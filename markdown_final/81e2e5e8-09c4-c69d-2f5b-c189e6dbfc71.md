## Question

SQUAMOUS EPITHELIAL CELLS in UA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about squamous epithelial cells in urinalysis, specifically their origin, how to interpret their presence, what thresholds matter, and how they should influence diagnostic decisions and stewardship. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cellular origins and why squamous cells appear in urine. Then, I should verify the traditional teaching that squamous cells equal contamination and weigh newer evidence that challenges that assumption. Next, I will examine how squamous cells affect the diagnostic performance of urinalysis markers and whether any thresholds meaningfully predict contamination or bacteriuria. After that, I should integrate guideline and stewardship perspectives to decide when to repeat collection or escalate to catheterization. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically actionable approach and highlight special scenarios like pregnancy, pediatrics, and cytology contexts.

> Let me first confirm the cellular origins and basic definitions. Squamous epithelial cells in urine are flat, scale-like cells that typically derive from the distal urethra and external genitalia; they are distinct from urothelial (transitional) cells lining the ureters, bladder, and proximal urethra, and from renal tubular epithelial cells, which are less commonly seen and indicate renal parenchymal injury when present in significant numbers [^cfd15b29] [^75aebaa2]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some epithelial cells in voided samples are urothelial rather than squamous, and modern studies using uroplakin III staining show that a substantial fraction of "epithelial cells" in urine are actually urothelial in origin, especially in infection states where urothelial shedding increases, so I need to keep that in mind as I interpret counts [^b3f9ddcf] [^da12c40d].

> Next, I should review the traditional teaching and its evidentiary basis. The conventional view is that squamous cells signal contamination from periurethral or vulvovaginal skin, and that higher squamous counts should prompt concern for poor collection quality; this is reflected in older laboratory practices and some device studies that equated squamous cells with contamination or mixed growth on culture [^75aebaa2] [^99eb1c02]. Wait, let me verify whether this assumption holds up under scrutiny; several contemporary studies using uroplakin III to distinguish urothelial from squamous cells argue that many epithelial cells in voided samples are urothelial and part of the disease substrate rather than contamination, which complicates the simplistic "squamous equals bad sample" heuristic [^b3f9ddcf] [^da12c40d].

> I will now examine how squamous cells influence urinalysis performance. Large datasets show that squamous epithelial cell count is a poor standalone predictor of culture contamination, with ROC AUCs around 0.53–0.68, and that the presence of squamous cells degrades the diagnostic accuracy of traditional urinalysis markers such as pyuria, bacteriuria, and leukocyte esterase for predicting positive cultures, lowering likelihood ratios and worsening test characteristics as squamous counts rise [^df706e5d] [^61add6a9]. Hold on, I should double-check the magnitude: in one study, the positive likelihood ratio for bacteriuria dropped from about 5.0 when squamous cells were absent to about 2.3 when more than 8 squamous cells per low-power field were present, indicating materially worse rule-in performance in contaminated-appearing samples [^df706e5d].

> Next, I should review thresholds and stewardship guidance. Many laboratories historically used a threshold of roughly 10–30 squamous cells per low-power field to flag contamination, but evidence does not support squamous counts as a reliable contamination marker; instead, stewardship frameworks emphasize that very high squamous counts should trigger a comment and consideration of repeat collection rather than automatic rejection, with some programs using > 10 squamous cells/lpf as a cutoff for adding structured interpretive comments and audit-feedback rather than cancelling the culture outright [^fd6226d5]. Let me reconsider whether any numeric cutoff is useful; even where thresholds are cited, they are not validated to predict contamination reliably, so I should avoid overinterpreting exact numbers and focus on clinical context and repeat quality [^df706e5d].

> I need to ensure I integrate guideline perspectives on specimen quality and next steps. The AUA/SUFU microhematuria guideline advises that if a significant number of squamous cells are present, contamination is possible and a repeat specimen or catheterization should be considered, particularly when results are discordant or will alter management; this aligns with a broader principle of prioritizing high-quality specimens when decisions hinge on urinalysis [^fd6226d5]. But wait, what if the patient is high risk or the clinical stakes are high? In that case, moving directly to a catheterized specimen may be reasonable to avoid repeated nondiagnostic voided samples, especially in women with obesity, atrophy, prolapse, or repeated contamination issues [^fd6226d5].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, studies comparing midstream to catheterized specimens show higher epithelial cell counts in midstream samples, yet immunostaining confirms most cells are urothelial and that midstream samples may better capture clue cells and pathogenic signals, arguing against reflexively labeling them as contaminated; this supports a more nuanced interpretation in obstetric patients [^9ebca6e2] [^f35d90fe]. In infants and young children, urinalysis sensitivity for bacteremic UTI is high, and contamination remains a concern; when results are discordant or squamous cells are abundant, repeating collection with improved technique or obtaining a catheterized specimen is prudent to avoid misclassification [^62f8320a]. For hematuria evaluations, applying a squamous cell threshold to define a "properly collected" specimen can improve the positive predictive value of microscopic hematuria, with one study suggesting that fewer than 2 squamous cells/hpf on a voided specimen increases the likelihood of true hematuria and may reduce unnecessary workups if used to trigger repeat testing or catheterization when exceeded [^8156e96c].

> I should confirm how this translates into diagnostic stewardship. Large health-system analyses demonstrate that white blood cells on microscopy have the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting uropathogens, whereas squamous cells add little to no predictive value; therefore, reflex algorithms should prioritize WBCs and other high-yield markers rather than squamous counts, and squamous cells should primarily prompt a comment about specimen quality and consideration of repeat collection rather than drive automatic culture cancellation [^f2980cdf] [^0296ffb8]. Hold on, I should verify whether combining parameters helps; in fact, adding bacteria to WBCs can reduce performance compared with WBCs alone, reinforcing the principle to keep the algorithm simple and WBC-centric for stewardship [^f2980cdf].

> Next, I should review practical actions when squamous cells are abundant. If squamous cells are prominent and the clinical picture is discordant, I should repeat the urinalysis with enhanced collection technique — clean-catch midstream after genital cleansing, spreading the labia in women, retracting the foreskin in uncircumcised men, and discarding the initial stream — and if results remain equivocal or management hinges on accuracy, obtain a catheterized specimen to secure a high-quality sample; this approach balances contamination risk with the need to avoid missing true disease [^fd6226d5]. I need to ensure documentation includes the squamous cell burden and the action taken, both to support diagnostic reasoning and to enable quality improvement feedback loops [^7444b205].

> But wait, what if the epithelial cells are not squamous at all? I should double-check for urothelial or renal tubular epithelial cells, which carry different implications: urothelial cells with adherent bacteria ("clue cells") suggest infection biology and may be enriched in midstream samples, while renal tubular epithelial cells point to intrinsic kidney injury and warrant careful sediment review and correlation with clinical context; misclassifying these as "squamous" can mislead management, so I need to verify cell morphology and, when available, consider uroplakin staining in research or complex cases to clarify origin [^b3f9ddcf] [^da12c40d]. Hold on, I should verify that interobserver reliability for squamous cells is high, which it is, supporting confident identification when properly trained, whereas renal tubular cells are frequently misidentified and require caution in interpretation [^fee511b6] [^621bfc79].

> In summary, I need to ensure my message is precise: squamous epithelial cells in urinalysis reflect external genital contamination to some degree, but their presence is an imprecise marker of contamination and degrades the performance of urinalysis for predicting bacteriuria; therefore, high squamous counts should trigger a comment, consideration of repeat collection with improved technique, and, when results are discordant or stakes are high, catheterization to obtain a definitive specimen, while remembering that many epithelial cells may be urothelial and part of the disease process rather than mere contamination [^df706e5d] [^61add6a9] [^7444b205] [^b3f9ddcf]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with contemporary stewardship and guideline recommendations, which emphasize specimen quality, WBC-focused reflex algorithms, and judicious use of catheterized samples to optimize diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary antibiotics or missed infections [^f2980cdf] [^fd6226d5].

Squamous epithelial cells in urinalysis are a marker of **contamination** from external genitalia or skin, not of urinary tract infection [^75aebaa2]. They are most often seen in improperly collected midstream samples, especially in women, and their presence should prompt **repeat collection** using a clean-catch or catheterized specimen to improve diagnostic accuracy [^fd6226d5]. High squamous counts reduce the reliability of urinalysis for predicting bacteriuria, so results from contaminated samples should be interpreted cautiously or repeated [^61add6a9] [^df706e5d]. Routine reporting of squamous cells helps identify contamination and guide corrective action, but they are not themselves a sign of disease [^7444b205].

---

## Origin and significance

Squamous epithelial cells are **flat, scale-like cells** lining the urethra, vagina, and skin; in urine, they indicate contamination from external sources rather than true urinary tract pathology [^cfd15d29]. Their presence reflects **poor collection technique** or contamination from the perineum, vagina, or foreskin, especially in women and uncircumcised men [^14fc5f8c] [^fd6226d5].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Contamination marker**: Squamous cells are a recognized marker of contamination, and their presence should prompt careful interpretation of urinalysis results [^7444b205].
- **Reduced diagnostic accuracy**: High squamous counts reduce the accuracy of urinalysis for predicting bacteriuria, lowering the positive likelihood ratio and increasing false positives [^61add6a9] [^df706e5d].
- **Need for repeat collection**: When squamous cells are abundant, repeat collection using clean-catch or catheterized techniques is recommended to obtain a more reliable sample [^fd6226d5].

---

## Quantitative thresholds

| **Threshold** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 2 squamous cells/hpf | Acceptable contamination | Interpret results normally |
| 3–10 squamous cells/hpf | Moderate contamination | Consider repeat collection if results are discordant |
| > 10 squamous cells/hpf | High contamination | Repeat collection strongly recommended |

---

## Factors influencing squamous cell presence

- **Collection technique**: Improper midstream collection increases contamination [^93674c1e].
- **Patient demographics**: Higher in women due to anatomical factors; also more common with obesity, atrophy, or prolapse [^14fc5f8c].
- **Clinical context**: More frequent in asymptomatic screening or non-urgent settings.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **AUA guidelines**: Recommend repeat collection or catheterization when significant squamous cells are present, especially if results are discordant with clinical suspicion [^fd6226d5].
- **Diagnostic stewardship**: Laboratories should report squamous cells and provide interpretive comments to guide repeat collection and reduce false positives [^7444b205].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Subjectivity**: Manual microscopy can introduce variability in squamous cell counts [^notfound].
- **Not pathological**: Squamous cells are not a sign of infection or disease; their role is to signal contamination [^75aebaa2].
- **Balance required**: Clinicians must balance the need for repeat collection against clinical urgency and patient factors.

---

Squamous epithelial cells in urinalysis indicate **contamination** from external sources and should prompt repeat collection when present in significant numbers. They reduce the reliability of urinalysis for UTI detection, so results from contaminated samples should be interpreted cautiously or repeated using improved technique [^61add6a9] [^df706e5d].

### Squamous epithelial cell presence reduces accuracy of urinalysis for prediction of positive urine cultures [^61add6a9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnostic value of urinalysis specimens contaminated with squamous epithelial cells (SEC) from the genital surfaces is assumed to be limited compared to clean-catch samples. However, no studies have quantified the change in predictive value in the presence of SECs for individual urinalysis markers.

Methods

In a retrospective, single center cohort study, we analyzed all urine cultures sent from the ED over a 26-month period with corresponding urinalysis results. Cultures were classified as positive with growth of > 10⁴ colony forming units of pathogenic bacteria, negative if no growth, or contaminated for all other results. UA specimens were classified as contaminated or clean based on SEC presence. Accuracy of urinalysis markers for prediction of positive cultures was calculated as an area under the curve (AUC) and was compared between contaminated and clean UA specimens.

Results

6490 paired UA and urine cultures were analyzed, consisting of 3949 clean and 2541 contaminated samples. SEC presence was less common with male gender, older age, and smaller BMI. Urine cultures were 19.2% positive overall, and SECs were more common in contaminated cultures. AUCs for individual markers ranged from 0.557 to 0.796, with pyuria, bacteriuria, and leukocyte esterase having higher AUC in clean samples over contaminated.

Conclusion

Analysis of AUC for individual urinalysis markers showed reduced diagnostic accuracy in the presence of SECs. SEC presence also reflected much higher rates of contaminated cultures. These results support the reduced reliance on contaminated UA specimens for ruling in UTI in ED patients.

### Comparison and interpretation of urinalysis performed by a nephrologist versus a hospital-based clinical laboratory [^5fec5116]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Urinalysis (UA) is considered the most important laboratory test in evaluating patients with kidney disease. Anecdotally, we have observed differences between results of UA performed by nephrologists compared with those performed by certified medical technologists or clinical laboratory scientists that could affect a clinician's diagnosis. Whether there are differences between UA performed by the clinical laboratory and that performed by a nephrologist was determined, and accuracy of diagnosis based on interpretation of the UA was compared.

Methods

Urine samples were obtained from 26 patients with acute renal failure (ARF). An aliquot of urine was sent to the clinical laboratory for UA. Nephrologist A, blinded to the patient's clinical information, performed a UA on the other aliquot of urine, generated a report, and assigned the most likely diagnosis for ARF based on UA findings. Nephrologist B, also blinded to the clinical information, reviewed nephrologist A's UA reports and assigned a diagnosis for ARF to each report. Nephrologists A and B both assigned a diagnosis (or diagnoses) for the ARF based on laboratory UA results. These 4 sets of diagnoses were compared with those assigned by the consult nephrologists.

Results

Nephrologist A correctly diagnosed the cause of ARF in 24 of 26 samples (92.3% success rate) based on his performance of the UA. Diagnoses by nephrologists A and B, based on their review of the clinical laboratory UA report, were correct in only 23.1% and 19.2% of the samples, respectively. Accuracy of diagnosis for nephrologist B improved to 69.3% when she reviewed UA reports from nephrologist A. Nephrologist A's review of urine sediment was significantly more accurate than interpretations by nephrologist A or B of clinical laboratory reports (sign test, P < 0.001). Nephrologist A reported a greater number of renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells (P < 0.0001), granular casts (P = 0.0017), hyaline casts (P = 0.0233), RTE casts (P = 0.0008), and dysmorphic red blood cells. The laboratory noted a greater number of squamous cells (P = 0.0034).

Conclusion

A nephrologist is more likely to recognize the presence of RTE cells, granular casts, RTE casts, and dysmorphic red blood cells in urine. The laboratory may be reporting RTE cells incorrectly as squamous epithelial cells. Nephrologist-performed UA is superior to laboratory-performed UA in determining the correct diagnosis.

### Urinary squamous epithelial cells Do not accurately predict urine culture contamination, but may predict urinalysis performance in predicting bacteriuria [^df706e5d]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The presence of squamous epithelial cells (SECs) has been advocated to identify urinary contamination despite a paucity of evidence supporting this practice. We sought to determine the value of using quantitative SECs as a predictor of urinalysis contamination.

Methods

Retrospective cross-sectional study of adults (≥ 18 years old) presenting to a tertiary academic medical center who had urinalysis with microscopy and urine culture performed. Patients with missing or implausible demographic data were excluded (2.5% of total sample). The primary analysis aimed to determine an SEC threshold that predicted urine culture contamination using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. The a priori secondary analysis explored how demographic variables (age, sex, body mass index) may modify the SEC test performance and whether SECs impacted traditional urinalysis indicators of bacteriuria.

Results

A total of 19,328 records were included. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that SEC count was a poor predictor of urine culture contamination (area under the ROC curve = 0.680, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.671 to 0.689). In secondary analysis, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of predicting bacteriuria via urinalysis among noncontaminated specimens was 4.98 (95% CI = 4.59 to 5.40) in the absence of SECs, but the LR+ fell to 2.35 (95% CI = 2.17 to 2.54) for samples with more than 8 SECs/low-powered field (lpf). In an independent validation cohort, urinalysis samples with fewer than 8 SECs/lpf predicted bacteriuria better (sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 84%) than samples with more than 8 SECs/lpf (sensitivity = 86%, specificity = 70%; diagnostic odds ratio = 17.5 [14.9 to 20.7] vs. 8.7 [7.3 to 10.5]).

Conclusions

Squamous epithelial cells are a poor predictor of urine culture contamination, but may predict poor predictive performance of traditional urinalysis measures.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^0296ffb8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Unlike some previous investigations that combined macroscopic and microscopic urinalysis results and did not stratify results by hospital setting, we examined potential healthcare setting differences. Surprisingly, our results show combining urinalysis parameters did not improve diagnostic accuracy, in contrast to results from Ourani et al. The variance may be explained by their definition of a positive urine culture, which included all positive cultures, and thus likely included non-uropathogens. Our results, for example, show WBCs combined with bacteria did not demonstrate better performance (AUC 0.711 95% CI 0.706–0.714]), compared to WBCs alone (AUC = 0.722 [95% CI 0.718–0.725], P = 0.001), suggesting that single, high-performing parameters like WBCs may be sufficient for reflex urine culture workflows, rather than more complex algorithms that do not provide additional value. Furthermore, we did not find a care setting (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient) with clinically meaningful differences in urinalysis parameter test performance. Therefore, our data suggests no care site-specific urine reflex algorithm is warranted.

Our study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of squamous epithelial cells in predicting uropathogens. Although many experts consider squamous epithelial cells as a marker for contaminated urine cultures, our study is among the few to examine their potential use in a urine reflex algorithm. Our results suggest that squamous epithelial cells are poor predictors of uropathogens (AUC = 0.53), consistent with Maher et al. who similarly found squamous epithelial cells unhelpful for reflex urine algorithms.

Our study has strengths. One is our large sample size urinalysis-urine culture pairs (n = 80,949). Although ours is not the largest study in this area, our sample size exceeds that of the University of Pittsburgh group (n = 19,511)and is second to only to Advani et al.'s 221,963 pairs. Unlike Advani et al. who grouped data from inpatient and outpatient settings, our study took a more granular approach by stratifying healthcare settings.

Automated urinalysis — Automated, image-based urinalysis systems are being used in many hospitals and laboratories to classify particles in uncentrifuged urine rapidly; results correlate well with manual methods (including red blood cells, WBCs, and squamous epithelial cells), and this may become the most common laboratory method in the future.

Urinalysis results

Urinalysis results are summarized in Table 2. For nitrite, 87% (n = 70,387) of results were negative. The leukocyte esterase results were negative in 36% (n = 29,008) of cases. Results from microscopic urinalysis showed that the most common WBC count was 0–3 WBCs/High Power Field (HPF) in 36% (n = 28,867) of cases. Bacteria were most commonly classified as either few/HPF 45% (n = 36,087) or none/HPF 34% (n = 27,483). For squamous epithelial cells, the most frequent result was > 30 squamous epithelial cells/Low Power Field (LPF) (36%, n = 29,368) (Table 2).

Among microscopic urinalysis parameters, WBCs had the highest AUC for predicting uropathogens (0.722 [95% CI 0.718–0.725]), followed by bacteria (0.673 [95% CI 0.670–0.677]) and squamous epithelial cells (0.530 [95% CI 0.526–0.534]). For macroscopic urinalysis parameters, the AUC value for uropathogen prediction was 0.700 [95% CI 0.690–0.701], for leukocyte esterase, and 0.627 [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), for nitrite (Figure 1).

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^f2980cdf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are commonly overdiagnosed. To minimize overdiagnosis, some laboratories utilize reflex algorithms that use urinalyses as preliminary screening before potentially proceeding to urine culture. However, the optimal urinalysis cutoffs for this diagnostic stewardship intervention remain poorly defined.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis from 2/1/21–1/31/23 in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services healthcare system. We examined patient encounters in which urinalysis was ordered synchronously with urine culture. We categorized urine culture isolates as uropathogens or non-uropathogens. We calculated receiver operating characteristic curves of urinalysis parameters' ability, singularly or in combination, to identify uropathogens.

Results

Among 80,949 paired urinalysis and urine cultures (17,488 inpatient, 20,716 emergency department, 42,745 outpatient), cultures yielded 35% (n = 28,993) uropathogens, 4% (n = 2960) non-uropathogens, 37% (n = 29,951) contaminants, and 24% (n = 19,045) no growth. Among urinalysis parameters, white blood cells (WBCs) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.722, [95% CI 0.718–0.725]), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.700, [95% CI 0.690–0.701]), bacteria (AUC = 0.673, [95% CI 0.670–0.677]), nitrite (AUC = 0.627, [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), and squamous epithelial cells (AUC = 0.530, [95% CI 0.526–0.534]). WBC AUC values were consistent across healthcare settings (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient). The urinalysis parameter combination with the highest AUC, WBC plus bacteria, performed worse than WBCs alone (AUC = 0.711 vs. AUC = 0.722, p = 0.001).

Conclusion

WBC on microscopic urinalysis demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting uropathogens in urine cultures. Stewardship programs should consider prioritizing urinalysis WBC count as the screening tool to optimize urine culture utilization.

### Defining properly collected urine: thresholds to improve the accuracy of urinalysis for microscopic hematuria evaluation in women [^8156e96c]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Microscopic hematuria is one of the most common office consults for urologists. While revised guidelines have risk-stratified patients to reduce unnecessary screening, they do not provide guidance concerning specimen quality. We sought to define "properly collected" specimens using catheterized urine samples as a reference to improve the utility of hematuria screening in women.

Materials and Methods

We prospectively acquired same-visit voided and catheterized urine samples from 46 women referred for microscopic hematuria from September 2016 to March 2020. Characteristics of pre-referral urinalysis were compared to the matched specimens. True microscopic hematuria was defined as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high power field on catheterization.

Results

Catheterized urinalyses had significantly fewer red blood and squamous epithelial cells in comparison to both referral urinalyses (p = 0.006, p = 0.001, respectively) and same-day void urinalyses (p = 0.02, p = 0.04, respectively). As no catheterized sample had > 2 squamous epithelial cells, we applied this squamous epithelial cell threshold to referral urinalyses for analysis. Addition of this criterion for "properly collected specimen" increased the positive predictive value of referral urinalyses from 46.1% to 68.8% for true microscopic hematuria. Fewer than 2 squamous epithelial cells with elevated RBC was a significant predictor for true microscopic hematuria (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Voided specimens in the urology clinic had significantly lower red blood cells than referral samples, indicating improved collection technique may reduce false positive urinalyses. Matched collection suggested that repeat collection by catheterization in women who present with > 2 squamous epithelial cells per high power field on referral urinalysis may prevent unnecessary future work-up.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^27b44c60]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Shed urothelial cells are an attractive option for study when seeking to examine contamination with different sampling methods. Uroplakin III (UP3), a transmembrane protein found exclusively in the urinary tract, is a useful biomarker for discerning the origin of epithelial cells in a urine sample. Thus, it is possible to discriminate contaminating cutaneous and vaginal squamous cells from urothelial umbrella cells using a specific antibody against this protein with immunofluorescence staining protocols.

This study consisted of two parts. The first was a comparative study of the urinalysis results obtained from samples collected by MSU and CSU. It was a random allocation, cross-over design and the urine sampling performances were compared using microscopic pyuria counts, epithelial cell counts, microbial growth from spun cell sediment culture and UP3-positive cell counts to measure contamination. The second part of the study was a random allocation, cross-over comparison study of contamination obtained with MSU, a novel MSU sampling device called a "Peezy" and naturally voided urine, in which we measured microscopic epithelial cell counts using UP3 staining.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: analysis of data from a healthcare system [^118279e3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of all synchronous urinalysis and urine culture tests performed within 24 hours of each other and ordered between 2/1/2021 and 1/31/2023 at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. This municipal safety net healthcare system consists of 26 ambulatory care centers and 4 acute care hospitals, primarily serving vulnerable populations. We examined all categories of patient encounters including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department visits. We excluded encounters if the patients, based on demographics or associated ICD-10 codes, were under 3 months of age, had neutropenia, were pregnant, or were undergoing a urologic procedure, as screening or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these populations may be warranted.

Data collection

Patient data were retrieved from electronic medical records. We examined all episodes in which there were synchronous testing of urinalysis and urine culture. Synchronous was defined as tests ordered within the same calendar day, as previously described. Urinalysis and urine cultures were ordered by providers based on clinical judgment, and there was no system-wide protocol that automatically triggered urine culture performance based on urinalysis results. The specific clinical indication for testing, such as suspected UTIs, was unavailable in structured fields of the electronic medical record. At our institution, microscopic urinalysis is triggered based on predefined thresholds from the macroscopic urinalysis (eg, positive leukocyte esterase or nitrites), serving as an internal reflex mechanism. For this study, we limited our analysis to only those urinalysis and urine culture pairs in which microscopic analysis was performed. For each encounter, we collected demographic and healthcare encounter data, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and healthcare setting (ie, outpatient, emergency department, or inpatient). From urinalysis macroscopic, we analyzed leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests performed using either Arkray AUTION MAX AX-4030 (Minneapolis, MN) or CLINITEK ATLAS® (Malvern, PA). For the microscopic examination, we analyzed white blood cells (WBCs), bacteria, and squamous epithelial cells using the Iris iQ200 Elite/Sprint (Santa Clara, CA) or Sysmex UF-1000i (Bohemia, NY). For urine cultures, results are classified into one of the following categories as defined by the clinical microbiology laboratory's standard operating procedures: positive for growth, no growth, normal flora, or contaminated based on the growth of multiple (≥ 3) organisms.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

Rationale for the preferable use of first-void urine for HPV testing in women.

When different types of urine specimens were assessed from a cohort of HPV-positive women, substantial differences were observed in the reported copy number of HPV and human DNA when comparing first-void (or initial-stream) urine versus the subsequent fractions. It is now generally agreed that first-void urine contains considerably more epithelial cells and consequently higher concentrations of both HPV and human DNA than subsequent void fractions. This observation is in fact consistent with an opinion forged in the early 1940s, where Traut and Papanicolaou suggested that for the detection of cancer of the uterus a self-collected vaginal smear would be appropriate and could be used for routine diagnostic purposes. Their basic rationale for this suggestion was that all epithelial tissues have superficial cell layers that are subject to continuous exfoliation. This debris of epithelial tissues and exfoliated cells subsequently mix with the secretions of the uterus and cervix and descend into the vagina, explaining why they can be detected in a vaginal sample. Subsequent to this information came the realization that female genital secretions, including the debris of superficial cell layers, further descend and exit the vagina, where they are accumulated between the labia minora and around the urethra opening (Fig. 1). This natural biological cleaning process of the female genital tract is completed when a woman urinates and flushes away (mostly with first-void urine) said accumulated secretions. Thus, in the context of HPV testing, we should not categorize first-void urine as a urine specimen but rather consider it a mixture of genital tract secretions collected through urination. In Fig. 1, this important rationale is shown graphically, and four selected examples of macroscopically visible differences between first-void urine versus subsequent urine fraction(s) are presented.

### Assessment of interobserver reliability of nephrologist examination of urine sediment [^fee511b6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

For particles in the urine sediment other than casts, overall percent agreement was 69% (95% CI, 61%-77%) and the overall κ was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.56–0.73). Interobserver reliability was highest for squamous epithelial cells (κ = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.94), isomorphic red blood cells (RBCs) (κ = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81–0.88), and dysmorphic RBCs (κ = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.80–0.86). The lowest κ statistics were seen for kidney tubular epithelial cells (κ = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.26–0.33) and transitional epithelial cells (κ = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.45–0.52).

The disease processes believed most likely to be present in each case based on the reviewers' evaluation of the urine sediment findings in comparison with the diagnoses made after kidney biopsy are presented in Table 2 and depicted in Figure 3. Agreement varied considerably between cases but was highest when glomerular pathology was present. In 3 cases, all 14 reviewers suspected the same underlying disease process with perfect agreement, which was, in turn, consistent with the findings on biopsy. Results of urinalyses as reported by the central laboratory, which were available from urine samples collected within 2 days before biopsy in 9 of 10 cases, are given in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Notably, in none of these cases were any findings other than isomorphic RBCs, WBCs, squamous cells, bacteria, and hyaline casts reported by the laboratory.

HPV TESTING IN URINE

HPV self-sampling.

To improve equitable access to screening, women in many cervical cancer screening programs or projects are now given the option of providing a self-collected sample. Self-taken samples for HPV testing have a similar accuracy to that of clinician-collected samples for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions when a validated PCR-based assay is used. In most self-sampling scenarios, women collect the self-sample by inserting a swab, brush, or more complicated collection device into the vagina to collect cervicovaginal secretions (containing exfoliated epithelial cells and debris of disintegrated cells) by turning or rubbing or through washing or lavage. However, urine as the least invasive self-collected sample has strong potential for use in self-sampling exercises for screening and epidemiological applications.

Background.

Our understanding regarding the use of urine as a valid specimen for testing for HPV has evolved substantially in the last decade (Table 1). In the early days of investigation, major technical and interpretational challenges were identified and suboptimal analytical and clinical sensitivity were observed particularly when urine was compared with clinician-collected cervical samples. The mechanism through which HPV DNA "contaminated" urine was poorly understood and was a major limitation for advancing the field. An initial review on the performance of urine as a biospecimen for HPV testing demonstrated that the conflicting results obtained in early studies were largely a consequence of a lack of standardization and an imprecise broad definition of the term urine. In certain pioneering papers, investigators did not differentiate between the different "types" of urine, for example, initial-stream (first-void), midstream, total-void, any-void, first urine of the day, or urine collected later in the day. In addition, many investigators did not realize the considerable difference between female and male urine specimens and (wrongly) expected equivalent performance in both sexes.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^fd6226d5]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria (MH) — proper sample collection: For most initial evaluations, a random midstream clean-catch collection is sufficient, and patients should be instructed to discard the initial 10 mL of voided urine into the toilet in order to collect the midstream void; if a significant number of squamous cells are present, contamination is possible and a repeat specimen collection or catheterization should be considered, and providing basic instructions to patients on proper sample collection may help to minimize contaminated or faulty samples. For male patients, midstream voided specimens are adequate unless the patient is unable to void, and the specimen can be collected into the sterile specimen cup after gently cleaning the urethral meatus with a sterilization towelette; in uncircumcised men, it is important to retract the foreskin to avoid contamination. For female patients, a voided midstream specimen should be the primary method unless there are circumstances such as known problems with repeated specimen contamination or a history of difficulty voiding, and the patient should be instructed to spread the labia adequately to allow for cleansing of the urethral meatus with a sterilization towelette and to avoid introital contamination. In some patients, catheterization may be necessary in order to obtain an appropriate specimen; this subgroup includes obese female patients and patients with a non-intact urinary tract, an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or who use intermittent catheterization, and women with concurrent menstruation should be reevaluated after its cessation or should undergo catheterization to determine if the blood is in fact present in the urine or is only noted as a result of vaginal contamination.

### The effect of written posted instructions on collection of clean-catch urine specimens in the emergency department [^1ed649d8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Urinalysis testing is frequently ordered in the emergency department (ED), but contamination of urine specimens limits the interpretation of results. The mid-stream, clean-catch (MSCC) procedure for urine specimen collection is recommended to decrease contamination rates, but without instructions this procedure has poor compliance.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of written instructions alone, we analyzed the rate of specimen contamination, defined by presence of squamous epithelial cells (SECs) and culture results, in the ED after posting information on the MSCC procedure.

Methods

Instructions in simple English for the MSCC procedure were posted in all patient-accessible restrooms in the ED. Frequency of contamination, defined microscopically as > 5 SECs per high-powered field or through growth of mixed or non-pathologic flora on urine culture, was determined over a 3-month period for comparison to historical controls from the previous year.

Results

During the intervention period, 754 urinalyses were sent, with 392 contaminated specimens (51.98%), and 193 urine cultures were sent, with 77 contaminated results (39.8%). Historical controls from the previous year yielded 827 urinalyses sent, with 430 contaminated (51.99%), and 251 urine cultures, with 125 contaminated results (49.8%). The difference between groups was not significant for urinalysis (p = 0.99) or urine culture (p = 0.13).

Conclusions

A poster-based educational intervention with instructions on MSCC procedure failed to decrease contamination rates in this ED-based study. Possible explanations include poor compliance with MSCC technique in the ED, or poor efficacy of this technique at decreasing contamination rates. These results may indicate that other efforts are necessary to improve urine collection methods.

### Reassessment of routine midstream culture in diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^2c6a1b43]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our second key finding was that MSU culture grossly underestimated the amount of polymicrobial growth in patient urine. For example, 36.4% of new patient urine samples grew mixed growths; this number rose to 63.6% when more uncentrifuged urine was plated and to 84.8% in the case of centrifuged sediment cultures. Although it is now recognized that even healthy urine contains bacteria, which certainly complicates the diagnostic landscape, our enhanced culture and genomic analyses showed a clear difference between the taxa isolated from patients and those isolated from controls. Specifically, Enterobacteriaceae was the dominant family in new patients, whereas Streptococcus was foremost in the asymptomatic controls. These findings, taken together with other reports, suggest that automatically discounting polymicrobial cultures may dismiss symptomatic patients in need of treatment.

There is, of course, a formal possibility that the mixed growths reported here could simply be the result of contamination by skin bacteria during sample collection. In the United Kingdom, this possibility is addressed by the UK Standards for Microbiology Investigations, which recommends the counting of squamous epithelial cells in the urine as a marker for contamination. However, their utility for this purpose is complicated by the fact that exfoliation of urothelial cells as an innate immune response to UTI is a recognized phenomenon which is widely used as a surrogate marker of infection in both mice and humans. Indeed, using antibodies against uroplakin III, a highly specific marker for cells originating from the urinary tract, we previously demonstrated that the majority of epithelial cells shed in the urine of symptomatic patients originate from the bladder. Finally, were the presence of mixed growths merely the result of contamination, we would not expect their presence to cluster statistically with symptoms, as they did in this study.

### Urate nephropathy following chronic ileostomy acidosis [^e8533e26]. American Journal of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Normal renal function and normal urinalysis results in an 81-year-old man deteriorated over a 6-month period following an ileostomy, associated with metabolic acidosis, persistent aciduria, proteinuria, and a urinary sediment that showed numerous red blood cells, granular casts, and 'reactive' epithelial cells with intracellular uric acid (UA) crystals. These also formed extensive UA casts. Oral sodium bicarbonate therapy completely reversed all of the abnormalities. Renal biopsy, while it failed to demonstrate significant tubular obstruction, showed evidence of extensive epithelial cell injury. It is suggested that intestinal losses of bicarbonate resulted in persistent excretion of an acidic urine which promoted UA crystal formation within renal tubules and in epithelial cells which then caused cellular injury and the release of cytokines, leading to an altered regulation of the renal blood flow. The importance of microscopic techniques in the diagnosis is stressed along with the significance for managing both acute and chronic renal failure.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^b3f9ddcf]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to measure contamination and substrate content for four different methods of obtaining urine samples. It also used the fact that urothelial cells can be distinguished from squamous epithelial cells by UP3 staining. This enabled measurement of contamination by the extra-urinary milieu compromising these various methods. The proportion of UP3-positive cells found in MSU samples was previously reported as 75% (Q1 = 68, Q3 = 78.5) by Horsley et al. This study had a similar outcome, and has extended this to three other sample collection methods. Taken together with a wide body of literature demonstrating that urothelial cell shedding is a common innate immune response to infection, this study suggests that the widely held assumption that epithelial cells in a urine sample indicate contamination might need to be revised. The sample collection method did influence the absolute epithelial cell counts, the lowest number with CSU samples (Fig. 1 a) and the greatest number with natural void (Fig. 1 c), during which the bladder contracts and collapses to eliminate bladder urinary substrate. The Peezy device seemed to do what it claimed, achieving a sample of fewer cells and very few uroplakin-negative cells. However, the sediment trapped in the sponge valve of the Peezy device may, counter-intuitively, prove to be a richer substrate for microbiological investigation, as bacteria are known to adhere to and colonise the urothelial cells.

The rationale of midstream sampling has always been the avoidance of contamination. This was never properly tested and relied on assumptions. In this experiment we were able to analyse contamination directly by using UP3 staining of the epithelial cells as a proxy, and we found that contrary to what has been assumed, the majority of epithelial cells in all samples originated from the urinary tract.

The standard NHS MSU culture achieved a very small number of positive cultures, in contrast to the spun sediment cultures, despite the patients exhibiting significantly fewer urinary tract symptoms; this discrepancy has been reported previously by our team and others. Urinary microscopic detection of pyuria and increased urothelial cell shedding provided strong evidence for the presence of UTI. The sediment culture generated a greater abundance of isolates. However, given that healthy urine is known to harbour many species of bacteria, including known uropathogens, it is not known whether these microbes are pathogenic or harmless commensals, a problem affecting all current urinary microbial detection methods.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^da12c40d]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

There are three commonly used urine collection methods: the midstream clean catch technique (MSU), the catheter specimen of urine (CSU), and suprapubic aspiration. Sample contamination is a key concern, particularly with regard to MSU. Our understanding is hampered by the variable definitions of "contamination" described in the literature. Some have claimed that contamination is indicated by isolation of microbes typical of skin flora, such as Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus. According to Collier et al. contaminated urine samples are revealed by finding squamous epithelial cells on urine microscopy. Wilson and Gaido defined contamination as ≥ 2 different types of organisms at > 10⁵ mL⁻¹ or 1 organism at < 10⁴ mL⁻¹. Others have reported urine samples as contaminated, without describing the criteria used. These disparities add to the confusion that affects these diagnostic methods and there are no data available to aid clarification. An important consideration is the substrate that these collection methods should seek to obtain for culture. Historically, the emphasis has been on uncontaminated urine samples being cell-free. However, contemporary studies have shown that UTI is associated with microbial parasitisation of urothelial cells, via surface attachment and/or intracellular invasion. This parasitisation stimulates urothelial cell shedding as part of an innate immune response. It has been found that the urinary urothelial cell counts are elevated in association with other markers of infection and that the proportion of parasitised cells among the cell sediment increases during UTIs, along with inflammatory markers and changes in the urinary microbiome. If the primary pathology is the microbial invasion of urothelial cells, stimulating the concomitant innate immune response of increased urothelial cell shedding, it is plausible that these cells would make a better substrate for urine culture than would supernatants of planktonic bacteria. This was demonstrated in our previous work.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^3d72c46a]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Culture thresholds

We aimed to evaluate Sysmex parameters to predict urine culture positivity (Fig. S2). Both a high UBC and a high U-WBC were associated with a positive urine culture (p < 0.001). We did not observe statistical difference between positive urine culture and culture with more than three bacteria (considered as contamination) for epithelial cells (p > 0.99), squamous cells (p > 0.99), non-secretory cells (p > 0.99) and transitional cells (p > 0.99). The ROC curve AUC was above 0.8 for UBC (AUC = 0.923 [0.895–0.950]) and for U-WBC (AUC = 0.853 [0.819–0.888]) (Fig. 2 B). The AUC for UBC was significantly higher than the AUC for U-WBC (p < 0.001). The optimal threshold defined by the Youden index was 1176 bacteria/µL, giving a sensitivity of 79.17% [72.41–84.62], specificity of 95.83% [92.86–97.6], LR- of 0.22 [0.21–0.23] and LR + of 19.0 [16.07–22.46]. No UBC threshold was able to achieve an LR- < 0.1.

### Urine flow cytometry in older adults urinary tract infection diagnosis: is it time to reevaluate thresholds for men and women? [^8b3f1ff1]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

There is actually no recommended threshold for UBC interpretation using Sysmex automate. However, in our study we found that UBC are more suitable than urine dipstick in excluding the diagnosis of UTI in both men and women with a threshold of 150 bacteria/µL. In women, this threshold can be up to 300 bacteria/µL to gain specificity. The combination of UBC and U-WBC gave a gain in sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of UTI. Thus, at a threshold of 1176 bacteria/µL, we were able to predict urine culture positivity with an LR + of 19. This threshold is concordant with a previous study which obtained an AUC between 0.897 and 0.952 (0.923 in our study) according the number of CFU/mL in urine culture. Analysis of epithelial cell counts measured by the Sysmex UF-4000 was not effective in discriminating between patients with and without UTI or in predicting urine culture positivity or contamination. This finding contrasts with the proposed threshold of 30 squamous cells/µL used to classify urine cultures as contaminated.

Urine dipsticks are used as a first-line test to exclude UTI in women or to confirm UTI in men. The use of urine dipsticks for diagnosing cystitis is rated as a weak strength, and their use leads to only a modest increase in diagnostic accuracy when applied to patients with typical symptoms, according to the European Association of Urology (EAU). The European federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory no longer recommends urine dipsticks for diagnosing UTIs in young women. The infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) guidelines were published in 2011 and an updated version is currently in development. Our results suggest that urine dipstick is a good test to exclude UTI in older men (LR- of 0.057) but not in women (LR- of 0.129). Urine dipstick alone was not able to confirm UTI in either men (LR + of 4.64) or women (LR + of 1.15). Similar to Advani et al. urine dipstick performed better in older men than in older women. Our results suggest that urine dipstick is a good test to exclude UTI in older men, but less good in older women to exclude or diagnose UTI.

Biological parameters and threshold determination

In univariate analysis, parameters including urinary bacterial count (UBC), urinary white blood cell count (U-WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell, transitional cells, squamous cells, and atypical cells were significantly higher in patients with UTI (p < 0.05) (Table 1). The ROC curves demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability for both UBC (AUC = 0.874 [0.841–0.906]) and U-WBC (AUC = 0.925 [0.896–0.954]) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, CRP (AUC = 0.673 [0.608–0.738]), blood white blood cells (AUC = 0.613 [0.540–0.686]), squamous cells (AUC = 0.641 [0.578–0.713]), transitional cells (AUC = 0.688 [0.621–0.755]), and atypical cells (AUC = 0.641 [0.578–0.703]) did not demonstrate sufficient predictive value for further analysis (AUC < 0.8).

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^50a1b06d]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The natural void provided the greatest number of urothelial cells and even in this situation, UP3 analysis did not show evidence of increased contamination, which contradicts long-held assumptions about urine sampling. The natural void captures the first part of the urinary stream; the influence of gravity would encourage such samples to contain a larger proportion of the sediment because of settlement at the bladder base (Fig. 1 b). By avoiding the initial stream, the MSU and Peezy MSU™ methods collected samples containing fewer cells, the Peezy MSU™ providing the clearest specimens (Fig. 1 d). The remaining urine in the bladder proceeds with a terminal flow, with very few bladder sediments (Fig. 1 e).

The Peezy MSU™ device works with a sponge in the funnel exit, which inflates gradually on contact with the first part of the urinary stream, eventually blocking the outflow so that the remainder of the stream escapes by a side channel into a collecting tube. Thus, the bulk of the sediment deposit from the bladder neck would be expected to be trapped in the sponge. If the bladder base sediment is indeed, as recent work suggests, the best specific target for diagnostic analysis, so is the content of the sponge. As matters stand, the Peezy MSU™ achieves what it sets out to do and provides an MSU sample free of early stream content, but in achieving that goal, it is less effective at capturing the sediment at the base of the bladder.

In conclusion, this study, supported by previous findings, suggests that epithelial cells might be a legitimate component of the urinary sample and are not derived from the peri-urethral area. Naturally voided urine provides the richest source of urinary sediment and may be the better sampling method for urinalysis in the face of LUTS. By comparison, the MSU, and particularly the CSU, provide inferior samples, because the pathological cellular exudate is excluded.

### UroVysion, urine cytology, and the college of American pathologists: where should we go from here? [^0b13cb44]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Abstract UroVysion (Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, Illinois) is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved test for the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. Although widely used, there are a variety of different ways to evaluate and interpret the test, and questions remain about the test's cost effectiveness and reproducibility in actual clinical practice. I suggest that the College of American Pathologists has a unique opportunity to create educational programs focusing on borderline or difficult urine cytology and UroVysion samples to provide data upon which to make evidence-based decisions concerning the best use of these tests.

### Observation of intracellular bacterial communities in urinary sediment using brightfield microscopy; a case report [^f8a88329]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are usually related to the presence of Escherichia coli, a microorganism that adopts an intracellular life-style during the pathogenesis of cystitis. Evidence of the underlying mechanism in urothelial cells from urine samples has been reported. However, intracellular communities have not yet been described in squamous cells in fresh samples stained with Sternheimer-Malbin method, thus, we have provided these descriptions in this case report.

Case Presentation

Number 1 was a male patient with symptoms of UTI, his urinalysis revealed hematuria and nitrites. In the urine sediment, we found urothelial cells with internal endosomes filled with short rods. Case number 2, female patient with recurrent UTI by E. coli, her urinalysis showed positive nitrites, glycosuria, bacteriuria and squamous cells with endosomes filled with short rods. Both patients were positive for E. coli isolation.

Conclusions

These case reports provide evidence of the presence of intracellular bacterial communities in urothelial and squamous cells (not previously reported) in fresh urine samples stained with Sternheimer-Malbin using brightfield microscopy. The clinical impact and pathogenic mechanisms involved in the invasion of the squamous epithelium need further investigation.

### Analysis of human urinary extracellular vesicles reveals disordered renal metabolism in myotonic dystrophy type 1 [^cfd15b29]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Urine contains a mixture of epithelial cells, red blood cells, and white blood cells that may be contributing to the urinary EV pool. Epithelial cell types found in the urine include (1) renal tubular, (2) transitional that arise from the renal pelvis, ureters, or bladder, and (3) squamous that arise from the urethra during the process of micturition. To explore this possibility that a mixed population of urinary cells may be useful as gene expression biomarkers of DM1, we performed ddPCR to quantify gene expression. Genes that are downregulated in DM1 urinary EVs also tended to be expressed at lower levels in mixed urine cells of DM1 as compared to UA, although to a lesser degree and the differences statistically non-significant (Supplementary Fig. 11). Of the transcripts upregulated in DM1 exRNA, KRT20 also was significantly increased in mixed urine cells of DM1 vs. UA controls, while HPGD appeared similar in both groups. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a prior study that found alternative splice events in urine exRNA were more reliable indicators of DM1 molecular pathogenesis than those found in a mixed population of urine cells.

Ultracentrifugation isolates a pellet consisting of EVs and non-EV-associated high molecular weight protein and protein complexes, some of which bind RNA. To determine whether the mRNAs that we are measuring are localized to EV cargo, we used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to separate EVs from non-EV-associated proteins and RNAs. Using ddPCR, we found that the purified EV fraction is enriched for mRNAs as compared to the mixed EV/non-EV protein pellet isolated by ultracentrifugation (UCF) from the same samples (Supplementary Fig. 12).

### Assessment of interobserver reliability of nephrologist examination of urine sediment [^8f23185b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Urine sediment microscopy is commonly performed during the evaluation of kidney disease. Interobserver reliability of nephrologists' urine sediment examination has not been well studied.

Objective

Assess interobserver reliability of the urine sediment examination.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this diagnostic test study, urine samples were prospectively collected from a convenience sample of adult patients from an academic hospital in the United States undergoing kidney biopsy from July 11, 2018, to March 20, 2019. Digital images and videos of urine sediment findings were captured using a bright-field microscope. These images and videos along with urine dipstick results were incorporated in online surveys and sent to expert nephrologists at 15 US teaching hospitals. They were asked to identify individual sediment findings and the most likely underlying disease process.

Exposures

Urine dipstick results and urine sediment images from patients undergoing native kidney biopsy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Interobserver reliability of urine sediment microscopy findings estimated by overall percent agreement and Fleiss κ coefficients. Secondary outcomes included concordance of diagnoses suspected by nephrologists with corresponding kidney biopsy results.

Results

In total, 10 surveys from 10 patients containing 76 study questions on individual features were sent to 21 nephrologists, 14 (67%) of whom completed them all. Their combined 1064 responses were analyzed. Overall percent agreement for casts was an estimated 59% (95% CI, 50%-69%), κ = 0.52 (95% CI, 0.42–0.62). For other sediment findings, overall percent agreement was an estimated 69% (95% CI, 61%-77%), κ = 0.65 (95% CI, 0.56–0.73). The κ estimates ranged from 0.13 (95% CI, 0.10–0.17) for mixed cellular casts to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.94) for squamous epithelial cells.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, substantial variability occurred in the interpretation of urine sediment findings, even among expert nephrologists. Educational or technological innovations may help improve the urine sediment as a diagnostic tool.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^f35d90fe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The urinary tract undergoes various physiological adaptations in pregnancy. The effect of increased progesterone leads to ureteral dilatation, reduced ureteral tone and an increased potential for glycosuria which encourages microbial growth. These changes predispose pregnant women to infections and 1–4% of women develop an acute bladder infection for the first time during pregnancy. If untreated, bacteria may ascend the renal tract causing pyelonephritis, a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.

Current dogma defines a urinary tract infection (UTI) as the presence and multiplication of microorganisms in one or more structures of the urinary tract with associated tissue invasion. This may present with symptoms, such as dysuria, frequency, urgency and suprapubic pain, or be asymptomatic. The routine urine culture techniques are designed to favour the growth of common uropathogens. Threshold bacterial counts of ≥ 10⁵ total colony forming units per millilitre (cfu/ml) urine are used to discriminate between true infection and contamination of the urine sample by vulvo-vaginal organisms. At present, this method of diagnosing UTIs is standard practice in UK laboratories, despite evidence of insensitivity. The majority of urine cultures do not surpass diagnostic thresholds in routine practice.

Contamination occurs when bacteria, from the skin surfaces, get into the urine culture. By proxy, a urine sample is presumed to be contaminated if epithelial cells are detected. Historically, urethral catheterisation has been the gold standard for urine collection as it bypassed the skin surface and was thought to avoid skin contamination. However, it has been found that voided urine samples may be equally valid to CSU samples, if not superior due to its convenience. This non-invasive technique has since become the clean-catch, mid-stream urine (MSU) method which draws on the assumption that skin contamination is avoided by discarding the initial stream. The MSU is now the most frequently used sampling method in today's clinical setting.

Recent evidence suggests that bacteriuria is more complex than previously thought. Healthy urine is no longer considered sterile; manifesting a microbiome that may include urinary pathogens. Colonisation of the urothelium, by microbial biofilms adherent to cell surfaces or intracellular invasion, is now recognised to be important in the pathology of UTI. The innate immune response to these events is to increase urothelial shedding so as to excrete parasitsed cells in the urine. These "clue cells" are epithelial cells with closely associated bacteria and may be evidence of bladder infection, not skin contamination.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^c7612d92]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — interventions, comparators, and outcomes note that interventions include urinary cytology and urine-based tumor markers (UBTMs), patient engagement tools and decision aids, and follow-up schedules in patients with initial negative hematuria evaluation. Comparators are defined as any of the included interventions of interest when used as the control and compared to another intervention, and it was anticipated that most identified studies would be single arm. Critical outcomes include hematuria detection concordance (urinalysis [UA] versus dipstick), diagnostic yield incorporating prevalence of malignant and/or benign diagnoses, diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and false positive rate), risk stratification for urologic malignancy with system performance characteristics (predictive ability, prognostic ability, number needed to screen), and rate of adverse events and number needed to harm; important outcomes include disease specific survival rates, diagnostic grade/stage of malignancy, prevalence of risk factors in hematuria patients, patient satisfaction, and quality of life.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^839726ca]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to urine cytology, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining urine cytology in high-risk patients with equivocal findings on cystoscopic evaluation or with persistent microscopic hematuria and irritative voiding symptoms or risk factors for carcinoma in situ after a negative workup.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^c00f9876]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria (MH) — definition and diagnostic threshold: Clinicians should define microhematuria as ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field on microscopic evaluation of a single, properly collected urine specimen (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The Panel encourages the use of ≥ 3 RBC/HPF as a minimum reporting threshold and maintained that only a single urinalysis (UA) with ≥ 3 RBC/HPF is necessary to establish the presence of MH. Supporting data include that the initial UA detected MH in 95% of patients with the second and third UA detecting the remaining 5%, and a study of over 46,000 patients noted the highest sensitivity for detecting bladder cancer (0.73) and lowest negative likelihood ratio (0.40) at the threshold of ≥ 3 to 10 RBC/HPF.

### Abnormal urinalysis results are common, regardless of specimen collection technique, in women without urinary tract infections [^93674c1e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Voided urinalysis to test for urinary tract infection (UTI) is prone to false-positive results for a number of reasons. Specimens are often collected at triage from women with any abdominal complaint, creating a low UTI prevalence population. Improper collection technique by the patient may affect the result. At least four indices, if positive, can indicate UTI.

Objective

We examine the impact of voided specimen collection technique on urinalysis indicators of UTI and on urine culture contamination in disease-free women.

Methods

In this crossover design, 40 menstrual-age female emergency department staff without UTI symptoms collected urine two ways: directly in a cup ("non-clean") and midstream clean catch ("ideal"). Samples underwent standard automated urinalysis and culture. Urinalysis indices and culture contamination were compared.

Results

The proportion of abnormal results from samples collected by "non-clean" vs. "ideal" technique, respectively, were: leukocyte esterase (> trace) 50%, 35% (95% confidence interval for difference -6% to 36%); nitrites (any) 2.5%, 2.5% (difference -2.5 to 2.5%); white blood cells (> 5/high-powered field [HPF]) 50%, 27.5% (difference 4 to 41%); bacteria (any/HPF) 77.5%, 62.5%, (difference -7 to 37%); epithelial cells (> few) 65%, 30% (difference 13 to 56%); culture contamination (> 1000 colony-forming units of commensal or > 2 species) 77%, 63% (difference -5 to 35%). No urinalysis index was positively correlated with culture contamination.

Conclusion

Contemporary automated urinalysis indices were often abnormal in a disease-free population of women, even using ideal collection technique. In clinical practice, such false-positive results could lead to false-positive UTI diagnosis. Only urine nitrite showed a high specificity. Culture contamination was common regardless of collection technique and was not predicted by urinalysis results.

### Epithelial tissue-SEER training modules… [^c30d2d4d]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Epithelial Tissue Epithelial tissues are widespread throughout the body. They form the covering of all body surfaces, line body cavities and hollow organs, and are the major tissue in glands. They perform a variety of functions that include protection, secretion, absorption, excretion, filtration, diffusion, and sensory reception. The cells in epithelial tissue are tightly packed together with very little intercellular matrix. Because the tissues form coverings and linings, the cells have one free surface that is not in contact with other cells. Opposite the free surface, the cells are attached to underlying connective tissue by a non-cellular basement membrane. This membrane is a mixture of carbohydrates and proteins secreted by the epithelial and connective tissue cells. Epithelial cells may be squamous, cuboidal, or columnar in shape and may be arranged in single or multiple layers. Simple cuboidal epithelium is found in glandular tissue and in the kidney tubules.

Simple columnar epithelium lines the stomach and intestines. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium lines portions of the respiratory tract and some of the tubes of the male reproductive tract. Transitional epithelium can be distended or stretched. Glandular epithelium is specialized to produce and secrete substances.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 155: urinary incontinence in women [^e769d3f6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinalysis — urinary incontinence in women: Urinary tract infections should be identified using urinalysis and treated before initiating further investigation or therapeutic intervention for urinary incontinence, and a clean midstream or catheterized urine sample should be obtained for dipstick urinalysis. If suspicious for infection (ie, nitrites, leukocytes, or both are present), a urine culture should be sent and appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy initiated for treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. If microscopic hematuria is present, further upper and lower urinary tract evaluation with cystoscopy and computed tomography is recommended. The American Urological Association defines microscopic hematuria as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on "microscopic examination of urinary sediment and not on a dipstick reading" and "in the absence of an obvious benign cause".

### Interobserver reliability of urine sediment interpretation [^621bfc79]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Urine sediment interpretation is frequently used in the evaluation of patients with kidney disease. There has been no systematic evaluation of the reliability of this diagnostic maneuver.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Digital photographs of urine sediment images were acquired from 165 consecutive patients being evaluated by the nephrology consultation service at a tertiary care hospital. Urine sediment images of 100 patients were randomly selected; 86 patients had images that were deemed to be of sufficient quality, and one image per patient was chosen for inclusion in an internet-based questionnaire. For each image, the presence or absence of 14 potential urinary structures was ascertained. Ten nephrologists (senior readers [n = 3]: > 10 yr of experience; intermediate readers [n = 3]: 1 to 10 yr of experience; and junior readers [n = 4]: first year of practice) completed the questionnaire. For each urinary structure, we measured the rate of complete agreement among the readers as well as the kappa statistic as a marker of agreement beyond chance.

Results

Unanimous agreement was highest (79.1%) regarding the presence of broad and fatty casts and poorest (31.4%) for the identification of dysmorphic red blood cells and white blood cells. Interobserver agreement was best for squamous epithelial cells (kappa = 0.54) and hyaline casts (kappa = 0.52) and worst for transitional epithelial cells (kappa = 0.14) and fatty casts (kappa = 0.06). When assessed within strata of physician experience, interobserver agreement was not associated with seniority.

Conclusions

Nephrologists achieved slight to moderate agreement in the identification of structures that are commonly observed in the urine sediment.

### Bacteria on urine microscopy is not associated with systemic infection in patients with obstructing urolithiasis [^8fe7aaf6]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Determining whether bacterial presence in urine microscopy represents infection is important as ureteral stent placement is indicated in patients with obstructing urolithiasis and infection. We aim to investigate whether the presence of bacteria on urine microscopy is associated with other markers of infection in patients with obstructing urolithiasis presenting to the emergency room.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional study of 199 patients with obstructing urolithiasis and divided patients into two groups according to the presence of bacteria on urine microscopy. The primary outcome was serum white blood cell count and secondary outcomes were objective fever, subjective fever, tachycardia, pyuria, and final urine culture. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to assess whether the presence of bacteria on microscopy was associated with other markers of infection.

Results

The study included 72 patients in the bacteriuria group and 127 without bacteriuria. On univariate analysis, the presence of bacteria was not associated with leukocytosis, objective fever, or subjective fever, but it was associated with gender (p < 0.001), pyuria (p < 0.001), positive nitrites (p = 0.001), positive leukocyte esterase (p < 0.001), and squamous epithelial cells (p = 0.002). In a multilinear regression model including the presence of squamous cells, age, and sex, the presence of bacteriuria was not related to serum white blood cell count (coefficient -0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.1, 0.2; p = 0.17), heart rate (coefficient 0.85; 95% CI -2.5, 4.2; p = 0.62), presence of subjective or objective fever (odds ratio [OR] 1.5; 95% CI 0.8, 3.1; p = 0.18), or the presence of squamous epithelial cells (coefficient -4.4; 95% CI -10, 1.2; p = 0.12). However, the presence of bacteriuria was related to only the degree of pyuria (coefficient 16.4; 95% CI 9.6, 23.3; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Bacteria on urine microscopy is not associated with other markers of systemic infection and may largely represent a contaminant. Renal colic may be a risk factor for providing a contaminated urine specimen.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^e62a7fe9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The uroplakin analysis refutes the assumption that epithelial cells are vulvo-vaginal skin contaminants. The epithelial cells seen in the urine were urothelial in origin and were often clue cells with closely associated bacteria. MSU samples had more clue cells and therefore a greater degree of bacterial invasion. There was no significant correlation between total cfu/ml and clue cells, but this is to be expected as intracellular bacteria will evade detection by routine culture means. Our findings confirm that colonisation of urothelial cells by microbes leads to an innate immune response as previously described by Horsley and colleagues. Mucosal surfaces are a common entry point for microbes, and in the context of urinary tract infections, uropathogenic bacteria invade the apical surface of the urothelium to create adherent surface biofilms or form intracellular bacterial colonies. The parasitised urothelial cell is subsequently exfoliated into the urine to encourage bacterial clearance, leading to the accumulation of these clue cells as sediment at the base of the bladder. While a transurethral catheter will pass through this deposit and sample the urine above, a MSU is more likely to achieve a greater sample of clue cells. It is conceivable that an ordinary void may achieve even more by including the first part of the stream.

Urine is increasingly recognised to have its own diverse microbiome, and standard culture methods only capture a small fraction of this living community. Imbalances within this healthy microbiota are associated with factors such as age, body mass index and hormonal status and predisposition to disease. Pregnancy may be a similarly influential factor. Current quantitative criteria may be inappropriate for diagnosing infection given the true urinary microbiome. Sediment culture delivers more microbes, but the pathological significance of these organisms is unexplained. We propose that the appropriate substrate for analysis of infection should be urothelial cells as they have been parasitised by the pathogen. Khasriya et al. provided evidence supporting this contention outside pregnancy. Intracellular uropathogens may evade detection by standard diagnostic means. This degree of urothelial parasitisation in voided urine implies that the MSU may be superior in capturing the disease signals.

### Diagnostic accuracy of cytology for the detection of endometrial cancer in urine and vaginal samples [^fe4b86a2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cytological assessment of urine and vaginal samples

Urine and vaginal samples were preserved with an equal volume of CRR (Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Jersey) and transferred to the Manchester Cytology Centre at MFT. Once there, samples were centrifuged at 1614× g for 5 min. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet fixed in 6 mL CRR for 1 h. After fixation, the sample was centrifuged at 403× g for 10 min, supernatant decanted and the pellet prepared as a liquid-based cytology (LBC) Papanicalaou stained slide using the BD prepstain (Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Jersey) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stained slide was dehydrated in two changes of industrial methylated spirits, cleared in two changes of xylene and cover-slipped. All slides were reviewed by three independent observers, a consultant biomedical scientist (BMS) in cytopathology and two consultant specialist cytopathologists, with discrepant cases settled by consensus review at a multi-header microscope. Slides were reported as unsatisfactory (sample obscured by debris, lymphocytes, bacteria or paucicellular sample), negative (benign urothelial and/or squamous epithelial cells) or positive (glandular, atypical or malignant cells seen). Positive cytology included atypical cells of undetermined significance (ACUS, occasional small atypical, degenerate cells), glandular cells (unexpected finding in postmenopausal woman) or malignant (single and/or clusters of epithelial cells with malignant features, specifically high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, vacuolated or minimal non-vacuolated cytoplasm, enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei, coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli and irregular nuclear outlines).

Blinding

Women with unexplained PMB were sampled before clinical examination and any routine diagnostic tests, when researchers were blinded to cancer outcomes. The cytopathologists/BMS were blinded to patient identity, the results of clinical investigations and cancer outcomes until they had given their final report.

Primary and secondary outcomes

The pre-specified primary outcome was abnormal, suspicious or malignant glandular cells in urine and/or vaginal samples by cytology. Diagnostic accuracy was determined against routine histopathology on either the endometrial biopsy or hysterectomy specimen. Women with non-malignant causes of PMB were followed up for any subsequent referral or presentation to our service until May 2019; this was used as reference standard for women with no histopathology results.

### How important is urinary cytology in the diagnosis of urological malignancies? [^48fa82f2]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To audit clinical usefulness of urine cytology examination in a subspecialised urological unit setting.

Patients and Methods

Data from the hospital information support system on urinary cytology examinations carried out at one centre was audited over a period of 15 months. Source of urine cytology specimens, clinical profile of patients and the findings of urinary cytology were analysed and collated.

Results

A total of 1400 urinary cytology specimen on 900 patients were requested during 15 months study period. Urologists requested 1092 (78%) and non-urologists (general practitioners, physician or general surgeons) requested 318 (22%) specimens. The majority of specimens, 1115 (80%) did not show any cytological evidence of malignancy. 83 specimens (6%) showed cytological evidence of malignant cells consistent with origin from a urothelial malignancy. Among this group 87% (72) were more than 50 years of age and 60 (72%) had history of gross heamaturia. 159 (11.35) cases were reported as being suspicious of malignancy or showing atypical cells requiring further evidence. A total of 43 (3.04%) specimens were poorly preserved or insufficient for diagnosis. The positivity rate amongst urologist and non-urologists request was 56% and 6% respectively (p = 0.00001 value). The source in 37 (86%) specimens reported, as poorly preserved or insufficient for diagnosis was non-urologists compared to 6 (14%) from urologists with significant p value (0.00001).

Conclusions

Urinary cytology for malignant cells is a contributory investigation in the diagnosis of urological malignancy. It should be only ordered in the proper clinical situation.

### Phase II trial of enfortumab vedotin in patients with previously treated advanced head and neck cancer… [^ec397dac]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose Methods Results Conclusion Introduction 1, 2Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma arising from mucosal epithelial cells of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx comprises > 90% of HNC cases. 3, 4Approximately 50% of individuals diagnosed with locally advanced HNSCC experience recurrent disease, and up to 10% present with metastatic disease. 10, 11Nectin-4 is expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including most bladder cancers and HNCs. 10, 12Notably, data from bladder cancer trials, including the EV-201 clinical trial of EV monotherapy in urothelial carcinoma, suggest that the degree of nectin-4 expression is not associated with response. 13-16Preclinical evidence suggests EV selectively binds to and is internalized by nectin-4–expressing cells, resulting in intracellular release of MMAE and apoptotic cell death.

10, 11Furthermore, studies have suggested that nectin-4 can promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in other tumor types/malignancies. 11, 13, 25Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were reported in 34. 8% of patients with HNC in this study and
51. 4% of the 296 patients treated with EV in the phase III trial EV-301 in patients with previously treated la/mUC. 11Rates of all-grade TRAEs of special interest were also similar between the HNC cohort of EV-202 and EV-treated patients in EV-301. 11No new safety signals were identified. Similar to the EV trials in la/mUC, AEs were managed with dose interruptions and dose reductions. Education of patients, caregivers, and health care practitioners on early recognition of AEs associated with EV is essential.

In addition, proactive monitoring and management of the known AEs associated with EV, including dose modification to manage AEs, are important aspects of caring for patients being treated with EV. Together, these results suggest substantial antitumor activity with well-characterized safety, meriting further investigation of EV in R/M HNC.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^436eaab8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The type of urine specimen or the choice of void fraction used for HPV testing does have a profound impact on the amount of HPV DNA present in the sample and, in turn, the probability of accurate HPV detection. The superiority of first-void urine for HPV testing was confirmed in the first meta-analysis on the subject, published in 2014, but without understanding the underlying reasons and mechanism. Surprisingly, although the fraction of the void exerted an impact on testing accuracy, as well as use of a tailored device to capture the initial void, no difference between (first-void) urine collected during first morning urination versus later in the day was observed. Consequently, in applied projects where women are asked to collect urine for HPV DNA testing, they are asked not to wash their genitals thoroughly in advance of the sample and to wait at least 1 h after the previous urination before providing a first-void urine specimen for HPV testing.

Other technical considerations.

Another important observation described in pilot experiments is the relative instability of HPV DNA in certain urine samples and the requirement for a preservative in the sample collection/transport media to enhance stability and minimize degradation. Even with well-established DNA extraction protocols, which have been found to garner a high yield and quality of HPV DNA in more cellular samples, significant reductions of HPV DNA in urine specimens have been observed in the absence of a preservative applied immediately after collection of first-void urine. This finding is consistent with the fact that, due to nucleases present in unpreserved urine, HPV DNA may become undetectable. The instability of HPV DNA in urine is its main drawback compared with cervical samples, where HPV DNA remains stable at room temperature for months. Therefore, it is important when using first-void urine to incorporate a sample collection system that includes urine-conservation preservative to stabilize HPV DNA. In addition, human DNA present in urine may not be optimal as an internal control for sample validity in urine because it can remain positive even if HPV DNA is degraded substantially, running the risk of false-negative results. Instead, the use of an external DNA control to monitor sample validity is recommended for urine.

Microhematuria — risk-group guidance on cytology and urine-based tumor markers: For low/negligible-risk cases where the risk of bladder cancer is approximately 0.4%, a marker with a theoretical 100% sensitivity would need to be utilized 1,000 times to identify 4 cancers, and if such a marker had 90% specificity, it would still result in 100 negative/unnecessary cystoscopy evaluations; conversely, in high-risk patients the incidence of cancer exceeds 2.5%, and therefore the Panel recommends against routine use of urine cytology or UBTMs in the initial evaluation of low/negligible- or high-risk patients with MH.

### Evaluation of women with a positive urine cytology and no demonstrable disease in the urinary tract [^cabf2975]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Urinary cytology is indispensable both for the evaluation of gross hematuria and surveillance of patients with urothelial neoplasms. A positive urine cytology usually indicates the presence of urothelial carcinoma somewhere in the urinary tract. However, in women, it may also signal urothelial carcinoma involvement of the lower gynecologic tract or be the presenting sign for a primary cancer of the lower gynecologic tract or rectum. Guidelines for the evaluation of women with a positive cytology and normal urinary tract are lacking. We present a review of the current literature with case scenarios to bring clinicians attention to this diagnostic dilemma.

### Analysis of extracellular mRNA in human urine reveals splice variant biomarkers of muscular dystrophies [^31c6092d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Quantitative gene expression in biofluids from DM1 and UA controls

Urine contains RNA from two broad categories: (1) exRNA released by cells lining the urinary tract, including the kidney, bladder, and urothelial (transitional epithelial) cells that line the inside of the ureters and proximal urethra, and (2) RNA contained inside of cells normally present in the urine, including small numbers of erythrocytes (0–2/high power field [HPF]) and leukocytes (0–2/HPF), exfoliated renal tubular cells, urothelial cells, and squamous epithelial cells, and recently described "urine stem cells" –. Using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), we analyzed DMPK gene expression in exRNA from urine and serum, and in total RNA from urine cells. DMPK content, as measured by copies per microliter of input cDNA, appeared similar between DM1 and UA subjects in both sources of urine RNA (Fig. 1a). However, in urine exRNA, expression of the reference gene GTF2B tended to be higher in DM1 as compared to UA subjects, and normalization of DMPK expression to GTF2B in urine exRNA revealed DMPK levels in DM1 patients about half that in the UA group (Fig. 1b, c). By contrast, GTF2B levels in urine cell total RNA showed no difference between DM1 and UA groups, and normalized DMPK expression was similar in these groups (Fig. 1b, c). In serum, DMPK and GTF2B were expressed at similar levels in DM1 and UA subjects, and in both groups were present at levels nearly an order of magnitude lower than in urine (Fig. 1a–c).

### A prospective study comparing contamination rates between a novel mid-stream urine collection device (peezy) and a standard method in renal patients [^75aebaa2]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Contaminated urine was defined as either squamous (epithelial) cells visible in urine microscopy or a mixed growth on urine culture. Mixed growth was defined as those with ≥ 2 different types of organisms at > 10⁵/mL or ≥ 2 different types of organisms at 10⁴–10⁵/mL or ≥ 1 different type of organism at < 10⁴/mL. Squamous epithelial cells from the skin surface or from the outer urethra can appear in urine. They can act as a surrogate marker for contamination, indicating that skin flora from around the perineum may have contaminated the sample. Therefore, data on epithelial cell counts on microscopy were also collected.

The study samples were then compared with historical consecutive controls from female transplant patients who had given a urine specimen in the same clinic using the standard method (passing the MSU into a sterile jug) between January 2010 and March 2010. The processing methods in the microbiology department were identical across both periods.

Individuals who used the Peezy device were also requested to complete a questionnaire. Questions about ease of use and urine spillage were included. Patients were also asked how likely they would be to use the device again and how it compared with their usual method of giving a MSU. The questionnaire was adapted after an initial pilot, such that questions were added to determine whether patients found it easier to use after more than one attempt.

Demographic details, including age, reason for renal failure and underlying renal function, were collected.

This study was performed as a service evaluation to assess the results and feasibility in this patient cohort. There was no randomisation or double collecting of samples. The Peezy device was chosen as it was available in the National Health Service (NHS) prescription service. It was practical to use and had a sound method for producing a MSU.

Statistical analysis

Sample size was calculated as a total of 870 patients (n = 435 of Peezy patients compared with 435 historical controls) based on an estimated reduction from 10% to 5% in mixed growths from prior studies.

Statistical analysis was performed using STATA V.11.0. Means and medians were calculated, and Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare variables as appropriate. Categorical/grouped variables were analysed using χ² tests.

Results

Demography and symptoms

In the first study, 60 female adult patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patient group was 60 years (SD = 12). The patients suffered from chronic LUTS and were being treated for chronic UTI. The demographic data are shown in Table 1 and demonstrate that the patients were suffering from significant symptoms.

Evaluation of pyuria, epithelial cells and UP3-positive cells

To evaluate the presence of pyuria, epithelial cells and UP3-positive cells, a total of 118 urine samples were examined (MSU = 60, CSU = 58). The patients were at various stages of disease. The data analysis results are shown in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5. Microscopic pyuria counts (log10 WBC μl⁻¹) were significantly lower in CSU compared with MSU. Similarly, there were greater numbers of epithelial cells in MSU, the majority of which were UP3-positive, indicating urothelial origin. There was no significant difference in the proportion of UP3-positive cells between the MSU (0.81) and CSU (0.9) methods. If the CSU method collected a significantly less contaminated sample, the proportion would be expected to be significantly higher with the CSU method. These results suggest that MSU might enrich a urine sample for urinary tract cell sediment compared with the CSU, without increased or appreciable contamination.

### Accuracy of urine cytology and the significance of an atypical category [^a0b2de1d]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The "atypical urothelial cell" cytologic category is nonstandardized. We subclassify atypical cases to "atypical, favor a reactive process" or "atypical, unclear if reactive or neoplastic". We evaluated the predictive significance of atypical cases by looking at their histologic follow-up. Among the 1,114 patients and 3,261 specimens included, 282 specimens had histologic follow-up. An atypical diagnosis did not carry a significant increased risk of urothelial neoplasia compared with the benign category. Although an "atypical unclear" diagnosis carried a higher rate of detection of high-grade cancer on follow-up biopsy in comparison with "atypical reactive" or "negative" diagnoses (26/58 [45%] vs 15/52 [29%] and 16/103 [15.5%], respectively), this difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that dividing atypical cases into 2 categories based on the level of cytologic suspicion of cancer does not add clinically relevant information within the atypical category. They also raise the question of the significance of the atypical category altogether.

### Assessment of interobserver reliability of nephrologist examination of urine sediment [^b9cfbd2a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our study suggests that interobserver reliability of different urine sediment findings varies widely. Agreement ranged from slight for mixed cellular casts to almost perfect for squamous epithelial cells. For most sediment findings, moderate or substantial agreement was observed, as demonstrated by the overall κ estimates for casts and other sediment particles. Notable exceptions, however, included several sediment findings traditionally regarded as being of high clinical relevance during evaluation of patients with kidney disease, including WBC casts, RBC casts, and kidney tubular epithelial cells, in which fair agreement was observed. Though the kidney biopsy represents the reference standard diagnostic test for intrinsic kidney disease, agreement among pathologists on individual histopathologic lesions and diagnoses has been reported to range widely, with relatively low κ coefficients, for example, of 0.07 to 0.57 in a study of kidney procurement biopsies during deceased donor kidney transplantation and of 0.35 for diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis.,

Adequate interobserver reliability of individual types of urine sediment particles is a prerequisite for the particles to serve as useful biomarkers. If interobserver reliability is poor, test performance characteristics may be adversely affected and inconsistent between examiners. Given the limited available data on diagnostic test performance characteristics of many urine sediment elements, suboptimal interobserver reliability could also raise questions about the generalizability of published findings in this field unless validated by more than 1 group of researchers. As an example, studies have shown how a urine sediment score based on a count of granular casts and kidney tubular epithelial cells can help discriminate prerenal injury from acute tubular necrosis among hospitalized patients with acute kidney injury and, moreover, predict its severity. Although these studies report how granular casts and kidney tubular epithelial cells can have utility as biomarkers in a common clinical scenario, and related studies of others have shown consistent findings, the modest interrater reliability for identifying kidney tubular epithelial cells in our study might suggest that a score relying partially on their correct count can be difficult to accurately assign, at least in a consistent manner among different nephrologists. Further standardization and education about the interpretation of epithelial cells in urine sediment may be of clinical value.

### Human papillomavirus detection in urine samples: an alternative screening method [^a99c3dd5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the usefulness of human papillomavirus detection in the urine of women with poor gynecologic attention.

Materials and Methods

Fifty urine and 50 cervical samples from 50 women were analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on these 100 samples using consensus primers and a low-density microarray-based method for human papillomavirus typing.

Results

The concordance of the results between both sample groups was 80%. In the urine samples, the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion was 100%, the specificity was 80%, the positive predictive value was 91%, and the negative predictive value was 100%.

Conclusions

Human papillomavirus detection in urine samples may be used as an alternative screening method for women with poor gynecologic attention.

Specimen collection in women — "A voided midstream sample is the recommended method to collect a urine specimen from women". Due to sex-specific factors, "this collection approach will result in more genital flora contamination in samples from women", and "menstruation, urogenital tract atrophy, and pelvic organ prolapse are exclusively female conditions that can lead to urine contamination". Additionally, "obesity also increases the risk of contamination". The guideline panel noted detection of nonfemale conditions during evaluation — "benign prostatic hypertrophy [12.9%] and urethral stricture [1.4%]" — but "such conditions are not common to or relevant for women".

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^cede5064]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The symptomatic measurements pain, urgency, FLUTS and LUTSqol were concordant with the pyuria and culture data. It should be appreciated that CSU sampling missed a pathological signal in a significant proportion of patients with appropriate symptoms, pyuria and urothelial cell shedding. Compared with CSU, the MSU technique provided a more substantial sample of the inflammatory sediment. UTI involves colonisation of the urothelial cells by pathogenic microbes. The innate immune response to this microbial colonisation is increased urothelial cell shedding, which may be promoted by mast cells. The shed cells may be colonised or unaffected, but the proportion of parasitised cells in the face of infection would be expected to increase. This sediment, a mixture of white cells, epithelial cells and debris, is likely to collect under the influence of gravity at the bladder base, forming a sampling target that should not be influenced by dilution effects. This is made evident by the characteristic milky quality of the terminal flow when a catheter is used to drain an infected bladder. A catheter, as well as a suprapubic stab, samples urine above this collection at the bladder base (Fig. 1 a), and therefore contains fewer epithelial cells, white cells and microbes, a point reflected in the data reported here. Thus, a CSU sample may be an inferior option because it may miss a substantial amount of the pathology.

With the advent of more sensitive genomic technology, a number of groups have reported that the healthy bladder is not sterile, and that polymicrobial colonisation is the norm in both healthy and infected bladders. Polymicrobial growth in urine specimens has been associated with LUTS in a recent study of similar patients. Indeed, the sediment cultures carried out on urine samples collected by MSU and CSU in this study also demonstrated polymicrobial growth. In patients with symptoms of UTI, the species dispersion is much wider than in asymptomatic controls. At this time it is not known what species of these mixes are responsible for the disease. In this study, the data on the UP3-positive cells argued against the common assumption that polymicrobial results and/or epithelial cells are pointers to contamination. A recent study has shown the isolation of a different microbial population using the Peezy compared with one isolated from peri-urethral swabs, based on the assumption of peri-urethral contamination of MSU samples.

### Diagnostic accuracy of cytology for the detection of endometrial cancer in urine and vaginal samples [^4de7ad69]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This is the first report of a novel endometrial cancer detection tool that combines non-invasive urogenital sampling with cytology to differentiate malignant from non-malignant causes of PMB. Exploiting the anatomical continuity between the uterine cavity and the lower genital tract, we demonstrate that malignant cells can be collected from the vagina by gentle lavage using the Delphi screener, and from voided urine samples that become contaminated with shed tumour debris during self-collection. These cells can be distinguished from benign squamous and urothelial cells by cytology where assessors are blinded to cancer outcomes. In our study of 216 women with PMB, urine and/or vaginal cytology was positive in 100/109 women who did (sensitivity 91.7%), and negative in 95/107 women who did not (specificity 88.8%) have cancer. In the prospective PMB cohort, urine and/or vaginal cytology detected all four endometrial cancers, offering comparable diagnostic accuracy to outpatient hysteroscopy and endometrial sampling. These data suggest that urogenital cytology could offer a simple, patient-friendly 'rule out' test to enable quick reassurance for most women who present with PMB, and urgent invasive investigations for those who test positive.

Previous studies have shown that cytology brush samples taken from the uterine cavity are an effective, albeit invasive endometrial cancer detection tool –. A recent systematic review reported abnormal cervical cytology in 45% women with endometrial cancer, providing proof-of-concept that shed endometrial tumour cells can be collected from the cervix, and inspiring the development of novel sampling methodologies to improve cancer detection rates. Sample collection with the Delphi screener is simple, quick and patient-friendly, achieving lower mean pain scores than diagnostic hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy and even speculum examination, which can be uncomfortable in elderly postmenopausal women. It has the further advantage that it could be used by practice nurses and clinicians in community healthcare settings and even enable women to collect their own sample at a time and location convenient for them, extending its potential application to asymptomatic, high-risk women for whom no evidence-based screening tool currently exists. Using the Delphi screener, we missed 10/104 endometrial cancers in our study, including three with microscopic disease at hysterectomy and three with atypical presentations. The identification of patient, tumour and test parameters that increase the risk of false-negative cytology results must now be prioritized to establish the diagnostic limitations of this endometrial cancer detection tool.

### Urine cytology discrepancies: frequency, causes, and outcomes [^a6f99336]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Although urine cytology is used for the early detection and surveillance of urothelial carcinoma, there has been little study of the frequency, causes, and outcomes of cytologic-histologic discrepancies. We obtained histologic follow-up in 361 (6.2%) of 5,785 voided, 124 (19.5%) of 636 lower tract instrumented, and 23 (33%) of 69 upper tract urinary cytologic specimens from 1 institution during a 2-year timeframe to determine diagnostic discrepancy frequency and outcomes. Cytologic-histologic discrepancies were observed in 208 (40.9%) cases with histologic followup, and the cause of discrepancy was interpretation and sampling in 35.1% and 63.0%, respectively. Of all discrepancies, 101 (48.6%) resulted in minimal or mild harm, consisting mainly of repeated testing and/or diagnostic delays. Severe harm never was observed. We conclude that current screening and surveillance methods that incorporate urine cytology are accurate in diagnosing urothelial cancer. However, the current protocols result in potentially reducible errors that lead to unnecessary testing and diagnostic delays.

### Presence, quantitation and characterization of JC virus in the urine of Italian immunocompetent subjects [^0d4ac64e]. Journal of Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Human polyomavirus JC (JCV) infects the worldwide population, remains latent in the kidney, and is excreted in the urine. A longitudinal study was performed in order to evaluate JCV excretion, to characterize molecularly the virus and to determine if its presence in urine is a consequence of viral reactivation or merely of epithelial squamous cell shedding. The presence of cellular sediment and the JCV genome were examined in 333 urine samples collected periodically for 3 months from 17 healthy subjects; molecular characterization, and quantitation of the virus were also undertaken. JCV DNA was detected in 40.2% of the samples, with a significant difference (P < 0.001) observed between males and females. JCV shedding was independent of the presence of cellular sediment in every individual. JCV genotype 1 was the genome detected most frequently, while all of the amplified strains showed archetypal organization of the transcriptional control region (TCR). No clinical symptoms have been associated with JCV excretion and no microbial load was detected in the urine samples. The lack of correlation between JCV DNA detection and the presence of squamous cells in urine sediment indicates that viruria is regulated by the life cycle of JCV. Thus, the virus is eliminated as consequence of its reactivation.

### Diagnostic accuracy of cytology for the detection of endometrial cancer in urine and vaginal samples [^31f68073]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Urine and vaginal sample analyses

Microscopic haematuria was more common in women with gynaecological cancer than those without (77% versus 56%, p = 0.04). Both urine and vaginal cytology samples showed mixed cellular populations consisting predominantly of benign urothelial and/or squamous epithelial and inflammatory cells. Malignant endometrial cancer cells appeared as clusters of hyperchromatic glandular cells with large, atypical nuclei (Fig. 2). These cells exhibited an immunoprofile consistent with female genital tract (CK7+, CK20−, PAX-8+, ER+) rather than urinary tract (GATA3−) origin. Samples varied in cellularity and the proportion of malignant endometrial cancer cells seen, with vaginal samples in general showing more frequent and larger clusters of malignant cells than their matched urine sample.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^f02a0baf]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — urine cytology use and diagnostic performance: clinicians may obtain urine cytology for high-risk patients with equivocal findings on cystoscopic evaluation or those with persistent microhematuria and irritative voiding symptoms or risk factors for carcinoma in situ after a negative work up (Expert Opinion). Data currently indicate that cytology rarely identifies cancer in the setting of normal cystoscopy and imaging. In a study of 660 patients, a positive cytology detected urothelial carcinoma in only 4 patients with normal cystoscopy, of whom 2 had carcinoma in situ and 2 had upper tract disease. In DETECT I, which recruited 3,556 patients with hematuria (30.3% MH, 69.7% GH), urine cytology was performed in 567 (15.9%) and a positive/atypical urinary cytology had a sensitivity of 57.7%, specificity 94.9%, PPV 35.7%, and NPV 97.9%, with an ROC of 0.688. Additionally, in a prospective cohort enrolling microhematuria and gross hematuria patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of cytology was 57.7% (95%CI: 38.7 to 75.3) for high-risk bladder cancers, especially carcinoma in situ.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^a0214468]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary markers in microhematuria (MH) — initial evaluation and adjunctive use: Clinicians should not routinely use urine cytology or urine-based tumor markers to decide whether to perform cystoscopy in the initial evaluation of low/negligible- or high-risk patients with microhematuria, and should not routinely use cytology or urine-based tumor markers as adjunctive tests in the setting of a normal cystoscopy; both are graded as Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C. A prospective study of 2,778 patients evaluated the added benefit of obtaining cytology during the initial evaluation of MH, and of the 2,778 patients, only 2 with a negative evaluation and a positive cytology were eventually diagnosed as having urothelial carcinoma, with a 10.5% false-positive rate from cytology noted.

### How reliable is automated urinalysis in acute kidney injury? [^b98afd62]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Examination of urine sediment is crucial in acute kidney injury (AKI). In such renal injury, tubular epithelial cells, epithelial cell casts, and dysmorphic red cells may provide clues to etiology. The aim of this study was to compare automated urinalysis findings with manual microscopic analysis in AKI.

Methods

Samples from patients diagnosed with AKI and control patients were included in the study. Red blood cells, white blood cells, renal tubular epithelial cells/small round cells, casts, and pathologic (path) cast counts obtained microscopically and by a UF1000i cytometer were compared by Spearman test. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the ability to predict AKI from parameters obtained from the UF1000i.

Results

There was poor correlation between manual and automated analysis in AKI. None of the parameters could predict AKI using logistic regression analysis. However, the increment in the automated path cast count increased the odds of AKI 93 times.

Conclusion

Automated urinalysis parameters are poor predictors of AKI, and there is no agreement with manual microscopy.

### Evaluation of high-risk human papillomavirus types PCR detection in paired urine and cervical samples of women with abnormal cytology [^8c743003]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

During the last decade, increasing efforts have focused on HPV detection in self-obtained samples, to increase the overall proportion of patients participating in cervical cancer screening procedures.

Objectives

A clinical evaluation study of an optimized protocol for PCR detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types in urine compared with cervical samples in consecutive women referred to the colposcopy clinic with abnormal cervical cytology.

Study Design

Paired urine and cervical specimens were collected from 100 consecutive women referred to the colposcopy clinic with abnormal cervical cytology and normal urine parameters. In-house and a commercial PCR method for the detection of HPV types 16 and 18, and a commercial multiplex PCR for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33 were performed. All HPV cervix-positive/urine-negative paired urine samples were spiked with serial dilutions of cell lines infected with HPV 16 or 18 to test the sensitivity of HPV detection in these urine samples.

Results

In all but two cases HPV type 16 was detected. In cancer cases, the urine/cervix HPV detection sensitivity was 88.8%; in cases with high-grade lesions it was 76.5%; and in cases with low-grade lesions it was 45.5%. In all concordant cases the same HPV type was detected in both samples. The urine/cervix HPV detection sensitivity was higher when urine samples contained two or more epithelial cells per field in urine microscopy. HPV detection in 9 cervix-positive but urine-negative urine samples spiked with serial dilutions of HPV-positive cell lines showed that in these cases urine PCR inhibitors did not affect PCR amplification.

Conclusions

A higher urine/cervix HPV detection sensitivity in cancer and high-grade lesions suggests that urine testing could be used to detect HPV mainly when these lesions are present.

### Flipping the switch | NEJM resident 360… [^885d8978]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published January 31, 2024 Squamous metaplasia of the urothelium usually arises from chronic infection or mechanical irritation. If the urothelium is replaced by keratinizing squamous cells that are then shed into the urine, the condition is called keratinizing desquamative squamous metaplasia. Read the NEJM Clinical Problem-Solving Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Is keratinizing desquamative squamous metaplasia associated with urinary tract obstruction. A: Keratinizing desquamative squamous metaplasia is a pathologic adaptation of the urinary tract in which the native urothelial lining transforms to squamous epithelium with prominent keratin deposition. This form of metaplasia impairs urothelial integrity, leading to mucosal sloughing. The resulting keratinaceous debris can lead to urinary stasis or obstruction.

Q: What is the link between vitamin A deficiency and keratinizing desquamative squamous metaplasia. A: Vitamin A has an essential role in epithelial integrity. Vitamin A deficiency has been shown to induce keratinizing desquamative squamous metaplasia in the urothelial tracts of animal models; the authors are aware of one case of urothelial keratinizing desquamative squamous metaplasia in a human that resulted from vitamin A deficiency and resolved with vitamin A treatment. A: Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that occurs in multiple chemical forms. It is a transcription factor ligand with roles in gene regulation for morphogenesis, differentiation, and proliferation, which collectively are responsible for the integrity of epithelial tissue. Vitamin A deficiency causes metaplasia and keratinization of the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, leading to ulceration, scarring, and blindness.

Vitamin A is essential for the formation and maturation of keratinocytes, which are epithelial cells that produce the structural protein keratin; deficiency leads to abnormal keratin protein differentiation and skin hyperkeratosis and dryness.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the urinalysis for urinary tract infection in infants [^62f8320a]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection (UTI) guideline suggests incorporation of a positive urinalysis (UA) into the definition of UTI. However, concerns linger over UA sensitivity in young infants. Infants with the same pathogenic organism in the blood and urine (bacteremic UTI) have true infections and represent a desirable population for examination of UA sensitivity.

Methods

We collected UA results on a cross-sectional sample of 276 infants < 3 months of age with bacteremic UTI from 11 hospital systems. Sensitivity was calculated on infants who had at least a partial UA performed and had ≥ 50000 colony-forming units per milliliter from the urine culture. Specificity was determined by using a random sample of infants from the central study site with negative urine cultures.

Results

The final sample included 245 infants with bacteremic UTI and 115 infants with negative urine cultures. The sensitivity of leukocyte esterase was 97.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.5%-99.2%) and of pyuria (> 3 white blood cells/high-power field) was 96% (95% CI 92.5%-98.1%). Only 1 infant with bacteremic UTI (Group B Streptococcus) and a complete UA had an entirely negative UA. In infants with negative urine cultures, leukocyte esterase specificity was 93.9% (95% CI 87.9–97.5) and of pyuria was 91.3% (84.6%-95.6%).

Conclusions

In young infants with bacteremic UTI, UA sensitivity is higher than previous reports in infants with UTI in general. This finding can be explained by spectrum bias or by inclusion of faulty gold standards (contaminants or asymptomatic bacteriuria) in previous studies.

Microhematuria — diagnostic performance and post-test reclassification in intermediate-risk: In this analysis, the positive LR for cytology was 7.67 while the negative LR was 0.35; for other urine-based tumor markers, positive LR ranged from 2.14–6.6 and negative LR from 0.07–0.48. In patients with intermediate-risk disease, where the baseline prevalence of disease is approximately 1% (0.2–3.1%), a negative cytology yields a post-test probability of 0.4%, and a negative test on other UBTM can decrease the (post-test) probability of cancer detection to 0.1%-0.4%. The Panel focused on studies in which at least 25% were MH with an absolute number of at least 100 MH patients; an RCT of a marker-based approach reported NPV of 99%, and several other markers and cytology had reported NPV of 95–100% in the target population.

### Diagnostic utility of selective upper tract urinary cytology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature [^d94319c9]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) can be a challenging diagnostic pursuit. To date, there is no large-scale study assessing the statistical utility (eg, sensitivity and specificity) of selective cytology. Herein, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the published literature to evaluate the efficacy of selective cytology for the detection of UTUC in patients with a suspicious clinical profile Selective cytology confers a high specificity but marginal sensitivity for the detection of UTUC. The sensitivity is greater for high-grade UTUC lesions. The statistical assessment of its utility is limited by the heterogeneity and bias of previous studies.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^42671432]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Midstream urine (MSU) is key in assessing lower urinary tract syndrome (LUTS), but contingent on some assumptions. The aim of this study was to compare the occurrence of contamination and the quality of substrates obtained from four different collections: MSU, catheter specimen urine (CSU), a commercial MSU collecting device (Peezy) and a natural void. Contamination was quantified by differential, uroplakin-positive, urothelial cell counts.

Methods

This was a single blind, crossover study conducted in two phases. First, we compared the MSU with CSU using urine culture, pyuria counts and differential counting of epithelial cells after immunofluorescence staining for uroplakin III (UP3). Second, we compared the three non-invasive (MSU, Peezy MSU™, natural void) methods using UP3 antibody staining only.

Results

The natural void was best at collecting bladder urinary sediment, with the majority of epithelial cells present derived from the urinary tract. CSU sampling missed much of the urinary sediment and showed sparse culture results. Finally, the MSU collection methods did not capture much of the bladder sediment.

Conclusion

We found little evidence for contamination with the four methods. Natural void was the best method for harvesting shed urothelial cells and white blood cells. It provides a richer sample of the inflammatory exudate, including parasitised urothelial cells and the microbial substrate. However, if the midstream sample is believed to be important, the MSU collection device is advantageous.

### Urethral cancer [^d67d7dab]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on urethral cancer:

- **Definition**: Urethral cancer is a rare malignancy originating from the epithelial cells of the urethra, with histological types including SCC, transitional cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of urethral cancer involves the malignant transformation of urethral epithelial cells, often preceded by dysplastic changes. SCC is more common in the distal urethra, while transitional cell carcinoma typically arises in the proximal urethra. The tumor can invade adjacent tissues, including the bladder, vagina, or prostate.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of primary urethral carcinoma in the US is estimated at 4.3 per million in males and 1.5 per million in females, with a higher incidence observed in the elderly and African Americans.
- **Risk factors**: Chronic inflammation of the urethra, such as recurrent UTIs and urethral strictures, is a recognized risk factor for urethral cancer. HPV 16 infection, STIs, and prolonged catheter use are also risk factors for urethral cancer.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of urethral cancer vary according to tumor location and size. Common symptoms include hematuria, urethral bleeding, dysuria, and obstructive symptoms. A palpable urethral mass, perineal pain, and discharge may also be present. Advanced disease can present with pelvic pain, weight loss, and symptoms related to metastasis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of urethral cancer is generally poor, largely due to late diagnosis and high rates of local recurrence and metastasis. Early-stage disease has a better prognosis, with localized tumors amenable to surgical resection. Advanced or metastatic disease carries a poorer prognosis.

### Condyloma acuminatum of the urinary tract demonstrates atypical squamous cells in urine cytology [^6116fe9c]. Human Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Urine cytology of urinary tract condylomas has not been systematically studied. We analyzed cytologic features of urinary tract condylomas and evaluated potential diagnostic challenges and pitfalls. We retrospectively reviewed urine cytology of urinary tract condylomas from 2 academic institutions (2015–2022). Among 20 patients with urinary tract condylomas, 6 had urine cytology (2 samples in 1 patient), including 3 men and 3 women (mean age, 74.3 years; range, 65–86 years). Original interpretations were negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma (NHGUC; n = 4), atypical urothelial cells (n = 1), reactive urothelial cells (n = 1), and negative for malignancy (n = 1). Squamous cells were noted in 3 cases, atypical squamous cells (ASC) consistent with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) were noted in 1 case, and in 3 cases, the presence of squamous cells was not mentioned. All urines were reclassified according to The Paris System as NHGUC. Specimens were composed of benign urothelial cells and groups or isolated ASC consistent with LSIL (n = 4), atypical keratinized squamous cells (n = 2), and ASC that did not meet LSIL criteria (n = 1). The LSIL cells showed nuclear enlargement (n = 4), hyperchromasia (n = 4), perinuclear halo (n = 3), nuclear membrane irregularity (n = 4), orangeophilic cytoplasm (n = 3), and binucleation (n = 4). The atypical keratinized squamous cells showed hyperchromasia (n = 2), nuclear membrane irregularity (n = 2), keratin pearls (n = 2), and binucleation (n = 1). The ASC that did not meet LSIL criteria showed nuclear enlargement and orangeophilic cytoplasm. Many urinary tract condylomas (57%) demonstrate classic LSIL features in urine cytology. Less frequent cases can mimic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (28%) or demonstrate ASC not diagnostic of LSIL (15%).

### Urinary markers / cytology: what and when should a urologist use [^b76f5fd1]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

As of 2012, bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer afflicting men and ninth most common cancer in women. Nearly 80% of all bladder cancer diagnoses are non-muscle invasive at presentation, most of whom will develop recurrent disease within 5 years of initial diagnosis. Urinary tumor markers provide a noninvasive method for both screening and surveillance of bladder cancer. This article reviews the current Food and Drug Administration-approved urinary biomarkers for detection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

### The diagnostic accuracy of urine-based tests for bladder cancer varies greatly by patient [^3ce9401a]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

For all the above analyses, suspicious cystoscopies were considered positive since they will generally result in intervention (e.g. bladder biopsy). To determine whether the classification of suspicious cystoscopies dramatically affected our results, we repeated the analyses with suspicious cystoscopies classified as negative and found no significant difference in our results, demonstrating that the performance of cytology and UroVysion FISH are not sensitive to how suspicious cystoscopies are classified. This stands in contrast to the large effect seen in cytology with a similar re-analysis that was mentioned above.

### A blinded observational cohort study of the microbiological ecology associated with pyuria and overactive bladder symptoms [^b662f6fc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

This study sought to characterise the microbial ecology of the lower urinary tract in patients with symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) using culture of the urinary urothelial cell sediment. The pathological significance of the microbiome was assessed through its relationship with known urothelial inflammatory markers and patient reported symptoms.

Methods

Adult female patients with OAB symptoms and asymptomatic controls were assessed at 12 study visits scheduled every 4 weeks. At each visit, all participants provided a clean-catch midstream urine (MSU) that was analysed to count white and uroepithelial cells, submitted to standard culture and spun urothelial-cell-sediment culture. Symptoms were assessed using validated questionnaires.

Results

This analysis shows that OAB patients differ consistently from controls, demonstrating differences in bacterial ecology (t-4.57, p0.0001), in the microscopic pyuria count (t-6.37, p0.0001) and presence of infected urothelial cells (t-4.21, p0.0001). The primary outcome measure of bacterial growth [colony-forming units (CFU) mL⁻¹] was higher in OAB patients than in controls throughout the 12 months. Data showed a correlation between symptoms and pyuria, with notable urgency correlating with pyuria and epithelial cell shedding. The routine urine cultures (with a threshold of reporting a positive result as 10⁵ CFU/ml) were unable to distinguish OAB patients from controls. However, sediment cultures differed significantly, and there was a correlated increased immune response amongst OAB patients.

Conclusions

This study supports the need to re-examine the OAB phenotype given this association with microbial colonisation.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^9ebca6e2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection is common in pregnancy. Urine is sampled from by mid-stream collection (MSU). If epithelial cells are detected, contamination by vulvo-vagial skin and skin bacteria is assumed. Outside pregnancy, catheter specimen urine (CSU) is considered less susceptible to contamination. We compared MSU and CSU methods in term pregnancy to test these assumptions.

Methods

Healthy pregnant women at term gestation (n = 32, median gestation 38 + 6 weeks, IQR 37 + 6–39 + 2) undergoing elective caesarean section provided a MSU and CSU for paired comparison that were each analysed for bacterial growth and bladder distress by fresh microscopy, sediment culture and immunofluorescent staining. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire on lower urinary tract symptoms. Epithelial cells found in urine were tested for urothelial origin by immunofluorescent staining of Uroplakin III (UP3), a urothelial cell surface glycoprotein. Urothelial cells with closely associated bacteria, or "clue cells", were also counted. Wilcoxons signed rank test was used for paired analysis.

Results

Women reported multiple lower urinary tract symptoms (median 3, IQR 0–8). MSU had higher white blood cell counts (median 67 vs 46, z = 2.75, p = 0.005) and epithelial cell counts (median 41 vs 22, z = 2.57, p = 0.009) on fresh microscopy. The proportion of UP3+ cells was not different (0.920 vs 0.935, z = 0.08, p = 0.95), however MSU had a higher proportion of clue cells (0.978 vs 0.772, z = 3.17, p = 0.001). MSU had more bacterial growth on sediment culture compared to CSU specimens (median 8088 total cfu/ml vs 0, z = 4.86, p = 0.001). Despite this, routine laboratory cultures reported a negative screening culture for 40.6% of MSU specimens.

Conclusion

Our findings have implications for the correct interpretation of MSU findings in term pregnancy. We observed that MSU samples had greater bacterial growth and variety when compared to CSU samples. The majority of epithelial cells in both MSU and CSU samples were urothelial in origin, implying no difference in contamination. MSU samples had a higher proportion of clue cells to UP3+ cells, indicating a greater sensitivity to bacterial invasion. Urinary epithelial cells should not be disregarded as contamination, instead alerting us to underlying bacterial activity.

### Cervical cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^f7fae3d4]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

The cervix is lined by two types of epithelial cells: squamous cells at the outer aspect and columnar, glandular cells along the inner canal. The transition between squamous cells and columnar cells is an area termed the squamocolumnar junction. Most precancerous and cancerous changes arise in this zone. Pathogenesis Cervical carcinoma begins at the squamocolumnar junction. It can involve the outer squamous cells, inner glandular cells, or both. The precursor lesion is dysplasia: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ.
- Periaortic and pelvic lymph node status.
- Tumor size.
- Patient age.
- Performance status.
- Bilateral disease.
- Clinical stage. The study confirmed the overriding importance of positive periaortic nodes and suggested further evaluation of these nodes in locally advanced cervical cancer. The status of the pelvic nodes was important only if the periaortic nodes were negative. This was also true for tumor size.

46, 47] One report showed that approximately 25% of apparent squamous tumors have demonstrable mucin production and behave more aggressively than their pure squamous counterparts, suggesting that any adenomatous differentiation may confer a negative prognosis.
- A polymorphism in the Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase enzyme, which is related to folate metabolism, has been shown to decrease response to cisplatin, and as a result is associated with poorer outcomes.

PRINCIPLES OF HPV TESTING — CHOOSING THE RIGHT TEST FOR THE RIGHT APPLICATION

While HPV testing is relevant for population-based screening of the healthy population, increasing evidence suggests it may be relevant for individual prognostication in the patient population. To serve both healthy and patient populations, a range of biological specimens (biospecimens) and HPV tests with different performance characteristics are required. The characteristics of HPV tests used and the required specimen types differ considerably depending on whether the application for use serves a screening, diagnostic, epidemiological, or research objective.

In routine clinical laboratory settings, testing for hrHPV is used most frequently as a screening tool in HPV-based primary cervical cancer screening programs. For this purpose, HPV testing must be performed using validated molecular tests with clinical sensitivity and specificity calibrated to the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions rather than minute quantities of virus. Until recently, this testing was performed almost exclusively using cervical samples collected by a trained health care worker.

### Testing for human papillomaviruses in urine, blood, and oral specimens: an update for the laboratory [^0aa12aae]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Twelve high-risk alpha human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes cause approximately 690,000 cancer cases annually, with cervical and oropharyngeal cancer being the two most prominent types. HPV testing is performed in laboratory settings for various applications of a clinical, epidemiological, and research nature using a range of clinical specimens collected by clinicians or by individuals (self-collected specimens). Here, we reflect on the importance and justification of using the right test for the right application and provide practical updates for laboratories either participating in or anticipating involvement in HPV testing in three specimen types, namely, urine, blood, and oral specimens, which are considered "alternative" specimens by many. In addition to clinician-collected cervical samples and self-collected cervicovaginal samples, first-void urine is emerging as a credible specimen for HPV-based cervical cancer screening, triage of HPV screen-positive women, monitoring HPV vaccine impact, and HPV testing in groups for which a less invasive sample is preferred. Detection of cell-free DNA (including HPV DNA) in blood has great promise for the early detection of HPV-attributable oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-AOC) and potentially other HPV-driven cancers and as an adjunct prognostic marker in long-term tumor surveillance, including treatment response. The moderate sensitivity of HPV testing in oral rinses or swabs at HPV-AOC diagnosis prevents its use in HPV-AOC secondary prevention but represents a promising prognostic tool in HPV-AOC tertiary prevention, where the HPV persistence in oral rinses throughout treatment may predict early HPV-AOC recurrences and/or the development of secondary HPV-AOC. The increasing sophistication of specific collection devices designed for alternative samples and the enhanced precision of novel molecular technologies are likely to support the evolution of this field and catalyze potential translation into routine practice.

Results

Study population

A total of 493 women were eligible for inclusion whereof 369 women (74.8%) consented and were enrolled in the study (Fig. 1). After study exclusions (8.9%), 325 women (median age 36.0 years (IQR 29–46) with valid hrHPV results for the paired samples and histological results were included for analysis (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Most women underwent colposcopy (60.6%, n = 197/325) and were in general referred for colposcopy or LEEP based on abnormal cytology (59.7%, n = 194/325). About half of the women (56.4%, n = 182/325) reported to have been fully compliant with the recommendations to avoid urination in 1–2 hours before FVU collection and thoroughly intimate wash the day of study enrollment. Among partly compliant women (31.3%, n = 101/325), most had avoided urination but reported intimate wash (62%, n = 63/101) (Table 1).

### Diagnostic performance of an immunoassay based on urine exfoliated cell enrichment nanotechnology for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: a retrospective, monocentric study [^7b5074a6]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urothelial carcinoma (UC) can be divided into lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) UC and upper urinary tract (renal pelvis and ureter) UC. Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is less common, accounting for 5–10% of UC. However, UTUC is an aggressive urologic cancer with a tendency for disease progression and recurrence. UTUC represent a particular subtype of UC frequently associated with activated FGFR3 signaling, a luminal–papillary phenotype and a T-cell-depleted microenvironment. At diagnosis, UTUC is more frequently invasive than bladder tumor (60% vs. 15–25%, respectively). Early diagnosis is critical for improving clinical outcomes of UTUC because larger tumor size directly and virtually linearly predicts higher rates of invasive and non–organ-confined renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma. Moreover, conservative endoscopic treatment in suitable patients with low-grade (LG) and early stage UTUC is gaining acceptance, highlighting the need for precise diagnosis and robust surveillance. Thus, accurate diagnosis of UTUC aids much in prognosis and decision-making. However, the diagnosis of UTUC is often challenging due to the specific anatomical structure, which hinders timely treatment.

### Urothelial cells may indicate underlying bacteriuria in pregnancy at term: a comparative study [^010f1389]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This was a prospective, cross-sectional, single-blinded comparative study of two urinary sampling methods in pregnant women at term gestation undergoing elective caesarean section. Patients were recruited between June and August 2015 from the obstetric labour ward theatre at a tertiary hospital in central London and gave written consent to an ethically approved study. The data were structured so that individual patients could not be identified.

A set of 41 questions was used to obtain a pertinent clinical, obstetric and infection history. Further clinical data were gleaned from electronic patient notes and records. A lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) profile was created using the "Artemis questionnaire", a detailed 49 item questionnaire divided into four categories: stress incontinence symptoms, overactive bladder symptoms, voiding symptoms, and pain symptoms (Additional file 1). This questionnaire is used in clinical practice by a tertiary chronic LUTS clinic as a tool to identify urine infections and to assess treatment response in non-pregnant patients with chronic LUT symptoms. In this study, the LUTS profile was used as an assessment of bladder distress.

Two urine samples were obtained from each participant for paired comparison. First, participants were instructed to provide a MSU sample before entering the labour ward operating theatre. Verbal and written instructions were given to ensure an adequate clean-catch sample by (1) washing hands and cleaning the genital area with a hypoallergenic wipe to prevent local contamination; (2) parting the labia and urinating the first part of the stream into the toilet before moving the sterile container into the urine stream; and (3) removing the container before urination was complete. After completion of the epidural and/or spinal anaesthesia, and prior to routine prophylactic antibiotic administration and caesarean section surgery, a transurethral urinary catheter was placed. The first 25 mL of urine was collected as the CSU sample.

Fresh urine analysis

Each specimen was processed fresh and unspun at the same facility as sample collection within one hour in order to prevent cell degradation. Urinary dipstick results for nitrites and leukocyte esterase, by-products of bacteria and leukocytes respectively, were recorded as evidence of bacterial infection. Urinary adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP), an inflammatory cytokine, was assayed by a luciferin-luciferase method in order to quantify bladder distress. Microscopy was performed using a haemocytometer chamber to quantify erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBC), leukocytes (white blood cells, WCC), and epithelial cells (EPC) as previously described by Horsley et al.

Conclusions

We are the first to show that urine-based bladder cancer tests display spectrum effects. The reporting of spectrum effects in diagnostic tests should become part of standard practice. Knowledge of these effects allows the physician to properly interpret the results and has a meaningful impact on a patient's clinical care.

### Urine-based human papillomavirus DNA testing as a screening tool for cervical cancer in high-risk women [^fa405541]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that self-collected urine could be used to detect high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA with sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of standard cervical testing.

Methods

Women attending a gynecology clinic for evaluation of abnormal cytology were recruited. Fifty-two participants (21-60years of age) collected urine samples, and clinicians collected cervical brush samples. When appropriate, cervical biopsies were obtained during colposcopy. HPV detection and typing were performed on DNA extracts from each sample, using commercial reagents for L1 consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and type-specific hybridization. HPV 16 viral load was determined by quantitative PCR in HPV 16-positive samples. A diagnostic test analysis was conducted for urine samples.

Results

Fifty paired samples were analyzed, with 76% agreement between samples. The 12 discrepant pairs were all urine negative/cervix positive. The most common HPV types detected were 16, 51, 53, and 62. The urine test correctly identified 100% of the uninfected and 65% of the infected patients.

Conclusion

The results indicate that HPV DNA detection using urine is less sensitive than cervical sampling in a population with abnormal cytology. Further exploration is warranted to determine clinical utility when other options are unavailable.

### Barrier-forming potential of epithelial cells from the exstrophic bladder [^c75158c8]. The American Journal of Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

In situ buccal epithelium expressed ΔNp63, which was also present in all BEX samples, regardless of morphology. Mechanistically, ΔNp63 is complex and involved in both activation and repression of gene transcription by enhancement of chromatin accessibility or interaction with epigenetic repressors, respectively. Although the current study adds further weight to the dominant function of ΔNp63, rather than the TAp63 isoform in urothelium, we conclude that the epigenetic landscape in which BEX urothelium presents is likely to play a key role in determining the ability of p63 to drive a more transitional or squamous phenotype.

In situ, squamous BEX samples were more comparable with other stratified squamous epithelia than urothelium, with full-thickness CK13 expression, basal CK14 expression, and basal/intermediate Ki-67 labeling, comparable with normal buccal and cervical epithelia. This indicates that squamous BEX epithelium has a constitutive rate of cell turnover, whereas transitional-type BEX showed only rare dispersed Ki-67–positive nuclei, in line with healthy mitotically quiescent urothelium. This is of particular interest because there is a potential for an epithelium with constant turnover and compromised urinary barrier to be more susceptible to carcinogenic agents from exposure to urine. Although the current results indicate the potential for some histologically squamous BEX epithelia to revert to a barrier-forming transitional phenotype under permissive conditions, it raises a particular concern that intractable squamous BEX samples may be fundamentally incapable of generating a mitotically quiescent urinary barrier. Given that several clinical centers have BEX histology collections, it is worth considering a retrospective study to stratify squamous BEX samples on the basis of GATA3 expression and relate it to long-term patient outcomes.

### A prospective study comparing contamination rates between a novel mid-stream urine collection device (peezy) and a standard method in renal patients [^b8aa36ae]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Within the time frame, 424 historical patients (control group) and 420 Peezy users (study group) were included in the analysis. Table 1 outlines age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and underlying diagnosis in each group. The patient's eGFR was calculated using the serum creatinine, age and sex according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of control and study groups

The results of the laboratory analysis are outlined in table 2. There were an additional 3.7% mixed growth cultures in the Peezy group compared with historical controls (p = 0.1). However, both white blood cells and epithelial cells were present in significantly higher concentrations in those samples taken with the Peezy device. The epithelial cell data are outlined in figure 2.

Table 2
Urine results in control and study groups

Figure 2
Numbers of epithelial cells on microscopy in control and study groups.

A multivariate analysis was performed to determine whether the differences in groups contributed to the test results. Elevated concentrations of epithelial cells were twice as likely in the Peezy group compared with the controls (OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.7)) when controlled for significant variables in the univariate analysis (eGFR and underlying diagnosis).

Thirty-five 'pilot' questionnaires were returned. Forty-six per cent reported that they found the Peezy more difficult than their normal collection method. Looking at the adapted questionnaire, only 31 were returned for evaluation. Thirty-five per cent reported that they had problems, including spillage, using the Peezy device. In those patients who used Peezy more than once, 75% reported finding it just the same with 13% finding it easier and the rest finding it more difficult.

Statistical analyses and sample size

We evaluated the hrHPV DNA positivity across individual disease categories and sample types by cross-tabulating histology and hrHPV positivity for each sample type using the absolute thresholds for hrHPV positivity. We estimated the relative and absolute clinical accuracy (sensitivity for CIN2 + and CIN3 +, and specificity for < CIN2) with exact 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of hrHPV testing in FVU and cervical samples. Tests for differences in hrHPV positivity, sensitivity, and specificity in paired FVU vs cervical samples were performed using the McNemar's (McN) test. For continuous data, the median and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated. Differences in proportions for unpaired comparisons were tested with two-sample test. Overall percentage agreement and Cohen's Kappa (κ) test concordance for any hrHPV and specific hrHPV genotypes were assessed between the paired samples. Cohen's κ was grouped into: "poor" (κ ≤ 0.20), "fair" (0.21 ≤ κ ≤ 0.40), "moderate" (0.41 ≤ κ ≤ 0.60), "good" (0.61 ≤ κ ≤ 0.80), or "excellent" (κ ≥ 0.81). To address small numbers within specific genotype strata, the genotypes were grouped into three groups based on their carcinogenicity for CIN2 +/CIN3 + as reported by Bonde et al.: (1) highest carcinogenicity (hrHPV16/18), (2) intermediate carcinogenicity (hrHPV31,33,45,51,52,58), and (3) lowest carcinogenicity (hrHPV35,39,56,59,66,68). Compliance to avoid urination and thoroughly intimate wash before FVU collection were grouped as (1) non-compliant: both urination and intimate wash was reported, (2) partly compliant: urination or intimate wash was reported, and (3) fully compliant: no urination or intimate wash was reported. In sensitivity analyses, we evaluated if the test accuracy changed when we restricted the study population to women aged ≥ 30 years and women undergoing colposcopy due to abnormal screening results (i.e. excluding women referred for colposcopy due to post-coital bleeding symptoms and those undergoing LEEP). A supplementary analysis was performed to explore the effect on test accuracy between sample types using the absolute (Ct ≤ 43) and later published clinical genotype-specific thresholds for hrHPV positivity in cervical samples. Herein, hrHPV positivity was defined as Ct ≤ 40 for hrHPV16/18, Ct ≤ 37 for hrHPV31/33/45/52/58, and Ct ≤ 35 for hrHPV35/39/51/56/59/66/68. Data was stored and entered in REDCap. The statistical analyses were conducted using STATA version 18.

### A revalidation and critique of assumptions about urinary sample collection methods, specimen quality and contamination [^30b3be06]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of UP3-positive cells, comparing MSU, Peezy MSU™ and natural void

Thirty-one patients were enrolled in this study, which used the UP3-positive properties of urothelial cells to identify the origin of epithelial cells, given that skin and vaginal cells are UP3-negative. The mean age of the patients was 62 (SD = 10). In total, 93 non-invasive urine samples were collected by MSU, Peezy MSU™ and natural voided urine. Tables 7, 8, and 9 reports the analysis of the UP3-positive cells. The mean count of UP3-positive cells from the natural void method was greatest compared with the MSU and Peezy MSU™. Thus, natural void achieved the greatest abundance of the target substrate. The lowest UP3-positive cell count was observed with the Peezy technique; thus, this method captured the substrate the least. The UP3-negative cells were sparse, with no difference between specimen collection techniques (Table 7, 8, and 9). Thus, the proportion of all cells that were UP3-positive did not differ between the sampling methods, which implies that, contrary to assumptions, contamination by extra-urinary tract cells is not influenced by the sampling technique and was low overall.

### A prospective study comparing contamination rates between a novel mid-stream urine collection device (peezy) and a standard method in renal patients [^99eb1c02]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is imperative that laboratories receive uncontaminated urine samples to avoid giving false-positive results and reduce antimicrobial use.

Aim

The aim of the study was to investigate a novel urine collection device (Peezy) in a renal outpatient clinic to determine whether it reduced contamination of urine samples.

Methods

The novel device was used in 420 renal transplant recipients and the results were compared with 424 matched historical controls, who used the standard method of urine collection. High epithelial cell counts on microscopy and mixed urine cultures were used to identify contaminated samples.

Results

Peezy increased the rates of both epithelial cells and mixed growths in the urine samples when compared with the historical controls.

Conclusions

Further randomised studies in other more generalisable populations need to be performed.

### Determination of the differential expression of mitochondrial long non-coding RNAs as a noninvasive diagnosis of bladder cancer [^8866bad0]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Bladder cancer (BC) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 386.000 new cases and 150.000 deaths occurring worldwide in 2008. Bladder tumors are classified into four categories: papilloma, papillary urothelial carcinoma of low malignant potential, low-grade carcinoma, high-grade carcinoma and carcinoma in situ. About 90% of bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas and transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) and the rest include squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. As many other types of cancer, early detection of BC will allow effective treatments of patients, improving long-term survival.

The "gold standard" in the detection of BC is cystoscopy. This examination, however, is unpleasant, time consuming, expensive and may result in infections and urethral damage. On the other hand, urine cytology has high specificity but low sensitivity, especially in low-grade disease. To improve the detection of BC cells in voided urine, several tumor markers and tests have been developed. One of these tests is based on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect chromosomal alterations characteristic of BC.

### Diagnosis and management of non-metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma: AUA / SUO guideline [^f4a3d411]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) cytology shows pooled positive likelihood ratio 7.96 (95% CI: 5.87 to 10.81) and negative likelihood ratio 0.18 (95% CI: 0.11 to 0.29); in head-to-head comparisons, sensitivity of FISH was higher than for voided urine cytology with similar specificity. Use was not evaluated for selective instrument-obtained samples from the suspected upper tract, and selective collection from the suspected renal and/or ureteral unit likely improves performance characteristics. Given the high sensitivity and low specificity of FISH compared to voided cytology, the Panel acknowledges the yet uncertain role of FISH and suggests such testing may be considered adjunctively to adjudicate atypical or suspicious cytology results.
