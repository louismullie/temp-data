## Question

Clomiphene dose in male infertility

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about clomiphene citrate dosing in male infertility, including indications, dosing ranges, titration, duration, monitoring, safety, and how to counsel about uncertain efficacy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether any dosing is FDA-approved for men. Then, I should verify the clinical indications where clomiphene is used off-label. Next, I will review dosing ranges from guidelines and studies, followed by titration and duration aligned with spermatogenesis. After that, I need to check monitoring parameters and safety signals. Finally, I will integrate evidence on efficacy and provide a practical, cautious recommendation with counseling points and alternatives if clomiphene fails to help, making sure I double-check any conflicting data along the way.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory context, because I need to ensure we are not over-claiming any approved indication. Clomiphene citrate is FDA-approved for ovulatory dysfunction in women and is not approved for male infertility; its use in men is off-label, and the FDA labeling explicitly states there are no adequate or well-controlled studies demonstrating effectiveness in the treatment of male infertility, which frames the entire dosing discussion as evidence-based but off-label practice [^1144ZVGj] [^113tdg6Z] [^114PKeXU].

> Next, I should review the clinical indications where clomiphene is commonly used in men despite the lack of FDA approval. Off-label, clomiphene is used for idiopathic male infertility, for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism when fertility is desired, and as an alternative to testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men who wish to preserve or restore spermatogenesis; I need to emphasize that routine use for idiopathic infertility remains controversial due to limited and inconsistent efficacy data, so patient selection matters [^113ErgG2] [^1161uZrP].

> Now, I will examine dosing ranges from authoritative sources and studies, but hold on, I should verify consistency across guidelines. The AUA guideline describes clomiphene 25–50 mg orally every 1–2 days, which operationalizes a conservative starting dose with flexibility for titration; a commonly cited urology review prefers 25 mg daily with the option to increase to 50–75 mg to target testosterone to the upper normal range; a randomized trial in hypogonadal infertile men used 25 mg daily; and a case report of anabolic steroid–induced hypogonadism used 100 mg daily for 2 months, which I should treat as an outlier rather than a standard regimen [^1111AmGS] [^111m861X] [^114jQkx3] [^1122nu6d].

> Wait, let me verify the upper bound of dosing because I initially thought 100 mg daily might be a standard ceiling; that would be too high for chronic therapy in men. The 100 mg dose appears in case reports and short courses, not as a maintenance standard, and the more defensible maintenance range in men is 25–50 mg daily or every other day, with any escalation individualized and cautious; I should correct my earlier inclination to consider 100 mg daily as routine, and instead reserve higher short-course doses for select scenarios like rapid axis recovery after AAS exposure under specialist supervision [^1122nu6d] [^1111AmGS] [^111m861X].

> I will now examine titration and duration, and I need to ensure we align with spermatogenesis kinetics. A practical approach is to start at 25 mg daily or every other day, reassess testosterone, LH, FSH, and semen parameters at about 3 months, and titrate toward 50 mg if testosterone remains suboptimal and symptoms persist; treatment should continue for at least 3–6 months to span a full spermatogenic cycle, and if there is no meaningful improvement in semen parameters or pregnancy has not occurred, it is reasonable to discontinue and pivot to assisted reproduction rather than prolonging empiric therapy indefinitely [^111m861X] [^113ErgG2].

> Next, I should review monitoring parameters and safety, and I need to double-check that I am not importing female-only cautions into male care. Baseline and periodic total testosterone, free testosterone, LH, FSH, and estradiol are appropriate; semen analysis should be repeated at 3–6 months; clinically, watch for visual symptoms, gynecomastia, mood changes, and thromboembolic events; while the FDA label's warnings about ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple gestation are female-specific, the label also notes hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis cases, so I should screen lipids in men with risk factors and counsel about rare visual adverse effects; importantly, there is no established association with testicular tumors, but isolated case reports exist, so routine testicular examination and symptom inquiry remain prudent [^1111AmGS] [^111w13pU] [^117TkS2t] [^114PKeXU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy; I should confirm what high-quality syntheses say. Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses consistently show that clomiphene can improve biochemical markers like testosterone and sometimes semen parameters compared with other oral agents, but fail to demonstrate significant improvement in pregnancy or live birth versus placebo, and guideline bodies caution that routine use for idiopathic male infertility is unsupported; thus, shared decision-making should emphasize uncertain fertility benefit and the option to proceed to ART if no improvement occurs after a defined trial [^113nGTLb] [^113fqTfX] [^116dfy6L] [^113ErgG2].

> Let me consider special populations briefly, and I should confirm that I am not overgeneralizing. In men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, clomiphene can restore gonadotropins and testosterone and may improve semen parameters in select cases, with case series and reports showing biochemical and occasional fertility responses; however, exogenous gonadotropins remain the standard when the pituitary is incapable of responding, so endocrine referral is appropriate when HH is suspected [^113ErgG2] [^116FkYwL] [^113vvvCR].

> Putting this together, my practical, evidence-aligned recommendation is as follows, and I should double-check that each element is supported. Start clomiphene citrate 25 mg orally daily or every other day, reassess at 3 months with testosterone, LH, FSH, estradiol, and a semen analysis, titrate to 50 mg if testosterone is low-normal and symptoms persist, continue for a total of 3–6 months, and if there is no meaningful improvement in semen parameters or no pregnancy, discontinue and pivot to ART; throughout, counsel that use is off-label, efficacy for live birth is uncertain, and monitoring for visual symptoms, gynecomastia, mood changes, and lipid abnormalities is advised, with individualized risk–benefit review and documentation of informed consent [^1111AmGS] [^111m861X] [^113ErgG2] [^113nGTLb].

---

Clomiphene citrate is used off-label for male infertility, with a **typical dose of 25–50 mg orally every other day** [^1111AmGS] or 25 mg daily [^111m861X], titrated to maintain mid-normal testosterone and improve semen parameters. Treatment duration is **3–6 months** [^111m861X] to allow a full spermatogenic cycle, with reassessment at 3 months. Evidence shows **biochemical improvement** (testosterone, LH, FSH) [^111Gbvjr] but **limited pregnancy benefit** [^113nGTLb], so it is best for men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or subclinical hypogonadism who desire fertility [^113eYZKn]. Monitor testosterone, LH, FSH, estradiol, semen analysis, and adverse effects (visual changes, gynecomastia, mood changes) [^1111AmGS]; discontinue if no response after 6 months or if adverse effects occur.

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Initial dose**: 25 mg orally every other day [^1111AmGS] or 25 mg daily [^111m861X].

- **Titration**: Adjust to 50 mg every other day or 50 mg daily if testosterone remains low-normal after 3 months [^111m861X].

- **Maximum dose**: 50 mg daily; higher doses increase adverse effects without added benefit [^1111AmGS].

- **Duration**: 3–6 months to encompass a full spermatogenic cycle (~74 days) [^111m861X]; reassess at 3 months.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosage

- **Biochemical effects**: Increases testosterone, LH, and FSH, improving the testosterone/estradiol ratio [^112KWwjx] and semen parameters in hypogonadal men [^116FkYwL].

- **Pregnancy outcomes**: Limited evidence for significant improvement in natural conception; use is best in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or subclinical hypogonadism [^113nGTLb].

- **Comparison with other agents**: Clomiphene increases testosterone more than anastrozole [^114jQkx3] but does not clearly outperform other agents for pregnancy [^113nGTLb].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Clomiphene is most appropriate for men with **hypogonadotropic hypogonadism** [^113ErgG2] or subclinical hypogonadism who desire fertility, and for those with **idiopathic infertility** after other causes have been excluded. It is not recommended for men with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, testicular failure, or contraindications to estrogen modulation [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to optimize efficacy and safety:

| **Parameter** | **Frequency** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Total testosterone | Every 3 months | Target mid-normal range |
| LH, FSH | Every 3 months | Assess gonadotropin response |
| Estradiol | Every 3 months | Monitor for elevation |
| Semen analysis | Every 3 months | Assess sperm concentration, motility, morphology |
| Adverse effects | Each visit | Visual changes, gynecomastia, mood changes |

---

## Potential side effects and risks

- **Common side effects**: Gynecomastia, hot flashes, mood changes, visual disturbances [^1111AmGS].

- **Rare risks**: Testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported; causality is unclear [^113tdg6Z].

- **Long-term safety**: Generally well tolerated; monitor lipids and liver function with prolonged use [^113err84].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

AUA/ASRM recommend clomiphene as an **off-label option** for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and select idiopathic cases, with therapy individualized and monitored [^notfound]. Endocrine Society notes that SERMs, including clomiphene, are not FDA-approved for men; use is off-label and evidence is limited [^111BQEis].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial dose**: 25 mg every other day or 25 mg daily [^1111AmGS].

- **Titration**: Increase to 50 mg if needed after 3 months [^notfound].

- **Duration**: 3–6 months; reassess at 3 months [^111m861X].

- **Monitoring**: Testosterone, LH, FSH, estradiol, semen analysis, adverse effects [^notfound].

- **Indications**: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, subclinical hypogonadism, select idiopathic infertility [^113ErgG2].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop if no response after 6 months or if adverse effects occur.

---

Clomiphene citrate is a **reasonable off-label option** for selected men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or subclinical hypogonadism who desire fertility, using 25–50 mg daily or every other day for 3–6 months with close monitoring. Evidence for **pregnancy improvement is limited**; manage expectations and individualize therapy [^113nGTLb].

Future research need

Clomiphene consistently ranked as the most likely treatment to improve clinical outcomes in men with infertility over other treatment options, however, it did not demonstrate significant efficacy compared to placebo. Due to suboptimal trial methodology, none of the included trials reported sufficient longitudinal outcomes to enable adequate evaluation of the mechanistic effect of clomiphene in the trial cohort compared to placebo. There is a need for an adequately powered randomised trial to confirm the true efficacy of clomiphene on the semen parameters, biochemical, hormonal, and clinical outcomes of men with infertility. Specifically, there is a need for an extended evaluation of the longterm reproductive outcomes with the use of clomiphene, especially regarding its safety and tolerability.

There is a need to explore the effect of potential effect modifiers (e.g. age, BMI, dose, and adherence). Given the paucity of trials and limited reporting, prospective individual participant meta-analysis of future trial is required to achieve this objective. Future IPD meta-analyses using individual data from both randomised and observational studies with adequate adjustment for key confounders could also offer higher quality evidence and inform the design of future randomised trials.

None of the included trials sought input from lay consumers on study design or the choice of outcome reporting. Beyond conception, these pharmacological treatments could have a significant impact on men's quality of life which was reported only in one trial. Incorporating patient reported outcomes measures is critical in future trials as well as adopting established core outcome sets.

### A new look at the medical management of infertility [^111m861X]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Effective therapies are available for the treatment of infertility owing to specific causes. Most hormonal imbalances can be readily identified and successfully treated. The treatment of men with unexplained idiopathic infertility remains difficult. The availability of a multitude of agents ranging from hormones to nutritional supplements emphasizes the fact that none are consistently effective. There is no good way to predict which patients will respond to a specific treatment. Idiopathic infertility may result from multiple discrete defects in sperm generation and maturation that are as yet unidentified. A better understanding of these defects will yield more effective treatment options and appropriate triage of patients to specific therapeutic regimens. Assisted reproductive techniques remain an option for patients with idiopathic male infertility; however, they are expensive and treat the female partner for a male problem. Multiple gestations and other complications are not infrequent. Initial management should be directed at improving the quality of semen to facilitate natural conception. Specific abnormalities should be corrected. If empiric pharmacologic therapy is to be used, treatment should last at least 3 to 6 months to incorporate a full 74-day spermatogenic cycle. The infertile couple should be advised of the inconsistent response to therapy and the low conception rate that may follow when compared with the results of ART. When empiric therapy is decided upon, antiestrogens may be used and are effective in a subset of patients. The authors prefer to use clomiphene citrate, 25 mg per day. The dose may be increased to 50 or 75 mg to raise testosterone levels to the upper normal range. Lack of a significant improvement in semen parameters or of a pregnancy after a 3- to 6-month treatment period may be an indication to proceed with ART.

Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of Clomiphene, tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors to optimise semen parameters in men with infertility. Future randomised trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of clomiphene in improving fertility outcomes in men.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations

The workup and treatment of candidates for clomiphene citrate therapy should be supervised by physicians experienced in management of gynecologic or endocrine disorders. Patients should be chosen for therapy with clomiphene citrate only after careful diagnostic evaluation (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). The plan of therapy should be outlined in advance. Impediments to achieving the goal of therapy must be excluded or adequately treated before beginning clomiphene citrate. The therapeutic objective should be balanced with potential risks and discussed with the patient and others involved in the achievement of a pregnancy.

Ovulation most often occurs from 5 to 10 days after a course of clomiphene citrate. Coitus should be timed to coincide with the expected time of ovulation. Appropriate tests to determine ovulation may be useful during this time.

Recommended Dosage

Treatment of the selected patient should begin with a low dose, 50 mg daily (1 tablet) for 5 days. The dose should be increased only in those patients who do not ovulate in response to cyclic 50 mg clomiphene citrate. A low dosage or duration of treatment course is particularly recommended if unusual sensitivity to pituitary gonadotropin is suspected, such as in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (see WARNINGS; Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome).

### On-label and off-label drugs used in the treatment of male infertility [^115WjMK2]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Infertility affects 6.1 million U.S. couples-representing 10% of reproductive-age adults and 15% of all couples trying to conceive. Half of the time, infertility is the result of an abnormal semen analysis or other male factors, with 40%-50% of these infertile men diagnosed with idiopathic or nonclassifiable infertility. While the role of hormone therapy for men with an identified abnormality is well defined, the literature remains inconclusive and controversial regarding hormone manipulation using empirical (off-label) medical therapies for men with idiopathic infertility. This manuscript reviews the commonly used off-label medications used to treat idiopathic male factor infertility: clomiphene citrate, letrozole/anastrozole, exogenous androgens, and pentoxifylline.

### Clomiphene citrate for unexplained subfertility in women [^111zmqyK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of clomiphene citrate has been demonstrated in the treatment of subfertility associated with infrequent or irregular ovulation. The physiologic effects and clinical benefits in ovulatory women with unexplained subfertility are less clear. The drug is associated with an increased risk of multiple pregnancy and a suggestion of potentially increased ovarian cancer risks. In light of these concerns, defining the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate for ovulatory women with unexplained subfertility is extremely important.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in improving pregnancy outcomes in women with unexplained subfertility, used in a dose range of 50 to 250 mg for up to 10 days. The primary outcome was live births.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (June 2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2009), EMBASE (1980 to June 2009) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Quasi-randomised designs were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Fourteen potentially relevant trials were identified of which seven were included in this review. All trials were assessed for risk of bias using standardised Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group methodology.

Main Results

Data relating to 1159 participants from seven trials were collated. There was no evidence that clomiphene citrate was more effective than no treatment or placebo for live birth (odds ratio (OR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.38; P = 0.41) or for clinical pregnancy per woman randomised both with intrauterine insemination (IUI) (OR 2.40, 95% CI 0.70 to 8.19; P = 0.16), without IUI (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.66; P = 0.91) and without IUI but using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 4.80; P = 0.35). It should be noted that heterogeneity between studies ranged from 34% to 58% using the I(2) statistic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of clinical benefit of clomiphene citrate for unexplained fertility. When making this treatment choice, potential side effects should be discussed. These include the increased risk of multiple pregnancy and the concern that use for more that 12 cycles has been associated with a three-fold increase in risk of ovarian cancer.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115tkeB2]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing physicians and others regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies for unexplained infertility.

Methods

ASRM conducted a literature search, which included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 1968 through 2019. The ASRM Practice Committee and a task force of experts used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Outcomes of interest included: live-birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate, fertilization rate, multiple pregnancy rate, dose of treatment, rate of ovarian hyperstimulation, abortion rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate.

Result(S)

The literature search identified 88 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline.

Recommendation(S)

Evidence-based recommendations were developed for the following treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: natural cycle with intrauterine insemination (IUI); clomiphene citrate with intercourse; aromatase inhibitors with intercourse; gonadotropins with intercourse; clomiphene citrate with IUI; aromatase inhibitors with IUI; combination of clomiphene citrate or letrozole and gonadotropins (low dose and conventional dose) with IUI; low-dose gonadotropins with IUI; conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI; timing of IUI; and in vitro fertilization and treatment paradigms.

Conclusion(S)

The treatment of unexplained infertility is by necessity empiric. For most couples, the best initial therapy is a course (typically 3 or 4 cycles) of ovarian stimulation with oral medications and intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) followed by in vitro fertilization for those unsuccessful with OS-IUI treatments.

### Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) [^111a4EwT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the hazard associated with occasional abnormal ovarian enlargement associated with clomiphene citrate therapy, the lowest dose consistent with expected clinical results should be used. Maximal enlargement of the ovary, whether physiologic or abnormal, may not occur until several days after discontinuation of the recommended dose of clomiphene citrate. Some patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who are unusually sensitive to gonadotropin may have an exaggerated response to usual doses of clomiphene citrate. Therefore, patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should be started on the lowest recommended dose and shortest treatment duration for the first course of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

If enlargement of the ovary occurs, additional clomiphene citrate therapy should not be given until the ovaries have returned to pretreatment size, and the dosage or duration of the next course should be reduced. Ovarian enlargement and cyst formation associated with clomiphene citrate therapy usually regress spontaneously within a few days or weeks after discontinuing treatment. The potential benefit of subsequent clomiphene citrate therapy in these cases should exceed the risk. Unless surgical indication for laparotomy exists, such cystic enlargement should always be managed conservatively.

A causal relationship between ovarian hyperstimulation and ovarian cancer has not been determined. However, because a correlation between ovarian cancer and nulliparity, infertility, and age has been suggested, if ovarian cysts do not regress spontaneously, a thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out the presence of ovarian neoplasia.

American Society for Reproductive Medicine guideline — objective, methods, outcomes, and scope: The objective is to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies for unexplained infertility. ASRM conducted a literature search including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and comparative observational studies published from 1968 through 2019, and the literature search identified 88 relevant studies to inform the evidence base. Outcomes of interest included live-birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate, fertilization rate, multiple pregnancy rate, dose of treatment, rate of ovarian hyperstimulation, abortion rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate. Evidence-based recommendations were developed for treatments including natural cycle with intrauterine insemination (IUI), clomiphene citrate with intercourse, aromatase inhibitors with intercourse, gonadotropins with intercourse, aromatase inhibitors with IUI, low-dose and conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, timing of IUI, and in vitro fertilization and treatment paradigms.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114dZ6gq]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Low-dose gonadotropins with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — in couples with unexplained infertility who have a good or intermediate prognosis for unassisted conception, there is fair evidence that treatment with low-dose gonadotropins with IUI is no more effective than 6 months of expectant management. There is no difference in multiple-pregnancy rates between clomiphene citrate or letrozole with IUI treatments compared to low-dose gonadotropins with IUI. It is not recommended to use low-dose gonadotropins with IUI in the treatment of unexplained infertility, as it is more complex and expensive, and likely no more effective than OS with oral medications with IUI (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

### Use of clomiphene citrate to reverse premature andropause secondary to steroid abuse [^1122nu6d]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of symptomatic hypogonadism induced by the abuse of multiple steroid preparations that was subsequently reversed by clomiphene.

Design

Case report.

Setting

University-affiliated andrology practice within family practice clinic.

Patient(S)

A 30-year-old male.

Intervention(S)

Clomiphene citrate, 100-mg challenge for 5 days, followed by treatment at same dose for 2 months.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical symptoms, androgen decline in aging male questionnaire, total T, FSH, LH.

Result(S)

Reversal of symptoms, normalization of T levels with LH surge, restoration of pituitary-gonadal axis.

Conclusion(S)

Clomiphene citrate is used typically in helping to restore fertility in females. This represents the first case report of the successful use of clomiphene to restore T levels and the pituitary-gonadal axis in a male patient. The axis was previously shut off with multiple anabolic steroid abuse.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115v6o5v]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with combination of clomiphene citrate or letrozole and gonadotropins — evidence across trials indicates mixed findings without consistent superiority of combinations over oral agents alone: This guideline includes six RCTs and six cohort studies assessing clomiphene plus low-dose gonadotropins with IUI versus letrozole with IUI or letrozole plus low-dose gonadotropins with IUI. One intermediate-quality RCT found no difference in live birth among clomiphene with IUI, low-dose FSH with IUI, or sequential clomiphene plus low-dose FSH with IUI (8.0%, 12.0%, and 13.6%, respectively) (P = NS). Three randomized trials suggested no difference in fecundity between clomiphene and low-dose gonadotropins with IUI compared to letrozole and low-dose gonadotropins with IUI, and one cohort study found higher pregnancy rates with clomiphene and gonadotropins than letrozole and gonadotropins, but not statistically significant. Conversely, one RCT reported higher clinical pregnancy rates per cycle with letrozole-IUI alone versus clomiphene plus low-dose hMG plus IUI (23/70, 32.8% vs. 10/70, 14.3%), but there was a high risk for bias in the randomization strategy.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^113qzYk4]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) for unexplained infertility — Ovarian stimulation (OS) with IUI is a mainstay of fertility treatment, and this guideline includes 19 randomized trials, 4 systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, and 3 cohort studies assessing clomiphene citrate with IUI. Two randomized trials versus expectant management showed benefit: in 201 couples treated over 3 cycles, live-birth rate was 31% vs. 9%, respectively, P = .0003, and a strict per-protocol analysis showed 24% vs. 7%, P = .05. An intermediate-quality randomized controlled trial found a higher pregnancy rate versus untreated cycles (9.7% vs. 3.3%, respectively, P = .049), although live-birth outcome by diagnosis was not reported.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^111GEXoo]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — oral agents and conventional-dose gonadotropins with intrauterine insemination (IUI): In a cohort study, clomiphene and conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI was superior to expectant management (pregnancy rate 34.7% vs. 8.9%, respectively, P < .001), but 16% of pregnancies following gonadotropin treatment were multiple-gestation pregnancies with two sets of triplets, and 3.7% developed moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Pregnancy rates per cycle were significantly higher with IVF-ICSI than with clomiphene plus gonadotropins and IUI (36.6% vs. 5.6% per cycle, respectively, P < .001). An RCT comparing clomiphene with low-dose recombinant FSH vs. low-dose menopausal gonadotropins with IUI found no difference in outcomes, including a live-birth rate of 14.4% vs. 12.6% (recombinant FSH vs. menopausal gonadotropins, respectively, P = NS). A cohort study similarly found no difference when comparing one dose (150 IU) of gonadotropins with IUI to the same protocol with 75–150 IU of hMG on days 5–9, and a quasi-randomized study across IUI, direct intraperitoneal insemination, and timed intercourse found similar per-cycle pregnancy rates with high multiple-pregnancy rates (30% of all pregnancies and 40% of all deliveries). Summary statements on this page include: "There is fair evidence that clomiphene citrate and conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI treatments are associated with higher pregnancy rates than expectant management". and "There is good evidence that clomiphene citrate with conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI treatments are associated with an increased risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy".

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116dfy6L]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this network meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy of available non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for men with infertility across a total of fourteen randomised/quasi-randomised trials. While clomiphene seems to outperform other treatment options to achieve an improvement in both semen parameters as well as biochemical outcomes, there was no significant improvement with its use compared to placebo. The use of several anti-oxidants seemed to not yield any significant difference alone or when combined with other active treatments (e.g. clomiphene and tamoxifen). The use of aromatase inhibitors may alter some hormonal function (namely LH), but this did not translate to improvement in semen parameters across included trials. Overall, none of the evaluated treatment options demonstrated efficacy across reported outcomes compared to placebo, and therefore, their clinical value remains uncertain.

### Clomiphene citrate in combination with gonadotropins for controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing in vitro fertilization [^111iuYSe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Gonadotropins are the most commonly used medication for controlled ovarian stimulation in in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, they are expensive, invasive and are associated with risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). With recent calls for patient friendly IVF, there has been an interest in the use of clomiphene citrate with or without gonadotropins to reduce the burden of injections. However, it is not known whether regimens using clomiphene are at least as effective as gonadotropins alone.

Objectives

To determine whether clomiphene citrate with gonadotropins (with or without mid-cycle antagonist) is more effective than gonadotropins with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists for controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment.

Search Methods

Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched March 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, first quarter), MEDLINE (1970 to March 2012), EMBASE (1985 to Mar 2012) and reference lists of articles. Relevant conference proceedings were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) were included. Live birth rate (LBR) per woman was the primary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials

Main Results

Fourteen studies were included in the review. Meta-analysis could be performed with the data of 12 included studies, with a total of 2536 participants. There was no evidence that clomiphene along with gonadotropins for IVF, with or without mid-cycle GnRH antagonist, differed from gonadotropins alone in GnRH agonist protocols in terms of live births (5 RCTs, 1079 women; OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.69 to1.24) or clinical pregnancy (11 RCTs, 1864 women; OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to1.33). This means that for a typical clinic with 23% LBR using a GnRH agonist regimen, switching to clomiphene protocols would be expected to result in LBRs between 16% and 26%. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of OHSS (5 RCTs, 1559 women; OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.52). This means that for a typical clinic with 3.5% prevalence of OHSS using a GnRH agonist regimen, switching to clomiphene citrate protocols would be expected to reduce the incidence to between 0.8% and 1.8%. The trials included in this review were very old and outcomes such as live births, multiple pregnancy, OHSS and miscarriages have not been reported by most studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence to indicate that clomiphene with gonadotropins (with or without GnRH antagonist) differed significantly from gonadotropins in GnRH agonist protocols for women undergoing IVF treatment, in terms of live births or pregnancy rates. Meanwhile, use of clomiphene led to a reduction in the incidence of OHSS. However, these results were based on data from a small number of underpowered randomised trials with few participants. Hence there was insufficient evidence to recommend use of clomiphene citrate in routine IVF practice. Larger trials with adequate power are required.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^116k2L8L]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse: Most investigations demonstrated no difference in pregnancy outcomes when clomiphene with timed intercourse was compared with placebo with timed intercourse or expectant management, including a 2018 high-quality RCT where the adjusted OR for live birth was 0.80 (0.45–1.42), P = .45. An older low-quality RCT suggested higher pregnancy rates with clomiphene and timed intercourse versus placebo, but differences were not statistically significant (10/76 vs. 4/72 over 4 treatment cycles). The evidence base noted here includes four RCTs and three systematic reviews of RCTs assessing clomiphene citrate with intercourse for unexplained infertility.

### Early pharmacologic approaches to avert anabolic steroid-induced male infertility: a narrative review [^116ktyxr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review the impact of testosterone and other androgenic-anabolic steroids (AASs) on male fertility, exploring potential drugs that can be used to preserve or restore male fertility upon AAS use or prior contact.

Methods

A review was performed to provide a unifying clinical link between drugs used to preserve or restore male fertility (ie, clomiphene citrate, human chorionic gonadotropin, selective estrogen receptor modulators, recombinant luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones, and human menopausal gonadotrophin) in the context of AAS-induced infertility and related aspects.

Findings

Human chorionic gonadotropin (125–500 IU every other day), clomiphene citrate (12.5–50 mg/d), recombinant luteinizing hormone (125–500 IU every other day), recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (75–150 IU 1–3×/wk), and human menopausal gonadotrophin (75–150 IU 1–3×/wk) are promising early pharmacologic approaches to avert AAS-induced male infertility. Additionally, a full partner assessment is crucial to the success of a couple planning to have children. The partner's age and gynecopathies must be considered. Egg or sperm cryopreservation can also be alternatives for future fertility. Reinforcing AAS cessation is imperative to achieving better success in misusers.

Implications

The exponential increase in AAS misuse raises concerns about the impact on male fertility. This review suggests that gonadotropin analogs and selective androgen receptor modulators (clomiphene citrate) are viable approaches to early preserve or restore fertility in men on AAS use or with previous contact. However, proper standardization of doses and combinations is required and hence physicians should also be aware of patients' and partners' fertility.

Clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — efficacy and guidance: There is strong evidence that clomiphene citrate with IUI is superior to expectant management and natural-cycle IUI for live-birth rate in couples with unexplained infertility. Multiple gestation pregnancy rates with clomiphene citrate with IUI treatment range from 0 to 12.5%. It is recommended to use clomiphene citrate with IUI in the treatment of couples with unexplained infertility (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^1168u6eJ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Clomiphene citrate therapy for hypogonadal males shows promising effect on both clinical symptoms and the biochemical testosterone insufficiency with few reported side effects and good safety aspects compared with TTh. Therefore, it is worth to be considered especially in males presenting with symptoms of hypogonadism and low testosterone who wish to preserve their testicular function and are not eligible for TTh. Low to normal LH at baseline seems to predict biochemical and clinical effectiveness. Further research with clear inclusion criteria, adequate measurement of hormonal levels and registration of symptoms and side effects is recommended.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^1116YprG]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — letrozole (aromatase inhibitor) with timed intercourse: In a high-quality randomized controlled trial including 996 patients, clinical pregnancy rate was no different between letrozole cycles with timed intercourse and medically unassisted age-matched controls (11.1% vs. 7.0%, respectively, P = NS), and letrozole showed no significant advantage over clomiphene citrate (11.1% letrozole vs. 12.1% clomiphene). Systematic reviews reported no difference in outcomes comparing letrozole to clomiphene, and an earlier trial showed equivalent pregnancy rates across doses 2.5 to 7.5 mg (pregnancy rate/cycle: 2.5 mg, 4.8%; 5 mg, 4.3%; 7.5 mg, 6.5%, P = NS). The summary statement concludes there is good evidence that letrozole with timed intercourse is no more effective than clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse or expectant management, and the recommendation states it is not recommended to use letrozole with timed intercourse as a treatment for unexplained infertility, as it is no more effective than expectant management (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

The summary statement states there is good evidence that clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse is no more effective than expectant management, and the guideline recommends it is not recommended to use clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse as a treatment for unexplained infertility, as it is no more effective than expectant management (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

### Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^111LoNGy]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Interpretation within context of setting and intervention

At the time this trial was conducted, the Cochrane review on clomifene citrate in unexplained infertility suggested that it had a beneficial effect and supported its use on grounds of low cost and ease of administration. Fertility guidelines in the UK and the United States endorsed this viewbut highlighted the need for a definitive trial. While both 100 mg and 50 mg of clomifene citrate have been used in previous trials, our decision to use the lower dose in this cohort of ovulatory women was guided by concerns about the risk of high order multiple pregnancy. The rationale for ovarian stimulation in women with documented ovulation has been to correct subtle disorders of ovulation not identified by conventional tests and to increase the number of oocytes per cycle. Yet, as an agonist-antagonist at the level of the oestrogen receptor, antioestrogenic effects of clomifene citrate on the endometrium, uterine blood flow, and quality of cervical mucus could affect its ability to enhance pregnancy rates. A recent placebo controlled trial with 140 women with unexplained infertility failed to show higher rates of live birth after treatment with 100 mg clomifene citrate.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115Yvz8z]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — conclusions emphasize limited roles for gonadotropins and a streamlined pathway to IVF: for most couples with unexplained infertility there is no role for OS with gonadotropins, with or without IUI. Pregnancy rates associated with these treatments are dose dependent, and meaningful improvements over outcomes seen with OS-IUI with oral medications are only achieved at doses associated with a high risk for multiple-gestation pregnancy. Together with compelling evidence that a strategy of 3 cycles of clomiphene citrate-IUI followed immediately by IVF results in a shorter time to pregnancy at lower cost than a strategy that includes an intervening gonadotropin-IUI course, gonadotropin-IUI cycles should be rare. While IVF is an effective treatment for unexplained infertility, it is also associated with risks of multiple-gestation pregnancy, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. Furthermore, it is cost prohibitive for many couples. There is a pressing need for investigations to evaluate treatments to bridge the gap between the effectiveness of IVF and the low (and unchanging) success rates associated with OS-IUI treatments with oral medications, and further research is needed regarding barriers to the access of treatments such as ART, including social, cultural, and economic factors.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115b9KpZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — gonadotropins with intercourse (descriptive context): Gonadotropins have a dose-dependent action on the ovaries, with greater doses resulting in the maturation of additional follicles, and ovulation induction with gonadotropins is considered more aggressive than with letrozole or clomiphene. The more potent action of gonadotropins compared with oral medications frequently results in the development of more ovulatory-sized follicles, which would be anticipated to increase pregnancy rates at the expense of an increase in the risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114Habr2]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Timing and number of intrauterine inseminations (IUI) — In cycles using hCG, one RCT found no difference in clinical pregnancy when IUI was performed simultaneously with hCG versus 34–36 hours after hCG (IUI simultaneously with hCG 12.2% vs. IUI 34–36 hours after hCG 9.4%, P = .523, OR 1.35, 95% CI .53–3.42), and another RCT reported higher live-birth per cycle at 36 hours than 24 hours (13.4% [31/231] vs. 7.8% [18/230]). Trials comparing single versus double IUI after OS reported no differences (12/95 [12.6%] vs. 9/43 [20.9%], P = .21; 23/195 [11.8%] vs. 21/204 [10.3%], P = .64; 26/247 [10.5%] vs. 29/243 [11.9%], P = .68), although one RCT (n = 273) found higher clinical pregnancy with double IUI using clomiphene 100 mg plus conventional-dose gonadotropins (21.9% vs. 10.9%, P < .05) and reported a high multiple-pregnancy rate (25.4%). Summary statements specify that there is fair evidence timing between 0 and 36 hours does not impact pregnancy rates, that live-birth following single IUI is not significantly different than double IUI with clomiphene citrate, and that evidence is insufficient that ultrasound timing improves outcomes compared to urinary LH monitoring in clomiphene citrate-IUI treatments.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of clomiphene citrate for the treatment of hypogonadism [^113err84]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clomiphene citrate may be used as an off label treatment of hypogonadism. There are few long-term data on clomiphene citrate efficacy and safety when administered for more than 3 years. We assessed improvements in testosterone and hypogonadal symptoms while on clomiphene citrate for extended periods.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective review to identify patients treated with clomiphene citrate for hypogonadism (baseline testosterone less than 300 ng/dl) at a total of 2 institutions from 2010 to 2018. We assessed the duration of clomiphene citrate therapy, serum testosterone levels, symptom improvement and clomiphene citrate side effects.

Results

A total of 400 patients underwent clomiphene citrate treatment for a mean ± SD of 25.5 ± 20.48 months (range 0 to 84). Of the patients 280 received clomiphene citrate for 3 years or less (mean 12.75 ± 9.52 months) and 120 received it for more than 3 years (mean 51.93 ± 10.52 months). Of men on clomiphene citrate for more than 3 years 88% achieved eugonadism, 77% reported improved symptoms and 8% reported side effects. Estradiol was significantly increased following clomiphene citrate treatment. Results did not significantly differ between patients treated for more than 3, or 3 or fewer years. The most common side effects reported by patients treated more than 3 years included changes in mood in 5, blurred vision in 3 and breast tenderness in 2. There was no significant adverse event in any patient treated with clomiphene citrate.

Conclusions

Clomiphene citrate is not typically offered as primary treatment of hypogonadism in men who do not desire fertility preservation. These data demonstrate that clomiphene citrate is safe and effective with few side effects when used as long-term treatment of hypogonadism.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111Gbvjr]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Male factor infertility affect up to 50% of couples unable to conceive spontaneously. Several non-hormonal pharmacological treatments have been proposed to boost spermatogenesis and increase chances of conception in men with infertility. Still, no clear evidence exists on the most effective treatment strategy.

Objective

We aimed to compare the effectiveness of non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for men with infertility using a systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL until October 2023 for randomised/quasi-randomised trials that evaluated any non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for men with idiopathic semen abnormalities or those with hypogonadism. We performed pairwise and network meta-analyses using a random effect model. We assessed risk of bias, heterogeneity, and network inconsistency. We calculated the mean rank and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each intervention the maximum likelihood to achieve each of reported outcomes. We reported primarily on sperm concentration and other important semen and biochemical outcomes using standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence-intervals(CI).

Results

We included 14 randomised trials evaluating four treatments (Clomiphene citrate, Tamoxifen, Aromatase inhibitors, anti-oxidants) and their combinations in 1342 men. The overall quality of included trials was low. Sperm concentration improved with clomiphene compared to anti-oxidants (SMD 2.15, 95%CI 0.78–3.52), aromatase inhibitor (SMD 2.93, 95%CI 1.23–4.62), tamoxifen (SMD − 1.96, 95%CI -3.57; -0.36) but not compared to placebo (SMD − 1.53, 95%CI -3.52–0.47). Clomiphene had the highest likelihood to achieve the maximum change in sperm concentration (SUCRA 97.4). All treatments showed similar effect for sperm motility, semen volume, and normal sperm morphology. FSH levels showed significant improvement with clomiphene vs.anti-oxidant (SMD 1.48, 95%CI 0.44–2.51) but not compared to placebo. The evidence networks for LH and testosterone suffered from significant inconsistency (p = 0.01) with similar trend of improvement with clomiphene compared to other treatments but not compared to placebo.

Conclusion

There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of Clomiphene, tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors to optimise semen parameters in men with infertility. Future randomised trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of clomiphene in improving fertility outcomes in men.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114q8rEB]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — comparative outcomes and guidance are as follows: Compared with natural-cycle IUI (live-birth rate 6.2%), adjusted live-birth rates were significantly higher with clomiphene (8.9%, RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.6), letrozole (9.4%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.7), and gonadotropins (9.5%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.8). Multiple-pregnancy rates were significantly higher with gonadotropins (4.6%, RR 6.2, 95% CI 2.1–18.3) and clomiphene (1.9%, RR 3.8, 95% CI 1.7–16.1) than natural cycles (0.7%), but not with letrozole (1.3%, RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.4–7.7). A systematic review of six randomized controlled trials (1,776 women) found clinical pregnancy rates not significantly different overall between letrozole (199/809 [24.5%]) and clomiphene (201/967 [20.8%], RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.89–1.80, P = .20; six studies; heterogeneity P = .01), with a subgroup showing higher rates with 2.5 mg letrozole versus 100 mg clomiphene (74/261, 28.4% vs 39/260, 15%; RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.31–2.60, P = .0004; no heterogeneity, P = .60), and another review reporting similar live birth (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.08), spontaneous miscarriage (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61–1.38), and twin gestation (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.39–1.68). One RCT using extended letrozole (2.5 mg from day 1–9) versus clomiphene (100 mg days 3–7) showed higher ongoing pregnancy with letrozole (35/106, 33%) than clomiphene (20/105, 19%) (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.11–3.95, P = .02). In a high-quality RCT of 900 couples, live birth was lower with letrozole and clomiphene versus gonadotropins (gonadotropins 32.2% [97/301]; letrozole 18.7% [56/299], P < .001; clomiphene 23.3% [70/300], P = .02), and multiple gestations among live births were highest with gonadotropins (gonadotropins 32% [31/97]; clomiphene 5.7% [4/70]; letrozole 14.3% [8/56]). There is strong evidence that there is no significant difference in pregnancy rates or multiple-gestation pregnancy rate following letrozole with IUI as compared to clomiphene citrate with IUI. It is recommended that letrozole with IUI treatments be considered as an alternative regimen for couples with unexplained infertility; of note, letrozole is not FDA approved for treatment of unexplained infertility, but is considered an effective and well tolerated option (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

In addition, patients selected for clomiphene citrate therapy should be evaluated in regard to the following:

Estrogen Levels. Patients should have adequate levels of endogenous estrogen (as estimated from vaginal smears, endometrial biopsy, assay of urinary estrogen, or from bleeding in response to progesterone). Reduced estrogen levels, while less favorable, do not preclude successful therapy.
Primary Pituitary or Ovarian Failure. Clomiphene citrate therapy cannot be expected to substitute for specific treatment of other causes of ovulatory failure.
Endometriosis and Endometrial Carcinoma. The incidence of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma increases with age as does the incidence of ovulatory disorders. Endometrial biopsy should always be performed prior to clomiphene citrate therapy in this population.
Other Impediments to Pregnancy. Impediments to pregnancy can include thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and male factor infertility.
Uterine Fibroids. Caution should be exercised when using clomiphene citrate in patients with uterine fibroids due to the potential for further enlargement of the fibroids.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male infertility. In addition, testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males using clomiphene. The cause and effect relationship between reports of testicular tumors and the administration of clomiphene citrate is not known.

Although the medical literature suggests various methods, there is no universally accepted standard regimen for combined therapy (i.e., clomiphene citrate in conjunction with other ovulation-inducing drugs). Similarly, there is no standard clomiphene citrate regimen for ovulation induction in vitro fertilization programs to produce ova for fertilization and reintroduction. Therefore, clomiphene citrate is not recommended for these uses.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism in men seeking to preserve fertility-what are the options? [^113eYZKn]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Male hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome that results in low testosterone levels and frequently leads to infertility. The syndrome occurs due to disruption at one or more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is the most common treatment utilised for male hypogonadism. However, long-acting forms of TRT leads to infertility and so is inappropriate for patients wishing to conceive. For patients who wish to remain fertile, nasal TRT, clomiphene citrate, exogenous gonadotropins, gonadotropin releasing hormone and aromatase inhibitors have been used as alternative treatment options with different degrees of success. A review of the literature was performed to identify the safety and efficacy of alternative treatment options. Gonadotropin releasing hormone can successfully induce spermatogenesis but is impractical to administer. Likewise, aromatase inhibitors have limited use due to inducing osteopenia. Nasal TRT may be a good treatment option for these patients, but its efficacy has so far only been demonstrated in small sample sizes. However, clomiphene citrate and exogenous gonadotropins are safe, offer good symptom control and can successfully induce fertility in hypogonadism patients.

Materials and methods

Participants

Women in 23 ~ 42 years old who had given their consent to ovarian stimulation for IVF-ET or ICSI-ET at this center from January 2017 to December 2018 were concluded. A total of 2724 cycles containing 1409 fresh transplantation cycles were obtained. The infertility years were 1 ~ 13 years. The causes of infertility included pelvic fallopian tube factors, male infertility, endometriosis, ovulation disorders and unexplained infertility. Poor responders were defined as patients whose basal antral follicle count (AFC) were less than five referring to the Bologna Criteria. We classified high responders as patients with 15 and more basal antral follicles, and normal responders as 5 ~ 14 basal antral follicles. The comparison of clinical induction protocols included GnRH-a super long protocol, GnRH-a long protocol, GnRH antagonist protocol, minimal stimulation protocol, natural cycle protocol and so on.

For all participants, outcomes including age, BMI, T-Gn, T-retrieved ova, high quality embryos, cultured blastocyst, blastocysts number, and primary clinical outcomes including clinical pregnancy rate and cumulative pregnancy rate between the two groups with or without oral medication were presented.

For high (n = 573), normal (n = 1215) and poor (n = 727) ovarian responders, the above laboratory and clinical indicators were presented respectively. Moreover, we also analyzed the differences between single CC (n = 604) and single LE (n = 112) additions in laboratory and clinical outcomes.

The occurrence rates in high and normal responders of moderate and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) were detected according to a modern classification.

Group

Conventional group: routine ovulation induction by Gn/HMG, no oral CC or LE. Add group: extra CC and/or LE combined with routine Gn/HMG. Each subgroup (high responder; poor responder; normal responder) was divided into Conventional group and Add group according to the same criteria.

Treatment procedure

In conventional group, the dosages (150 ~ 300 IU/d) of Gn were carried by routine dose according to the patients' age, primary disease, ovarian reserve, body mass index (BMI) and so on.

In add group, we started with CC (or LE), 50–100 mg/d × 5d (2.5 mg/d × 5d) since Day 2–5. The dosages (150 ~ 300 IU/d) of Gn were adjusted according to the patients' different conditions (starting dose, starting time, injection QD/QOD, etc.).

Surface under the cumulative ranking curve of changes in semen parameters following the use of non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options for male infertility. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve expressed in percentage. Higher values suggest higher likelihood of the treatment achieving the outcome of interest

All treatments showed similar effect for sperm motility compared to each other and placebo (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 5) with similar ranking likelihood and no significant network inconsistency (p = 0.97) (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 5). Similarly, no significant difference was noted across all treatments for changes in semen volume (Supplementary Fig. 6) with both clomiphene (SUCRA 67.9) and Aromatase-inhibitor (SUCRA 60.1) showing greatest likelihood of achieving an improvement in semen volume (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 6).

Both clomiphene (SMD 3.01 95%CI 0.55 to 5.47) and placebo (SMD 1.77 95%CI 0.30 to 3.25) showed a significant improvement in normal sperm morphology compared to anti-oxidants with no other significant effect for any of the remaining treatment options (Supplementary Fig. 7). However, clomiphene had a higher rank (SUCRA 92.6) compared to placebo (SUCRA 73.6) in achieving a greater improvement in sperm normal morphology. This network did not suffer from significant inconsistency (p = 0.76) (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 7).

### WITHDRAWN: clomiphene or tamoxifen for idiopathic oligo / asthenospermia [^113qEfHe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Oligo-astheno-teratospermia (sperm of low concentration, reduced motility and increased abnormal morphology) of unknown cause is common and the need for treatment is felt by patients and doctors alike. As a result, a variety of empirical, non-specific treatments have been used in an attempt to improve semen characteristics and fertility. The administration of anti-oestrogens is a common treatment because anti oestrogens interfere with the normal negative feedback of sex steroids at hypothalamic and pituitary levels in order to increase endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion directly from the pituitary. In turn, FSH and LH stimulate Leydig cells in the testes, and this has been claimed to lead to increased local testosterone production, thereby boosting spermatogenesis with a possible improvement in fertility. There may also be a direct effect of anti-oestrogens on testicular spermatogenesis or steroidogenesis. This review considers the available evidence of the effect of both Clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen, both of which have a predominant anti-oestrogenic effect, for idiopathic oligo and/or asthenospermia.

Objectives

The objective was to assess the effects of treating subfertile men with anti-oestrogens (clomiphene or tamoxifen) on pregnancy rates among couples where subfertility has been attributed to idiopathic oligo- and/or asthenospermia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Subfertility Review Group specialised register of controlled trials was searched".

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of anti-oestrogen therapy for 3 months or more compared to placebo or no placebo for subfertile males among couples where subfertility is attributed to male factor.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Any differences were resolved with a third reviewer.

Main Results

Ten studies involving 738 men were included. Five of the trials did not specify method of randomisation. Anti-oestrogens had a positive effect on endocrinal outcomes, such as serum testosterone levels. In trials with secure randomisation there was no difference in the pregnancy rate between the anti-oestrogen groups and the control groups (odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.56). The overall pregnancy rate for these five trials was 15.4% compared to the spontaneous rate of 12.5% in the control groups. These odds increased to 1.56 (95% confidence interval 0.99 to 2.19) when all 10 trials were included, but this result is likely to be artificially inflated.

Authors' Conclusions

Anti-oestrogens appear to have a beneficial effect on endocrinal outcomes, but there is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of anti-oestrogens for increasing the fertility of males with idiopathic oligo-asthenospermia.[This abstract was prepared centrally.].

### Clomiphene citrtae (clomiphene citrate) [^113tdg6Z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, patients selected for clomiphene citrate therapy should be evaluated in regard to the following:

Estrogen Levels. Patients should have adequate levels of endogenous estrogen (as estimated from vaginal smears, endometrial biopsy, assay of urinary estrogen, or from bleeding in response to progesterone). Reduced estrogen levels, while less favorable, do not preclude successful therapy.
Primary Pituitary or Ovarian Failure. Clomiphene citrate therapy cannot be expected to substitute for specific treatment of other causes of ovulatory failure.
Endometriosis and Endometrial Carcinoma. The incidence of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma increases with age as does the incidence of ovulatory disorders. Endometrial biopsy should always be performed prior to clomiphene citrate therapy in this population.
Other Impediments to Pregnancy. Impediments to pregnancy can include thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and male factor infertility.
Uterine Fibroids. Caution should be exercised when using clomiphene citrate in patients with uterine fibroids due to the potential for further enlargement of the fibroids.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male infertility. In addition, testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males using clomiphene. The cause and effect relationship between reports of testicular tumors and the administration of clomiphene citrate is not known.

Although the medical literature suggests various methods, there is no universally accepted standard regimen for combined therapy (i.e., clomiphene citrate in conjunction with other ovulation-inducing drugs). Similarly, there is no standard clomiphene citrate regimen for ovulation induction in in vitro fertilization programs to produce ova for fertilization and reintroduction. Therefore, clomiphene citrate is not recommended for these uses.

### The treatment of hypogonadism in men of reproductive age [^1161uZrP]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the mechanisms of T replacement therapy's inhibition of spermatogenesis and current therapeutic approaches in reproductive aged men.

Design

Review of published literature.

Setting

PubMed search from 1990–2012.

Patient(S)

PubMed search from 1990–2012.

Intervention(S)

A literature review was performed.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Semen analysis and pregnancy outcomes, time to recovery of spermatogenesis, serum and intratesticular T levels.

Result(S)

Exogenous T suppresses intratesticular T production, which is an absolute prerequisite for normal spermatogenesis. Therapies that protect the testis involve hCG therapy or selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators, but may also include low-dose hCG with exogenous T. Off-label use of selective ER modulators, such as clomiphene citrate (CC), are effective for maintaining T production long term and offer the convenience of representing a safe, oral therapy. At present, routine use of aromatase inhibitors is not recommended based on a lack of long-term data.

Conclusion(S)

Exogenous T supplementation decreases sperm production. Studies of hormonal contraception indicate that most men have a return of normal sperm production within 1 year after discontinuation. Clomiphene citrate is a safe and effective therapy for men who desire to maintain future potential fertility. Although less frequently used in the general population, hCG therapy with or without T supplementation represents an alternative treatment.

### Mild ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate launch is a realistic option for in vitro fertilization [^117FunD4]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To validate the use of clomiphene citrate in IVF when mild stimulation approaches are chosen to reduce patient discomfort, risk, and cost.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Private IVF clinic.

Patient(S)

A total of 163 patients undergoing IVF and with a good prognosis (defined as ≤ 38 years old with normal ovarian reserve and normovulatory cycles, body mass index < 29 kg/m(2), no previous assisted reproductive technology cycles, no severe endometriosis, no history of recurrent miscarriage, no endocrine/autoimmune diseases, and no surgical semen extraction).

Intervention(S)

Mild stimulation using a fixed protocol of clomiphene citrate (100 mg/d from cycle days 3 to 7) in combination with low doses of gonadotropins (150 IU of recombinant FSH on cycle days 5, 7, and 9) and GnRH antagonist.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The cumulative delivery rate per patient after three fresh and/or frozen embryo transfers and time to pregnancy.

Result(S)

No dropouts were observed. The cumulative delivery rate was 70%, and the mean time to pregnancy was 2.4 months.

Conclusion(S)

Mild stimulation using clomiphene citrate in combination with low doses of gonadotropins can be considered a realistic option for good-prognosis patients undergoing IVF.

### Combination clomiphene citrate and antioxidant therapy for idiopathic male infertility: a randomized controlled trial [^116HvZCq]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of treatment with a combination of clomiphene citrate as an antiestrogen and vitamin E as an antioxidant on the incidence of pregnancy and sperm variables in men with idiopathic oligozoospermia and infertility.

Design

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

The outpatient andrology clinic at a university hospital.

Patient(S)

Sixty infertile men with idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia.

Intervention(S)

Patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: a group receiving the combination of clomiphene citrate (25 mg/day) and vitamin E (400 mg/day; n = 30) against a placebo group (n = 30). Treatment was maintained for 6 months.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy incidence and variations in semen parameters.

Result(S)

A significantly higher pregnancy rate was found among the combination treatment group in comparison to the control group. The odds ratio was 3.76 and the 95% confidence interval was 1.03–13.64, with a 36.7% pregnancy rate (11/30) in the combination treatment group compared with 13.3% pregnancy rate (4/30) in the control group. The trial showed a significantly higher increase in sperm count and progressive sperm motility with nonsignificant changes in total sperm motility, percentage of abnormal forms and semen volume in the combination treatment group as compared to the control group.

Conclusion(S)

The combination of clomiphene citrate as an antiestrogen and vitamin E as an antioxidant can significantly increase the pregnancy rate and improve sperm count and progressive sperm motility in cases of idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^116fE5Yc]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with low-dose gonadotropins — comparative effectiveness and cost: IUI with low-dose gonadotropins (< 150 IU daily) has been compared with several strategies in unexplained infertility, with mixed results. Two randomized controlled trials showed that expectant management resulted in similar pregnancy rates and similar time to pregnancy compared to IUI with low-dose gonadotropins, and a cost analysis found a significantly higher cost per ongoing pregnancy compared with 6 months of expectant management. One randomized trial showed no difference between natural-cycle IUI and low-dose FSH with IUI up to 6 cycles (23.7% vs. 31.0%, respectively, P = .17). When IUI with low-dose gonadotropins was compared to timed intercourse using the same stimulation, one small RCT of 46 couples favored IUI (25.7% and 8.9%, respectively, P < .05), whereas a second small RCT (n = 48) showed no difference. Across seven randomized trials versus clomiphene citrate with IUI, three trials favored gonadotropins and four showed no difference, and the multiple-pregnancy rate was not significantly different across these studies. One RCT and one cohort study comparing low-dose gonadotropins plus IUI to letrozole plus IUI also demonstrated no significant differences in pregnancy or multiple-pregnancy rates. Summary statement: "There is insufficient evidence that treatment with low-dose gonadotropins with IUI is associated with a higher pregnancy rate than clomiphene citrate or letrozole with IUI".

### Anastrozole vs. clomiphene citrate in infertile women with ovulatory dysfunction: a phase II, randomized, dose-finding study [^114kpUAE]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine an effective multiple-dose regimen of anastrozole compared with clomiphene citrate (CC) to induce follicular growth and ovulation in infertile women with ovulatory dysfunction.

Design

Phase II, prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, dose-finding, noninferiority study.

Setting

Outpatient.

Patient(S)

Infertile women (n = 271) with ovulatory dysfunction, aged 18–40 years, with body mass index < 37 kg/m(2).

Intervention(S)

Five days of anastrozole at 1, 5, or 10 mg/d or CC at 50 mg/d.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The primary endpoint was the ovulation rate (mid-luteal phase serum P level ≥ 10 ng/mL or clinical pregnancy) in the first treatment cycle (cycle 1).

Result(S)

In cycle 1 the ovulation rates for anastrozole at 1, 5, and 10 mg/d were 30.4% (n = 24), 36.8% (n = 28), and 35.9% (n = 14), respectively, compared with 64.9% (n = 50) for CC at 50 mg/d. In up to three cycles of treatment, cumulative ovulation rates did not differ between groups. No cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were reported, and both anastrozole and CC were well tolerated.

Conclusion(S)

In terms of ovulation rates, 5-day anastrozole at 1, 5, and 10 mg/d was less effective than CC at 50 mg/d for cycle 1 (noninferiority was not shown).

### The safety and efficacy of clomiphene citrate in hypoandrogenic and subfertile men [^1119Eqhd]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2015). Low credibility.

Our objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of clomiphene citrate (CC) in infertile and hypoandrogenic men through a retrospective study between September 2013 and May 2014. We identified 47 men between 18 and 55 years placed on 50mg CC every other day. We evaluated the effect of CC on testosterone after 2 weeks, rates of adverse effects and predictors of CC response. Mean baseline testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and estradiol were 246.8ngdl(-1), 125.5ngdl(-1) and 20.8pgdl(-1), respectively. At 2 weeks, mean testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and estradiol increased to 527.6ngdl(-1), 281.8ngdl(-1) and 32.0pgdl(-1) (all P < 0.001). Two patients at 2 weeks and one patient at 3 months had a paradoxical decrease in testosterone. Mean total motile count (TMC) and concentration increased from 59.7 million (s.e.m.: 16.5) and 50.7 millionsml(-1) (s.e.m.: 11.1) at baseline to 90.9 million (s.e.m.: 25.9) and 72.5millionsml(-1) (s.e.m.: 17.5), respectively, at 3 months, although this was nonsignificant (P = 0.09, 0.09). No patient on CC experienced a paradoxical decrease in TMC or sperm concentration. On age-adjusted regression analysis, age, BMI, longitudinal testis axis, baseline follicle-stimulating hormone, LH and estradiol did not correlate with improvement in bioavailable testosterone at 2 weeks. CC improves testosterone and may improve semen parameters, although a small percentage of men may not demonstrate improvement in testosterone.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116ksMPB]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Empirical pharmacological treatment for men with hypogonadism and/or idiopathic infertility have featured in the medical literature for more than five decades, however, evidence on effective and safe treatment strategy remains inconclusive. In contrast to previously published pairwise meta-analysis of observational and randomised evidence, our network meta-analysis showed limited efficacy for all evaluated treatment options over placebo. The decision to start such treatments depends on the underpinning cause of infertility, patient characteristics, and overall treatment objectives.

Most of the included trials evaluated these treatments in men with idiopathic infertility. However, it is important to distinguish the perceived benefit among men with hypogonadism compared to those with normal testosterone levels. Specifically, men with a reduced testosterone/estradiol ratio may see more benefit associated with clomiphene and aromatase inhibitor therapy. Similarly, men with high BMI or advanced age may also demonstrate more benefit following SERMs/AIs therapy compared to those with no other predisposing factors.

The magnitude of benefit may also vary depending on the degree of semen abnormality. While most of the included trial in our review demonstrated some improvement in sperm concentration, the magnitude of changes was smaller among men with very low sperm count. Due to limited reporting, were unable to further explore the mechanistic effect of evaluated treatment on varied semen abnormalities (e.g. low vs. very low sperm count).

The desired benefit should, therefore, be considered within the overall treatment strategy. Adopting non-hormonal pharmacological treatments could help to boost the chances of natural conception in couple with mild male factor infertility. It could also be adopted as intermediate treatment to increase the chances of surgically retrieving good quality sperm in men with very low sperm count and maximise the chance of conception with assisted conception.

Finally, most of the included trials introduced the treatment for a short period of time (3–6 months) with limited reporting on longterm clinical and reproductive outcomes. Both SERMS and AI are well tolerated with limited profile of side effects, however, careful monitoring and surveillance is recommended for prolonged use beyond what is reported in our meta-analysis.

### Clomiphene citrtae (clomiphene citrate) [^116J7rJJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolism Disorders: Cases of hypertriglyceridemia have been reported. Preexisting or family history of hyperlipidemia and use of higher than recommended dose and/or longer duration of treatment with clomiphene citrate are associated with a risk of hypertriglyceridemia. Periodic monitoring of plasma triglycerides is recommended in patients with preexisting or family history of hyperlipidemia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Pretreatment screening of triglyceride levels is recommended in patients initiating clomiphene citrate therapy.

Gastrointestinal Disorders: Cases of pancreatitis have been reported.

Multiple Pregnancy: Inform the patient that there is an increased chance of multiple pregnancy, including bilateral tubal pregnancy and coexisting tubal and intrauterine pregnancy, when conception occurs in relation to clomiphene citrate therapy. The potential complications and hazards of multiple pregnancy should be explained.

Spontaneous Abortion and Congenital Anomalies: Inform the patient that the available data suggest no increase in the rates of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or congenital anomalies with maternal clomiphene citrate use compared to rates in the general population.

During clinical investigation, the experience from patients with known pregnancy outcome (Table 1) shows a spontaneous abortion rate of 20.4% and stillbirth rate of 1.0%. (See CLINICAL STUDIES). Among the birth anomalies spontaneously reported as individual cases since commercial availability of clomiphene citrate, the proportion of neural tube defects has been high among pregnancies associated with ovulation induced by clomiphene citrate, but this has not been supported by data from population-based studies.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drug Interactions

Drug interactions with clomiphene citrate have not been documented.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term toxicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of clomiphene citrate.

Oral administration of clomiphene citrate to male rats at doses of 0.3 or 1 mg/kg/day caused decreased fertility, while higher doses caused temporary infertility. Oral doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day in female rats temporarily interrupted the normal cyclic vaginal smear pattern and prevented conception.

Doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day slightly reduced the number of ovulated ova and corpora lutea, while 3 mg/kg/day inhibited ovulation.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115wLFAM]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Infertility is a common disease affecting 8–12% of the world's population with 1 in 7 heterosexual couples seeking fertility treatments. Male factor infertility defined by abnormal semen parameters affects up to 50% of couples (either as sole factor in 20% or joint male/female in 30% of cases). The commonest presentation for male infertility is with a combination of reduced sperm concentration, poor sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology all of which correlate with reduced ability for natural conception. Male infertility and abnormal spermatogenesis have been attributed to several causes including genetic disorders, environmental factors, chronic illness and neoplasm. Still, more than half of all cases are considered idiopathic or are attributed to subclinical hypogonadism. While common, effective medical treatments for men with hypogonadism or idiopathic infertility remains limited with an over reliance on the use of expensive assisted reproductive technology.

Inadequate stimulation of the testes through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis commonly results in impaired testicular function and abnormal spermatogenesis. Interventions aimed at boosting testicular function could help to resolve male infertility, increase the chances of natural conception, and reduce the need for assisted conception.

Several pharmacological hormonal and non-hormonal interventions have been proposed to boost spermatogenesis. Specifically, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g. Clomiphene citrate and Tamoxifen) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (e.g. letrozole and anastrozole) are commonly used as off-license treatments for men with idiopathic infertility. Several interventional and observational studies suggested an improvement by using these non-hormonal treatments to increase sperm concentration and circulating Testosterone. However, current evidence remains limited to pair-wise comparisons across studies with varied methodological limitations.

We aimed to leverage both direct and mixed evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of these non-hormonal pharmacological treatment options compared to placebo and to each other in a systematic review and network meta-analysis.

### Clomiphene citrate effects on testosterone / estrogen ratio in male hypogonadism [^112KWwjx]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

Symptomatic late-onset hypogonadism is associated not only with a decline in serum testosterone, but also with a rise in serum estradiol. These endocrine changes negatively affect libido, sexual function, mood, behavior, lean body mass, and bone density. Currently, the most common treatment is exogenous testosterone therapy. This treatment can be associated with skin irritation, gynecomastia, nipple tenderness, testicular atrophy, and decline in sperm counts. In this study we investigated the efficacy of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of hypogonadism with the objectives of raising endogenous serum testosterone (T) and improving the testosterone/estrogen (T/E) ratio.

Methods

Our cohort consisted of 36 Caucasian men with hypogonadism defined as serum testosterone level less than 300 ng/dL. Each patient was treated with a daily dose of 25 mg clomiphene citrate and followed prospectively. Analysis of baseline and follow-up serum levels of testosterone and estradiol levels were performed.

Results

The mean age was 39 years, and the mean pretreatment testosterone and estrogen levels were 247.6 ± 39.8 ng/dL and 32.3 ± 10.9, respectively. By the first follow-up visit (4–6 weeks), the mean testosterone level rose to 610.0 ± 178.6 ng/dL (P < 0.00001). Moreover, the T/E ratio improved from 8.7 to 14.2 (P < 0.001). There were no side effects reported by the patients.

Conclusions

Low dose clomiphene citrate is effective in elevating serum testosterone levels and improving the testosterone/estradiol ratio in men with hypogonadism. This therapy represents an alternative to testosterone therapy by stimulating the endogenous androgen production pathway.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^115TzjwF]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Male hypogonadism is a biochemical and clinical testosterone deficiency syndrome with a prevalence of symptomatic hypogonadism ranging between 2.1% and 5.7% in males aged above 30 years of age.,

Prevalence increases with age and certain comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity and malignancies. Decreased libido, lack of energy, mood changes, decreased muscle mass, and erectile dysfunction are common hypogonadal symptoms. Testosterone therapy (TTh) is the treatment of first choice for male hypogonadism. However, exogenous testosterone leads to negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis, causing suppression of endogenous testosterone production and spermatogenesis. Other side effects are, changed lipid serum, polycythaemia and gynecomastia.

Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off‐label pharmacological treatment for a certain group of males with hypogonadism. CC is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, occupying oestrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to increased secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and so, stimulating testicular endogenous testosterone production and preserving spermatogenesis.

Since the 1960s, CC has been often used for ovulation induction in females. For males, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not approve the medicine with reason of unclear clinical effect because of the lack of well‐controlled and well‐powered controlled trials. However, CC is described over more than 30 years off‐label to hypogonadal men, especially those with an active or future child wish, or hypogonadal males who do not want to use TTh. Compared to TTh, CC is easy in usage and comes with little costs. For example, in our country, costs of CC are about 12 times lower than regular TTh.

To support the outcomes in the scarce literature on the efficacy of CC therapy, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC therapy for male hypogonadism.

### Use of micro-dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) after clomiphene citrate (CC) to complete folliculogenesis in previous CC-resistant anovulation [^112Go6Z3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of low-dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the late follicular phase to induce ovulation and its endocrine response in patients who had previously failed to ovulate on clomiphene citrate (CC) alone.

Design

A total of 67 patients from a private tertiary infertility clinic, who had produced a dominant follicle 12 mm or larger but 20 mm or smaller on a prior CC cycle at 100 mg but had failed to ovulate, were prospectively randomly assigned to groups. Group 1 repeated the 100 mg dose of CC but started a 200 IU hCG intramuscular injection daily when the largest follicle was 12 mm or larger mean diameter. Group 2 received a 150 mg dose of CC and both groups were monitored with transvaginal ultrasound and serum levels of E 2, P 4, and testosterone. Ultrasound measurements of follicle number and growth, ovulation, pregnancy rates, and serum hormonal levels were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. Analysis of variance and Student t test were used for statistical significance.

Results

The low-dose hCG group had significantly higher percentage of ovulatory cycles (57% vs 7% P < .001), peak E 2 levels (378 pg/mL vs 125 pg/mL P < .01), and pregnancy rates (18% vs 0% P < .001). This group showed no evidence of premature leutinization from the hCG with preovulatory P 4 levels less than 1.0 ng/mL and a slight increase in androgen levels.

Conclusion

The use of micro-dose hCG after CC in the late follicular phase results in continued follicle growth, increased E 2 levels, ovulation, and pregnancies. This treatment offers an efficient and cost-effective alternative before gonadotropin therapy for this type of patient.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114ZNuQu]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — recommendations for IUI, OS, oral agents, and gonadotropins are as follows: It is not recommended to perform IUI in natural cycles for the treatment of unexplained infertility. It is less effective than OS with IUI and likely no more effective than expectant management. (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) It is not recommended to use clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse as a treatment for unexplained infertility, as it is no more effective than expectant management. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) It is not recommended to use letrozole with timed intercourse as a treatment for unexplained infertility, as it is no more effective than expectant management. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) It is not recommended to use gonadotropins with timed intercourse in the treatment of unexplained infertility. Studies report either no difference in pregnancy outcomes compared to OS with oral agents or higher pregnancy rates associated with a higher risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) It is recommended to use clomiphene citrate with IUI in the treatment of couples with unexplained infertility. (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) It is recommended that letrozole with IUI treatments be considered as an alternative regimen for couples with unexplained infertility, as studies to date suggest similar efficacy. Of note, letrozole is not FDA approved for treatment of unexplained infertility but is considered an effective and well tolerated option. (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) It is not recommended to use letrozole or clomiphene citrate plus conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, as most studies associated with improved pregnancy rate over OS-IUI with oral medications are also associated with an increased risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) It is not recommended to use low-dose gonadotropins with IUI in the treatment of unexplained infertility, as it is more complex and expensive, and likely no more effective than OS with oral medications with IUI.

### What is the mechanism of poor endometrial proliferation in patients with unexplained infertility after clomiphene citrate treatment? [^1179ZsSa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Infertility is defined as an absence of conception despite 12 months of regular unprotected intercourse. It is a very common condition and estimated to affect 10% to 15% of couples worldwide. In some cases, there are specific underlying etiologies such as anovulation, endometriosis, adenomyosis, low ovarian reserve, poor sperm quality, or ovarian and uterine tract pathology; however, in ~10% to 30% of infertility cases, etiology remains unknown. Unexplained infertility is a diagnosis of exclusion, which requires a detailed and comprehensive evaluation to exclude other possible underlying pathologies. The prevalence of unexplained infertility varies based on which criteria are used by clinicians for diagnosis. It is likely to be higher in countries with limited resources due to restricted access to diagnostic tools.

In recent years, clinicians have been using various therapies, including expectant observation, ovarian stimulation with oral agents or gonadotropins, intrauterine insemination, and in vitro fertilization with and without intracytoplasmic sperm injection to treat unexplained infertility. However, all of these approaches are empirical because there are no identifiable treatable causes for unexplained infertility. One of the most widely used treatment options for ovarian stimulation is clomiphene citrate, which acts as a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator. It has been used widely as a first-line oral treatment option to induce ovulation for more than 40 years with minimal side effects.

A critical estrogen level is essential in regulating uterine receptivity, and inadequate estrogen action may lead to implantation failure. Clomiphene citrate has antiestrogenic effects on the endometrium, which may cause decreased endometrial proliferation and delayed glandular growth. Because adherence of the embryo is one of the most critical steps in fertility, failure in the adherence may lead to poor pregnancy rates among those cases. To avoid this adverse effect of clomiphene citrate, physicians considered using alternative treatments such as letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor that has no ER antagonism nor antiestrogenic effects, such as thin endometrium and poor cervical mucus. However, there is still limited clinical evidence showing its superiority to clomiphene in those patients with suboptimal endometrial thickness.

Furthermore, Von Wolff et al. showed an association between lower pregnancy rates and thin endometrium among women undergoing unstimulated cycles for the first time. This study suggested considering thin endometrium as an independent prognostic factor for pregnancy success. The authors indicated that there might be structural differences in these women's endometrium, and those changes may contribute to suboptimal endometrial thickness.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^114T1LiJ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypogonadism is a worldwide problem among men causing sexual, physical and mental problems. Testosterone therapy is the first-choice treatment for male hypogonadism, with several side effects, that is, subfertility. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off-label therapy for a certain group of hypogonadal males, especially for those with an active or future child wish. There is scarce literature in usage of CC for men with hypogonadism. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC for hypogonadal males.

Methods

In this single-centre study, men treated with CC for hypogonadism were evaluated retrospectively. Primary outcome was hormonal evaluation including total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Secondary outcomes were hypogonadal symptoms, metabolic and lipid parameters, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), prostate specific antigen (PSA), side effects, the effect of a trial without medication and potential predictors for biochemical and clinical response.

Results

In total, 153 hypogonadal men were treated with CC. Mean TT, FT, LH and FSH increased during treatment. TT increased from 9 to 16nmol/L, with a biochemical increase in 89% of the patients. In patients who continued CC treatment, an increased level of TT persisted after 8years of treatment. With CC treatment, 74% of the patients experienced hypogonadal symptom improvement. LH at the lower normal range before CC treatment was predictive for better TT response. During CC therapy, few side effects were reported and no clinical important changes in PSA, Hb and Ht were found.

Conclusion

Clomiphene citrate is an effective therapy on short and long term, improving both clinical symptoms and biochemical markers of male hypogonadism with few side effects and good safety aspects.

### Clomiphene citrate (miloPhene) [^117TkS2t]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolism Disorders: Cases of hypertriglyceridemia have been reported. Preexisting or family history of hyperlipidemia and use of higher than recommended dose and/or longer duration of treatment with clomiphene citrate are associated with a risk of hypertriglyceridemia. Periodic monitoring of plasma triglycerides is recommended in patients with preexisting or family history of hyperlipidemia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Pretreatment screening of triglyceride levels is recommended in patients initiating clomiphene therapy.

Gastrointestinal Disorders: Cases of pancreatitis have been reported.

Multiple Pregnancy: Inform the patient that there is an increased chance of multiple pregnancy, including bilateral tubal pregnancy and coexisting tubal and intrauterine pregnancy, when conception occurs in relation to clomiphene citrate therapy. The potential complications and hazards of multiple pregnancy should be explained.

Spontaneous Abortion and Congenital Anomalies: Inform the patient that the available data suggest no increase in the rates of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or congenital anomalies with maternal clomiphene citrate use compared to rates in the general population.

During clinical investigation, the experience from patients with known pregnancy outcome (Table 1) shows a spontaneous abortion rate of 20.4% and stillbirth rate of 1.0%. (See CLINICAL STUDIES). Among the birth anomalies spontaneously reported as individual cases since commercial availability of clomiphene citrate, the proportion of neural tube defects has been high among pregnancies associated with ovulation induced by clomiphene citrate, but this has not been supported by data from population-based studies.

Drug Interactions

Drug interactions with clomiphene citrate have not been documented.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term toxicity studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of clomiphene citrate.

Oral administration of clomiphene citrate to male rats at doses of 0.3 or 1 mg/kg/day caused decreased fertility, while higher doses caused temporary infertility. Oral doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day in female rats temporarily interrupted the normal cyclic vaginal smear pattern and prevented conception. Doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day slightly reduced the number of ovulated ova and corpora lutea, while 3 mg/kg/day inhibited ovulation.

### Does the additional use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole for in vitro fertilization deserve more attention? [^114UhhRp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Adding clomiphene citrate (CC) and/or letrozole (LE) to in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles for mild ovarian stimulation is a general approach. Although lots of researches have demonstrated partial benefits of the strategy, all-around effects of oral medications remained deficient. This paper aims to assess whether an addition of oral medication will result in considerable outcomes on T-Gn (total dose of gonadotropin), Gn days, total retrieved ova, high quality embryos, blastocyst number, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rate, clinical pregnancy rate and cumulative pregnancy rate, even if it was not conventional mild/minimal stimulations.

Results

Participants were categorized to three diverse populations as high responders, normal responders and poor responders according to basal antral follicle count. T-Gn in patients treated with CC/LE distinctly decreased from 2496.96 IU/d to 1827.68 IU/d, from 2860.28 IU/d to 2119.99 IU/d, and from 3182.15 IU/d to 1802.84 IU/d, respectively. For high ovary responders and normal responders, the OHSS incidence rate also declined from 29.2 to 4.3% (P < 0.001) and from 1.1 to 0.0% (P = 0.090). Other, there was no statistical difference with respect to the T-retrieved ova (total retrieved ova), high quality embryos, cultured blastocyst and blastocyst number in high responders. For normal responders and poor ovary responders, T-Gn, Gn days, T-retrieved ova, high quality embryos, cultured blastocyst and blastocysts number in oral medications group all apparently decreased. Clinical pregnancy rate per fresh cycle of poor responders with prior oral medications was significantly decreased (25.7% vs. 50.8%, P = 0.005), and no significant differences in high responders and normal responders were expressed (52.5% vs. 44.2%, P = 0.310; 51.9% vs. 42.4%, P = 0.163) between two groups of participants. The numbers of cumulative pregnancy rates were lower in the conventional group compared to the add group for high (75.90% versus 81.03%, P = 0.279), normal (62.69% versus 71.36%, P = 0.016) and poor (39.74% versus 68.21%, P < 0.001) responders.

Conclusions

The addition of CC/LE to the ovulation induction during IVF has certain efficacy in terms of low cost, low OHSS incidence. CC/LE deserves more recommendations as a responsible strategy in high responders due to advantageous pregnancy outcomes. For normal responders, the strategy needs to be considered with more comprehensive factors.

### Pharmacological non-hormonal treatment options for male infertility: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113dEZLB]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biochemical outcomes

There was limited reporting for other planned secondary outcomes and a direct pairwise meta-analysis was not possible for any of the reported biochemical outcomes.

Network meta-analysis for changes in FSH levels showed significant improvement with clomiphene vs. anti-oxidant (SMD 1.48 95%CI 0.44 to 2.51) but with no significant difference for clomiphene vs. placebo (SMD − 1.13 95%CI -2.40 to 0.15) (Supplementary Fig. 8 b). All other treatments showed similar effect with clomiphene (SUCRA 80.6) and tamoxifen (SUCRA 82.7) showing the highest likelihood for an increase in FSH. There was no significant inconsistency in this network (p = 0.73) (Supplementary Fig. 8 c).

The network for evaluating the impact on LH suffered from significant inconsistency (p = 0.01) and we therefore applied an inconsistency model(Supplementary Fig. 9). Overall, aromatase inhibitors significantly increased LH levels compared to all other treatments (aromatase-inhibitors vs. anti-oxidant (SMD 3.20 95%CI 1.94 to 4.45); clomiphene vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD − 1.65 95%CI -3.31 to 0.02); placebo vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD − 1.58 95%CI -3.08 to -0.08); tamoxifen vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD − 1.34 95%CI -2.47 to -0.21); tamoxifen + anti-oxidant vs. aromatase-inhibitors (SMD − 1.26 95%CI -2.39 to -0.13)) (Supplementary Fig. 9 b) and had the highest likelihood for improving LH (SUCRA 98.8) (Supplementary Fig. 9 c). Similarly, tamoxifen + anti-oxidant showed significant improvements compared to anti-oxidants only (SMD 1.62 95%CI 0.80 to -2.44) and placebo was more effective than anti-oxidants only (SMD 1.55 95%CI 0.46 to -2.64) (Supplementary Fig. 9 b).

### Genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2D6 determines oestrogen receptor activity of the major infertility drug clomiphene via its active metabolites [^113HbSyE]. Human Molecular Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Clomiphene citrate is the most used drug for the treatment of female infertility, a common condition in western societies and developing countries. Despite dose escalation, up to 30% of women do not respond. Since clomiphene shares structural similarities with tamoxifen, which is predominantly bioactivated by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, we systematically explored clomiphene metabolism and action in vitro and in vivo by pharmacogenetic, -kinetic and -dynamic investigations. Human liver microsomes were incubated with clomiphene citrate and nine metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and tested at the oestrogen receptor for their antagonistic capacity. (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed strongest inhibition of the oestrogen receptor activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 2.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. CYP2D6 has been identified as the major enzyme involved in their formation using recombinant CYP450 isozymes as confirmed by inhibition experiments with CYP monoclonal antibodies. We correlated the CYP2D6 genotype of 30 human liver donors with the microsomal formation rate of active metabolites and observed a strong gene-dose effect. A healthy female volunteer study confirmed our in vitro data that the CYP2D6 polymorphism substantially determines the formation of the active clomiphene metabolites. Comparison of the C(max) of (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene showed 8 and 12 times lower concentrations in subjects with non-functional CYP2D6 alleles. Our results highlight (E)-4-hydroxyclomiphene and (E)-4-hydroxy-N-desethylclomiphene as the active clomiphene metabolites, the formation of which strongly depends on the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. Our data provide first evidence of a biological rationale for the variability in the response to clomiphene treatment.

### Clomiphene citrate: a potential alternative for testosterone therapy in hypogonadal males [^114uZQ6L]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A reversed effect of CC on testosterone levels was found in two young hypergonadotropic patients (< 1%). Although this phenomenon has been described before in the literature, the physiology of this paradoxical effect of CC is unclear.

There are several limitations to address for this study. First, it has a retrospective character, with data obtained manually from patient files. There were no strict inclusion criteria with predefined baseline and outcome measurements. No validated instrument for reporting hypogonadal symptoms could be used because there does not exist a Dutch validated hypogonadism questionnaire, but self‐reported hypogonadal symptoms and subjective symptom improvement was evaluated during follow‐up. Second, because this was not a placebo controlled trial, it is difficult to conclude if clinical improvement is the result of CC therapy. Third, in 130 patients, the presence of side effects was not reported, and side effects were not systematically classified. This may have caused an underestimation of the actual prevalence of side effects. Fourth, dosage at start of therapy was chosen based on weight, based on expert opinion in 2012. For future research and for clinical practice it is recommended with this gap in knowledge to start with the minimal dosage not depending on weight and to titrate dosage up if there is no sufficient effect. As last to mention, the included patients had different origins of hypogonadism. This is causing heterogeneity and does not imply that the effect of the study do count for all different subgroups. Nevertheless, with the encouraging outcomes of this study, we believe it is very valuable to execute a prospective study, especially for young hypogonadal males with an active or potential future child wish who are not eligible for TTh, with clear inclusion criteria, adequate measurement of hormonal levels, symptomatology with the usage of a validated questionnaire and registration of side effects.

Abstract

Background

Hypogonadism is a worldwide problem among men causing sexual, physical and mental problems. Testosterone therapy is the first‐choice treatment for male hypogonadism, with several side effects, that is, subfertility. Clomiphene citrate (CC) is an alternative off‐label therapy for a certain group of hypogonadal males, especially for those with an active or future child wish. There is scarce literature in usage of CC for men with hypogonadism. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CC for hypogonadal males.

In this single‐centre study, men treated with CC for hypogonadism were evaluated retrospectively. Primary outcome was hormonal evaluation including total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Secondary outcomes were hypogonadal symptoms, metabolic and lipid parameters, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), prostate specific antigen (PSA), side effects, the effect of a trial without medication and potential predictors for biochemical and clinical response.

Results

In total, 153 hypogonadal men were treated with CC. Mean TT, FT, LH and FSH increased during treatment. TT increased from 9 to 16 nmol/L, with a biochemical increase in 89% of the patients. In patients who continued CC treatment, an increased level of TT persisted after 8 years of treatment. With CC treatment, 74% of the patients experienced hypogonadal symptom improvement. LH at the lower normal range before CC treatment was predictive for better TT response. During CC therapy, few side effects were reported and no clinical important changes in PSA, Hb and Ht were found.

Conclusion

Clomiphene citrate is an effective therapy on short and long term, improving both clinical symptoms and biochemical markers of male hypogonadism with few side effects and good safety aspects.

### Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^117Fsqgk]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

The study was a three arm, parallel group, pragmatic randomised controlled trial. We recruited patients from four major teaching hospitals and one district general hospital in Scotland. Inclusion criteria were at least two years of infertility, bilateral tubal patency (demonstrated by laparoscopy or hysterosalpingography), ovulation demonstrated by appropriately timed mid-luteal progesterone, and normal semen variables (according to World Health Organization criteria). We also included coupleswith minimum sperm motility of 20% or minimal endometriosis (rAFS stage 1).

Expectant management — This involved six months during which no clinic visits or medical interventions were scheduled. Couples were given general advice regarding the need for regular intercourse, but no specific measures such as basal temperature charts or luteinising hormone kits were recommended.

Clomifene citrate — Women randomised to clomifene citrate received an oral dose of 50 mg between day two and six of each treatment cycle. During the first cycle they underwent a transvaginal scan and mid-luteal progesterone check. Subsequent cycles were monitored by a mid-luteal progesterone check alone. Couples were advised to have intercourse on days 12–18 of the cycle. If three or more ovarian follicles were detected by scan in the first cycle, the cycle was cancelled and the couple advised to avoid intercourse. In the next cycle, women who were overstimulated on the first cyclestarted on a reduced dose of clomifene (25 mg) and were monitored in the same way as they would be for a first cycle (that is, scan on day 12 and blood test for progesterone on day 21) with a further reduction to alternate days of 25 mg offered in the next cycle if necessary. As women were known to be ovulatory, we did not anticipate progesterone concentrations to indicate non-ovulation. A single low mid-luteal progesterone concentration (suggestive of anovulation) could be attributed to a mistimed blood test and, given the pragmatic nature of the trial, did not result in a change of protocol. In the event of low concentrations in successive cycles, we intended to treat the women as anovulatory using the standard clinic protocol of incremental doses of clomifene.

### Anastrozole versus clomiphene citrate: which is better for ovulation induction? [^113HrGJt]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Although anastrozole may be used as an oral therapeutic agent in ovulation induction, it is not recommended as a replacement for clomiphene citrate. On the basis of two phase 2 studies, anastrozole should be viewed as a second-tier therapy after clomiphene citrate in anovulatory patients.

### Men converting from clomiphene citrate to natesto with a desire to maintain spermatogenesis should be followed closely [^11568PEz]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report a case of a testosterone deficient man desiring maintenance of spermatogenesis converting from clomiphene citrate (CC) to Natesto, who had a decrease in gonadotropins and semen parameter values after making this medication change. The data on men maintaining gonadotropins and semen parameter values after converting from CC to Natesto is also reported.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed. Baseline hormones prior to treatment, and again on CC and Natesto, as well as semen parameters on CC and on Natesto were assessed.

Results

A 32-year-old testosterone deficient man desiring to maintain future fertility potential who had a poor symptomatic response to CC despite an adequate serum testosterone response was converted to Natesto 11 mg twice daily. His gonadotropins diminished as did his semen parameter values but with dose titration of Natesto to 11 mg in the morning and 5.5 mg in the evening he had normalization of gonadotropins and a rise in semen parameter values back towards his values on CC with a continued satisfactory symptomatic response. The remainder of the 49 men to date converting from CC to Natesto revealed stability in gonadotropins and semen parameter values.

Conclusion

Testosterone deficient men interested in maintaining spermatogenesis who convert from CC to Natesto seeking a more robust symptomatic response should be followed closely with repeat serum gonadotropins and semen parameters to confirm that spermatogenesis is not being suppressed. Dose titration of Natesto may be effective at optimizing gonadotropins, semen parameter values, testosterone levels, and symptomatic response to treatment.

### Clomiphene citrate medication for infertility and risk of stillbirth or neonatal death: a population-based cohort study [^112wWHom]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Exposure

Conception was designated as occurring proximal to CC (exposed) if a prescription for CC was dispensed from 90 days before through to the end of a preconception window (defined later). The standard quantity of medication supplied to women is 10 tablets — enough medication for 2 cycles, assuming the dose is 50 mg. We ascertained whether women were also supplied with gonadotropins in the exposure period (occasionally prescribed with CC to trigger final follicular maturation and ovulation).

It was necessary to derive a preconception window for each birth because over 20% were missing the date of last menstrual period (LMP), and births to women with anovulatory infertility may be overrepresented in this group. This window was based on the recorded date of birth and gestational age, with allowance for biological variation and inaccuracy of dating by routine ultrasound. Comparisons between available LMP dates and the derived preconception window are detailed elsewhere; where the LMP date was not missing, it was consistent with the preconception window in most cases (94.5%). One missing gestational age was imputed as the 50th centile for the relevant birthweight and sex using Australian data.

### Complete reversal of adult-onset isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with clomiphene citrate [^113vvvCR]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion in men by T is principally mediated by aromatization to estrogen (E), which inhibits hypothalamic secretion of GnRH. We hypothesized that adult-onset isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) might result from an altered central set-point for E-mediated negative feedback.

Design and Setting

Longitudinal clinical investigation unit-based evaluation of the clinical and biochemical response to E-receptor blockade.

Patient(S)

A 31-year-old man presenting with an 18-month history of sexual dysfunction resulting from severe adult-onset IHH (LH 1.7 U/L, FSH 2.0 U/L, T 3.5 nmol/L).

Intervention(S)

Initial therapy with 50 mg of clomiphene citrate (CC) three times a day for 7 days, with overnight LH pulse profiling and 9 am T levels evaluated at baseline and on completion. A 2-month washout period, followed by low-dose maintenance therapy (25–50 mg/d) for 4 months.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Baseline and stimulated T levels and LH pulsatility; effect on sexual function.

Result(S)

Clomiphene therapy resulted in complete normalization of pulsatile gonadotropin secretion, serum T level, and sexual function.

Conclusion(S)

Isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may result from an acquired defect of enhanced hypothalamic sensitivity to E-mediated negative feedback. Whereas direct T replacement therapy can further suppress endogenous gonadotropin secretion, treating IHH men with gonadotropins can stimulate endogenous T secretion and enhance fertility potential. On theoretical grounds, reversal of gonadotropin deficiency with CC might be expected to have a similar biological effect.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^113ErgG2]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) management and endocrine therapy considerations: Patients with HH present with deficient luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH secretion, and referral to an endocrinologist or male reproductive specialist is encouraged; spermatogenesis can be initiated and pregnancies achieved in many men with idiopathic HH when treated with exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH. With gonadotropin treatment for HH, hCG injections are typically initiated with serum testosterone monitored, and after normalization of testosterone, FSH or FSH analogues may be added to optimize sperm production. Exogenous testosterone administration provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that can inhibit gonadotropins such that spermatogenesis may decrease or cease altogether, resulting in azoospermia, supporting avoidance of testosterone monotherapy in men desiring fertility. Although not currently FDA-approved for use in men, SERMs such as clomiphene or tamoxifen are often prescribed to attempt improvement in semen parameters and fertility outcomes. While exogenous FSH may be used as an adjunct for HH with good results, in idiopathic infertile men without HH its fertility benefits are measurable but limited; the cost-to-benefit ratio is questionable because men are typically treated for 3 months or more and the incremental increase in pregnancy rates is small. There are no clear, reliable data to support use of supplements (vitamins, antioxidants, nutritional formulations) for men attempting conception; current data suggest they are likely not harmful but of questionable value in improving fertility outcomes.

### Clomiphene citrate in the treatment of idiopathic or functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in men: a case series and review of the literature [^113Z7SqM]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Late-onset hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (LOH) is a complex, heterogeneous entity. Whenever treatment is indicated, the endocrine literature has recommend testosterone replacement. We present our experience with clomiphene citrate treatment in patients with LOH and a review of the literature.

Methods

This retrospective case series included 18 male patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, roughly according to the European Male Aging Study criteria for LOH, attended at an academic hospital outpatient clinic. Data were retrieved from the patients' electronic medical records.

Results

The patients' mean age (± SD) was 44.3 ± 6.3 years (range 21–67 years) referred for evaluation of low testosterone together with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue or tiredness, anxiety, and osteoporosis. Clomiphene was initially prescribed at doses between 25 mg 3 times a week and 50 mg/day. At 6 to 8 weeks following initiation of treatment, mean basal total-testosterone increased from 7.6 ± 2.6 to 19.3 ± 5.2 nmol/L (P < .0001). Mean basal luteinizing hormone (LH) increased from 2.7 ± 2.1 to 8.3 ± 3.5 nmol/L (P < .0001). Mean basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increased from 4.2 ± 3.6 to 8.6 ± 6.2 nmol/L (P = .007). Testosterone and LH responses were invariably observed, including 2 patients with history of nonpituitary cranial pathologies, 2 with somewhat elevated FSH, and 1 with an eating disorder. Twelve (67%) patients reported improvement in symptoms. Side effects included transient nipple tenderness in 1 patient.

Conclusion

Available data suggest that clomiphene is an efficient and convenient alternative to testosterone replacement therapy in a substantial subset of patients with LOH. Additional long-term controlled studies should further establish the role of clomiphene in LOH.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) — clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen — are detailed for dosing, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms, adverse effects, and regulatory status. Clomiphene citrate dosing is 25–50 mg orally every 1–2 days with T Max = 5 hours and T 1/2 = 5–7 days; it reduces negative feedback on pit gonadotropin release with a resultant increase in gonadotropins (LH, FSH), and adverse effects include visual symptoms, flushing, headache, and abdominal discomfort. Tamoxifen dosing is 20 mg orally daily and lists T Max = 5 hours and T 1/2 = 5–7 days; it inhibits hypothalamic and pituitary estrogen receptors blocking estrogen negative feedback on gonadotropin release, increasing hypothalamic pituitarygonadal gonadotropin release, and adverse effects include liver abnormalities, liver enzyme changes, ocular disturbances including cataracts, and thromboembolic events including deep venous thrombosis and stroke. Both agents are noted as not FDA-approved for use in males.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

A retrospective, single‐centre study was conducted in the University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht. Hypogonadal men, who wanted to preserve their endogenous testicular function or men who had other reasons for not willing to use TTh and therefore treated with CC within the time frame from January 2012 to January 2021 were included. Ethical approval for this retrospective study was obtained from the local Research Ethics Committee, UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands (WAG/mb/20/500309). All patients were informed that CC is used as an off‐label therapy.

2.2 Patient population

Men aged above 18 years with low (< 12.1 nmol/L, defined by the EAU guidelines)or relatively low TT in combination with clear hypogonadal symptoms, wherefore treatment with CC, were included. Relatively low testosterone was defined as testosterone < 15 nmol/L in combination with, (1) low free testosterone < 243 pmol/L or (2) young adult males with a history of orchiectomy and clear complaints of hypogonadism. No upper cut‐off values for FSH nor LH levels were used for inclusion. Patients with LH levels > 10 IU/L were classified as hypergonadotropic hypogonadal males.

Hypogonadal symptoms were scored by the experienced treating physicians, no validated questionnaires were used. Patients were excluded in case: hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, no assessment of TT/FT was done before or during treatment, CC was used in combination with TTh, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) or if these therapies were used within 12 months of CC initiation.

With the clinical knowledge in 2012 based on expert opinion at that time, men received CC, with a starting dosage of 25 mg every other day, or 25 mg a day in case of bodyweight above 100 kg. Dosage was raised to 50 mg daily when there was little biochemical response. Data of duration of CC therapy, patient characteristics (age, body mass index (BMI), obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m)) 2, testicular volume, medical history (HIV, testicular surgery, DM, cardiovascular disease, diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome, malignancies, polycythaemia) and additional medication for erectile dysfunction during treatment were obtained manually from patient files.

Results

Study selection and study characteristics

Our electronic search yielded 671 potentially relevant citations out of which we screened 53 in full and included 14 randomised/quasi-randomised trials in our review (Fig. 1). Ten of the included trials had a two groups parallel design, three had three groups and one compared four groups. Majority of the trials were single centre (11/14, 78.6%) and only three were multi-centre (3/14, 21.4%). Most of the trials were conducted in Asia (6/14, 42.9%) followed by four in Europe (4/14, 28.6%), and two in each of the United States and Egypt (2/14, 14.3%).

The majority of the trials included men with low sperm count (< 15 × 10^6/ml) with only two trials including men with very low sperm count (< 5 × 10^6/ml) (Supplementary Table 1). Only three trials included men with hypogonadism and one trial provided the intervention for 12 months with eleven reporting outcomes between three and six months from recruitment (11/14, 78.6%).

We compared four pharmacological treatment options in our network meta-analysis (n = 1342) including Clomiphene citrate; Tamoxifen; Aromatase inhibitors (1 RCT for anastrazole, 2 RCTs for letrozole); anti-oxidants; and their combinations (Clomifene + Anti-oxidant; Tamoxifen + Anti-oxidant) (Supplementary Table 1).

Risk of bias of included studies

The overall quality of included trials was low. Half of the included trials (7/14, 50%) showed high risk of bias for randomisation and half showed some concern for allocation to intervention groups (7/14, 50%). Two trials were published as randomised trials, but the reported methods of randomisation were more consistent with quasi-randomisation. Seven trials showed high risk for outcome assessment (7/14, 50%) and eleven selective reporting bias (11/14, 79%). Two trials (2/14, 14%) had high loss to follow-up and data incompleteness (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). We assessed the risk of publication bias in included trials visually using a funnel plot which suggested no significant small study effect (Supplementary Fig. 3).

### Clomiphene citrate [^112Z9yEk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Action

Clomiphene citrate is a drug of considerable pharmacologic potency. With careful selection and proper management of the patient, clomiphene citrate has been demonstrated to be a useful therapy for the anovulatory patient desiring pregnancy.

Clomiphene citrate is capable of interacting with estrogen-receptor-containing tissues, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, endometrium, vagina, and cervix. It may compete with estrogen for estrogen-receptor-binding sites and may delay replenishment of intracellular estrogen receptors. Clomiphene citrate initiates a series of endocrine events culminating in a preovulatory gonadotropin surge and subsequent follicular rupture. The first endocrine event in response to a course of clomiphene therapy is an increase in the release of pituitary gonadotropins. This initiates steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis, resulting in growth of the ovarian follicle and an increase in the circulating level of estradiol. Following ovulation, plasma progesterone and estradiol rise and fall as they would in a normal ovulatory cycle.

Available data suggest that both the estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties of clomiphene may participate in the initiation of ovulation. The two clomiphene isomers have been found to have mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects, which may vary from one species to another. Some data suggest that zuclomiphene has greater estrogenic activity than enclomiphene.

Clomiphene citrate has no apparent progestational, androgenic, or antiandrogenic effects and does not appear to interfere with pituitary-adrenal or pituitary-thyroid function.

Although there is no evidence of a "carryover effect" of clomiphene citrate, spontaneous ovulatory menses have been noted in some patients after clomiphene citrate therapy.

### Select patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may respond to treatment with clomiphene citrate [^116FkYwL]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the management of male hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and evaluate the efficacy of clomiphene citrate (CC).

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Two university-based urology clinics.

Patient(S)

Ten patients referred for male infertility evaluation.

Intervention(S)

Patients were treated with either clomiphene citrate or injectable gonadotropins.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Changes in seminal parameters, gonadotropin levels, serum testosterone, and pregnancy.

Result(S)

Ten men who were evaluated for infertility were diagnosed with HH. Four had Kallmann's syndrome, four idiopathic HH, and two panhypopituitarism. Eight patients were azoospermic, and two were oligospermic on presentation. Three of the four men with adult-onset idiopathic HH responded to CC alone with increases in testosterone, FSH, and LH. Semen parameters in this group also improved, and two of the three men achieved pregnancies with CC alone. Out of the ten men actively attempting conception, four pregnancies were achieved. Three pregnancies (two with CC and one with gonadotropins) were in men diagnosed with adult-onset idiopathic forms of HH.

Conclusion(S)

Select patients with adult-onset idiopathic forms of HH may benefit from a trial of clomiphene citrate.

3. Patients without abnormal vaginal bleeding. If abnormal vaginal bleeding is present, the patient should be carefully evaluated to ensure that neoplastic lesions are not present.

4. Patients with normal liver function.

In addition, patients selected for clomiphene citrate therapy should be evaluated in regard to the following:

1.000000000000000e+00 Estrogen Levels. Patients should have adequate levels of endogenous estrogen (as estimated from vaginal smears, endometrial biopsy, assay of urinary estrogen, or from bleeding in response to progesterone). Reduced estrogen levels, while less favorable, do not preclude successful therapy.

2.
Primary Pituitary or Ovarian Failure. Clomiphene citrate therapy cannot be expected to substitute for specific treatment of other causes of ovulatory failure.

3.000000000000000e+00 Endometriosis and Endometrial Carcinoma. The incidence of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma increases with age as does the incidence of ovulatory disorders. Endometrial biopsy should always be performed prior to clomiphene citrate therapy in this population.

4.
Other Impediments to Pregnancy. Impediments to pregnancy can include thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and male factor infertility.

5.000000000000000e+00 Uterine Fibroids. Caution should be exercised when using clomiphene citrate in patients with uterine fibroids due to the potential for further enlargement of the fibroids.

There are no adequate or well-controlled studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male infertility. In addition, testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males using clomiphene. The cause and effect relationship between reports of testicular tumors and the administration of clomiphene citrate is not known.

Although the medical literature suggests various methods, there is no universally accepted standard regimen for combined therapy (i.e., clomiphene citrate in conjunction with other ovulation-inducing drugs). Similarly, there is no standard clomiphene citrate regimen for ovulation induction in in vitro fertilization programs to produce ova for fertilization and reintroduction. Therefore, clomiphene citrate is not recommended for these uses.

### A randomized prospective double-blind comparison trial of clomiphene citrate and anastrozole in raising testosterone in hypogonadal infertile men [^114jQkx3]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

Clomiphene citrate (CC) and anastrozole (AZ) have been used off label to increase testosterone (T) in hypogonadal infertile men (HIM). Both medications have been shown to increase T with different effects on estradiol (E2) and T-to-E2 ratios. There are no reported randomized trials comparing CC and AZ to improve T levels in HIM. We aimed to establish equivalence of CC vs. AZ with respect to improvement in T levels in HIM.

Methods

We randomized 26 HIM (T less than 350ng/dL and normal luteinizing hormone [LH]). Patients were randomized to CC (25mg/day) or AZ (1mg/day) for 12 weeks. Hormones assayed were total T, free T, E2, LH, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Patient-reported outcomes were the International Index of Erectile Function, Erection Hardness Scale, and the Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male questionnaires. Blood tests and questionnaires were recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Semen analyses were performed at baseline and 12 weeks.

Results

T increased significantly from baseline in both groups at 6 and 12 weeks. There was a significantly larger increase in T and mean increase from baseline in CC vs. AZ (571 vs. 408ng/dL, respectively). Whereas E-2 levels increased in the CC group, they decreased in the AZ group. Though both groups demonstrated an increase in T-to-E-2 ratio from baseline, statistic significance at 6 and 12 weeks was only achieved with AZ. Neither group demonstrated significant changes in seminal parameters or patient-reported outcomes.

Conclusions

We failed to demonstrate equivalence of CC vs. AZ. CC resulted in significantly higher T levels than AZ. AZ resulted in a significantly larger increase in T/E-2 ratio than CC. No significant differences between CC and AZ on seminal parameters or patient-reported outcomes were demonstrated.

### Does the additional use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole for in vitro fertilization deserve more attention? [^114hFCmA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To reduce FSH dose, a series of trials compared CC/LE with Gn versus Gn, wondering if oral regimen was as effective as Gn alone. There was a common view having limited the use of Gn to 150 IU/d for mild stimulation and such a low dose did not stress side effects on pregnancy outcome in a number of randomized trials. One of them revealed that the ongoing pregnancy rate for mild ovarian stimulation (150 IU/d alone) was 12.8% versus 13.6% for conventional ovarian stimulation (450 IU/d) in poor responders (P > 0.05). In our statistical analysis, we analyzed the significance of adding oral medications, rather the fixed dose of exogenous Gn, and supplied the edges of adding oral agents to the ovulation process in different populations.

CC or LE regimens, which were associated with a reduction in the incidence of OHSS and low costs although by low-quality evidences, benefitted the poor or normal response populations. In our research, for high ovary responders and normal responders, we can see that the OHSS incidence rates extremely declined. In patients expected to be normal responders, Siristatidis et al. proved laboratory outcomes including the total dose of Gn administered and retrieved ova were significantly lower than conventional group, which was consistent with our conclusion. The adjunctive use of CC in IVF produced good efficacy for lowering the Gn level by a retrospective study covering 77 patients with POR. No regardless of populations in our study, fewer Gn days thereby lower T-Gn and lower costs were required for ovarian stimulation in Add group patients compared with those in Conventional group. Although without a strict criterion (150 IU/d), the strategy for using CC/LE during IVF cycles was to develop such a patient-friendly stimulation that costs were reduced by decreasing the total dose of Gn compared with conventional ovarian stimulation. All in all, addition of CC or LE exactly led to a cut-down in the total Gn, total costs and the OHSS incidence rates.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115jbWbe]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — summary statement indicates that current evidence does not support in vitro fertilization (IVF) as a first-line therapy over expectant management for 6 months or a limited course of ovulation stimulation (OS) with intrauterine insemination (IUI) in women < 38 years of age, that immediate IVF in women ≥ 38 years of age may be associated with a higher pregnancy rate and shorter time to pregnancy compared with a strategy of OS with IUI using either oral medications or gonadotropins prior to IVF, that in couples who fail to achieve a pregnancy following a course of clomiphene citrate with IUI treatment immediate IVF results in a shorter time to pregnancy and lower cost per pregnancy than a strategy that incorporates gonadotropins with IUI treatments in women ≤ 40 years, and that there is no reported difference in clinical pregnancy and live-birth rates when comparing IVF with conventional fertilization to IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for unexplained infertility, although ICSI has been associated with higher fertilization rates and a reduced risk of complete fertilization failure as compared to conventional fertilization.

### Improving the reporting of clinical trials of infertility treatments (IMPRINT): modifying the CONSORT statement [^113WReo8]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Medium credibility.

IMPRINT — Methods (Item 4a: eligibility criteria) directs authors to report how infertility factors were assessed and defined, and provides an example detailing thresholds used. The modified checklist item is to "Characterize how infertility factors in the couple/participants were evaluated, what definitions were used, any preconception screening, and if informed consents were obtained from participating partners". The example specifies women aged 21–39 years; "12 months of attempted conception"; at least one ovary with an "ipsilateral patent fallopian tube confirmed by hysterosalpingogram or laparoscopy"; no prior infertility treatment except "up to three cycles of clomiphene citrate with IUI"; ovarian reserve defined by "cycle day 3 FSH and estradiol values of < 15 mIU/mL and < 100 pg/mL"; and semen parameters of "a sperm concentration of ≥ 15 million/mL or total motile sperm per ≥ 5 million total motile sperm at reflex IUI preparation".

### The evaluation of infertility [^114GnAuy]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Infertility is a significant medical problem that affects many couples. Evaluation is the starting point for treatment of infertility as it may suggest specific causes and appropriate treatment modalities. Although the history and physical examination provide important information, specific diagnostic tests are required to evaluate infertility. Because the causes of infertility can be multifactorial, a systematic approach typically is used and involves testing for male factor, ovulatory factor, uterotubal factor, and peritoneal factor. Many of these diagnostic tests are laboratory based, including semen analysis, serum progesterone level, serum basal follicle-stimulating hormone level, and clomiphene citrate challenge, and can be done by the primary care physician. Moreover, by understanding the infertility evaluation, the primary care physician can serve as an important resource for advice about infertility. This article briefly reviews the diagnostic approach to infertility, with particular emphasis on important laboratory tests used for evaluation.

### Predictors of patient responses to ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome experiencing infertility [^1177Rurv]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify predictors of clomiphene citrate-induced ovulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Methods

A prospective observational study of patients 18–40 years of age with PCOS experiencing infertility was conducted at Menoufia University Hospital between January 2011 and January 2013. A range of potential predictors of ovulation were recorded before patients received a 50-mg dose of clomiphene citrate. Following ovulation or no response to increasing clomiphene-citrate doses, correlations between predictors and treatment responses were analyzed.

Results

In total, 150 patients with PCOS experiencing infertility were enrolled. Following treatment, 110 (73.3%) patients ovulated. Highly significant differences were observed between treatment responders and non-responders in baseline amenorrhea, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, total testosterone, anti-Müllerian hormone, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and visceral fat area (P < 0.001). Significant differences in mean ovarian volume (P < 0.009) and ovarian stromal artery pulsatility index (P < 0.003) were also observed. Total testosterone was the best individual predictor of clomiphene citrate treatment response. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in a multivariate prediction model was 0.98.

Conclusions

A combination of patient amenorrhea, BMI, total testosterone, anti-Müllerian hormone, ovarian volume, ovarian stromal artery pulsatility index, and visceral fat area could be used to predict clomiphene-citrate treatment response in patients with PCOS experiencing infertility.

### Testing and interpreting measures of ovarian reserve: a committee opinion [^112m1539]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Clomiphene citrate challenge test (CCCT) — protocol and utility: The CCCT involves measurements of serum FSH before (cycle day 3) and after (cycle day 10) treatment with clomiphene citrate (100 mg daily, cycle days 5–9), but compared with basal FSH and antral follicle count, the clomiphene-stimulated day-10 FSH level is not superior for predicting poor ovarian response or pregnancy, and for this reason, this test should be abandoned.

### Oral medications including clomiphene citrate or aromatase inhibitors with gonadotropins for controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation [^114vMyiv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gonadotropins are the most commonly used medications for controlled ovarian stimulation in in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, they are expensive and invasive, and are associated with the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Recent calls for more patient-friendly regimens have led to growing interest in the use of clomiphene citrate (CC) and aromatase inhibitors with or without gonadotropins to reduce the burden of hormonal injections. It is currently unknown whether regimens using CC or aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole (Ltz) are as effective as gonadotropins alone.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of regimens including oral induction medication (such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole) versus gonadotropin-only regimens for controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register (searched January 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2017), Embase (1980 to January 2017), and reference lists of relevant articles. We also searched trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx). We handsearched relevant conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcomes were live-birth rate (LBR) and OHSS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We analyzed the general population of women undergoing IVF treatment and (as a separate analysis) women identified as poor responders. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 27 studies in the updated review. Most of the new trials in the updated review included poor responders and evaluated Ltz protocols. We could perform meta-analysis with data from 22 studies including a total of 3599 participants. The quality of the evidence for different comparisons ranged from low to moderate. The main limitations in the quality of the evidence were risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods, and imprecision. In the general population of women undergoing IVF, it is unclear whether CC or Ltz used with or without gonadotropins compared to use of gonadotropins along with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists resulted in a difference in live birth (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.27, 4 RCTs, n = 493, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16, 12 RCTs, n = 1998, I² = 3%, moderate-quality evidence). This means that for a typical clinic with 23% LBR using a GnRH agonist regimen, switching to CC or Ltz protocols would be expected to result in LBRs between 15% and 30%. Clomiphene citrate or Ltz protocols were associated with a reduction in the incidence of OHSS (Peto OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.41, 5 RCTs, n = 1067, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). This means that for a typical clinic with 6% prevalence of OHSS associated with a GnRH regimen, switching to CC or Ltz protocols would be expected to reduce the incidence to between 0.5% and 2.5%. We found evidence of an increase in cycle cancellation rate with the CC protocol compared to gonadotropins in GnRH protocols (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.45, 9 RCTs, n = 1784, I² = 61%, low-quality evidence). There was moderate quality evidence of a decrease in the mean number of ampoules used,) and mean number of oocytes collected with CC with or without gonadotropins compared to the gonadotropins in GnRH agonist protocols, though data were too heterogeneous to pool. Similarly, in the poor-responder population, it is unclear whether there was any difference in rates of live birth (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.79, 2 RCTs, n = 357, I² = 38%, low-quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12, 8 RCTs, n = 1462, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) following CC or Ltz with or without gonadotropin versus gonadotropin and GnRH protocol. This means that for a typical clinic with a 5% LBR in the poor responders using a GnRH protocol, switching to CC or Ltz protocols would be expected to yield LBRs between 2% to 14%. There was low quality evidence that the CC or Ltz protocols were associated with an increase in the cycle cancellation rate (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.81, 10 RCTs, n = 1601, I² = 64%) and moderate quality evidence of a decrease in the mean number of gonadotropin ampoules used and the mean number of oocytes collected, though data were too heterogeneous to pool. The adverse effects of these protocols were poorly reported. In addition, data on foetal abnormalities following use of CC or Ltz protocols are lacking.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence indicating that clomiphene citrate or letrozole with or without gonadotropins differed from gonadotropins in GnRH agonist or antagonist protocols with respect to their effects on live-birth or pregnancy rates, either in the general population of women undergoing IVF treatment or in women who were poor responders. Use of clomiphene or letrozole led to a reduction in the amount of gonadotropins required and the incidence of OHSS. However, use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole may be associated with a significant increase in the incidence of cycle cancellations, as well as reductions in the mean number of oocytes retrieved in both the general IVF population and the poor responders. Larger, high-quality randomized trials are needed to reach a firm conclusion before they are adopted into routine clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and quality assessment study [^114WvnZj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of Infertility

Overall LSTs were considered the optimal first-line treatment for anovulation in women with PCOS and infertility for 3 to 6 months. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline considered pharmacological ovulation induction a contraindication in obese women (body mass index > 35 kg/m 2) with PCOS. Three CPGs recommended the use of letrozole as the primary method of pharmacological ovulation induction. This represented a shift in evidence compared to older CPGs such as the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guideline, which considered it optional, and the Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM guideline which recommended clomiphene citrate as first-line treatment. Most CPGs recommended ovulation induction with gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian drilling as a second-line treatment. The Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM guideline recommended ovulation induction with a follicle stimulating hormone starting dose of 37.5 to 50 IU/day used up to a 14-day stimulation period with close ovulation monitoring and a maximum of 6 stimulation cycles. In vitro fertilization was suggested as last option with a preference for gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocols and metformin to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, although there were limited recommendations on the best in vitro fertilization protocols in women with PCOS.

### Prediction of the individual follicle-stimulating hormone threshold for gonadotropin induction of ovulation in normogonadotropic anovulatory infertility: an approach to increase safety and efficiency [^115T7qFB]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To predict the FSH response (threshold) dose in normogonadotropic, anovulatory infertile women undergoing gonadotropin induction of ovulation.

Design

Prospective longitudinal clinical study.

Setting

Specialist academic fertility unit.

Patient(S)

Normogonadotropic, oligoamenorrheic, infertile women who were resistant to clomiphene citrate or in whom clomiphene citrate therapy had failed.

Intervention(S)

Daily exogenous FSH administration in a low-dose, step-up regimen.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The FSH dose on the day of ovarian response (follicle growth > 10 mm in diameter).

Result(S)

Multivariate analysis was used to devise the following equation to predict the individual FSH response dose (75 to > 187 IU/d) before initiation of therapy: [4 body mass index (in kg/m(2))] + [32 clomiphene citrate resistance (yes = 1 or no = 0)] + [7 initial free insulin-like growth factor-I (in ng/mL)] + [6 initial serum FSH level (in IU/L)] - 51. The SE of the predicted dose is 35 IU.

Conclusion(S)

The individual FSH response dose for gonadotropin induction of ovulation in anovulatory infertile women can be predicted on the basis of initial screening characteristics. The prediction model developed in this study may increase the safety and efficiency of low-dose gonadotropin protocols (step-up and step-down) by correctly determining the appropriate starting dose for a given patient.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — letrozole should be used rather than clomiphene citrate in women with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, and current evidence demonstrates no difference in fetal abnormality rates between letrozole or clomiphene citrate ovulation induction or natural conception.

### Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^117RRV7S]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination seems to be no more effective than expectant management in couples with unexplained infertility.

Strengths and weaknesses

We compared the effectiveness of both clomifene citrate and unstimulated intrauterine insemination versus expectant management. The inclusion of a control group (expectant management) means that our results reflect the true marginal effect of these popular interventions. The trial is strengthened by its pragmatic, multicentre approach and the choice of live birth per woman as its end point. We exceeded our recruitment target with less than 1% loss to follow-up; in addition, the number of women in the expectant management and clomifene citrate arms exceeded the number randomised in all of the previous clomifene citrate trials pooled together.

The inclusion of cases of mild male factor infertility and minimal endometriosis might have introduced an element of clinical heterogeneity. The presence of these cases in this pragmatic trial, however, can be justified on the grounds that they are managed in the same way as "true" unexplained infertility. Although there were few live births within each subgroup, subgroup analyses indicate similar treatment effects in these groups. Our choice of clinical protocols for the intervention arms reflects current practice in Scotland and the rest of the UK, but the results might not be generalisable to other populations and alternative drug regimens. In particular, this trial does not address the issue of a combined approach with clomifene citrate and intrauterine insemination, which should be the focus of future trials.

### Treatment of male subfertility with dietary supplements… [^1123fjRR]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

to the editor: A 40-year-old man with cryptorchidism that was corrected at 12 years of age presented in November 2010 with a four-year history of infertility. In November 2008, his sperm concentration was 3 million per mL, and motility was 30 percent. Microscopy revealed 2 percent normal morphology with a round cell count of 2 million per mL. Testicular ultrasonography and hormone levels were normal. The patient was prescribed clomiphene, 25 mg per day. Four months later, sperm concentration was 5 to 7 million per mL. Thirteen months after discontinuing clomiphene, bilateral varicoceles were diagnosed. At that time, sperm concentration was 4 million per mL, and motility was 63 percent. Varicocelectomy and in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection were recommended. The patient and his 27-year-old wife consulted a physician who recommended dietary supplements.

In November 2010, the patient began taking a formulation containing vitamin C, 1, 000 mg; vitamin E, 400 IU; vitamin D, 800 IU; l-carnitine, 2, 000 mg; l-arginine, 1, 500 mg; vitamin B complex of infertility cases are associated with male factor infertility. 2 A recent Cochrane systematic review of eight randomized controlled trials including 607 patients found no benefit to surgical varicocele treatment for subfertility. 3 Conversely, a Cochrane review of 34 randomized controlled trials found that oral antioxidants were associated with a statistically significant increase in pregnancy rate.
4.

This case illustrates a couple who were advised to undergo surgical procedures but successfully achieved pregnancy with a mixture of benign, inexpensive supplements. Based on the existing evidence, perhaps other infertile couples should be offered a trial of dietary supplements before considering expensive and invasive procedures.
