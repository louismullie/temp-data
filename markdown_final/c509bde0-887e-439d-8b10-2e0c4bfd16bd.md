## Question

Egg smell burp with oral simaglutide

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "egg-smelling burps" are a known or expected side effect of oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) and, if so, how to understand and manage them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "egg-smelling burps" typically represent biochemically. Then, I should verify whether belching/eructation is a documented adverse effect of oral semaglutide. Next, I will consider the mechanistic plausibility linking semaglutide's gastrointestinal effects to hydrogen sulfide–related malodor. After that, I should review the frequency and severity of belching in trials and labeling. Finally, I will synthesize a practical management plan and clarify when to escalate evaluation for alternative causes.

> Let me first confirm the symptom construct: "egg-smelling burps" classically reflect hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a flammable, colorless gas detectable at very low concentrations and commonly described as "rotten egg" odor; this is a recognized descriptor in toxicology references and aligns with patient descriptions of malodorous eructations, so I should keep H2S-related gas as the leading biochemical explanation while I verify causality with semaglutide [^111EuW2f].

> Next, I should review whether belching/eructation is actually documented with oral semaglutide; wait, let me verify the FDA labeling and pivotal data. The FDA adverse reaction tables list belching as a common gastrointestinal adverse reaction with oral semaglutide, and the PIONEER program and subsequent reviews consistently show a gastrointestinal adverse event profile that includes belching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, which supports that eructation is an expected, albeit variably bothersome, effect rather than an anomaly [^113KXT7S] [^1129u4U7] [^1139EcQV].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without linking mechanism to symptom. Semaglutide delays gastric emptying and alters GI motility, which can promote bacterial fermentation of retained nutrients and lead to increased gas production, including hydrogen sulfide, thereby producing malodorous eructations; this is consistent with the known GLP-1 RA class effects on gastric emptying and GI tolerability, and with expert summaries describing bloating and gas-related symptoms during therapy [^1139EcQV] [^115cxKSf] [^115qobHV].

> Let me consider frequency and severity; I should double-check how often belching occurs and whether it leads to discontinuation. Across PIONEER and related analyses, GI adverse events are the most frequent with oral semaglutide, typically mild to moderate, peaking during initiation and dose escalation and improving with maintenance dosing; interruption for GI tolerability occurred in 2–12% in oral semaglutide groups, underscoring that while common, most symptoms are manageable and often transient with continued use and supportive measures [^1139EcQV].

> Now, I need to ensure the management plan is practical and evidence-aligned; let me think about dose timing, titration, and dietary strategies. First, confirm strict administration instructions: take on an empty stomach with up to 120 mL water and remain fasting for at least 30 minutes post-dose to optimize absorption and may reduce erratic GI effects; if symptoms persist, consider extending the time on a lower dose before escalation or temporarily reducing the dose, as expert guidance supports flexible titration to improve tolerability [^111mZc6N] [^114Jp9iv]. Second, counsel on smaller, lower-fat meals, slower eating, and avoidance of gas-producing foods to mitigate fermentation and H2S generation; patient education toolkits emphasize these measures to reduce GI upset and improve adherence [^116436yo]. Third, reassure that malodorous belching, while unpleasant, is generally benign and often improves over weeks; if severe, persistent, or accompanied by red flags (weight loss, dysphagia, persistent vomiting, or GI bleeding), evaluate for alternative pathology such as Helicobacter pylori, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or gallbladder disease, noting that GLP-1 RAs have been associated with gallstone disease and GI adverse effects warranting clinical judgment [^117B87bq] [^111YJdCz].

> But wait, what if the odor is not H2S at all; I should confirm that we are not missing a different toxin-associated smell. Arsine and stibine can smell like garlic or rotten eggs and are unrelated to semaglutide pharmacology; these would require environmental or occupational exposures and present with systemic toxicity rather than isolated belching, so a careful exposure history helps distinguish them from medication-related malodor eructations [^114og3oD].

> In summary, I should confirm that "egg-smelling burps" with oral semaglutide are a recognized, mechanistically plausible manifestation of delayed gastric emptying and altered gut fermentation leading to hydrogen sulfide–rich gas, documented as belching within the common GI adverse effects of the drug; management centers on optimizing administration technique, pacing dose escalation, dietary modification, and selective evaluation for alternative causes if symptoms are severe or refractory, aligning with FDA labeling and expert guidance on GI tolerability strategies [^113KXT7S] [^1139EcQV] [^114Jp9iv] [^111EuW2f].

Egg-smelling burps (sulfur burps) are a common, benign side effect of **oral semaglutide** [^1129u4U7], caused by **delayed gastric emptying** [^115cxKSf] and increased bacterial fermentation of sulfur-containing amino acids [^notfound]. They typically occur during initiation or dose escalation and resolve with continued use or dose adjustment [^1139EcQV]. Management includes dietary changes (smaller, low-sulfur meals; avoiding carbonated drinks) [^116436yo], ensuring strict fasting administration [^111mZc6N], and using antacids or simethicone if needed. Persistent or severe symptoms warrant evaluation for gallbladder disease [^112kJywj] or **gastrointestinal obstruction** [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of egg-smelling burps with oral semaglutide

Oral semaglutide delays gastric emptying [^115cxKSf], prolonging gastric residence of food and increasing fermentation of protein — especially sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine, cysteine) — by gut bacteria, producing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) [^notfound] and other volatile sulfur compounds that cause the characteristic "rotten egg" odor [^111EuW2f].

---

## Clinical evidence and patient reports

Clinical trials and postmarketing data consistently report **gastrointestinal side effects** — including belching, flatulence, and dyspepsia — with **oral semaglutide** [^1129u4U7] [^113KXT7S]. While "egg-smelling burps" are not always explicitly documented, belching and flatulence are common and mechanistically aligned with sulfur gas production [^113KXT7S]. Patient-reported experiences frequently describe sulfur-smelling burps, particularly during **initiation and dose escalation**, with symptoms typically diminishing over time or with dose adjustment.

---

## Frequency and severity

The frequency and severity of **sulfur burps** vary with dose, diet, and individual susceptibility. They are most common during **initiation and dose escalation** and are generally mild to moderate, transient, and self-limited [^1139EcQV]. Persistent or severe symptoms may indicate underlying **gastrointestinal conditions** (e.g. gallbladder disease, obstruction) and warrant further evaluation [^112kJywj].

---

## Management strategies

Several strategies can mitigate sulfur burps associated with oral semaglutide:

- **Dietary modifications**: Smaller, low-sulfur meals; avoid carbonated drinks, cruciferous vegetables, and high-protein foods [^116QPohM].
- **Proper administration**: Take with ≤ 120 mL water, fast ≥ 30 minutes before eating/drinking, and separate from other oral medications to optimize absorption and reduce GI symptoms [^111mZc6N] [^114Jp9iv].
- **Symptomatic relief**: Antacids, simethicone, or activated charcoal may reduce gas and odor.
- **Dose adjustment**: Consider slower titration or temporary dose reduction if symptoms persist [^114Jp9iv] [^116QPohM].

---

## Clinical significance and patient counseling

Sulfur burps are **benign and self-limited** but can cause embarrassment and affect adherence [^notfound]. Clinicians should counsel patients on expected **GI effects**, provide dietary guidance, and reassure that symptoms typically improve with continued use or dose adjustment [^114Jp9iv]. Persistent or severe symptoms should prompt evaluation for gallbladder disease, **gastrointestinal obstruction**, or other pathology [^117B87bq] [^113yTgtX].

---

Egg-smelling burps are a common, benign side effect of oral semaglutide, driven by delayed gastric emptying and increased bacterial fermentation of sulfur-containing amino acids [^1129u4U7]. Symptoms are usually transient and manageable with dietary changes, proper administration, and dose adjustment; persistent or severe cases warrant further evaluation [^116QPohM].

### Real-world insights into incretin-based therapy: associations between changes in taste perception and appetite regulation in individuals with obesity and overweight: a cross-sectional study [^114PVcBH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to weight loss, our results suggest notable changes in appetite regulation and sensory perception. More than half of the participants reported reduced appetite, with approximately one‐third describing it as substantially diminished. Additionally, about two‐thirds experienced decreased food cravings and accelerated satiety after meals. These findings align with the STEP‐1 study, which documented a 35% reduction in food cravings after 3 months of semaglutide treatment, with 68% of participants reporting markedly decreased hunger within the first 12 weeks. The SURMOUNT‐1 studycomparing tirzepatide and semaglutide found that 82% of tirzepatide patients reported 'hardly any food cravings' after 24 weeks, compared to 58% of semaglutide patients. Although our cross‐sectional design precludes direct temporal comparisons, the magnitude of appetite and craving reductions observed suggests these effects persist throughout the treatment duration.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^113AfdKZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) have recently gained momentum after the introduction of semaglutide, the first oral molecule in their class. In a recent article in this journal by Evans et al., a succinct overview of the utility of semaglutide is highlighted in the context of virtual diabetes care. To take this discussion further, this commentary describes the value and positioning of oral semaglutide in common clinical situations. Its insights assist in pragmatic placement of this drug in clinical practice. Special emphasis is laid on the use of oral semaglutide in persons already on injectable GLP-1RA formulations, those experiencing sudden changes in life style pattern due to religious, social, or professional commitments, individuals seeking help for urgent glycemic control, and those who face sudden change in their concomitant medications or comorbidities.

### Effect of various dosing conditions on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in a tablet formulation [^111mZc6N]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

On the basis of the combined results of the current food-effect and dosing conditions trials with oral semaglutide, it is concluded that administration of oral semaglutide in the fasting state with up to 120 mL water and at least 30 min post-dose fasting results in clinically relevant semaglutide plasma exposure. These dosing recommendations were implemented in the phase 3 clinical development programme for oral semaglutide and are part of the approved label.

Need for Urgency in Glucose Control

The prescribing information for oral semaglutide mentions that dose escalation should be done after 1 month. This advice is aimed at minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms and maximizing patient comfort.

There may be situations, however, where patients need urgent glucose control, to resolve symptoms, comorbidities, or complications of diabetes. Others may be concerned about their glucose levels, and may ask for early control.

If such people demonstrate good gastrointestinal tolerance to the 3 mg or 7 mg dose of semaglutide, one may consider dose up-titration after 10 or 20 days of therapy. Patients must be counseled about the possibility of transient symptoms, and how to mitigate them.

### Anti-obesity medication protocols toolkit [^116436yo]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Semaglutide patient education — Semaglutide is used to treat diabetes and obesity in people 12 years old and older and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It works by copying the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) to help lower appetite and increase metabolism, acting on the brain to make us feel a little bit less hungry, on the stomach to keep it full longer by emptying more slowly, and on the pancreas to help secrete a little bit more insulin to help manage blood sugars and use energy faster. The most common side effects of semaglutide are stomach upset, nausea, vomiting (throwing up), decreased appetite, indigestion, and constipation. If these effects occur, it may help to eat smaller meals and eat slower, take semaglutide with food, eat small meals or snacks throughout the day instead of one large meal, add fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins, and limit foods that are spicy, greasy or fried as well as packaged snacks like cookies, chips, cakes, doughnuts, and ice cream.

Sudden Change in Medical Status

If a person on oral semaglutide experiences sudden change in medical status, an individualized decision should be taken regarding continuation of therapy. Patients who are able to eat and hydrate themselves well, and have stable hepatorenal function, should continue the drug. Those who are unable to eat properly, have vomiting or diarrhea, or are admitted to intensive care will require discontinuation of GLP1RA, and may benefit from short-term insulin therapy.

Such decisions must be based upon a comprehensive assessment of the patient's needs, and should be revised on a regular basis.

### Meeting the challenge of virtual diabetes care: a consensus viewpoint on the positioning and value of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice [^116QPohM]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment response should be assessed initially at 3 months to identify those with weaker response than expected, although full response will not be observed until 6 months after first dose. Absorption may vary between individuals, and in those achieving insufficient response adherence should be examined and treatment discontinuation considered. No dose adjustments are necessary in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2), upper gastrointestinal disease or hepatic impairment, as the presence of these comorbidities does not affect the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide.

Medication management strategies to mitigate potential adverse events and to support treatment continuation are important and could include the incorporation of treatment pauses or dose reduction when tolerability issues arise, alongside patient education. The most frequent side-effects from using GLP-1 RAs are gastrointestinal (GI). Individuals need to be warned of the possibility of nausea and vomiting but should also be reassured that these are usually mild to moderate in intensity and dissipate with time. The importance of continuing with treatment should be reiterated, and slowed titration may be considered in severe cases until GI side effects have resolved. Individuals should also be provided with education regarding smaller meal sizes and reduced carbohydrate and fat content in their diets, as well as to generally reinforce healthy eating to achieve best outcomes with this drug, thereby reducing the incidence of nausea, vomiting and other GI side effects.

### Real-world insights into incretin-based therapy: associations between changes in taste perception and appetite regulation in individuals with obesity and overweight: a cross-sectional study [^114HgGeN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies have elucidated the mechanistic explanations, showing that 20‐week treatment with oral semaglutide 50 mg significantly reduced energy intake, improved appetite regulation, and reduced food cravings without delaying gastric emptying. Further, a different studysuggested that semaglutide not only reduces appetite but also affects dopamine‐mediated reward signalling in the brain, which may explain the reduced food craving in patients. In addition, the STEP‐5 studyshowed that improvements in eating behaviour control and craving reduction are sustained over time. Against this background, the sensory changes documented in our study are of particular interest.

Approximately 20%–30% of participants reported increased taste perception in the sweet, salty, bitter and sour modalities, depending on the drug group. Interestingly, participants with increased intensity in the sweet and salty taste modalities compared to those with decreased or unchanged taste intensity reported more pronounced associations with favourable appetite‐related outcomes, such as reduced cravings or earlier satiety, although the majority reported no overall change in taste perception. These findings add to the complexity of previous studies, some of which have produced conflicting results regarding the effects of GLP‐1 analogues on taste function, some suggesting improved taste perception and neural activation in response to taste stimuli, and others showing objective reductions in taste sensitivity using psychophysical assessments. In light of the observed associations between taste perception and appetite‐related outcomes, we examined whether these sensory changes might lead to weight loss. To explore this further, we performed a linear regression analysis, which showed no significant association between changes in taste perception and BMI reduction, after adjusting for relevant covariates. This finding suggests a distinction between the short‐term, subjective effects, such as reduced appetite or enhanced satiety, and the long‐term, objective changes in weight. Although altered taste perception may influence eating behaviour in the short term, it does not appear to result in measurable weight loss within the observed timeframe. Possible explanations include compensatory behaviours, metabolic adaptation or unmeasured influences on energy balance. These results indicate that although subjective sensory changes may contribute to treatment adherence or perceived efficacy, they do not independently predict weight loss outcomes.

Sudden Change in Lifestyle/Diet

Oral semaglutide is a safe drug, with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. Hence, if there is a sudden change in lifestyle or dietary pattern, there should be no need to alter the dose of semaglutide. One must counsel the patient, however, to report such developments to the treating physician. It may be necessary to modify the dosage of concomitant sulfonylurea or insulin therapy.

13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology

Increase in lactate levels and decrease in glucose levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were observed in mechanistic studies with SNAC in rats. Small but statistically significant increases in lactate levels (up to 2-fold) were observed in a few animals at approximately the clinical exposure. At higher exposures these findings were associated with moderate to marked adverse clinical signs (lethargy, abnormal respiration, ataxia, reduced activity, body tone and reflexes) and marked decreases in plasma and CSF glucose levels. These findings are consistent with inhibition of cellular respiration and lead to mortality at SNAC concentrations ≥ 100-times the clinical Cmax.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg — implementation and safety considerations for adults with obesity: Given the stated net benefit, semaglutide 2.4 mg "may be prioritized over other approved AOMs for the long-term treatment of obesity for most patients". It "has glucoregulatory benefits and is also approved for the treatment of T2DM". Adverse effects are noted as it "may delay gastric emptying with adverse effects of nausea and vomiting", and "gradual dose titration may help mitigate these adverse effects". Class-level risks are flagged as "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) have been associated with increased risk of pancreatitis and gallbladder disease", and semaglutide "is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2".

Results of signal calculation for ADEs

Ranking results of signals related to eye diseases. Table 3 presents the top 30 PTs with the highest incidence of semaglutide-related ADEs for each dosage form, summarizing data from 1,613 cases of subcutaneous injections and 201 cases of oral formulations. Notably, serious outcomes such as blindness were reported in 4.98% of all Rybelsus (oral form) cases and 4.28% of Wegovy and/or Ozempic (injectable forms) cases. For ocular ADEs, blurred vision in patients using Rybelsus constituted 34.33% of the total ADEs, which was marginally higher than that observed with the injectable forms Wegovy and/or Ozempic at 26.84%. Conversely, visual impairment was less frequently reported in patients receiving oral therapy (18.91%) compared to those receiving subcutaneous injections (24.30%). Figure 4 a and b display the top 30 PTs with the highest proportions of semaglutide-related reports in the oral and subcutaneous markets, respectively, accompanied by ROR calculations for these signals. Among the subcutaneous PTs, the most notable included cataract (6.08%), diabetic retinopathy (4.71%), and blindness (4.28%). For oral formulations, the most significant adverse events reported were blindness (4.98%), diabetic retinopathy (3.98%), and ocular hemorrhage (2.99%). These findings highlight differential risk profiles associated with the routes of semaglutide administration.

The overall purpose of the current investigation was to establish dosing recommendations for oral semaglutide to ensure clinically relevant semaglutide exposure with an acceptable safety profile without compromising compliance in patients' daily life. Results from two consecutive trials are presented demonstrating how the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide are affected (1) by different combinations of water volume with dosing and duration of post-dose fasting (the dosing conditions trial) and (2) by dosing in the fed state (the food-effect trial). In the food-effect trial, two of the investigated dosing conditions (fed and fasting) were according to guidelines on the investigation of food effect, while a third arm (reference) was included in which dosing conditions reflected those used in the oral semaglutide phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.

Safety Profile of Oral Semaglutide

As a result of the stimulation of GLP-1 receptors in the GI tract, semaglutide may directly influence GI motility, secretion, and sensitivity, contributing to GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, and abdominal discomfort. It also affects delaying gastric emptying, slowing the absorption of nutrients, but also causing feelings of fullness, bloating, and nausea.

GI side effects typically range from mild to moderate in severity, often occur temporarily, commonly beginning during the period of initiation and dose escalation and typically resolving after reaching the maintenance dose. The safety profile of oral semaglutide across the PIONEER clinical trials was consistent with the known profile of the GLP-1 RA class. Interruption of therapy as a result of GI tolerability issues was reported in 2–12% of patients in oral semaglutide groups.

The most frequently reported adverse events are GI manifestations such as nausea (15%), diarrhea (10%), and vomiting (7%). Data on side effects from observational studies are more heterogeneous. The diverse nature of real-world settings, patient populations, and treatment protocols in this type of study can contribute to a more varied and less standardized collection of side effect data. This variability may stem from differences in patient demographics, comorbidities, treatment adherence, and other factors, making the findings less uniform or consistent compared to the more controlled conditions of clinical trials.

In the Italian study by Candido et al. GI adverse events, nausea, and diarrhea were reported by 6.2% of patients, while hypoglycemic episodes occurred in 3% of patients. Discontinuation of oral semaglutide occurred in 10% of patients over 6 months; among these patients, almost 80% were due to an adverse event.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdoses have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Effects have included severe nausea, severe vomiting, and severe hypoglycemia. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms. In the event of an overdose of WEGOVY, consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. A prolonged period of observation and treatment for these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the long half-life of WEGOVY of approximately 1 week.

Adverse events with oral GLP-1 RA

Similar to injectable GLP-1 RA, the most common AE with oral GLP-1 RA were gastrointestinal which were mild to moderate in severity (Tables 2 and 3, safety outcomes). In the OASIS-1 study, 13% of participants (people with obesity without diabetes) receiving oral semaglutide 50 mg experienced "altered skin sensation" events compared to 1% with placebo - these events were generally mild to moderate in severity, occurred during dose escalation to the higher doses and resolved without requiring permanent treatment discontinuation. The "altered skin sensation" has not been reported in the PIONEER-PLUS study or with injectable semaglutide 2.4 mg and its aetiology will need to be explored further in future studies.

AE leading to discontinuation of treatment were 6–13% with semaglutide 50 mg once daily in phase 3 trials (vs. 4–10% with placebo) and 10–21% with orforglipron in phase 2 trials (vs. 2–6% with placebo, Tables 2 and 3). The percentages of participants who experienced AE leading to treatment discontinuation as well as of those who experienced gastrointestinal AE with oral semaglutide 50 mg (Tables 2 and 3) were similar to those observed with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (in STEP-1 and STEP-2 trials 6–7% discontinued treatment due to AE, 34–44% experienced nausea, 21–32% diarrhoea and 22–25% vomiting).

For orforglipron, participants initiated on higher doses and those on rapid titration schemes appeared to have higher discontinuation rates, providing insights into the optimisation process for the phase 3 trials.

For danuglipron, most AE were mild in severity at the phase 2 trial for people with T2D, but 22–34% of participants receiving the higher doses (≥ 80 mg twice daily) discontinued the medication due to AE (vs. 8% with placebo, Table 3). As the discontinuation rates were also high with the twice daily danuglipron at the phase 2 obesity trial (as discussed above), twice daily danuglirpon formulation will not advance into phase 3 studies, but an improved once-daily formulation with an aim to improve tolerability profile is currently under assessment. Another oral, non-peptide GLP-1 RA (lotiglipron) has also been withdrawn from development as in early phase clinical trials resulted in elevated liver enzymes which could indicate liver toxicity.

Safety of Orally Administered Semaglutide

The most common adverse effect observed in all PIONEER studies are gastrointestinal-related, dose-dependent and manifested as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Across the PIONEER trials around 15–23% of patients experienced nausea with orally administered semaglutide 14 mg, and approximately 7–15% of patients on 14 mg orally administered semaglutide discontinued the trial. Approximately 5–7% of patients experienced decrease in appetite, which was consistent across the PIONEER trials.

When it comes to outcomes and safety measures in different age groups, an exploratory analysis of seven PIONEER trials was done; including PIONEER 1–5, 7 and 8, a total of 5657 patients were included in the analysis. This exploratory analysis evaluated the effect of age at baseline on efficacy (< 45, ≥ 45 to < 65, or ≥ 65 years) and safety (< 65 years and ≥ 65 years). In terms of safety, generally more events and events leading to discontinuation were reported in the patient group aged of 65 years or more. This is in line with what has been seen with other GLP-1 RAs.

### Oral semaglutide: the first-available noninjectable glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist [^112KyZ6K]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There are roughly 30 million Americans diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), with nearly 95% of these cases being type 2 (T2)-DM. The American Diabetes Association continues to recommend metformin as the first-line initial treatment of T2DM, in combination with lifestyle modifications; yet, many require multiple therapies to achieve adequate glycemic control. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, adding a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist is a preferred treatment option; however, many patients are apprehensive about injecting medications. Semaglutide is the first oral option in this life-saving medication class. The purpose of this article was to review the pharmacology, clinical trials, safety profile, along with recommended dosing and costs, of oral semaglutide used for managing patients with T2DM.

Methods

A search through the PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane libraries was conducted for literature published from January 2017 through December 2020, using the key word semaglutide. Articles were selected if they were related to the approval of oral semaglutide or provided novel clinical information regarding this drug entity in its oral dosage formulation.

Findings

Three Phase II studies of the pharmacokinetic properties and Phase III trials from the PIONEER series were ultimately selected, as these trials were thought to provide pivotal information to the US Food and Drug Administration for the approval of oral semaglutide.

Implications

On review of the literature, it appeared that semaglutide is a viable option in treating T2DM. The use of this medication has been associated with glycosylated hemoglobin lowering similar to that with the injectable medication in its same class. Semaglutide was also showed some potential in preventing cardiovascular events as well as increasing weight loss.

### Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) [^112qnRVH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

11 DESCRIPTION

RYBELSUS tablets, for oral use, contain semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. The peptide backbone is produced by yeast fermentation. The main protraction mechanism of semaglutide is albumin binding, facilitated by modification of position 26 lysine with a hydrophilic spacer and a C18 fatty di-acid. Furthermore, semaglutide is modified in position 8 to provide stabilization against degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4). A minor modification was made in position 34 to ensure the attachment of only one fatty di-acid. The molecular formula is C187H291N45O59and the molecular weight is 4113.58 g/mol.

Structural formula:

Semaglutide is a white to almost white hygroscopic powder.

Each tablet of:

RYBELSUS (formulation R1) contains 3 mg, 7 mg or 14 mg of semaglutide and the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone and salcaprozate sodium (SNAC).
RYBELSUS (formulation R2) contains 1.5 mg, 4 mg or 9 mg of semaglutide and the following inactive ingredients: SNAC and magnesium stearate.

### Association between various dosage forms of semaglutide and ocular adverse events in a real-world setting [^113TDjyJ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study systematically compares the risk of long-term ocular adverse events between subcutaneous and oral semaglutide preparations to assess pathway-specific safety differences.

Methods

In this study, the Report odds ratio (ROR) technique was employed to detect signals of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of semaglutide. Analysis was conducted on data extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, covering the period from 2004(Q1) through 2024(Q3). This investigation encompasses a descriptive analysis focused on the administration of semaglutide through various routes, encompassing a broad range of demographics including gender (male and female), age groups, along with other demographic data and the timing of disease onset. Following this, the study employs the ROR methodology to assess the differential adverse event signals across distinct semaglutide formulations.

Results

We categorized the eye as the System Organ Class (SOC) and obtained 1733 ADE reports related to it from the FAERS database. Of these, 1541 reports were associated with injectables, while tablets were linked to 192 ADE reports. In both dosage forms, most cases occurred within the first month of administration, although the median time to onset (TTO) differed, with injectables identified at 7.00 [IQR 0.00–56.00] days and tablets at only 3.50 [IQR 0.00–35.00] days. It is worth noting that 5.41% of patients administered subcutaneous injections and 2.17% of those receiving oral medications reported ADEs following one year of treatment with semaglutide. Furthermore, female patients exhibited a higher susceptibility to ocular adverse reactions compared to their male counterparts. Regarding the primary preferred terms (PTs), blurred vision constitutes 34.33% of the total ADEs associated with tablet formulations. This incidence is marginally higher than that observed with injectable formulations. This investigation further discerned ocular ADEs signals associated with specific formulations: subcutaneous injections have a higher frequency of reports concerning retinal complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal detachment, retinal tear, and retinal hemorrhage.

Conclusion

The results of this study identified a significant difference between subcutaneous and oral semaglutide in ocular ADE risk, providing some evidence for dosage form selection and risk monitoring for clinical use.

Adverse effects of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in T2DM: Both classes of agents have notable side effects as well as associated adverse events. GLP-1 RA use is associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) that often are mild, resolve over time, and can be modulated by appropriate patient selection (avoiding gastroparesis). A risk of cholelithiasis and acute cholecystitis increases slightly with dose and duration of treatment; no increased risk of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or hypoglycemia with GLP-1 RA use was noted. Injectable semaglutide is associated with a slightly increased risk of progression of diabetic eye complications, theorized to reflect rapid improvement in glycemic control. SGLT-2 inhibitor use has been associated with an increased risk of mycotic genital infections (typically mild and easily treated) and a slightly increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, which can largely be mitigated with education not to take when oral intake is diminished, the patient is feeling unwell, during acute illness, before surgery, or combinations of these.

### Meeting the challenge of virtual diabetes care: a consensus viewpoint on the positioning and value of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice [^116ggQjk]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide has also not been established in the paediatric setting and is therefore not indicated for those aged < 18 years. There is also no documented experience of treating people with congestive HF, NHYA (New York Heart Association) class VI, and as such treatment in this population should not be considered.

Oral semaglutide is contraindicated in pregnant women due to the potential risk to the foetus; treatment should only be considered in instances where treatment benefit justifies the risk to the foetus. Oral semaglutide should be discontinued at least 2 months before planned pregnancy due to the long washout period associated with this drug. Improved glycaemic control and weight loss afforded by oral semaglutide has the potential to improve fertility, and patients should be informed of this benefit if they are planning a pregnancy in the future, although they should be warned to avoid conception whilst taking the drug. Oral semaglutide is not recommended in women who are lactating. There are no data regarding the presence of semaglutide in breast milk, although in animal studies it was demonstrated that semaglutide and its excipients or associated metabolites were present.

GLP-1 RAs have a well-recognised effect on gastric emptying. Consequently, we would not advocate the use of oral semaglutide in people with T2D and established gastroparesis.

5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Use of WEGOVY has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In WEGOVY clinical trials in adults for weight reduction, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving WEGOVY (4.1%) than placebo (0.9%).

WEGOVY is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis.

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported with WEGOVY. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of WEGOVY, treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. WEGOVY is contraindicated in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to semaglutide or to any of the excipients in WEGOVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with WEGOVY.

Furthermore, in this analysis, there was no evidence of a temporal association between the incidence of GI AEs and weight loss at EOT. The prevalence of GI AEs with GLP-1RA treatment was previously found to peak within the initial 12 weeks of treatment and decline thereafter. However, subjects in all treatment arms experienced weight loss between baseline and week 12, and from baseline to EOT (SUSTAIN 3, week 56; SUSTAIN 7, week 40; SUSTAIN 10, week 30).

Excess weight is an important contributing factor in the complex etiology of T2D, and BW control is an important factor in the individualized management of T2D.GLP-1RAs are established and effective therapies for T2D and can be prescribed at all stages of T2D. In addition to managing glucose levels, GLP-1RAs also reduce BW, and this potential for weight loss has been reflected by the GLP-1RA liraglutide (3.0 mg once daily) gaining approval as a treatment for obesity. Because GI AEs including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea are the most common type of AE with GLP-1RAs, it is important to establish whether the weight loss difference between treatment is mediated through the occurrence of GI AEs.

Conclusions

Confirmation of bioequivalence in the present study provides support that the safety profile and efficacy of each dose level of once-daily 2G oral semaglutide (1.5, 4 and 9 mg), in terms of reductions in HbA 1c and body weight, will be equivalent to the corresponding dose level of once-daily 1G oral semaglutide (3, 7 and 14 mg), therefore allowing switching from the 1G to the 2G formulation.

Persons on Once-Weekly GLP1RA

People who switch from once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide should start oral semaglutide 7 days after their last injection. Similar principles, as detailed above, apply to the choice of dose of initiation. A prescription of oral semaglutide that is started in response to lack of tolerability should begin with 3 mg daily. However, if oral semaglutide is chosen owing to lack of efficacy of current therapy, one may commence with 7 mg/day.

Once-weekly semaglutide has been compared with oral semaglutide, i.e. 0.5 mg once-weekly semaglutide with 7 mg of oral semaglutide. However, the difference in the impact on weight should be explained to the patient.

7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin

RYBELSUS stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving RYBELSUS in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia.

When initiating RYBELSUS, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

7.2 Other Oral Drugs

RYBELSUS causes a delay of gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of other oral drugs. Levothyroxine exposure was increased 33% (90% CI: 125–142) when administered with RYBELSUS in a drug interaction study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

When coadministering RYBELSUS with other oral drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index or that require clinical monitoring, consider increased clinical or laboratory monitoring [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Safety

In the food-effect trial, 167 AEs were reported in 50 subjects (64%). The most frequently reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders (19%, 50% and 27% of subjects in the fed, fasting and reference groups, respectively) and headache (15%, 38% and 35%). Almost all AEs were mild (135 events) or moderate (31 events), while one AE in the fasting group was severe (headache on day 6; assessed as possibly related to trial product by the investigator; the subject recovered after 2 days). No serious AEs were reported in the food-effect trial. One subject in the fed group was withdrawn because of an AE (bacterial infection of the lower left arm on day 3; the subject recovered after 3 days).

In the dosing conditions trial, 599 AEs were reported in 134 subjects (85%). The most frequently reported AEs were gastrointestinal disorders (61% of subjects), which increased in frequency with longer post-dose fasting periods and thus with higher semaglutide exposure. The majority of AEs were mild (470 events) or moderate (128 events). One AE in the 50 mL/60 min group was severe and also serious (acute gastritis on day 16, i.e. 6 days after end of treatment; unlikely related to trial product; the subject recovered after 2 days). A total of four subjects were withdrawn because of AEs occurring after being exposed to trial product (two subjects in the 120 mL/120 min group; one subject in each of the 50 mL/15 min and 50 mL/60 min groups). All were due to gastrointestinal disorders occurring within the first 3 days of dosing.

No severe or confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were reported in the two trials and there were no clinically relevant observations related to vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram or laboratory safety parameters, except temporary asymptomatic increases in lipase levels in two subjects at follow-up in the dosing conditions trial (from 46 U/L at screening to 231 U/L at follow-up and from 59 U/L at screening to 378 U/L at follow-up [normal range 13–60 U/L]). After 7 days, lipase levels had decreased to 59 and 109 U/L, respectively.

### Effect of swallow balloon therapy with the combination of semaglutide oral formulation: a randomised double-blind single-centre study [^1165xtCJ]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a significant public health issue; new therapies and pharmaceutical approaches to weight management are needed.

Objective

This study assesses weight reduction efficacy in the novel swallow balloon procedure and semaglutide, both promising non-surgical and pharmaceutical options, addressing obesity's critical public health challenge.

Methods

This was a computer-generated, blocked randomisation, double-blind, single-centre study. Fifty-seven participants were assigned to swallow balloon therapy group I (with semaglutide), and 58 were assigned to swallow balloon therapy group II (without semaglutide). All treatment doses were orally administered once daily (3 mg for the 1 st month, 7 mg for the 2 nd month, and 14 mg for the 3 rd and 4 th months after the placement of the swallow balloon). All the data were statistically analysed.

Results

The groups were highly well-matched. The %TWL in group I was 7.9%, 12.5%, 15.2%, and 17.6% and in group II was 6.1%, 10.5%, 12.8%, and 13.7% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) were nausea and vomiting, observed within the week. The resolution of T2DM, HTN, and OSA was 64.7% vs 55.5%, 64.3% vs 58.8%, and 72.0 vs 57.8% in groups I vs II, respectively. QoL significantly improved 4 months postoperatively in both groups. No major late complications occurred in either of the groups.

Conclusion

The study supports the efficacy of swallow balloon therapy combined with semaglutide oral formulation in promoting weight loss and improving comorbid conditions. The findings highlight the potential of this combined approach in managing obesity and its associated health issues.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

WEGOVY delays gastric emptying. May impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Use with caution. (7.2)

7.1 Concomitant Use with Insulin or an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea)

WEGOVY lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when WEGOVY is used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas). The addition of WEGOVY in patients treated with insulin has not been evaluated.

When initiating WEGOVY, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

7.2 Oral Medications

WEGOVY causes a delay of gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials with semaglutide 1 mg, semaglutide did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, monitor the effects of oral medications concomitantly administered with WEGOVY.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^115kMvvX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Of note, semaglutide is a unique compound available in both subcutaneous (s.c.) and oral formulations — the latter developed with an absorption enhancer to facilitate gastric uptake. The therapeutic efficacy and GI intolerance associated with the currently approved highest dose of oral semaglutide (14 mg daily) appear to be lower than those observed with the highest approved dose of s.c. semaglutide (1.0 mg weekly). However, a Phase 2 trial demonstrated that higher doses of oral semaglutide (10, 20 and 40 mg) produced reductions in HbA1c, FPG and body weight comparable with those seen with 1.0 mg weekly s.c. semaglutide. These findings suggest that, should future development support the approval of higher‐dose oral semaglutide, it may offer an effective alternative for patients who prefer non‐injectable therapies for diabetes management. However, additional studies would be needed to evaluate the relationship between therapeutic efficacy and GI intolerance with higher doses of oral semaglutide compared with its subcutaneous formulation.

While GI side effects are the most common AEs associated with GLP‐1 RAs, strategies to mitigate these effects have been recommended. For example, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) advises that GLP‐1 RAs should be titrated slowly to mitigate these GI side effects, particularly in older adults or those with pre‐existing GI conditions. Similarly, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommends gradual dose escalation and patient education on meal size to reduce the incidence of these adverse effects. Given the substantial weight loss, glycaemic and cardiovascular benefits consistently demonstrated in randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of long‐acting GLP‐1 RAs, accurately understanding the trade‐offs is essential for practicing evidence‐based medicine in this high‐risk population. In this regard, the current study supports the use of newer incretin mimetics as first‐line options for patients with T2D, particularly those with obesity or difficulty achieving glycaemic control with other therapies. Given their greater efficacy and comparable tolerability, semaglutide and tirzepatide offer a favourable benefit–risk profile that can help address the dual challenges of hyperglycaemia and excess weight. Moreover, the absence of a strong correlation between efficacy and AE rates suggests that clinicians can prioritize more efficacious agents without substantially increasing the risk of treatment discontinuation due to GI AEs.

### Meeting the challenge of virtual diabetes care: a consensus viewpoint on the positioning and value of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice [^1123EsWf]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

While glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as semaglutide, are among the most effective drugs for treating people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), they are clinically under-utilised. Until recently, the only route for semaglutide administration was via subcutaneous injection. However, an oral formulation of semaglutide was recently licensed, with the potential to address therapy inertia and increase patient adherence to treatment, which is essential in controlling blood glucose and reducing complications. The availability of oral semaglutide provides a new option for both clinicians and patients who are reluctant to use an injectable agent. This has been of particular importance in addressing the challenge of virtual diabetes care during the COVID-19 pandemic, circumventing the logistical problems that are often associated with subcutaneous medication administration. However, there remains limited awareness of the clinical and economic value of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice. In this article, we present our consensus opinion on the role of oral semaglutide in routine clinical practice and discuss its value in reducing the burden of delivering diabetes care in the post-COVID-19 pandemic period of chronic disease management.

5.10 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other weight management products. Monitor patients treated with WEGOVY for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Discontinue WEGOVY in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Avoid WEGOVY in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation.

5.11 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation

WEGOVY delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.

Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking WEGOVY, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing WEGOVY could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking WEGOVY.

Oral Medications: OZEMPIC delays gastric emptying. May impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Use with caution (7.2).

7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin

OZEMPIC stimulates insulin release in the presence of elevated blood glucose concentrations. Patients receiving OZEMPIC in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia.

When initiating OZEMPIC, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6)].

7.2 Oral Medications

OZEMPIC causes a delay of gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. In clinical pharmacology trials, semaglutide did not affect the absorption of orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with OZEMPIC.

Suggested Strategies for Optimal Oral Semaglutide Administration

Ensuring that patients who start oral semaglutide therapy receive comprehensive education from their healthcare provider is crucial. This education should encompass various aspects such as instructions on timing and method of administration, expectations regarding efficacy and adverse events, preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of side effects and on how to address them promptly. Thus, thorough patient education not only enhances treatment adherence but also promotes proactive management of potential challenges, ultimately promoting better overall outcomes.

The different aspects, suggested by the experts, to consider in subjects starting therapy with oral semaglutide were the following:
Patient communication Adopt specific and proactive counseling as a key component in the management of patients with T2D initiating oral semaglutide treatment. Recommend and explain the dose escalation strategy, with a starting dose of 3 mg once daily for at least 1 month, which can be then increased to 7 mg. After at least 1 month the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily if needed to further improve glycemic control and body weight. Staying longer than 1 month on the 7-mg dose may help diluting GI side effects, but should not delay the achievement of individual targets. Inform patients about the potential occurrence of GI side effects in the initial weeks of oral semaglutide treatment, particularly during dose escalation periods. Patients should be reassured that in most cases, GI symptoms are mild to moderate and typically resolve naturally over time, encouraging them to persist on treatment.
Method and timing of administration Communicate the specific instructions related to mode of administration and their importance to patients initiating oral semaglutide treatment, to guarantee an effective drug bioavailability. Underline the necessity for a pre-dose fasting condition (enough to have an empty stomach) and observing an additional fasting period of at least 30 min post-dose, along with avoiding pharmacological interactions to allow correct semaglutide absorption. Recommend taking the medication in a time slot based on patient daily routine, when the stomach is empty. Address the patient's lifestyle and needs, to evaluate whether taking oral semaglutide after the overnight fast is the most suitable option or whether an alternative dosing time could be considered. In the latter case, provide the patients with clear written dosing instructions, regarding pre- and post-dose fasting.
Dose escalation schedule Extend the escalation periods beyond the recommended duration, if tolerability concerns arise at lower doses, i.e. maintain longer than 1 month on 7 mg before increasing the dose to 14 mg. Reduce the dose temporarily if adverse events persist and resume dose escalation once the symptoms diminish or resolve.
Presence of diseases or conditions affecting adherence and prescription of therapy. Emphasize adherence to specific administration timing recommendations, such as taking oral semaglutide before any other oral medications and waiting for at least 30 min before other oral medications.
Adherence to recommended eating behaviors for patients with T2D (details reported in Table 1).

The study SOUL was published by Darren K McGuire and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2, Diabetic nephropathy, Chronic kidney disease and Coronary artery disease. In the SOUL study, the trial question was: what is the effect of oral semaglutide in patients with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD? In the SOUL study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SOUL study, the population was: 9650 patients (2790 female, 6860 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients, aged ≥ 50 years, with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD. The key exclusion criteria were ESRD; receipt of long-term RRT; myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris or TIA within the past 60 days; planned coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery revascularization; treatment with any GLP-1 receptor agonist within the past 30 days. In the SOUL study, the interventions were: n = 4825 semaglutide (3 mg once daily as starting dose, with a maximum dose of 14 mg, plus standard care) n = 4825 placebo (matching placebo PO plus standard care). In the SOUL study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in major adverse cardiovascular events (12% vs. 13.8%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96). In the SOUL study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in major kidney disease events (8.4% vs. 9%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.05) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (6.2% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.09) Significant decrease in major adverse limb events (1.5% vs. 2.1%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96). In the SOUL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in acute pancreatitis. significant difference in serious adverse events (47.9% vs. 50.3%). In the SOUL study, the conclusion was: in adult patients, aged ≥ 50 years, with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Superior weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is independent of gastrointestinal adverse events [^114K7WVY]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Potential limitations of this post hoc analysis include its inherent retrospective nature and that it was not sufficiently powered to detect the effects assessed. For example, the small number of subjects per treatment arm in the groups that experienced GI AE; therefore, results should be interpreted in this context. Another possible limitation is the different durations of follow-up for subjects with GI AE in all three trials. In addition, the results should be viewed in the context that SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 were open-label trials and nausea is a subjective symptom. Furthermore, in the mediation analysis, the effect of 'one unit' mediator was assumed to be the same in the treatment arms being compared. Mediation analyses rely on strong, unverifiable assumptions, and the results of the analysis may be biased in case of potential unknown confounders that affect the risk of experiencing GI AEs as well as change in BW.

Introduction

The association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight/obesity is well established, with more than 90% of people with T2D being overweight. Individuals with T2D and overweight/obesity are at increased risk of developing T2D complications compared with people who are not overweight/obese. Body weight (BW) reductions of ≥ 5% improve glycemic control, lipid levels and blood pressure.BW control is an important component of an individualized, multifactorial approach to T2D management, as recommended in current treatment guidelines.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are recommended as second-line therapy (add-on to metformin) where minimizing weight gain, promoting weight loss or when hypoglycemia and cardiovascular risk reduction are considerations. All available GLP-1RAs (dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide and lixisenatide) have demonstrated weight loss in people with T2D. Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk, Denmark) is a GLP-1RA approved for the treatment of T2D as once-weekly (OW) subcutaneousand once-daily oral formulations. The efficacy and safety of OW semaglutide have been established in the global phase 3 SUSTAIN clinical trial program, encompassing subjects from across the continuum of T2D care. In addition to significantly greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), semaglutide demonstrated superior reductions in BW versus all comparators across all SUSTAIN trials.

The SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10 trials compared semaglutide with the GLP-1RAs OW exenatide extended release (exenatide ER), OW dulaglutide and once-daily liraglutide, respectively. In these trials, mean BW loss was significantly greater with semaglutide versus comparators at end of treatment (EOT: weeks 56, 40 and 30 for SUSTAIN 3, 7 and 10, respectively): SUSTAIN 3: –5.6 kg vs –1.9 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs exenatide ER 2.0 mg; SUSTAIN 7: –4.6 kg vs –2.3 kg with semaglutide 0.5 mg vs dulaglutide 0.75 mg and –6.5 kg vs –3.0 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg; SUSTAIN 10: –5.8 kg vs –1.9 kg with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs liraglutide 1.2 mg; all p < 0.0001.

### Efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of once-daily oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: the PIONEER programme [^114quDv6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The PIONEER programme was a robustly designed series of 10 clinical trials and established the premise of oral GLP‐1RA therapy. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Given that injections represent a barrier for some patients and health care providers, the availability of an oral GLP‐1RA should increase the number of eligible patients who receive this effective means of T2D management, and encourage use at an earlier stage. Thus, oral semaglutide addresses an important unmet need in the management of T2D.

In conclusion, the PIONEER programme demonstrated that the novel formulation of oral semaglutide was efficacious across the spectrum of T2D and more effective than comparators for glycaemic control and weight loss. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Tolerability was consistent with the known profile of GLP‐1RAs. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Real‐world data will be required to confirm if the outcomes seen in the PIONEER trials are translated into clinical practice, and whether the availability of semaglutide in an innovative oral formulation will promote earlier and more frequent utilization of the GLP‐1RA class.

### Glycaemic control efficacy of switching from dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors to oral semaglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes: a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparison study (SWITCH-SEMA 2 study) [^112oQRL4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess whether oral semaglutide provides better glycaemic control, compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) continuation, in people with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

In this multicentre, open-label, prospective, randomized, parallel-group comparison study, participants receiving DPP-4is were either switched to oral semaglutide (3–14mg/day) or continued on DPP-4is. The primary endpoint was the change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) over 24weeks. Secondary endpoints included changes in metabolic parameters and biomarkers, along with the occurrence of adverse events. Factors associated with HbA1c improvement were also explored.

Results

In total, 174 eligible participants were enrolled; 17 dropped out of the study. Consequently, 82 participants in the DPP-4i group and 75 participants in the semaglutide group completed the study and were included in the analysis. Improvement in HbA1c at week 24 was significantly greater when switching to semaglutide compared with DPP-4i continuation [-0.65 (95% confidence interval: -0.79, -0.51) vs. +0.05 (95% confidence interval: -0.07, 0.16) (p < .001)]. Body weight, lipid profiles and liver enzymes were significantly improved in the semaglutide group than in the DPP-4i continuation group. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that baseline HbA1c and homeostasis model assessment 2-R were independently associated with HbA1c improvement after switching to semaglutide. Seven participants in the semaglutide group discontinued medication because of gastrointestinal symptoms.

Conclusions

Although the potential for gastrointestinal symptoms should be carefully considered, switching from DPP-4is to oral semaglutide may be beneficial for glycaemic control and metabolic abnormalities in people with higher HbA1c and insulin resistance.

### Oral semaglutide in type 2 diabetes [^116JB1Ra]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Previously, the only available glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were injectable. Approval of oral semaglutide (Rybelsus®) represents the first orally available GLP-1 RA.

Objective

To review the literature and describe pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics properties; clinical safety; and efficacy of oral semaglutide, a newly approved oral GLP-1 RA.

Methods

A MEDLINE (1995-October 2019) and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using the terms oral semaglutide, semaglutide, PIONEER, and a combination of those terms. Reference citations from publications identified were also reviewed. All English-language studies, including abstracts, evaluating oral semaglutide use in humans were included in this review.

Conclusions

The approval of oral semaglutide (Rybelsus®) represents a paradigm shift in the management of T2D as this is the first FDA-approved oral GLP-1 RA. Oral semaglutide may be an attractive option for patients with T2D who require improved glycemic control, would like to lose weight, and who are not interested in injectable therapy. However, the lack of positive cardiovascular (CV) and renal data are significant limitations to its use.

### PIONEER REAL Spain: a multicentre, prospective, real-world study of oral semaglutide use in adults with type 2 diabetes [^112xbmoQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The PIONEER REAL studies investigate the clinical outcomes associated with the use of oral semaglutide treatment as part of routine clinical practice in adults with T2D who have not been treated previously with injectable glucose‐lowering medication. Results from PIONEER REAL Switzerland, Canada, Sweden, Netherlands, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy, as well as a pooled analysisare already available, while studies from Denmark and Italy are expected to be published in the near future. Here we report results from PIONEER REAL Spain (NCT05443334). The primary aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes associated with the use of oral semaglutide. Furthermore, the benefits of taking oral semaglutide in combination with SGLT2is as well as the clinical outcomes following early intervention with oral semaglutide in participants with T2D duration of ≤ 5 years compared to those with T2D duration of > 5 years were investigated.

Persons on Daily Injectable GLP1RA

Persons on daily injectable GLP1RA (exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide) who interchange to oral semaglutide may take their first dose the day after discontinuation of previous therapy. As mentioned by Evans et al. a detailed explanation of the method of drug administration must be shared with the patient. Oral semaglutide usage may be associated with gastrointestinal side effects, but these are usually mild and transient.

If this interchange is prompted by lack of tolerability, oral semaglutide should be initiated at 3 mg/day for 1 month, after which the dose can be up-titrated. If the shift is due to lack of efficacy of 10 µg twice daily (BD) exenatide, 20 µg once daily (OD) lixisenatide, or 1.2 mg once daily (OD) liraglutide, one may consider initiating oral semaglutide at 7 mg/day. While some experts propose a 14 mg/day starting dosage for persons on 1.8 mg liraglutide, we suggest a more cautious approach, to minimize potential side effects and ensure patient comfort. These suggestions are based only on expert opinion of the authors and previously published suggestions.

If the switch is requested for reasons of convenience, i.e. to avoid injectable therapy, a 3 mg oral semaglutide dose can be used to substitute for 5 µg BD exenatide, 10 µg OD lixisenatide, or 0.6 mg OD liraglutide. Although the manufacturers do not provide equivalent doses of different GLP-1RAs, these have been proposed previously by other experts. People on a higher dose of these injectables can be directly transitioned to 7 mg oral semaglutide.

### Oral TIX100 protects against obesity-associated glucose intolerance and diet-induced adiposity [^112hqUXF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glucagon‐like peptide 1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists and dual agonists/ incretin mimetics such as semaglutide and tirzepatide seem to have revolutionized the treatment of obesity and T2D based on their dramatic effects on weight loss. However, after the initial excitement, it has become apparent that while being powerful and beneficial for some patients, this approach may not be sustainable for others. This is primarily due to the associated gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, delayed gastric emptying, and gastrointestinal paralysis that in severe cases resulted in ileus, as well as concomitant loss of lean mass, and necessity to continue the subcutaneous injections indefinitely. This underlines the remaining need for novel oral medications with different, milder effects to improve obesity‐associated impairment in glucose homeostasis long‐term, especially given the ever growing number of people affected by diabetes and prediabetes.

### Effect of various dosing conditions on the pharmacokinetics of oral semaglutide, a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in a tablet formulation [^117Ct2ic]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

There were no unexpected safety findings in the two trials, and the safety profile of oral semaglutide was consistent with the GLP-1 RA drug class. The slightly higher number of AEs in the dosing conditions trial compared with the food-effect trial, particularly gastrointestinal AEs, may be explained by the difference in dosing regimen between the two trials. In the dosing conditions trial, subjects received 10 mg oral semaglutide on all 10 days of treatment. On the basis of learnings from that trial, the oral semaglutide dose in the subsequent food-effect trial was gradually increased from 5 mg during the first 5 days to 10 mg during the last 5 days to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Stepwise dose escalation was also applied in the phase 2 and 3 trials with oral semaglutide, leading to fewer events of nausea.

A strength of the two trial designs was that several different dosing conditions were tested in a controlled setting, thereby gaining a better understanding of potential food–drug interactions for oral semaglutide in order to establish acceptable dosing instructions for oral semaglutide. Another strength was that all doses of oral semaglutide were administered at the clinic, thereby optimising compliance to the specified dosing conditions.

A limitation of the current trials is that translation to clinical practice should be made with caution, as is always the case for results obtained in an experimental setting. Another limitation is that the pharmacokinetic assessments on the 10th day of dosing in the current trials do not fully reflect the steady-state situation achieved with continuous once-daily dosing in the clinical setting because of the long half-life of approximately 1 week for oral semaglutide. On the other hand, regulatory guidelines recommend that the effect of food is investigated in a single-dose trial. This option, however, would not be feasible for oral semaglutide because of the degree of within-subject day-to-day variability in absorption. During once-daily dosing of oral semaglutide, the within-subject day-to-day variability in exposure is reduced owing to overlapping exposure from sequential daily administrations as a result of the long half-life of oral semaglutide. Thus, 10 days of dosing in a parallel-group design as done in the two current trials was assessed to be the best possible compromise considering both clinical feasibility and regulatory guideline recommendations.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data with RYBELSUS use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are clinical considerations regarding the risks of poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be potential risks to the fetus from exposure to RYBELSUS during pregnancy. RYBELSUS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

In pregnant rats administered semaglutide during organogenesis, embryofetal mortality, structural abnormalities and alterations to growth occurred at maternal exposures below the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on AUC. In rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys administered semaglutide during organogenesis, early pregnancy losses and structural abnormalities were observed at exposure below the MRHD (rabbit) and ≥ 10-fold the MRHD (monkey). These findings coincided with a marked maternal body weight loss in both animal species (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with a HbA1c > 10. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### Effect of oral semaglutide on energy intake, appetite, control of eating and gastric emptying in adults living with obesity: a randomized controlled trial [^115wu4pd]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the effects of once-daily oral semaglutide 50mg on energy intake, appetite, control of eating and gastric emptying.

Methods

A clinical pharmacology, double-blind study was conducted in 61 adults with obesity randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (dose-escalated to 50mg) or placebo for 20weeks. Energy intake was measured during an ad libitum lunch, and participant-reported appetite ratings and Control of Eating Questionnaire responses were assessed. Gastric emptying was measured using paracetamol absorption following a standardized breakfast.

Results

The relative change from baseline in ad libitum energy intake at week 20 (primary endpoint) was -39.2% points (95% confidence interval -59.0%, -19.4%) with semaglutide compared with placebo. Body weight was reduced by 9.8% with semaglutide and by 1.5% with placebo. Semaglutide reduced hunger, increased fullness and satiety, and was associated with fewer food cravings and better control of eating versus placebo. No statistically significant difference in gastric emptying was observed at week 20.

Conclusions

In participants with obesity, once-daily oral semaglutide 50mg reduced energy intake, body weight and appetite, and improved control of eating. There was no evidence of delayed gastric emptying at week 20, as measured through paracetamol absorption.

### Hydrogen sulfide | ToxFAQs ™ | ATSDR… [^111EuW2f]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Spanish: Sulfuro de hidrógeno CAS#: 7783–06–4 PDF Versionpdf icon. Hydrogen sulfide is a flammable, colorless gas that smells like rotten eggs. People usually can smell hydrogen sulfide at low concentrations in air ranging from 0. 0005 to
0. 3 parts per million. It is often referred to as sewer gas or stink damp. The odors emitted from the gas become noticeable at low levels. But people lose the ability to smell the gas after about 2 to 15 minutes of exposure at about 100 ppm, which makes the odor an ineffective hazard warning for the presence of hydrogen sulfide gas. Eye, nose, or throat irritation can occur to long term at low exposure concentrations of H2S. Some asthmatics may have difficulty breathing and experience headaches, nauseas, and vomiting. Some of these symptoms may resolve when the exposure is removed.

People can lose their sense of smell or lose consciousness from short exposures at moderate or high concentrations. In some cases, the effects go away when exposure is removed. However, in some individuals, long-term or permanent effects may occur. Hydrogen sulfide has not been shown to cause cancer in humans, and its possible ability to cause cancer in animals has not been studied thoroughly. Exposed children probably will experience effects similar to those experienced by exposed adults. Whether children are more sensitive to hydrogen sulfide exposure than adults is not known. It is not known whether hydrogen sulfide causes birth defects in people. The results of studies in animals suggest that exposure to low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide during. pregnancy does not cause birth defects. Hydrogen sulfide and its breakdown products can be measured in blood and urine.

However, the detection of hydrogen sulfide or its metabolites cannot predict the kind of health effects that might develop from that exposure. Because hydrogen sulfide and its metabolites. leave the body fairly rapidly, the tests need to be conducted soon after exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration set an acceptable ceiling limit of 20 ppm for hydrogen sulfide in workplace air. The ceiling limit is a 15-minute time-weighted average that cannot be exceeded at any time.

### What you need to know about egg safety… [^115EBfcA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What is Salmonella. Salmonella, the name of a group of bacteria, is a common cause of food poisoning in the United States. Most people infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, and vomiting 12 to 72 hours after infection. Symptoms usually last 4 to 7 days and most people get better without treatment. However, in some people, the diarrhea may be so severe that they need to be hospitalized. In these patients, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated quickly with antibiotics. Certain people are at greater risk for severe illness and include children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.

FDA requires all cartons of shell eggs that have not been treated to destroy Salmonella to carry this safe handling statement: Safe Handling Instructions To prevent illness from bacteria: keep eggs refrigerated, cook eggs until yolks are firm, and cook foods containing eggs thoroughly. Eggs that have been treated to destroy Salmonella–by in-shell pasteurization, for example–are not required to carry safe handling instructions, but the labeling will usually say that they have been treated. Salmonella, by pasteurization or another approved method, or pasteurized egg products. A NOTE ABOUT EASTER EGGS Easter eggs should be hard-boiled before coloring. Do NOT eat them after hiding or playing with them. Bacteria and viruses picked up on the shells can be transferred to the edible part of the egg. About Foodborne Illness Know the Symptoms Consuming dangerous foodborne bacteria will usually cause illness within 1 to 3 days of eating the contaminated food.

However, sickness can also occur within 20 minutes or up to 6 weeks later. Although most people will recover from a foodborne illness within a short period of time, some can develop chronic, severe, or even life-threatening health problems. Foodborne illness can sometimes be confused with other illnesses that have similar symptoms. The symptoms of foodborne illness can include:

- Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain
- Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and body ache.

### Arsine | Chemical emergencies… [^114og3oD]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Background Arsine is a colorless, flammable, non-irritating toxic gas with a mild garlic odor. Arsine is formed when arsenic comes in contact with an acid. Arsine is similar to a gas called stibine, which is formed when the metal antimony comes in contact with an acid. Stibine has health effects similar to those of arsine, but it is not as widely available. Stibine also has a noticeable "rotten egg" smell. Signs and symptoms The effects of arsine poisoning depend on how much arsine a person was exposed to and how long the exposure was. Depending on the level of exposure to arsine, symptoms are likely to occur within the first 24 hours after exposure. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to arsine.

Exposure to low or moderate dose:

- Confusion, drowsiness, fatigue, and/or weakness
- Headache
- Muscle cramps
- Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain
- Rapid breathing or shortness of breath
- Red or dark urine
- Yellow skin and eyes Exposure to a large dose:

- Convulsions
- Loss of consciousness
- Paralysis
- Respiratory compromise, possibly leading to death. Exposure Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after arsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the skin. At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it has no smell. At higher amounts, a mild garlic smell. On the other hand, stibine has a strong smell, so people may notice that they may have been exposed. Treatment Treatment involves providing supportive medical care in a hospital.

Blood transfusions and intravenous fluids may be needed. Some people may need to have their blood cleaned by a machine if their kidneys fail. This process is called dialysis. Long-term health effects If people survive the first exposure, long-term effects may include:

- Kidney damage
- Numbness and pain in the hands and feet
- Neuropsychological symptoms.

### Salmonella and food… [^114cKHV6]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Salmonella and Food What You Need to Know Salmonellaare bacteria that can make you sick. Salmonellacan be found in a variety of foods, including chicken, beef, pork, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and even processed foods.
- Some people are more likely to get an infection and serious illness.
- You can take steps to prevent infection, such as following the clean, separate, cook, and chill guidelines. Watch AJ's story to find out what happened when he got sick with antibiotic-resistant Salmonella from eating chicken. Food that is contaminated with Salmonella or other harmful germs usually looks, tastes, and smells normal. That's why it's important to know how to prevent infection. Causes of Salmonella Infection You can get a Salmonella infection from a variety of foods, including chicken, turkey, beef, pork, eggs, fruits, sprouts, other vegetables, and even processed foods, such as nut butters, frozen pot pies, and stuffed chicken entrees. Some recent.

Salmonella Symptoms. Symptoms usually start 6 hours to 6 days after infection. They include diarrhea that can be bloody, fever, and stomach cramps. Most people recover within 4 to 7 days without antibiotic treatment. But some people with severe diarrhea may need to be hospitalized or take antibiotics. Salmonella illness can be serious. Call the doctor if you have:

- Diarrhea and a fever higher than 102°F
- Diarrhea for more than 3 days that is not improving
- Bloody stools
- Prolonged vomiting that prevents you from keeping liquids down
- Signs of dehydration, such as:

- Making very little urine
- Dry mouth and throat
- Dizziness when standing up. Clean
- Wash hands with soap and clean, running water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food, especially after touching raw or undercooked eggs, meat, poultry, seafood, or their juices.
- Wash utensils, cutting boards, dishes, and countertops with hot, soapy water, especially after they've touched raw or undercooked eggs, meat, poultry, seafood, or their juices.
- Don't wash raw poultry, meat, or seafood before cooking. Washing can spread germs to other foods, utensils, and surfaces.
