## Question

Antirealism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antirealism in medicine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining antirealism and distinguishing it from related positions like instrumentalism and constructivism. Then, I should verify where antirealism shows up in medicine, especially psychiatry, evidence-based medicine, and global health. Next, I will examine the arguments for and against antirealism in these domains, including the pessimistic induction and coherence theory. After that, I need to consider clinical implications and practical responses, such as pluralism, values-based medicine, and anti-racist praxis. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced conclusion and note limitations and uncertainties that could change my view if new evidence emerges.

> Let me first confirm the core definition so I don't conflate terms. Antirealism, in philosophy of science, denies that scientific theories aim at or achieve correspondence to a mind-independent reality; instead, theories are tools for prediction, organization, or social negotiation rather than mirrors of nature, which contrasts with scientific realism that asserts approximate truth about unobservable entities and processes.

> Hold on, I should verify the variants that often get lumped together. Instrumentalism treats theories as useful instruments without claiming truth, constructivism emphasizes social construction of knowledge, and pragmatism judges theories by practical consequences; these are related but not identical, and in medicine they manifest differently across diagnostics, therapeutics, and policy, so I need to keep them analytically distinct while noting overlaps.

> Next, I will examine where antirealism appears in medicine, starting with psychiatry. The field has long debated whether psychiatric disorders correspond to natural kinds or are pragmatic constructs; the pessimistic induction — given the history of abandoned diagnoses — supports an antirealist stance toward current nosology, while some argue for a limited realism grounded in coherence with converging evidence rather than correspondence to discrete entities [^113eFMze] [^111gCjjN].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis for that claim. The argument that psychiatric categories are historically contingent and would likely differ if we reran history is explicitly made in contemporary philosophy of psychiatry, and it undermines strong realist claims for DSM/ICD entities; this is where antirealist or instrumentalist views gain traction, though many clinicians adopt a pragmatic pluralism that accepts provisional categories while acknowledging their constructed elements [^113eFMze] [^111gCjjN].

> I will now examine evidence-based medicine, because I need to check whether EBM's hierarchy of evidence implies a realist commitment. Critics argue that EBM's emphasis on RCTs and meta-analyses presumes a mechanistic, context-independent model of disease and treatment, which can obscure patient-specific meanings and social determinants; this has prompted calls to integrate qualitative evidence and lived experience, aligning with more constructivist or pragmatist epistemologies [^111cVNp3] [^113pFMHk] [^115d8kmB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about EBM being uniformly realist. Some defenders note that EBM explicitly calls for clinical judgment and patient preferences, but the critique persists that its methods and metrics privilege population-level efficacy over individual phenomenology and context, reinforcing a tacit realism about average effects while underplaying variability and meaning [^1127yYbd] [^111cVNp3].

> Next, I should review global health and anti-racist praxis, where antirealism intersects with decolonial and critical theory. Scholars argue that dominant global health frameworks often naturalize power relations and epistemic hierarchies that privilege Northern expertise and devalue local knowledges; antiracist and anti-colonial praxis therefore challenge the presumed objectivity of these frameworks and advocate for plural, situated knowledges and equitable partnerships [^111fa81T] [^112bidS4] [^113CB35k].

> Let me consider the arguments for antirealism in medicine more systematically. The pessimistic induction remains central: many once-accepted medical entities and treatments have been overturned, so we should be cautious about claiming truth for current theories; coherence theories of truth offer a more modest standard, whereby medical constructs are justified to the extent they fit with converging evidence across levels, even if they do not map onto immutable natural kinds [^111gCjjN] [^113eFMze].

> But wait, what if antirealism undermines clinical confidence and public trust? I need to ensure I weigh counterarguments. Realists argue that medicine requires commitment to the reality of disease mechanisms to justify interventions, and that antirealism risks sliding into relativism; however, many philosophers of medicine propose a pragmatic middle ground that accepts provisional realism for clinical action while remaining epistemically humble and open to revision as evidence evolves [^113eFMze] [^111ZroPz].

> I should double-check the clinical implications so I don't overgeneralize. Antirealist perspectives support greater integration of qualitative research, patient narratives, and social determinants into decision-making; they also align with values-based medicine and shared decision-making that treat patients' goals and meanings as co-constitutive of evidence, not mere add-ons to a realist evidence base [^111cVNp3] [^113DTSmL] [^115d8kmB].

> Let me think about practical responses that incorporate antirealist insights without abandoning science. Pluralism in psychiatric explanation — biological, psychological, and social — is increasingly endorsed to reflect multi-level causation and lived experience; similarly, realist evaluation and complexity-sensitive methods in implementation science emphasize "what works, for whom, and why" in context, bridging universal claims with local realities [^115C9b5C] [^1146Pkda] [^112s2NwW].

> I should confirm how antiracist praxis operationalizes these ideas. Institutions are urged to conduct annual "How is racism operating here?" reviews, embed restorative justice processes, and treat race as a social construct in clinical algorithms; these steps reflect an antirealist stance toward race-as-biology and a constructivist commitment to examining how categories and practices perpetuate harm [^11737Woo] [^116BwWeh] [^1134mSJr].

> Hold on, I should verify the limitations of antirealism so I don't overstate its reach. Antirealism does not imply that all knowledge is equally valid or that evidence hierarchies should be discarded; rather, it calls for reflexive, context-aware use of evidence and explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty, which can coexist with rigorous empirical methods and scientific integrity [^115gMaS2] [^111cVNp3].

> In summary, antirealism in medicine manifests as skepticism toward correspondence theories of truth for disease categories and treatments, emphasizing the constructed, provisional, and context-dependent nature of medical knowledge. It supports methodological pluralism, patient-centeredness, and anti-oppressive praxis, while remaining compatible with pragmatic clinical realism that acts on the best available evidence while staying open to revision [^113eFMze] [^111cVNp3] [^111fa81T].

Antirealism in medicine is the view that **medical knowledge is constructed** rather than discovered, shaped by social, cultural, and historical contexts rather than reflecting a mind-independent reality [^113nCiBR]. It emphasizes that diagnoses, treatments, and evidence hierarchies are **not purely objective** but are influenced by values, power, and context, leading to calls for pluralism, patient-centeredness, and equity in practice and research [^115C9b5C] [^111cVNp3]. Antirealism does not deny science but urges humility, reflexivity, and integration of diverse perspectives to improve care and reduce bias [^115gMaS2] [^112bidS4].

---

## Philosophical foundations of antirealism in medicine

Antirealism in medicine draws from **constructivism**, **pragmatism**, and **relativism**, arguing that medical knowledge is shaped by human interpretation and context rather than mirroring a fixed reality [^113eFMze] [^113nCiBR]. Key claims include:

- **Constructivism**: Medical categories (e.g. disease, disorder) are socially constructed and reflect cultural values, history, and power relations [^113eFMze] [^116mBkMv].
- **Pragmatism**: Truth is what works in practice; medical theories are judged by utility, not correspondence to an objective reality [^111ZroPz] [^111gCjjN].
- **Relativism**: Knowledge is context-dependent; what counts as valid evidence or best practice varies by culture, setting, and perspective [^113nCiBR] [^114kpQ56].

## Manifestations of antirealism in medical practice

Antirealism is evident in several areas of medicine:

| **Domain** | **Manifestations of antirealism** |
|-|-|
| Psychiatry | - Diagnostic categories (e.g. DSM) are historically contingent and culturally shaped [^113eFMze] [^116mBkMv] <br/> - Mental disorders reflect social norms and values, not purely biological entities [^115C9b5C] [^116mBkMv] |
| Evidence-based medicine (EBM) | - EBM's hierarchy of evidence reflects specific epistemic values and may exclude patient experiences and qualitative insights [^113pFMHk] [^111cVNp3] <br/> - Calls to integrate diverse evidence types and patient values [^111cVNp3] [^115d8kmB] |
| Global health | - Western-centric models often ignore local knowledge and perpetuate colonial power dynamics [^112bidS4] [^113CB35k] <br/> - Emphasis on decolonizing knowledge and valuing indigenous perspectives [^112bidS4] [^112meKcD] |
| Clinical guidelines | - Guidelines reflect expert consensus and cultural values, not absolute truths [^notfound] <br/> - Ongoing debates about bias, representation, and applicability across populations [^116BwWeh] |

## Implications for medical research and clinical decision-making

Antirealism has **significant implications**:

- **Research methodology**: Encourages pluralism in methods, including qualitative, participatory, and mixed-methods approaches [^111cVNp3] [^113nCiBR].
- **Clinical judgment**: Highlights the role of intuition, experience, and patient values alongside evidence [^116KBB9v] [^111cVNp3].
- **Ethics**: Underscores the need for reflexivity, cultural competence, and attention to power dynamics in care [^112bidS4] [^114EKHzm].

---

## Critiques and challenges of antirealism

Antirealism faces several critiques:

- **Relativism risk**: May undermine scientific authority and lead to harmful practices if all views are equally valid [^notfound].
- **Practical constraints**: Clinicians still need reliable, generalizable knowledge to guide decisions [^111cVNp3].
- **Balance**: Many advocate a middle ground that integrates evidence with context, values, and patient preferences [^113DTSmL] [^111cVNp3].

---

## Contemporary relevance and future directions

Antirealism is highly relevant today, informing efforts to **address bias**, **promote equity**, and **enhance patient-centered care**. Future directions include:

- **Decolonizing medicine**: Challenging Eurocentric epistemologies and integrating diverse knowledge systems [^112bidS4] [^112meKcD].
- **Patient-centered care**: Emphasizing shared decision-making, lived experience, and narrative medicine [^116KBB9v] [^113Xu5yt].
- **Reflexive practice**: Training clinicians to recognize and mitigate their own biases and assumptions [^116mWyzf] [^11737Woo].

---

Antirealism in medicine reminds us that medical knowledge is **not neutral or absolute**; it is constructed, contextual, and value-laden. By acknowledging this, medicine can become more inclusive, equitable, and responsive to diverse patient needs and realities [^113nCiBR] [^115C9b5C].

### Can there be science without philosophy? [^117JpDMs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Over the last few decades, philosophy has gained an increasingly bad reputation among working scientists. Prominent researchers have suggested, in various forms and degrees of mockery, that philosophy has little or nothing positive to contribute to science. This essay provides a response to these allegations. We begin by examining, and ultimately questioning, an influential argument purporting to undermine the significance of a philosophical approach to science. Next, we offer some biomedical examples where philosophical speculation plays a prominent role. We conclude by arguing that, when understood in the appropriate context, philosophical reflection is an important-indeed, integral-ingredient of healthy scientific inquiry.

### Discovering the truth beyond the truth [^113Xu5yt]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2015). Low credibility.

The question "What is truth?" is one of the oldest questions in philosophy. Truth within the field of medicine has gained relevance because of its fundamental relationship to the principle of patient autonomy. To fully participate in their medical care, patients must be told the truth-even in the most difficult of situations. Palliative care emphasizes patient autonomy and a patient-centered approach, and it is precisely among patients with chronic, life-threatening, or terminal illnesses that truth plays a particularly crucial role. For these patients, finding out the truth about their disease forces them to confront existential fears. As physicians, we must understand that truth, similar to the complexity of pain, is multidimensional. In this article, we discuss the truth from three linguistic perspectives: the Latin veritas, the Greek aletheia, and the Hebrew emeth. Veritas conveys an understanding of truth focused on facts and reality. Aletheia reveals truth as a process, and emeth shows that truth is experienced in truthful encounters with others. In everyday clinical practice, truth is typically equated with the facts. However, this limited understanding of the truth does not account for the uniqueness of each patient. Although two patients may receive the same diagnosis (or facts), each will be affected by this truth in a very individual way. To help patients apprehend the truth, physicians are called to engage in a delicate back-and-forth of multiple difficult conversations in which each patient is accepted as a unique individual.

### What can philosophy do for psychiatry? [^1142ce7k]. World Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

This article illustrates the practical impact of recent developments in the philosophy of psychiatry in five key areas: patient-centred practice, new models of service delivery, neuroscience research, psychiatric education, and the organisation of psychiatry as an international science-led discipline focused on patient care. We conclude with a note on the role of philosophy in countering the stigmatisation of mental disorder.

### Systems of service: reflections on the moral foundations of improvement [^116Mo1Px]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

Two moral syndromes

Each of these ways of knowing has its dedicated adherents who differ in what they see as the most appropriate way for medicine to meet its moral obligation of continuous movement to new levels of performance. The depth of feeling sometimes expressed over these differences suggests that the psychological forces at work go beyond the strictly intellectual, and are closer to the righteousness associated with moral positions. Stated differently, each perspective seems convinced that its concepts and methods provide the true or, at least, more moral path to better medical care.

These two moral perspectives are not new; they have appeared in various guises for centuries, in philosophy, natural sciences, psychology, statistics and elsewhere. For example, natural scientists have long seen the methods of social science as lacking true scientific validity, in particular since social sciences have difficulty in producing verifiable theoretical predictions. As recently as 1996, the longstanding differences between these moral positions erupted into the so-called 'science wars', in which natural scientists publicly questioned whether social science leads to 'dangerous antirationalism and relativism'. The struggle continues to this day.

In medicine, Sackett and Holland suggested some 35 years ago that the controversy brewing over the then-emerging approaches to screening for disease stemmed from fundamental ideological differences between 'advocates' and 'methodologists' or, as they later referred to them, 'evangelists' and 'snails'. vangelists, in these authors' view, held that:

'the pre-existing evidence plus common sense — in the face of the ongoing toll of disability and untimely death — demand massive screening programs for the detection of citizens with risk factors for these disorders now, even in the absence of experiments to determine whether the alteration of many risk factors will, in fact, alter risk'.
Snails, on the other hand, were equally convinced that:

'screening, like any other untested health maneuver, may do more harm than good and must meet scientific as well as political criteria before it is implemented'.

### Is evidence-based practice diverse enough? Philosophy of science considerations [^11712WNu]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

In its policy rationale for evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP), the APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice claims to have constituted itself with "scientists and practitioners from a wide range of perspectives and traditions, reflecting the diverse perspectives within the field" (p. 273). We applaud this attention to diversity but contend that an entire perspective of the debate was omitted in the Task Force's newly approved policy and its underlying report. The failure to consider a philosophy of science perspective led the Task Force to make a number of epistemological assumptions that are not based on evidence or rationale and that thus violate the very spirit of evidence-based decision making. In this comment, we reveal a few of these assumptions and discuss their detrimental consequences.

### It's a long shot, but it just might work! perspectives on the future of medicine [^117JwjPv]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

What does the future of medicine hold? We asked six researchers to share their most ambitious and optimistic views of the future, grounded in the present but looking out a decade or more from now to consider what's possible. They paint a picture of a connected and data-driven world in which patient value, patient feedback, and patient empowerment shape a continually learning system that ensures each patient's experience contributes to the improved outcome of every patient like them, whether it be through clinical trials, data from consumer devices, hacking their medical devices, or defining value in thoughtful new ways.

### Gender perspective in medicine: a vital part of medical scientific rationality. A useful model for comprehending structures and hierarchies within medical science [^113nCiBR]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Results and discussion

When applying the combinations in the model to medical science, we identified the following research areas in medicine (Figure 2): basic research, applied (clinical) research, medical philosophy and 'empowering' research.

The biomedical framework versus other research paradigms

Basic and applied research is performed within the biomedical framework, the dominating paradigm in medicine. Researchers use the quantitative hypotheticodeductive method, with epistemological roots in positivism and logical empiricism. Knowledge is defined as facts that can be verified. Explanation and proof are sought. These traditional biomedical methods have been, and are, very successful in producing useful medical knowledge, but they are not suited for all types of medical research. For example, they are often not fitted to studies of 'soft' data such as patient experiences or patient-doctor interaction, which are important elements of clinical medicine. Nor can they help researchers to discover, interpret and understand the character and meaning of social phenomena, such as the reluctance to consider gender issues in medicine or to understand comprehensive processes in their contexts.

Medical researchers within medical philosophy and 'empowering' research recognise these limitations of the biomedical methods. They see paradoxes and medical anomalies, phenomena that do not comply with established biomedical explanations, for example, undefined musculoskeletal pain. They adopt other research traditions, such as social constructivism, hermeneutics or phenomenology where knowledge is seen as interpreted, contextual and situated. The aim is to understand, not to prove. A paradigm conflict arises not only because of the epistemological difference from biomedicine, but also due to the character of the research subjects and because qualitative methods that are uncommon in the biomedical contexts are often used.

Actor-oriented versus public-oriented research in medicine

Medical scientists within basic research and medical philosophy use a scientific language with a very specialised interdisciplinary terminology and a high theoretical abstraction in their research, which is often difficult to grasp for those who are not in the field. Thus, their primary scientific communication is with their fellow researchers in the same sector. In applied and 'empowering' research within medicine, on the other hand, researchers try to communicate with and address more directly those who might benefit from their scientific findings, as they are the ones that could evaluate the usefulness and efficacy of the research results.

### Patients, doctors and risk attitudes [^116FV52A]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

A lively topic of debate in decision theory over recent years concerns our understanding of the different risk attitudes exhibited by decision makers. There is ample evidence that risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviours are widespread, and a growing consensus that such behaviour is rationally permissible. In the context of clinical medicine, this matter is complicated by the fact that healthcare professionals must often make choices for the benefit of their patients, but the norms of rational choice are conventionally grounded in a decision maker's own desires, beliefs and actions. The presence of both doctor and patient raises the question of whose risk attitude matters for the choice at hand and what to do when these diverge. Must doctors make risky choices when treating risk-seeking patients? Ought they to be risk averse in general when choosing on behalf of others? In this paper, I will argue that healthcare professionals ought to adopt a deferential approach, whereby it is the risk attitude of the patient that matters in medical decision making. I will show how familiar arguments for widely held anti-paternalistic views about medicine can be straightforwardly extended to include not only patients' evaluations of possible health states, but also their attitudes to risk. However, I will also show that this deferential view needs further refinement: patients' higher-order attitudes towards their risk attitudes must be considered in order to avoid some counterexamples and to accommodate different views about what sort of attitudes risk attitudes actually are.

### Gender perspective in medicine: a vital part of medical scientific rationality. A useful model for comprehending structures and hierarchies within medical science [^116JdtW6]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

During the past few decades, research has reported gender bias in various areas of clinical and academic medicine. To prevent such bias, a gender perspective in medicine has been requested, but difficulties and resistance have been reported from implementation attempts. Our study aimed at analysing this resistance in relation to what is considered good medical research.

Method

We used a theoretical model, based on scientific competition, to understand the structures of scientific medicine and how they might influence the resistance to a gender perspective in medicine. The model was originally introduced to discuss how pluralism improves rationality in the social sciences.

Results

The model provided a way to conceptualise different fields of research in medicine: basic research, applied research, medical philosophy, and 'empowering' research. It clarified how various research approaches within medicine relate to each other, and how they differ and compete. It also indicated why there might be conflicts between them: basic and applied research performed within the biomedical framework have higher status than gender research and other research approaches that are performed within divergent research paradigms.

Conclusion

This hierarchy within medical research contributes to the resistance to a gender perspective, causing gender bias and making medical scientific rationality suboptimal. We recommend that the theoretical model can be applied in a wider medical context when different and hierarchically arranged research traditions are in conflict. In this way, the model might contribute to shape a medical community where scientific pluralism is acknowledged to enlarge, not to disturb, the scientific rationality of medicine.

### Gender perspective in medicine: a vital part of medical scientific rationality. A useful model for comprehending structures and hierarchies within medical science [^115iqDBX]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Understanding the resistance to a gender perspective in medicine

In the original article on the theoretical model, Johansson concludes that a scientific community as a whole is rational when the different research approaches respect each other and when there is an interaction between the different sub-rationalities. He states:

"It does not matter too much, then, if some scientists doing normal science are stubborn or dogmatic. Neither does it matter much if some theoreticians working with paradigm conflicts are highly speculative and totally insensitive to empirical findings. Nor does it matter if some scientists. merely think in terms of usefulness. as long as there is an interaction between the different kinds of rationalities".

As we see it, medical science is not quite there yet. There is a clear hierarchy between different medical research fields. Basic research and, to some extent, traditional clinical research, are classified as genuine medical science. There is a special group of distinguished scientific journals with high impact, publishing preferably basic medical research. Lately, medical journals have also shown an increasing interest in clinical research where results can help combat global health problems in the developing as well as in the industrial world. The other two research approaches, medical philosophy and 'empowering' research, are often considered as metaphysics or politics by authorities in medical academia, i.e. as something other than science.

Similarly, this has probably been the attitude encountered when trying to introduce into medicine the concept of gender as something more than biological sex. Attempts have ended up outside the prevailing paradigm, a low-status area, sometimes even ruled as non-scientific. The tradition of positivistic science seems to be a strong excuse for making medical research and medical education 'immune' to the gender discussion taking place in the academic world in other disciplines, and in society at large.

Representatives of biomedicine and those of a gender perspective not only compete for fame, esteem and resources; there is a wider conflict where biomedicine often claims the right to define the field and to preserve (gendered) privileges. To redefine gender as being synonymous with biological sex is one way to exert such rights. Unfortunately, such claims limit the scientific rationality of medicine. Biomedicine did not produce 'truth-likeness' for a series of important diseases until a gender perspective appeared and was used. We argue that a medical science with gender bias has a suboptimal scientific rationality.

### Patient centred medicine: reason, emotion, and human spirit? Some philosophical reflections on being with patients [^116eycy4]. Medical Humanities (2003). Low credibility.

The ideal of patient centred medicine remains only partially realised. Within modern Western society, the highly individualistic culture and religious decline linked with medicine's reluctance to relinquish an outmoded form of scientific rationalism can act as reductive influences, stifling conceptual development. Some examples of the recent literature on communication skills in medicine are analysed to discern the underlying philosophy. A rationalist stance invites an examination of the possible nature of rationality. Another example accepts the need to accommodate the emotional and the unconscious. Issues of human suffering with an inherent spiritual dimension seem to remain excluded. The need to move beyond a duality of reason and emotion to embrace the existential and spiritual is suggested as a theoretical prerequisite for developing a more inclusive concept of patient centred medicine, which only then may be realised. Some brief examples are considered of the sort of notions and types of discourse that might effectively inform "teaching" of communication skills.

### Physician perspectives on addressing anti-black racism [^115WNEmB]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are physicians' perceptions of their role in perpetuating, addressing, and providing accountability for anti-Black racism when treating Black patients with serious illness?

Findings

In this qualitative study of 21 physicians, participants identified practices that may perpetuate and exacerbate perceptions of anti-Black racism. Participants identified strategies and resources for addressing patient concerns and facilitating conflict resolution, but they stopped short of promoting personal or team accountability for anti-Black racism.

Meaning

This study suggests that processes that promote accountability, such as restorative justice, may provide space within a mediated setting for clinicians to repair harm, provide accountability, and facilitate racial healing.

### Philosophy of science and the diagnostic process [^114RDC94]. Family Practice (2013). Low credibility.

This is an overview of the principles that underpin philosophy of science and how they may provide a framework for the diagnostic process. Although philosophy dates back to antiquity, it is only more recently that philosophers have begun to enunciate the scientific method. Since Aristotle formulated deduction, other modes of reasoning including induction, inference to best explanation, falsificationism, theory-laden observations and Bayesian inference have emerged. Thus, rather than representing a single overriding dogma, the scientific method is a toolkit of ideas and principles of reasoning. Here we demonstrate that the diagnostic process is an example of science in action and is therefore subject to the principles encompassed by the scientific method. Although a number of the different forms of reasoning are used readily by clinicians in practice, without a clear understanding of their pitfalls and the assumptions on which they are based, it leaves doctors open to diagnostic error. We conclude by providing a case example from the medico-legal literature in which diagnostic errors were made, to illustrate how applying the scientific method may mitigate the chance for diagnostic error.

### Can arguments address concerns? [^112wHbv9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

People have concerns, and ethicists often respond to them with philosophical arguments. But can conceptual constructions properly address fears and anxieties? It is argued in this paper that while it is possible to voice, clarify, create and-to a certain extent-tackle concerns by arguments, more concrete practices, choices, and actions are normally needed to produce proper responses to people's worries. While logical inconsistencies and empirical errors can legitimately be exposed by arguments, the situation is considerably less clear when it comes to moral, cultural, and emotional norms, values, and expectations.

### Philosophy of psychiatry: theoretical advances and clinical implications [^115C9b5C]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Work at the intersection of philosophy and psychiatry has an extensive and influential history, and has received increased attention recently, with the emergence of professional associations and a growing literature. In this paper, we review key advances in work on philosophy and psychiatry, and their related clinical implications. First, in understanding and categorizing mental disorder, both naturalist and normativist considerations are now viewed as important - psychiatric constructs necessitate a consideration of both facts and values. At a conceptual level, this integrative view encourages moving away from strict scientism to soft naturalism, while in clinical practice this facilitates both evidence-based and values-based mental health care. Second, in considering the nature of psychiatric science, there is now increasing emphasis on a pluralist approach, including ontological, explanatory and value pluralism. Conceptually, a pluralist approach acknowledges the multi-level causal interactions that give rise to psychopathology, while clinically it emphasizes the importance of a broad range of "difference-makers", as well as a consideration of "lived experience" in both research and practice. Third, in considering a range of questions about the brain-mind, and how both somatic and psychic factors contribute to the development and maintenance of mental disorders, conceptual and empirical work on embodied cognition provides an increasingly valuable approach. Viewing the brain-mind as embodied, embedded and enactive offers a conceptual approach to the mind-body problem that facilitates the clinical integration of advances in both cognitive-affective neuroscience and phenomenological psychopathology.

### Can family medicine's counterculture history help shape an anti-racist future? [^1131weSD]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Family medicine prides itself on community engagement and has embraced its counterculture roots. After the racial and social reckoning of 2020, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Black Lives Matters movement, family medicine, as a specialty, must embrace anti-racism as a core value to meet community needs. This article reflects on the foundational tenets of family medicine's origin. It highlights the current disparities regarding professional representation while offering equitable, intentional, and collaborative approaches to move toward and achieve anti-racism within the specialty, medical education, and the community.

### Anti-racism and anti-colonialism praxis in global health-reflection and action for practitioners in US academic medical centers [^112bidS4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

In global health, one way the "coloniality of knowledge" shows up is in our norms and perceptions surrounding expertise. By knowingly or unwittingly devaluing the expertise of local collaborators and indigenous populations — their lived experience or other ways of knowing, we reproduce colonial practices, and miss critical opportunities for impact. In our global health practice, we believe that the knowledge of those most proximate to the problem at hand should be privileged, and that collective, inclusive problem-solving requires questioning academic perspectives on hierarchies of knowing. We must have the humility to recognize the possibility of plurality and diversity in knowledge — to act on the idea that knowledge production exists beyond formal institutions and research expertsand recognize the limits of our own contributions, and the gaps in our knowledge.

### Induced abortion in the world: 1. perception of abortion throughout the centuries and by religions [^114KQjVw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In a book dedicated to contraception and abortion in world religions, Maguireargues that framing religions as being inflexible or unresponsive to societal reality perhaps stems from a stereotypical depiction that juxtaposes religion against science. Exploring the religious stance finds evidence that this has shifted over time, which is not unexpected because religions encompass scripture or traditions handed down through the generations and interpretations can evolve. Because of its nature, it should not come as a surprise that religious stance does not change at the same rapid pace as science. Currently, religious stance leans towards a more conservative interpretation than what could be gleaned from the possibly more permissive interpretations. This runs contrary to the societal shift as reflected in legislation. Maguirecharacterizes almost all world religions to admit both the "pro‐choice" and the "no‐choice" options and that, rather than being seamless garments, world religions are more like rich patchwork quilts that have a space for valid moral pluralism.

Sharmaargues that the current stance of religion should be seen as a "result" of the religious method in the same way as current understanding of science is the result of scientific method. This separation of the result from the method enables religion and science to continue even as the outcome changes, evolves, or is proven to be inaccurate. It is possible that the religious stance is a rebound against liberalization. On the other hand, religious views may not be the primary or the dominant drivers of the anti‐abortion sentiment. Ultimately, religion influences but does not control individual or political choice. The distinction seen in some religious teachings based on the stage of pregnancy may have also been weakened by modern embryology and medical advances, such as ultrasound, which demonstrated signs of "life" in very early embryos. Despite general prohibition, some religions are willing to make exceptions for extreme cases such as where the life of the mother is at risk. But the interpretation of this is difficult, especially with the advances in medicine. On the other hand, the concept of pregnancy as a risk to the mother's health is itself modern and, therefore, it is difficult to conceive how it could have been appreciated or addressed by early religious scholars.

### Illness as a condition of our existence in the world: on illness and pathic existence [^117Jtery]. Medical Humanities (2012). Low credibility.

This paper seeks to find different ways of addressing illness as an experience essential to the understanding of being a human being. As a conceptual point of departure, we suggest the notion of 'pathic existence' as developed by the German physician and philosopher Viktor von Weizsäcker (1886–1957). Through an analysis of his conceptualisation of the pathic and of pathic categories, we demonstrate how this auxiliary typology may be of help in unveiling different modes of ill-being, or Kranksein. Furthermore, we show how illness plays a paradigmatic role in this type of existence. We discuss how von Weizsäcker's claim of illness as "a way of being human" indicates how such a view of the illness existence both differs from and touches upon other streams of thought within the philosophy of medicine and medical ethics. Finally, we highlight some of the normative implications emerging from this perspective of relevance in today's medicine.

### Critical medical humanities: embracing entanglement, taking risks [^113JZErp]. Medical Humanities (2015). Low credibility.

The special issue also brings together scholars who range widely in the foci of their concern as well as the scale at which their arguments find most vigorous purchase. All contributions take flight from sites other than that described as medical humanities' 'primal scene' — namely the encounter that enjoins a patient who has cancer and her clinician. We wanted explicitly to dislodge this mise-en-scène so as to foreground other kinds of relations, networks, nodes and entities through which health and medicine are made, and unmade. We wanted, additionally, to reflect on the scholarly and worldly resources that are not commonly captured within either medical humanities' consolidating archive, or within its usual (inter)disciplinary machinery. Why, for example, have Continental philosophy (outside of a particular lineage of phenomenological thought), cultural theory, disability studies, queer theory, and science and technology studies been, hitherto, largely shadowy or eccentric presences, even as they have addressed, often extensively, problematics central to the medical humanities? What would a vigorous interrogation of the debates and subdisciplines that have tended to occupy centre stage within the medical humanities (we are thinking here of medical education, the history and philosophy of medicine, literature and medicine, and art therapies) reveal about that field's locus of concern, horizons of interest, and procedural norms?

### Being well together? Promoting health and well-being through more than human collaboration and companionship [^111wehSs]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

Becoming well together and the Research Forum

We highlight here two radically different scales of 'multispecies medicine' not because they are different in kind, for the two are intimately entangled positing human–non-human relations as a site for promoting and maintaining health and well-being. Each case operates through a complex entanglement of cultural and biological factors framed within a societal context. Each varies in the degree to which it promises a radical reconfiguring of long established biomedical political tropes, or is open to incorporation within the same and a return of familiar individualistic politics of healthcare. Foregrounding the role of non-human forms of life in human health and well-being is a provocation to the medical humanities to consider what lies outside our current thinking. The language of 'becoming with' foregrounds our interdependencies, prompting recognition that what matters to an individual in large part must be placed into broader contexts of what matters to others. Within the medical humanities, this line of thought invites an approach to understanding health and well-being less as an essential property of an individual human and more as a shared outcome of relations between humans and non-human beings. In subsequent BMJ Medical Humanities issues, further articles will present case studies exploring how the experience of being well with animals reshapes understandings of medicine, health and well-being. We hope to show how the medical humanities can operate as a shared ground where the politics of animal and disability advocacy might be productively brought together under a shared programme. Forthcoming papers will address the lived experience of health as a product of multispecies relations, the role of affect and emotion in the maintenance of human and non-human well-being, and the societal politics of 'being well' when 'being well' is a more than human condition. Importantly, the Research Forum is not intended to serve as a monologue. In line with the underlying philosophy of multiplicity, relationality and shared becoming which motivates our intellectual interest in human–animal interactions as a site for the flourishing of health, the Research Forum is conceived as a shared space where readers and authors engage. We invite, therefore, critical responses from readers and look forward to the shared process of becoming together which will generate new perspectives on medicine, health and changing relations of human and animal life in society.

### Storylines of family medicine I: framing family medicine-history, values and perspectives [^112Xzg86]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Family medicine — the generalist specialty

Kate Rowland

Over 50 years ago, the discipline of family medicine defined itself as an academic specialty with scientific backing, one that cared for individuals in the context of their families, communities and society while staying grounded in its generalist roots.

When the goal is health and healing, expertise in human beings is often more valuable than expertise in human bodies. US family medicine as a discipline emerged in the 1960s when the imbalance between expertise in human beings and expertise in human bodies became obvious. Medicine increasingly focused on pathologies of the body, and many people were left without a personal physician (a role previously fulfilled by general practitioners, commonly physicians who had completed a one year rotating hospital internship before entering practice).

The seeds of this crisis were sown decades earlier as the physician-scientist paradigm rose to prominence and medical training moved exclusively to university settings. After centuries of doctors functioning as generalists, within a generation, the perception that only specialty care was inherently scientific took hold. The population of general practitioners aged and dwindled as students followed available incentives to specialise and subspecialise.

Generalist physicians had always been around. They were in neighbourhoods close to their patients, attending to their patients' ailments, providing them with preventive care and listening to their life concerns. In the post-World War II era, generalist physicians rapidly disappeared, and specialists were ill-equipped to fill in. The value of generalist knowledge and skill grew more apparent as communities struggled to recruit general practitioners to help cure disease and keep the healthy well. People still needed person-centred care.

Thus, general practitioners in the 1960s designed and implemented a new specialty — family medicine — to address the need for providing personalised care for people in communities. The biomedical sciences served as the foundation for this new specialty and for the care that this specialty offered. Still, it also incorporated the wisdom of many other fields, including public health, the behavioural sciences, hospital practice, systems theory and community medicine, among others.

### Perspectives on anti-black racism and mitigation strategies among faculty experts at academic medical centers [^116mWyvF]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Theme 1: Learning Objectives of the Intervention Should Be Comprehensive

Participants underscored the need to ensure faculty have a solid foundation on the historical underpinnings of anti-Black racism and how policies within their institution lead to disparities. One participant stated: "they would understand the terminology around racism, the definitions and then how that gets applied to the world and academic medicine. I'm thinking implicit bias, structural racism, equity — those sorts of things, and I would also think an objective would be… to gain a better understanding of how racism impacts Black faculty specifically in academic medicine and to walk away with ways to implement and advocate for change" (P 2).

Interviewees emphasized the importance of practicing antiracism skills similarly to learning other parts of clinical medicine: "we need to practice with cases and with direct observation — watching people do it the right way and giving them feedback about how it went" (P 6). Another participant highlighted the importance of self-reflection: "There has to be a lot of self-inner work that I don't think people in medicine do very well. A lot of time for self-reflection and understanding why these behaviors exist, why you may demonstrate these behaviors yourself and you don't really want to come to terms with it… more mindfulness practice, more restorative justice" (P 11). Participants noted how the intervention should be comprehensive and go beyond implicit bias training: "Not like a two-hour unconscious bias training, like a really deep dive into trends, into experiences, real experiences of bias, into role-playing if that's needed" (P 4).

### Six' biases' against patients and carers in evidence-based medicine [^115d8kmB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

However, whilst this problem has been described for decades, workable solutions have not arisen from within the EBM literature. In our view, this is because generating such solutions would require a fundamental change in perspective, an abandoning of certain deeply held principles and assumptions, and the introduction of new ideas and methodologies from disciplines beyond EBM. Given the policy push for greater patient and carer involvement in research, the time is surely ripe for those who adhere to the EBM paradigm to question its rigid 'gold standard' and consider whether it is time to extend and enrich EBM's evidence base.

In particular, EBM researchers should learn from the literature on civic engagement with a view to building a level of patient and public involvement in research that goes beyond the limited goal of increasing recruitment to research trials. EBM practitioners should learn from the humanities (especially philosophy and literature) to ensure that individual ('personally significant') evidence, both subjective and objective, is given appropriate weight in clinical decision-making. They should take a more interdisciplinary and humanistic view of clinical consultations, drawing, for example, on the evidence from social psychology and medical education on the importance of the therapeutic relationship. All this would require a greater focus on the deliberative analysis of real, unique individual cases rather than standardised fictional ones in teaching and professional development.

Those who seek to apply EBM in policy and practice should also consider the literature from social and political sciences and critical public health on power and inequality, especially research on power dynamics in healthcare encounters, social determinants of health, and differential access to health services. Finally, those whose research focus is the patient should seek to engage with theories, methods, and empirical findings from (among other fields) digital sociology on self-monitoring, online peer support, and tacit knowledge exchange.

In conclusion, as we have argued previously, EBM may not be 'a movement in crisis', but it is certainly at a crossroads. The success of clinical epidemiology has taken the EBM movement to a stage where many of the unanswered research questions are no longer epidemiological but humanistic, social, and political. Nowhere is this truer than in EBM's efforts to be patient-centred. We believe that the interdisciplinary approach described in this paper would allow EBM practitioners and policymakers to overcome or reduce what we have (perhaps somewhat provocatively) described as 'biases' against patients and carers.

### Art, science, and the existential focus of clinical medicine [^111Dz23s]. Medical Humanities (2002). Low credibility.

The continuing debate over the status of medicine as an art or a science remains far from resolved. The aim of this paper is to clarify what is meant by the art of medicine. In the following interpretation I contrast two current perspectives of the medical art. I argue that the art of medicine is best understood in terms of the Aristotelian notion of techne. It consists of listening skills directed to the lived experience of the patient in such a way that knowledge (principally scientific knowledge) can be applied in a therapeutic way. This constitutes what I call medicine's existential focus. The art of medicine is prior to and independent of medical science which plays an important but subordinate role.

### To be, or not to be? The role of the unconscious in transgender transitioning: identity, autonomy and well-being [^116b12SP]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

The merits and challenges of gender affirmative care

The question about whether we should 'accept' transgender individuals' claims about what will support their well-being can be approached from two angles: one more obvious, generalisable, but no less important and the other, more variegated and hence not allowing any generalisations. We will first address the more obvious reading before exploring a more complex reading of 'acceptance'.

The etymology of 'to accept' is the Latin accipere meaning 'to receive, to let in, admit, hear, learn'. It denotes a willingness to take on board another person's account, to give it legitimacy, but not necessarily to accept it as true or superior to an alternative account. Ethical decision-making about any medical intervention that carries risks as well as potential benefits is always embedded in a relational matrix in which at least two people strive to arrive at a decision about whether an intervention is in the patient's best interests. This is central to most contemporary models of the doctor-patient relationship and represents a rejection of the historically dominant medical model of medical paternalism. Within the 1980s and 90s, respect for patient autonomy increased in importance in medicine. But tit also came with the realisation that medicine is concerned with promoting the patient's best overall interests, such as well-being, rather than health narrowly conceived as the absence of disease. As medicine became increasingly complex, with multiple options with different risk/benefit profiles, it became clear it was necessary to understand patient values to identify the best option. According to the shared decision-making model, patients supplied the values and doctors supplied the facts. However, other models gave greater weight to normative dialogue, that is, dialogue about should be done, what is good and right. For example, the liberal rationalist model required doctors and patients to engage in normative and value dialogue, as well as exchange of facts, to identify what would best promote this patient's well-being in this particular context. It is the patient who is privy to their own values and to their particular life circumstances, relationships and position in society. However, sometimes their values conflict and sometimes their values should change, for example, a person who autonomously desires to abuse their partner. According to the liberal rationalist model, doctors and patients are engaged in a joint journey to answer the question: what should the patient do in this circumstance?

### Cultural psychiatry: international perspectives. epilogue [^114kpQ56]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The psychiatry of the 21st century will have to be different from the psychiatry of the 20th century. The latter began its journey in a socially, compartmentalized world in which sharp categories and boundaries for the definition of mental illness were assumed to be relevant. International psychiatry completed its hegemonic hold over the territory of mental health and illness with a commanding home-stretch run of success borne in the confidence and optimism of its neurobiologic and culture free program and agenda. The world in which psychiatry now exists, however is changing rapidly and will continue to change and so of necessity will the practice of psychiatry need to change. This issue offers a guidelines and a vision of the direction that should be followed. Migration and transnational communication and awareness of cultural differences are changing the character of communities around the world. These changes considered in the context of world wide political economic factors are bringing into close physical and symbolic juxtaposition persons from distinct nations and ethnic groups. Clashes in world views, attitudes, spiritual orientation, and general philosophic and moral outlook are becoming ever-present realities of urban centers around the world. In traditional contexts and among persons who do not physically migrate, the power of communications media manages to psychologically migrate them; that is, to challenge their local, native cultural traditions about mental health with the scientific perspectives about mental health and illness. Advances in the social and cultural sciences have underscored ways in which assumptions of reductionism and universalism need to be chastened with an appreciation of human differences and humane considerations as these relate to mental health problems. The science of psychiatry of the 21st century will have to accomodate to this new creolized world of ethnic pluralism, cultural differences, and clashing perspectives between the traditional and the modern. The boundaries, categories, and the conceits governing the closed neurobiologic international program and agenda will need to be modified and broadened by the addition, sensitivity to and appreciation of cultural differences. This issue has reviewed the efforts of scholars around the world who are all deeply committed to the goals of the old international psychiatry but judge that a new vision and idiom is needed. A responsive international cultural psychiatry is based on a blending and integration of all facets of knowledge of the behavioral sciences, from biology, pharmacology, genetics on through sociology and cultural anthropology. In a new idiom it seeks to provide to all communities of the globe the best that the science of psychiatry has to offer in the areas of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The best psychiatry possible translates as providing expert scientific diagnosis and therapy in light of an appreciation of the role played by cultural factors in shaping human behavior. Contributors have covered the broad terrain of clinical psychiatry in a selective way giving emphasis to demographic, regional, and national needs in areas of mental health planning and therapy. The reviews of empirical issues and the formulation of conceptual areas needing further clarification provide a perspective of what a culturally sensitive and responsive international psychiatry should consist of.

### Gender perspective in medicine: a vital part of medical scientific rationality. A useful model for comprehending structures and hierarchies within medical science [^111LVsym]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Such bias has been described during the past decades in research from various areas of clinical and academic medicine. Unjustified differences in the investigation and treatment of male and female patients have been identified, most abundantly and ever recurrently in coronary heart disease, but also in other conditions such as kidney disease, depression, HIV/AIDS, colorectal cancer, neck pain and irritable bowel syndrome. There are also reports of discrimination and harassment based on gender among medical students, physicians, medical faculty and medical researchers.

To prevent and avoid gender bias, there are good reasons for a gender perspective to be included in medicine in the same way as perspectives regarding social class, ethnicity, and age. However, in reports from attempts to introduce gender issues in clinical medicine, medical research and medical curricula, difficulties and resistance have been experienced and described. For example, in medical research and education, the term 'gender' is often wrongly used as being synonymous with biological sex. Sometimes 'sex' is simply replaced by 'gender', and used as a variable even in experiments on animals. Analyses of medical textbooks, training material and examination questions have revealed stereotypical gender patterns and even open patriarchal views. Enduring and difficult work has been described when trying to address and change this. Lack of interest in gender issues has been shown from students as well as from faculty. Interviews with course organisers at a medical school revealed that several of them found a gender perspective to be of little relevance in medicine; gender issues were considered subjective and unscientific. In open answers from a questionnaire to physician teachers about gender issues, many comments were minimising, neutralising, and sometimes even denying the role of gender in professional relationships.

In this paper, we theorise about and try to understand this resistance to a gender perspective in medicine in relation to what is considered good and valid research in the medical society.

### Anti-racism and anti-colonialism praxis in global health-reflection and action for practitioners in US academic medical centers [^111Cai6S]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) play a unique role in the US global health landscape, falling at the intersection of clinical care, research, policy, and medical education, and their faculty and trainees engage in many global health partnerships — with increasing frequency. Despite this prominent role, we find that not all global health programs at AMCs have critically interrogated their position within the ill-defined field of "global health", or what the term "partnership" does or should mean in the social, historical, and political context of global inequities. Yet all global health practitioners must be deliberate in how they engage in the work, question their practices, and actively work to be anti-racist and to "decolonize" global health programs, not only as an ideological but also a pragmatic commitment. The idea of decolonizing global health — identifying, unveiling, and interrupting the persisting remnants of colonialism within our practice and structures — is not new. But AMCs have been institutionally less vocal in the wider discourse on this topic compared with universities, schools of public health, and even international development organizations. Less focus has been placed on "how" the global health work in AMCs is achieved — but we believe that the "how" really matters. AMCs must play a crucial role in this decolonizing work through institutional and individual efforts. In this article, we focus on individual efforts, proposing three initial questions as part of a continuous practice of self-reflection and inquiry for individuals who engage and design global health programs. These questions are intended to act as tools for global health practitioners at AMCs to unceasingly interrogate our practices and advocate for institutional change.

### Following the science? Views from scientists on government advisory boards during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative interview study in five European countries [^112BaoXq]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the statement of 'following the science' has been used by politicians as both a shorthand for a new, 'better' era of politics, where government decisions will be based on scientists' and public health experts' advice, for example in the USA, as well as an explanation or even excuse for certain government's decisions and failings related to handling this pandemic. However, some highlighted that the assumption behind this statement and traditional positivistic view and understanding and use of evidence-based medicine (EBM), namely that we can access singular truth through empirical enquiry and the use of clearly defined hierarchy of methods, should in fact be contested. While these debates are not new (eg, refs), some argued that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the urgency of challenging our understanding and use of EBM. Situations such as a pandemic are complex, raising complex questions with often complex answers, highlighting the need to make space for a different paradigm. Epidemic preparedness and response as well as health systems strengthening initiatives are increasingly recognising epidemics as complex biosocial events. The complex systems theory has been recently proposed as one way of shifting the traditional positivist paradigm, reflecting more complex and dynamic relationships in the real world which needs to be addressed by a variety of methods, going beyond clinical trials. Others have also called for embracing the complementary insights achieved through diverse methods and diverse disciplines, sacrificing the need for a black and white picture of a problem for a more robust understanding of it.

### Ethics and academic discourse, scientific integrity, uncertainty, and disinformation in medicine: an American College of Physicians position paper [^115gMaS2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Respect for the scientific process and a diversity of views; open discourse and debate based on principles of ethics, best available evidence, and scientific inquiry and integrity; and an understanding of evidence gaps and uncertainty and how to communicate about them are important values in the advancement of science and the practice of medicine. Physicians often must make decisions about their recommendations to patients in the face of scarce or conflicting data. Are these characteristics of medicine and science widely understood and effectively communicated among members of the profession and to patients and the public? Issues of scientific integrity are longstanding, but COVID-19 brought them to the forefront, in an environment that was sometimes characterized by communication missteps as guidance came and went-or changed-quickly. Today, is open debate flourishing? Have some debates shed more heat than light? Are people losing confidence in science and medicine? In health care institutions? The American College of Physicians explores these issues and offers guidance in this position paper.

### Promoting networks between evidence-based medicine and values-based medicine in continuing medical education [^113DTSmL]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In a nutshell, we can say that the CME intervention favors the creation of networks between EBM and VBM from a philosophical, epistemic, axiological and practical point of view. From the philosophical point of view, we were able to recover the ends of medical practice, namely: healing, curing and caring, the recognition of the person as central to healthcare. This is evident in Table 3 where after the CME intervention; the representations and beliefs of the healthcare personnel were modified, and exhibited a more thorough understanding of the philosophy of medicine. From the epistemic point of view, the epistemic values that are related with medical attention were strengthened. Simultaneously, we perceived increased knowledge related to integral ethics. This can be seen in Table 3 and Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, where the physicians' roles were more balanced. The promotion of personal growth through the exercise of values, such as autonomy, love, justice and freedom, could be seen. These values were rediscovered and used to improve the patient-healthcare personnel relationship. Both the quantitative (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6), and the qualitative (Figures 7 and 8, and Table 3) analyses show the construction of links between EBM and VBM. From a practical perspective, tools for ethical discernment were provided, discursive spaces to reflect and critically analyze ethical dilemmas in clinical practice were created.

### Unconscious conflict of interest: a jewish perspective [^111KPb78]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

In contemporary medicine, it is not always obvious whether the acceptance of a benefit constitutes a conflict of interest. A particular area of controversy has been the impact of small gifts or other benefits from pharmaceutical companies on physicians' behaviour. Typically, in such cases, the gift is not an explicit reward for cooperation; the physician does not perceive the gift as an attempt to influence his or her judgement; and the reward is relatively minor. Under these circumstances, physicians are generally of the view that acceptance of gifts will not affect their behaviour, notwithstanding findings from social psychology and neuroscience that the impact of gifts is often unconscious, shaping action without a person's awareness. Here, we draw on traditional texts of Jewish law pertaining to the prohibition of taking a gift to illustrate recognition by the ancients of unconscious conflicts of interest, and their approach to dealing with the problem.

### The common premise for uncommon conclusions [^117He1UZ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

Recent controversy over philosophical advocacy of infanticide (or the comically-styled euphemism 'postnatal abortion') reveals a surprisingly common premise uniting many of the opponents and supporters of the practice. This is the belief that the moral status of the early fetus or embryo with respect to a right to life is identical to that of a newly born or even very young baby. From this premise, infanticidists and strong anti-abortionists draw opposite conclusions, the former that the healthy newly born have no inherent right to life and the latter that minute embryos and the very early fetus have the same right to life as young babies. (Indeed strong anti-abortionists tend to regard this right to life as identical to that possessed by adult humans.) This paper argues that these opposed conclusions are both deeply implausible and that the implausibility resides in the common premise. The argument requires some attention to the structure of the philosophical case underpinning the supposed vice of speciesism that has been given intellectual currency by many philosophers, most notably Peter Singer, and also to the reasoning behind the strong anti-abortionist adoption of the common premise.

### Six' biases' against patients and carers in evidence-based medicine [^113pFMHk]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We have argued that the EBM paradigm is not as patient centred as it is sometimes assumed to be. We are concerned that the methods and approaches currently being adopted by the EBM community to 'involve' and 'empower' patients will not, in and of themselves, redress this deficiency.

The six 'biases' described in this review – the limited involvement of patients and carers in research; EBM's hierarchical dismissal of personal experience and qualitative research more generally; its tendency to over-emphasise the use of decision tools at the expense of more humanistic elements of the consultation; its failure to recognise and address power imbalances; its implicit assumption that key decisions happen with a clinician in the room; and its neglect of the inverse care law – can all be traced back to the assumptions and preferred focus of the discipline of epidemiology: the science of experimental and observational studies of diseases in populations.

EBM's epidemiological focus, which is appropriate and rigorous when considering populations or samples, places limited emphasis on aspects of healthcare that are key to the successful application of quantitative research evidence to the individual patient. The conceptual frames of EBM effectively configure the patient as an autonomous rational chooser, a model that does not readily translate into the everyday lives of real patients – multifaceted individuals with physical, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions, who lead messy, idiosyncratic, networked, and often complicated lives in contexts that are shaped by cultural, economic, and political forces. As Mark Tonelli observed in 1999,

"[In evidence-based medicine], the individuality of patients tends to be devalued, the focus of clinical practice is subtly shifted away from the care of individuals toward the care of populations, and the complex nature of sound clinical judgement is not fully appreciated. "

### Anti-racism and anti-colonialism praxis in global health-reflection and action for practitioners in US academic medical centers [^113CB35k]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Global health practitioners in academic medicine must reckon with certain realities of our work. These relate to the history of the field and its conception in colonialism as well as present-day inequities that continue to be pervasive. Such inequities include asymmetric power dynamics that often place institutions and practitioners in the "global North" above those in the "global South" and that normalize unequal partnerships where expertise and experience are more readily assigned to those of us in the global North. In the United States (where the authors are currently based), we, as global health practitioners, must understand and address our positionalities — the power and other differences in our social positions that shape our identities and access in society — and the inherent power structures that exist as we strive to achieve shared goals of addressing the most pressing global health challenges of our time.

### The nature of psychiatric disorders [^113eFMze]. World Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

A foundational question for the discipline of psychiatry is the nature of psychiatric disorders. What kinds of things are they? In this paper, I review and critique three major relevant theories: realism, pragmatism and constructivism. Realism assumes that the content of science is real and independent of human activities. I distinguish two "flavors" of realism: chemistry-based, for which the paradigmatic example is elements of the periodic table, and biology-based, for which the paradigm is species. The latter is a much better fit for psychiatry. Pragmatism articulates a sensible approach to psychiatric disorders just seeking categories that perform well in the world. But it makes no claim about the reality of those disorders. This is problematic, because we have a duty to advocate for our profession and our patients against other physicians who never doubt the reality of the disorders they treat. Constructivism has been associated with anti-psychiatry activists, but we should admit that social forces play a role in the creation of our diagnoses, as they do in many sciences. However, truly socially constructed psychiatric disorders are rare. I then describe powerful arguments against a realist theory of psychiatric disorders. Because so many prior psychiatric diagnoses have been proposed and then abandoned, can we really claim that our current nosologies have it right? Much of our current nosology arose from a series of historical figures and events which could have gone differently. If we re-run the tape of history over and over again, the DSM and ICD would not likely have the same categories on every iteration. Therefore, we should argue more confidently for the reality of broader constructs of psychiatric illness rather than our current diagnostic categories, which remain tentative. Finally, instead of thinking that our disorders are true because they correspond to clear entities in the world, we should consider a coherence theory of truth by which disorders become more true when they fit better into what else we know about the world. In our ongoing project to study and justify the nature of psychiatric disorders, we ought to be broadly pragmatic but not lose sight of an underlying commitment, despite the associated difficulties, to the reality of psychiatric illness.

### The war on "anti-aging medicine" [^112FK1wL]. The Gerontologist (2003). Low credibility.

Leading members of the gerontological community have recently launched a war on anti-aging medicine, seeking to discredit what they judge to be fraudulent and harmful products and therapies, and to distinguish their research from what they regard as the pseudoscience of the anti-aging movement. This article interprets the contemporary war on anti-aging medicine as largely an attempt by established gerontological researchers to preserve their hard-won scientific and political legitimacy, as well as to maintain and enhance funding for research on the basic biological mechanisms of aging. First, it recounts the difficult struggle of U.S. biogerontologists to join the scientific mainstream in terms of legitimization and public funding. Second, it examines how elements of a contemporary anti-aging movement seem to threaten the hard-won public legitimacy of established gerontological researchers and practitioners. Third, it looks at the "boundary work" responses of the gerontological community to the anti-aging movement. Finally, it assesses the consequences of the war on anti-aging medicine to date.

### Digital bioethics: introducing new methods for the study of bioethical issues [^113QhH7G]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

II. Empirical bioethics

When bioethics first emerged as a discipline in the late 1960s, most scholars in the field had a philosophical, theological or legal background. Bioethical scholarship thus revolved mostly around definitional issues (such as the definition of disease, death or competence). Its methods consisted mainly of philosophical analysis, and its aims focused on providing reasonable ways to support decision making in medicine and science. While the role of philosophy remains highly relevant today, insight from other disciplines such as sociology, history, policy, science and medicine have gained significant recognition.

Two decades ago, as an increasing number of social scientists began to engage with bioethical issues, an empirical turn in bioethics research has occurred. The interdisciplinary characteristics of the field easily accommodated these novel contributions. However, the theoretical relation between normative and empirical bioethics was, and remains, a matter of debate.

Empirical bioethics employs social science methods to collect quantitative and qualitative data about bioethical issues and related stakeholders' views and attitudes. One primary contribution of empirical bioethics has thus consisted in giving a voice to ethical concerns around controversial issues in medicine, science and technology. In this respect, empirical bioethics has provided insight into the ways ethical issues relate to their specific sociological, political and cultural contexts, as well as how various actors articulate their perspectives around a given ethical question.

The question of whether and how insight from empirical bioethics can directly contribute to normative analysis and decision making remains unsettled. The distinction between matters of fact and matters of value has a long philosophical genealogy, conventionally dating back to David Hume's thesis that one cannot derive 'ought' from 'is', i to more recent metaethical debates about the merits of ethical naturalism. A dichotomous understanding of the relation between facts and norms ('is' and 'ought') has to some extent prevented the seamless integration of empirical methods into normative bioethics and decision making. ii This condition has resulted in academic tension between the two fields, with some scholars viewing empirical work as mainly descriptive, while others consider it conducive to reorienting action-guiding norms in a practical (normative) sense.

### Simple rules for evidence translation in complex systems: a qualitative study [^112s2NwW]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The accumulating data about the 'daily realities' of evidence translation and improvement required us to reconceptualise our understanding of the problem, and associated potential solutions. Our focus moved from evidence-based medicine and interventions, to focusing on the complexity of the systems within which we hoped to intervene. As such, literature relating to complex systems thinking grew in importance over time to become the primary lens by which we were able to make sense of our experiences (further details on this process of reconceptualisation are provided in Additional file 2).

Reflecting this reconceptualisation, 'act scientifically and pragmatically' was identified as the core category for selective coding. It was chosen to reflect the interaction between our starting world view (the need to use scientific evidence) and our core learning (the need to understand and respond to the constraints and opportunities of the local system). Our analysis indicated the tension between these perspectives, and also the opportunity for increased synergy between them, as follows:
An underlying tension was observed in the literature and in our empirical data between the production and use of generalisable knowledge (influenced by positivist and realist philosophical perspectives) and local context-specific problem solving (influenced by pragmatist and participatory philosophical perspectives).
We recognised the value of drawing insights from both perspectives. Effective improvement initiatives can benefit from drawing on a scientific knowledge base (evidence-based medicine, or other knowledge of effective interventions or change processes), and from making pragmatic adjustments in line with the opportunities and constraints of the actual setting for the change.
The change process can be guided by applying aspects of the scientific method at a local level so that clear aims and measures guide structured experimental processes to assess, learn and inform next steps. This resonates with the pragmatist notion of science to solve local problems of societal importance, and with the complexity literature notion of the "science of muddling through " in dynamic and evolving systems.

### Current epistemological problems in evidence based medicine [^111XxiXi]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence based medicine has been a topic of considerable controversy in medical and health care circles over its short lifetime, because of the claims made by its exponents about the criteria used to assess the evidence for or against the effectiveness of medical interventions. The central epistemological debates underpinning the debates about evidence based medicine are reviewed by this paper, and some areas are suggested where further work remains to be done. In particular, further work is needed on the theory of evidence and inference; causation and correlation; clinical judgment and collective knowledge; the structure of medical theory; and the nature of clinical effectiveness.

### A bioethics for all seasons [^116HPrga]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

Perhaps, then, we ought to search for those works of bioethical scholarship that contain the most rigorous philosophical analysis, or the most elegant argument; or that provide insight into the most pressing issues of the day; or that enable the most effective policy solutions. But how do we measure any of these aspects, or decide which should predominate, in our determination of what we consider to be 'good'? It is important to recognise that in asking what makes good bioethics we are also inviting an opinion about what we think bioethics is, or should be.

This is a problem that bioethics has confronted repeatedly throughout its relatively short history. In so doing, it has often turned a self-reflective eye to questions of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, method and methodology (or lack thereof) — in short, how to define what it is we do. Intertwined with such issues is the question of moral expertise, of what gives us as bioethicists legitimacy to carry out the roles we claim to be able to perform.

Bioethics has at least some of its roots in philosophy, but we do not, by and large, have an explicitly-developed 'philosophy of bioethics'. Science produces explanations for observed phenomena and evaluates those explanations according to how well they describe and predict these phenomena. But if bioethics functions analogously, in attempting to elucidate some underlying moral principle, what are the phenomena we are trying to explain?

The role of moral intuitions in bioethics is a contested one, and being led by the 'moral nose' is often looked upon as being a poor method of 'doing bioethics'. Yet bioethical reasoning often relies first on appeals to intuition to establish the basic premises from which axioms can be abstracted and against which more complex problems can be compared and analysed. Can we claim, then, that we are uncovering some sort of 'moral truth'? This problem both recapitulates perpetual meta-ethical debates over the nature of moral philosophy itself and invokes issues of moral expertise — who is best placed to know or discover the truth, and whose statements should be considered as good moral guidance? How do we decide what makes something a 'good' moral explanation, and is producing moral explanations the proper purpose of bioethics?

### Does reductio ad absurdum have a place in evidence-based medicine? [^115wj2Uz]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In our recent paper published in BMC Medicine, we explored in a thought-provoking manner whether science can actually be sure that 'sucrose = sucrose' in the treatment of major depressive disorder. This paper was an original piece of research based upon a reductio ad absurdum, but basically an essay about science and care with certain epistemological dimensions. We submitted it to stimulate reflection about the validity of scientific knowledge in medicine and we are glad that it has worked, with a very interesting commentary by Cipriani and Geddes on our published article.

Beyond addressing a complex and controversial issue within the field of antidepressant research, we believed that the form of this unusual paper raised an important issue implicitly suggested by Cipriani and Geddes' comments: does reductio ad absurdum have a place in evidence-based medicine?

Evidence-based stories

Cipriani and Geddes are right to point out that while our paper addressed an epistemological question we approached it 'scientifically' by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Indeed, this can be considered as a challenge to the comfortable dualism at the basis of modern science: words are seen as being for philosophers and numbers for 'hard' scientists. We clearly militate for abandoning such a position, which sterilises the debate, especially in the field of psychiatric research. To sum up our position on this point, we consider that in most papers, whether they come from social and human sciences or from 'harder' sciences, there is a mixture of observation (the core activity of science, present in the methods and results section of papers) and discussion about sense and meaning (more related to philosophy, and in general present in the discussion section). Ultimately, there is nothing more than a story, told with words or numbers, even if it can sometimes be an evidence-based story.

### The biopsychosocial model 25 years later: principles, practice, and scientific inquiry [^116KBB9v]. Annals of Family Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The biopsychosocial model is both a philosophy of clinical care and a practical clinical guide. Philosophically, it is a way of understanding how suffering, disease, and illness are affected by multiple levels of organization, from the societal to the molecular. At the practical level, it is a way of understanding the patient's subjective experience as an essential contributor to accurate diagnosis, health outcomes, and humane care. In this article, we defend the biopsychosocial model as a necessary contribution to the scientific clinical method, while suggesting 3 clarifications: (1) the relationship between mental and physical aspects of health is complex — subjective experience depends on but is not reducible to laws of physiology; (2) models of circular causality must be tempered by linear approximations when considering treatment options; and (3) promoting a more participatory clinician-patient relationship is in keeping with current Western cultural tendencies, but may not be universally accepted. We propose a biopsychosocial-oriented clinical practice whose pillars include (1) self-awareness; (2) active cultivation of trust; (3) an emotional style characterized by empathic curiosity; (4) self-calibration as a way to reduce bias; (5) educating the emotions to assist with diagnosis and forming therapeutic relationships; (6) using informed intuition; and (7) communicating clinical evidence to foster dialogue, not just the mechanical application of protocol. In conclusion, the value of the biopsychosocial model has not been in the discovery of new scientific laws, as the term "new paradigm" would suggest, but rather in guiding parsimonious application of medical knowledge to the needs of each patient.

### Physician perspectives on addressing anti-black racism [^111ixfxa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Uncertainty remains among clinicians regarding processes to address and resolve conflict around anti-Black racism.

Objective

To elicit clinicians' perceptions of their role in addressing concerns about anti-Black racism among Black patients with serious illness as well as their families.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this qualitative study, one-on-one semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 physicians at an academic county hospital between August 1 and October 31, 2022. Participants were provided clinical scenarios where anti-Black racism was a concern of a patient with serious illness. Participants were asked open-ended questions about initial impressions, prior similar experiences, potential strategies to address patients' concerns, and additional resources to support these conversations. A framework based on restorative justice was used to guide qualitative analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Perspectives on addressing anti-Black racism as described by physicians.

Results

A total of 21 medical subspecialists (mean [SD] age, 44.2 [7.8] years) participated in the study. Most physicians were women (14 [66.7%]), 4 were Asian (19.0%), 3 were Black (14.3%), and 14 were White (66.7%). Participants identified practices that are normalized in clinical settings that may perpetuate and exacerbate perceptions of anti-Black racism. Using provided scenarios and personal experiences, participants were able to describe how Black patients are harmed as a result of these practices. Last, participants identified strategies and resources for addressing Black patients' concerns and facilitating conflict resolution, but they stopped short of promoting personal or team accountability for anti-Black racism.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this qualitative study, physicians identified resources, skills, and processes that partially aligned with a restorative justice framework to address anti-Black racism and facilitate conflict resolution, but did not provide steps for actualizing accountability. Restorative justice and similar processes may provide space within a mediated setting for clinicians to repair harm, provide accountability, and facilitate racial healing.

### 'Global health': meaning what? [^111cbVc1]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

'Global health' is emerging as an increasingly widely invoked and powerful discursive construct. But what does it mean? It is described as a metaphor, a conceptual framing, a set of legal norms, and as a distinct field of practice; as an emerging science, an area of policy and research and as a formative disciplinary field of study. But the precise dimensions of the idea remain unclear.

While we have yet to clarify what we mean by global health, we should circumspect as to what it is allowed to mean. Too often, discourse appears to point in one direction, while reality runs rapidly in quite another. The appearance of an agreed language may obscure and suppress important differences in philosophy, strategy and priority. Global health may well be invoked to support and enable policies and actions with genuinely universal and equitable benefit. But it may also be used to justify measures that are neither progressive nor just.

We should not assume that a harmonious interpretation will, over time, emerge. Rather, we should expect an emergent global health paradigm to be characterised by potentially fierce contest. We should encourage that contest, played out through transparent, honest and evidence-based debate. The quality of that debate, from the health perspective, will depend on an ability to understand, engage with and draw on insights from a wide field of intellectual traditions and disciplines.

If global health is to be an organising framework for thinking and action, we should ask: what does it imply, what does it endorse? For proponents of a global health vision characterised by health as an intrinsic social goal, and by health equitably generated within and across populations, understanding how the concept is framed from other political perspectives, based on other disciplinary values, will require a polymathic capability — to engage with heterogeneous concepts in macro, micro and behavioural economics; in sociology, political science, international relations and public policy and in anthropology and institutional ethnography. It will require going beyond advocacy simply rooted in 'health', to understand what health means from other intellectual and political standpoints, and to engage and challenge where such standpoints traduce the values we seek in global health.

### The levels problem in psychopathology [^115ttq8R]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric disorders are studied at multiple levels, but there is no agreement on how these levels are related to each other, or how they should be understood in the first place. In this paper, I provide an account of levels and their relationships that is suited for psychopathology, drawing from recent debates in philosophy of science. Instead of metaphysical issues, the focus is on delivering an understanding of levels that is relevant and useful for scientific practice. I also defend a pragmatic approach to the question of reduction, arguing that even in-principle reductionists should embrace pluralism in practice. Finally, I discuss the benefits and challenges in integrating explanations and models of different levels.

### Physician perspectives on addressing anti-black racism [^115BQokp]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Reconciliation

Participants noted that creating an environment in which patients felt comfortable sharing their thoughts in the presence of a trusted HCW or advocate was important (Table 2). Many thought an advocate would also help prompt clinician self-reflection and provide "additional support for the patient, someone that could be an ally". The presence of mediators and advocates was endorsed by participants as helpful resources to guide clinicians toward validating and normalizing patients' concerns. After reflecting on the scenarios, a participant stated, "Getting someone else to help assess the situation would help with that additional perspective of, have I really offered the same to this patient as other patients?" Participants thought advocates would help move clinicians away from defensive behaviors and language and facilitate a patient-focused approach that validated concerns and facilitated mutual understanding: "There's a gap in communication that needs to be addressed for both parties to understand where the other is coming from and find alignment". Mutual understanding facilitates a patient-centered approach to finding a plan that is acceptable to the patient, even if this plan is not in line with a clinician's values. For many participants, this meant focusing on the patient's goals and the processes needed to achieve them. One participant shared, "What I bring to the discussion is based on what I'm hearing from [the patient] so at least the patient is initiating. They're given the first volley of saying, 'This is what's important to me', and then I can say, 'Well hearing that, it sounds like this is how we should take care of you'. Last, only 2 participants offered apologies as a part of reconciliation. One participant stated, "Hopefully there's going to be an apology and a step about what you're going to do differently next time".

### A NICE game of minecraft: philosophical flaws underpinning UK depression guideline nosology [^116mBkMv]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

The codification of mental disorders in manuals has been described by Thomas Schacht as intrinsic to the relationship between science and politics and the way in which psychiatrists gain significant social power by aligning themselves to science. 7 His argument drew on Szasz, who saw the mental health establishment as a therapeutic state; Zimbardo, who described psychiatric care as a controlling force; and Foucault, who described the categorisation of the mentally ill as a force for isolating 'the other'. Diagnostic critique has been further developed through a cultural relativist lens in that what Western psychiatrists classify as a depression is constructed differently in other cultures. 8 Considering these limitations, some critics have gone so far as to argue that psychiatric diagnostic systems should be abolished. 9

Yet architects of DSM manuals have worked hard to ensure the technology of classification is regarded as genuine scientific activity with sound roots in philosophy of science. In their philosophical defence of DSM IV, Allen Frances and colleagues address their critics under the headings 'nominalism vs realism', 'empiricism vs rationalism' and 'categorical vs dimensional' 10 The implication is that there are opposing stances in which a choice must be made or a middle ground forged by those reasonable enough to recognise the need for pragmatism in the service of clinical utility. The nominalism–realism debate is illustrated using as metaphor three different stances a cricket umpire might take on calling strikes and balls. The discussion sets out two of these as extreme views: 'at one extreme… those who take a reductionistically realistic view of the world' versus 'the solipsistic nominalists… might content that nothing exists'. Szasz, who is characterised as holding particularly extreme views, is named as an archetypal solipsist. There is implied to be a degree of arrogance associated with this view in the illustrative example in which the umpire states 'there are no balls and there are no strikes until I call them'. Frances therefore sets up a means of grouping two kinds of people as philosophical extremists who can be dismissed, while avoiding addressing the philosophical problems they pose.

### Realism, instrumentalism, and scientific symbiosis: psychological theory as a search for truth and the discovery of solutions [^111ZroPz]. The American Psychologist (2004). Low credibility.

Scientific realism holds that scientific theories are approximations of universal truths about reality, whereas scientific instrumentalism posits that scientific theories are intellectual structures that provide adequate predictions of what is observed and useful frameworks for answering questions and solving problems in a given domain. These philosophical perspectives have different strengths and weaknesses and have been regarded as incommensurate: Scientific realism fosters theoretical rigor, verifiability, parsimony, and debate, whereas scientific instrumentalism fosters theoretical innovation, synthesis, generativeness, and scope. The authors review the evolution of scientific realism and instrumentalism in psychology and propose that the categorical distinction between the 2 is overstated as a prescription for scientific practice. The authors propose that the iterative deployment of these 2 perspectives, just as the iterative application of inductive and deductive reasoning in science, may promote more rigorous, integrative, cumulative, and useful scientific theories.

### False dichotomies: EBM, clinical freedom, and the art of medicine [^1127yYbd]. Medical Humanities (2005). Low credibility.

According to numerous commentators, clinical freedom, the art of medicine, and, by implication, a degree of patient welfare, are threatened by evidence based medicine (EBM). As EBM has developed over the last fifteen years, claims about better evidence for medical treatments, and improvements in healthcare delivery, have been matched by critiques of EBM's reductionism and uniformity, its problematic application to individual patients, and its alleged denial of the continuing need for clinical interpretation, insight, and judgment. Most of these attacks on EBM and defences of clinical freedom fail. They are based on erroneous understandings of the relationships between inductive knowledge, clinical uncertainty, and action. Evidence based medicine is a necessary condition for clinical freedom, not a threat to it, and EBM is not something to be balanced with either clinical experience or patient preferences. The art and science of medicine are more conceptually and practically connected than the defenders of clinical freedom, whatever they conceive that to be, are willing to admit.

### What is nature capable of? Evidence, ontology and speculative medical humanities [^116kzPvB]. Medical Humanities (2016). Low credibility.

Expanding on the recent call for a 'critical medical humanities' to intervene in questions of the ontology of health, this article develops a what we call a 'speculative' orientation to such interventions in relation to some of the ontological commitments on which contemporary biomedical cultures rest. We argue that crucial to this task is an approach to ontology that treats it not as a question of first principles, but as a matter of the consequences of the images of nature that contemporary biomedical research practices espouse when they make claims to evidence, as well as the possible consequences of imagining different worlds in which health and disease processes partake. By attending to the implicit ontological assumptions involved in the method par excellence of biomedical research, namely the randomised controlled trial (RCT), we argue that the mechanistic ontology that tacitly informs evidence-based biomedical research simultaneously authorises a series of problematic consequences for understanding and intervening practically in the concrete realities of health. As a response, we develop an alternative ontological proposition that regards processes of health and disease as always situated achievements. We show that, without disqualifying RCT-based evidence, such a situated ontology enables one to resist the reduction of the realities of health and disease to biomedicine's current forms of explanation. In so doing, we call for medical humanities scholars to actively engage in the speculative question of what nature may be capable of.

### Antiracism: an ethical imperative [^114EKHzm]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Pediatric ethicists hold a privileged position of influence within health care institutions. Such a position confers a corresponding responsibility to address barriers to the health and flourishing of all children. A major barrier to children's health is racism. Pediatric ethicists can, and should, leverage their position to address racism both in institutional policy and the provision of pediatric care. Health care's historical and continued contributions to fostering and sustaining racist values and systems mean that those within all medical fields- regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age, or profession-should consider ways they can work to offset and ultimately dismantle those values and systems. Institutional policy is a critical mechanism propagating racism in hospitals and an area where ethicists have a unique perspective to bring antiracism into ethical analysis. Many institutional and organizational policies have unintended consequences, negatively impacting children and families who have been historically marginalized and oppressed. In this paper, we report and discuss existing policies, along with how they are implemented (procedures) and how they are conducted (practices), identified through a workshop during a pediatric subgroup meeting at an annual bioethics conference. We highlight the need to focus on these structural factors and reference scholarship that can be used to correct institutional policies that uphold white supremacy. We conclude with actionable, concrete recommendations for change.

### Recharging family medicine: a perspective from the keystone IV conference [^114PtE27]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A historic perspective of family medicine's development, the work of Gayle Stephens, and prior Keystone conferences constitute an important backdrop for the fourth Keystone Conference. Decisions made in the past constrain what can be done now, but they may also offer opportunities for family medicine. A major challenge for Keystone IV was to discern what is a constraint and what is an opportunity-in particular when it comes to the role of the personal physician. This article provides reflections based on decades of observation and study and confirms that knowing something and doing something are not the same.

### Opacity, difference and not knowing: what can psychiatry learn from the work ofédouard glissant? [^113ZD7TS]. Medical Humanities (2024). Medium credibility.

It may very well be that the notion of creolisation has fallen out of fashion in recent years; for contemporary scholars, a creolising world is, perhaps, more or less taken for granted and highlighting the impact of global interconnectedness may be seen as stating the obvious. The present article is not an attempt to revive the discussion about the implications of creolisation for the field of cultural psychiatry or the clinical sciences in a broader sense. Instead, I would like to bring to the fore another element in the work of Édouard Glissant: that of the importance of acknowledging opacity in the encounter with the Other. As described in some more detail below, the concept of opacity as introduced and developed by Glissant has primarily been embraced by the academic fields of poststructural philosophy and literary studies as well as in postcolonial or Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour activism. I would argue, however, that opacity is also a highly relevant notion in clinical contexts, as an essential resource for understanding concepts such as first-person, second-person and third-person perspectives in the phenomenology of patient-clinician encounters. By focusing on the inherently opaque nature of the patient-as-Other and its moral-ethical implications for psychiatry — beyond creolisation as a buzzword — I hope to show that Glissant does not belong to some sort of trivial 'anything goes' strand of abstract postmodernism, but that his work does indeed offer rich and tangible insight into alterity in the clinical encounter and the boundaries of empathy.

### The implicit ideological function of the global health field and its role in maintaining relations of power [^111fa81T]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

Ideology functions to naturalise and maintain prevailing relations of power. Recent debates about power imbalances in global health have urged the field to contest 'all forms of supremacy', 'to become actively anti-supremacist, and also anti-oppressionist and anti-racist' in order 'to transcend its origin'. This is a necessary step for transforming the field towards greater equity. But it is not enough. Critiquing particular ideological contents does not address how ideology operates. Without understanding and critiquing how ideology operates, we risk losing sight of new narratives in the making to legitimise inequalities.

As I am writing this article as an employee at the Gates Foundation, my own critical self-reflection gives rise to a sense of unease from recognising the inherent contradiction in my privileged position. No amount of writing about the ideological function of the field will 'cancel out' this conflict, and that is precisely the point: to confront the unease in recognising the injustice embedded in the structure, and my own inextricable role in it. Denying this conflict with 'but I am doing my part' obscures my role in perpetuating the structure of injustice. My intent is irrelevant. What matters is what is implicit in my doing.

Let us 'do our part' but let us not fall for an illusion that it is possible to escape the ideological pressure and conditioning which are inherent in an unequal and unjust society. That may sound pessimistic, but it is far from it. The point is to confront ideology and make it visible. Solidarity is unimaginable otherwise. Spaces for shared struggle open when we collectively confront the injustices inherent in the system, and our role in sustaining it. When we make visible this implicit ideological function that global health field performs, we can see new directions, new ideas and new allies for collective action that are otherwise kept unimaginable.

### Community-engaged research perspectives: then and now [^115qxQAS]. Academic Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

To fully appreciate the health of an individual, it is necessary to understand the effect of a person's attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors within their social, environmental, and cultural context. The medical model, although extremely useful, has its limitations when it comes to understanding the health of people as they live in the world. Wellness does not happen in the doctor's office alone, akin to the fact that scientific discovery is not limited to a laboratory. In this perspectives article, we posit that by using a community-engaged research approach, we not only allow for the translation of scientific discovery into clinical practice and public health initiatives, but we also create a new way of generating and integrating knowledge to improve health outcomes. In short, community-engaged research is not only a tool for translation, it is unique method for scientific discovery bringing transdisciplinary teams together that study health problems in real-world contexts and consider sustainability at the front end of asking the research question.

### The social value of candidate HIV cures: actualism versus possibilism [^115sQYc1]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

Moreover, judging what lines of inquiry are most likely to succeed is challenging even if one is a possibilist. Uncertainty about, say, the technical possibility of a cure is the same, independent of the stance one takes about actualism. Actualists do not differ from possibilists on questions that turn on the likelihood of a line of inquiry paying dividends in the form of promoting health (or some other good). There is evidence that 'blue skies' research, for example — research that is not pursued with an explicit pragmatic goal in mind, but rather out of curiosity about some feature of the natural world — can lead to considerable benefits; an actualist can acknowledge the value of blue skies research while maintaining the argument that when discussing priorities of goal-driven clinical research, we ought to account for our motivations to carry out our actions. If actualist considerations are burdensome, it is only a matter of degree, not of kind. And, as we claim, there is no in-principle reason why deliberation about feasibility ought to be something pursued by lone researchers.

### A NICE game of minecraft: philosophical flaws underpinning UK depression guideline nosology [^113xpxfw]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Frances provides little if any justification for the middle ground stance, 'There are balls and there are strikes and I call them as I see them', other than to focus on its clinical utility and the lack of clinical utility in the alternatives 'naïve realism' and 'heuristically barren solipsism'. The natural conclusion the reader is invited to reach is that a middle ground of a heuristic concept is naturally right because it is not extreme and is naturally useful clinically, without specifying in what way this stance is coherent, resolves the two alternatives, and in what way a heuristic construct that is not 'real' can be subject to scientific testing.

Similarly, in discussing the 'categorical vs dimensional', Frances promotes the 'prototype approach'. Those holding opposing views are labelled as 'dualists' or 'dichotomisers'. The prototypical approach is again put forward as a clinically useful middle ground. Illustrations are drawn from natural science: 'a triangle and a square are never the same', inciting the reader to consider science as value-free. The prototypical approach emerges as a natural solution, yet the authors do not address how a diagnostic prototype resolves the issues posed by the two alternatives, nor how a prototype can be subjected to natural science methods.

The argument presented here is not a defence of solipsism or dualism; rather it aims to illustrate that if for pragmatic purposes clinicians and policymakers choose to gloss over the philosophical flaws in classification practices, it is then risky to move beyond the heuristic and apply natural science methods to these constructs adding multiple layers of technocratic subclassification. Doing so is more like playing Minecraft than cricket. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for depression is taken as an example of the philosophical errors that can follow from playing Minecraft with unsound heuristic devices, specifically subcategories of persistent forms of depression. As well as serving a clinical purpose, diagnosis in medicine is a way of allocating resources for insurance companies and constructing clinical guidelines, which in turn determine rationing within the National Health Service. The consequences for recipients of healthcare are therefore significant; clinical utility is arguably not being served at all and patients are left at risk of poor-quality care.

### The role of the physician in laboratory medicine: a European perspective [^111RRs2K]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Advances in medical laboratory technology have driven major changes in the practice of laboratory medicine over the past two decades by the development of automated, cross-disciplinary single platform analysers. This has led to the blurring of boundaries between traditional disciplines and the emergence of core automated or blood science laboratories. This paper was commissioned by the Union of European Medical Specialists to examine the changing role of laboratory-based physicians in the light of these advances by focusing on the added value of expert interpretation of test results and resultant improvements in clinical outcomes. The paper also considers the broad range of responsibilities of laboratory-based physicians and the difficulties in precisely measuring how this translates into improved clinical outcomes. Given its provenance, the paper concentrates predominantly on the role of laboratory-based physicians while acknowledging the essential and vital role of scientists in running diagnostic laboratory services.

### Physician perspectives on addressing anti-black racism [^1114xDNo]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Addressing Barriers to Reconciliation

Participants noted clinician values are frequently misaligned with patients' values, often resulting in negative perceptions of patient and family choices (Table 2). These conflicting values contributed to the moral distress participants experienced and worsened perceptions and communication with patients when there was conflict. One participant shared, "Our values are not aligned with what patients need, especially patients with social barriers and challenges to receiving health care". Participants believed improved transparency from both clinicians and patients might improve understanding around goals of care and help find alignment. One participant shared, "I wonder if a patient or their family are not feeling like they can bring up what it is that is keeping them from making certain choices". Another participant shared, "I tell patients and families that I come to this with my own set of values and that's part of where our guidance comes from. I think that that has been positively received".

### Avoiding hypersensitive reluctance to address parental responsibility in childhood obesity [^114biMYK]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, deliberative-oriented physicians view parents as carrying specific role responsibilities. These physicians act as teachers by trying to educate parents about their role and (normatively) persuading parents to choose the best interventions for their children. Role responsibility may be attributed to parents because of their specific role, regardless of their capacity to control their children's conduct or the circumstances in which they make their choices. However, the very point of a deliberative-oriented physician–patient/parent interaction is to develop capacities to engage in necessary behaviour changes by critically reflecting on the parental role and its requirements — trying to prevent children from becoming obese and to adequately intervene if this should happen.

Given that childhood obesity is harmful and that addressing parental responsibility is likely to be effective, the negative consequences of ignoring parental responsibility can be considerable. In a clinical context characterised by conflicting values and ongoing physician–patient/parent interactions, it seems that attempts to persuade parents about the desirableness of a course of action might be justified, and even encouraged. In these settings, we claim that the deliberative model should be preferred. It seems to best capture current ideas of antipaternalism, patient autonomy, and shared and evidence-informed decision-making. A deliberative-oriented physician-patient/parent might also facilitate parental role development. Consequently, reluctance to address parental responsibility in the physician–patient/parent encounter is difficult to defend. The following paragraphs present three points to support this claim.

First, parents have role responsibilities by virtue of being parents. Children generally lack the moral, emotional and cognitive capacities to be responsible for themselves; thus, parents take on the responsibility for ensuring their children's well-being. Though different parents have different opportunities and capacities for guiding and helping their children, we believe physicians should avoid a 'hypersensitive' stance and engage parents in deliberations about the parental role in childhood obesity. Addressing the topic is a necessary condition, and employing a deliberative model for physician–patient/parent interaction may facilitate such conversations.

Second, not addressing parental responsibility can de facto individualise the problem and make it more difficult for parents to articulate social and environmental barriers for lifestyle change. This may indirectly result in a search for causal explanations in the children themselves. If the children remain the only subject of scrutiny, and if other relevant explanations are disregarded, this can place an additional burden on the children. Hence, to activate the parents' role is an independent argument.

### Obesity and advocacy: a joint clinical perspective and expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the obesity action coalition – 2024 [^111YBubM]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Obesity advocacy — abstract overview and organizational context states that this joint clinical perspective by the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) and Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) provides clinicians an overview of the role of advocacy in improving the lives of patients living with the disease of obesity and describes opportunities to engage in advocacy, and it is based upon scientific evidence, clinical experiences, and peer review by the OMA leadership. The abstract specifies that the Obesity Medicine Association is the largest organization of physicians, nurse practitioners, physician associates, and other clinical experts with over 5000 members at time of print, and that the OAC is a national nonprofit organization of more than 80,000 members. It states that advocacy involves educational and public policy initiatives using relationships, networks, and targeted strategies and tactics — such as traditional media, social media, petitions, and direct communication with policy makers — to promote public awareness and establish public policies that help mitigate bias, stigma, and discrimination and generally improve the lives of patients living with obesity. The conclusions emphasize that an objective of advocacy is to foster collective involvement and community engagement that help empower patients and clinicians to seek and achieve changes in policy, environment, and societal attitudes, and note that advocacy may also enhance public awareness, promote prevention, advance clinical research, develop safe and effective evidenced-based therapeutic interventions, and facilitate patient access to comprehensive and compassionate treatment.

### How and why to use' vulnerability': an interdisciplinary analysis of disease risk, indeterminacy and normality [^112JZcsE]. Medical Humanities (2024). Medium credibility.

Position and approach

We, the authors, are writing as a group of scholars with different disciplinary orientations towards theoretical, professional and popular spaces. We are, though, all qualitative researchers, and engaged to different degrees with medical humanities and science and technology studies (STS). Within our collaborative discussions, we have noticed that vulnerability is an emerging way of situating and approaching disease, and arguably a key concept in the contemporary landscape of how disease is understood. We believe our interdisciplinary perspective can illuminate some of the context and stakes of this development, as we combine backgrounds in anthropology, bioethics, history, philosophy and sociology. To varying degrees, we draw from and participate in gender studies and feminist theory, critical public/global health, disability studies, and anticolonial and critical race theory.

Through coming together to discuss the valences of vulnerability, we grappled both with the different ways we had encountered the term as well as a range of orientations towards the methods and aims of scholarship. This includes scholarship's normative dimensions; that is, to what extent and in what ways our scholarship promotes a vision of the world as it should be. Of course, to some extent any critical work promotes a normative view, and no description can be neutral. Still, some disciplinary traditions are more comfortable than others with producing openly prescriptive work. Our collaboration also reinforced a need to distinguish between actors' categories and analysts' categories — that is, when are we using the term vulnerability to describe something about the world, versus describing how 'people in the world' are using vulnerability to characterise bodies and agents, and to take actions. Through considering manifestations of vulnerability across theoretical, professional and popular spaces, we have sought to draw from the strengths of our multiple analytical and empirical approaches. Given the conceptual nature of this paper, it was not appropriate or possible to involve patients or the public in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.

### Fake news, alternative facts, and things that just are not true: can science survive the post-truth era? [^112gMtjT]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Perhaps more than at any time in history, we are graced by scientific achievements that promise to revolutionize the health and well-being of people all over the world. Given that science has been so successful, the threat imposed by post-truth thinking seems distant, and unlikely to emerge within the modern scientific community. However, it bears emphasis that scientists engage in post-truth thinking, often with the best intentions, and often without knowing it. There are several likely explanations for how this might occur. First, the rapidly changing nature of science means it can disrupt existing paradigms, so that scientists whose body of scientific work depends on existing paradigms may be slow(er) and or resistant to adopt new ideas. I can recall sitting in various study sections listening to rigorous discussions from learned colleagues about how a new idea proposed in a grant could not possibly be true because that new idea did not conform to the existing paradigms. In this setting, the debate over what is true and false is ultimately determined by the conditions under which what is true and false is decided. Another explanation is that what is deemed as the truth scientifically is often context dependent. Philosophers have termed this concept "epistemic relativism", emphasizing that there are no facts, only interpretations of facts. As physician scientists, we study diseases that are the result of perturbations that arise within complex, homeostatic biological systems that have become dysregulated for some reason. In one context, blocking the biological system may lead to loss of homeostasis and worsening outcomes; in another context, blocking the dysregulated system may lead to improved outcomes. Thus, the data provided by rigorously performed scientific studies are rarely black and white and are dependent on the contextual boundaries imposed by the experimental conditions chosen by the investigator. Third, and this may come as a shock, the scientific community is not immune to investigators who purvey fake news, alternative facts, and things that are just not true. Fortunately, in my experience, these individuals are rare. In his 1988 Presidential Address to the American Society for Clinical Investigation, Robert Lefkowitz spoke eloquently about the 3 elements of the spirit of science: enthusiasm for new knowledge, creativity, and integrity. Lefkowitz described integrity as "an unswerving commitment to what we perceive as true and right, and to a set of consistent, personally realized principles of action". He states:

### Towards an agenda for implementation science in global health: there is nothing more practical than good (social science) theories [^1146Pkda]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

One approach to research that is explicitly built on developing middle range theories is realist evaluation (or realist research). Developed by Pawson and Tilley in the late 1990srealist evaluation is inspired by critical realism, of which Ridde says that "theoretical approach of critical realism, (which) is not well-tested in LMICs [low- and middle-income countries]". This should not be surprising: critical realism is a philosophy of science, developed by Bhaskar, Archer et al. Realist research adopted some key principles of critical realismand is much more used in health policy and systems research than critical realism itself. The clarion call of realist research 'to find out not only what works, but how, for whom and why?' is nowadays widely echoed in this field. In our experience, this is with just cause: realist research (and theory-driven approaches in general) is well suited to demonstrate the interplay between policy, programme or intervention, context, actors, causal mechanisms and outcomes. It is, indeed, complexity-sensitive. Realist research explicitly aims at building and refining middle range theory through the analytical comparison between cases and by using the configuration of contextual conditions, mechanisms and outcomes as a heuristic. The gradual development of theory during analysis provides a bridge between cases.

### Science fiction and the medical humanities [^111pnDRV]. Medical Humanities (2016). Low credibility.

Research on science fiction within the medical humanities should articulate interpretative frameworks that do justice to medical themes within the genre. This means challenging modes of reading that encourage unduly narrow accounts of science fiction. Admittedly, science studies has moved away from reading science fiction as a variety of scientific popularisation and instead understands science fiction as an intervention in the technoscientific imaginary that calls for investment in particular scientific enterprises, including various biomedical technologies. However, this mode of reading neglects science fiction's critical relationship to the construction of 'the future' in the present: the ways in which science fiction proposes concrete alternatives to hegemonic narratives of medical progress and fosters critical self-awareness of the contingent activity which gives 'the future' substance in the here-and-now. Moreover, the future orientation of science fiction should not distract from the function of medical science fiction as 'cognitive estrangement': the technological innovations that dominate science-fiction narratives are less concrete predictions and more generic devices that explain in historical time the origins of a marvellous world bearing provocative correspondences to our own, everyday reality. The editorial concludes with a series of introductions to the articles comprising the special issue, covering the print edition and a special online-only section.

AHA/ACC professionalism and ethics — historical perspective and scope describe that the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have longstanding efforts in ethics and professionalism, and they sponsored a conference on medical professionalism and ethics on October 19 to 20, 2020. The stated purpose was to address the practical management of professional and ethical behavior of cardiovascular clinicians and scientists and to make specific recommendations in light of contemporary issues. Prior conference subtopics included acting in the patient's interest, respecting the patient's preferences, distributive justice, physician responses to society, medical decision making, end-of-life decisions, conflicts of interest (COIs), and relationships with industry (RWIs), as well as palliative care, futile care, foregoing treatment and advance care planning, physician-assisted suicide, and the ethical, legal, and social implications of the Human Genome Project. The ACC/AHA Consensus Conference also addressed COIs and proper disclosure, research involving human subjects and confidentiality of research activities, avoidance of bias in clinical trials, physician self-referral, direct-to-consumer advertising, and legal frameworks including antikickback statutes and Stark laws.

### The transformation of (bio) ethics expertise in a world of ethical pluralism [^112wTxYi]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

Today, bioethics experts have an increasing role in public life. However, the question arises: what does bioethics expertise really mean? Can there be such a thing in our globalised world characterised by ethical pluralism? I will argue that bioethics as a discipline represents the transformation of ethics expertise from a hard to a soft form of it. Bioethics was born as a reaction to the growing awareness of ethical pluralism, and it denied the hard form of normative-prescriptive ethics expertise (the ability to determine what is the right course of action for others), particularly in its medical ethics form. In contrast, the traditional medical ethics model, and pre-modern societies in general, believed in hard normative ethics expertise. From this followed the characteristic paternalism of traditional medical practice: if physicians were experts in moral matters as well, if they knew what the right course of action to choose was, then they had a right to benevolently force this course of action on their patients. The remnants of this doctrine, although rarely stated explicitly, still can often be seen in clinical practice. The whole bioethics movement can be seen as a radical denial of the doctrine of physician's hard expertise in moral matters. Bioethics, however, represents a type of soft ethics expertise (mainly value sensitivity). Hence follows the seeming paradox of bioethics expertise: bioethics is both a denial of ethics expertise (in its hard form) as well as a type of (soft) ethics expertise.

### The evidence thing [^116aPrnh]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The methodology of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become dominant in the clinical field to the detriment of historically validated paradigms. The philosophical background of EBM is considered and the strengths and flaws of its main tools (randomized trials and meta-analysis) are reviewed. The structural format of EBM speaks the language of regulators and health planners, satisfies the needs of the academic-industrial complex, and is favored by editors of medical journals. Specific problems of trials of medical versus surgical therapy are noted. The deductive-numerical approach of EBM is a methodology geared to ascertain the most effective management of a condition when the differences observed between the two entities being considered is small. EBM methodology is unlikely to lead to discovery of new diseases or treatments; the latter derive from alert observation and inductive inference. While its contribution to the rigorous analysis of effectiveness of some therapies is acknowledged, EBM is not the nostrum of clinical research. Observational and inductive clinical intelligence should be stimulated and published because a therapy needs to be invented before it is proven effective. Biomathematicians need to improve nonrandomized methodology as they did for randomized studies.

### Conceptualization of utility in translational clinical genomics research [^116PVqwr]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Prior to integration into clinical care, a novel medical innovation is typically assessed in terms of its balance of benefits and risks, often referred to as utility. Members of multidisciplinary research teams may conceptualize and assess utility in different ways, which has implications within the translational genomics community and for the evidence base upon which clinical guidelines groups and healthcare payers make decisions. Ambiguity in the conceptualization of utility in translational genomics research can lead to communication challenges within research teams and to study designs that do not meet stakeholder needs. We seek to address the ambiguity challenge by describing the conceptual understanding of utility and use of the term by scholars in the fields of philosophy, medicine, and the social sciences of decision psychology and health economics. We illustrate applications of each field's orientation to translational genomics research by using examples from the Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium, and we provide recommendations for increasing clarity and cohesion in future research. Given that different understandings of utility will align to a greater or lesser degree with important stakeholders' views, more precise use of the term can help researchers to better integrate multidisciplinary investigations and communicate with stakeholders.

### Moral pluralism versus the total view: why singer is wrong about radical life extension [^114WPjFT]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

Peter Singer has argued that we should not proceed with a hypothetical life-extension drug, based on a scenario in which developing the drug would fail to achieve the greatest sum of happiness over time. However, this is the wrong test. If we ask, more simply, which policy would be more benevolent, we reach a different conclusion from Singer's: even given his (admittedly questionable) scenario, development of the drug should go ahead. Singer's rigorous utilitarian position pushes him in the direction of an implausible "total view" utilitarianism when it encounters the problems presented by certain thought experiments. A more pluralistic account of the nature of morality promises to solve these problems, and in this case it reaches a benevolent recommendation on life-extension technology.

### Evidence based medicine: a movement in crisis? [^111cVNp3]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Research must transcend conflicts of interest

To support real evidence based medicine, and in particular to reassure policy makers, clinicians, and the public that research and the guidance derived from it can be trusted, the infrastructure for research and guideline development must show the highest standards of probity. Independent funding of national bodies for medical research is crucial.

Broader, more imaginative research is needed

The research agenda for real evidence based medicine is much broader than critical appraisal and draws on a wider range of underpinning disciplines. For example, it should include the study of the patient's experience of illness and the real life clinical encounter for different conditions and in different circumstances. The field would be enriched, for example, by qualitative research to elucidate the logic of care–that is, the numerous elements of good illness management that are complementary to the application of research evidence.

We need to gain a better understanding (perhaps beginning with a synthesis of the cognitive psychology literature) of how clinicians and patients find, interpret, and evaluate evidence from research studies, and how (and if) these processes feed into clinical communication, exploration of diagnostic options, and shared decision making. Deeper study is also needed into the less algorithmic components of clinical method such as intuition and heuristic reasoning, and how evidence may be incorporated into such reasoning.

In relation to producing usable evidence, we need to identify how to balance gold standard systematic reviews with pragmatic, rapid reviews that gain in timeliness and accessibility what they lose in depth and detail. In the same vein, we need research on how and in what circumstances to trade detail for brevity in developing guidelines. We need to develop decision aids that support clinicians and patients to clarify the goals of care, raise and answer questions about the quality and completeness of evidence, and understand and contextualise estimates of benefit and harm. We also need to improve both the usefulness and ease of use of these and other evidence based tools (models, scores, algorithms, and so on) including the intellectual, social, and temporal demands they make on users and the resource implications for the healthcare organisation and system.

### Cultural understanding in the provision of supportive and palliative care: perspectives in relation to an indigenous population [^114MEYxG]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2013). Medium credibility.

Special respect and deference for elders is a fundamental given in Mi'kmaq communities. Some respected elders are known for their knowledge and wisdom of oral traditions and this may not necessarily be related to age. Elders are well known and play a significant role in the community. Healthcare providers must build relations with respected elders in the community as the relationship is seen as a partnership for addressing culturally competent care for community members.

Historically, care giving was defined within the context of reciprocity, and was often experienced throughout the lifespan. Today, there are differences in the availability of supports that exist on and off reserve which has led to changes in care, particularly around the role of the community in providing assistance and the role of family in providing respite care.

A sense of family, community and traditional views of spirituality frame the view of health among Mi'kmaq. There is a rooted belief in the strength of prayer and faith in its ability to cure as much as any intervention. More value may be placed on quality of life rather than on pursuit of a cure when life balance and wellness are a part of the holism that is ethically equated with mental, physical, emotional and spiritual health.

Aboriginal worldviews see health as more than a lack of disease. Health is linked to the economy, the land, community and culture. Emphasis on biomedical treatment through technological interventions may be associated with a colonial approach to health, while at the same time diverse perspectives regarding aggressive treatment and technology abound. A study reported that 66% of a sample of 100 Mi'kmaw patients at a community health centre used Mi'kmaq medicine. Of those, 24.3% reported using it as a first-line of treatment, 92.4% had not discussed this with their physician and 31.8% said they believed Mi'kmaq medicine was better overall than Western medicine. Non-Mi'kmaq healthcare providers should not assume that someone in their care is following treatment measures prescribed by Western medicine and should openly discuss this with clients in a non-judgemental manner. It is important for non-Mi'kmaq healthcare providers to understand and appreciate the worldview, spirituality, role of family and community, and communication norms of Mi'kmaw individuals with whom they are working, and to strive for an alignment of values in the provision of care.

### Physician perspectives on addressing anti-black racism [^1134mSJr]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we describe skills and resources identified by physicians to address the effect and harm of anti-Black racism in clinical settings through the novel use of a restorative justice framework to guide qualitative analyses around communication about serious illness. Through the combined use of provided scenarios and personal experiences, participants described harmful behaviors and cultural norms that perpetuate and exacerbate anti-Black racism in the hospital setting, even if these harms are unintentional. Participants identified potential steps to resolve conflict and address patient concerns, but additional processes are needed to facilitate repair and accountability. Prior reports of the application of RJPs in schools suggest that these practices are associated with a decrease in harmful, biased disciplinary practices against students of racial and ethnic minority populations, lower levels of absenteeism, and an increased sense of community. Studies suggest that educators benefit from RJPs, but learning and accepting restorative approaches require a transformative shift away from status quo concepts of accountability that protects privilege and social standing. Similarly, actualizing accountability for anti-Black racism in health care settings requires shifting away from the power and privilege afforded to HCWs and health care institutions, and toward patients and communities that are traditionally marginalized. This suggests a need to introduce and educate stakeholders about RJPs before broad implementation.

The use of scenarios in this study promoted discussions with participants about conflict perpetuated by anti-Black racism and the difficulties resolving them, enabling us to expand on findings in the original study. For example, participants described how cultural norms and usual communication practices may facilitate biased behavior or result in misunderstandings that further marginalize patients. Although the original study described initial feelings of defensiveness on hearing patients' concerns about racism in their care, a restorative justice lens further illuminated how defensive behaviors and language continue to propagate more harm on marginalized patients. The concepts of time and space in the original study were described as a need that mostly served physicians to help them process hard-to-hear feedback; with a restorative justice framework, time and space further emerged as important components to facilitate perspective taking, validate patient concerns, decrease harmful behaviors, and promote mutual understanding to find a path forward in a plan of care. Transparency in the original study was largely described as a factor to bring awareness to clinicians about patients' concerns, but a restorative justice lens suggests that transparency is needed from both patients and clinicians, as the incongruency of clinicians' values with those of their patients contributed to moral distress and worsened patient-clinician conflict.

### Is it about the 'where' or the ' how'? Comment on… [^112meKcD]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Overall, we stand firmly behind the authors' efforts to push towards the decolonisation of the field of global health. Colonialism remains the original sin of global health and we believe that asking ourselves, 'why practise somewhere else?' is worthwhile. Likewise, the examination of our underlying assumptions and normative concerns is imperative in order to move the study and practice of global health towards delivering health equitably for all, everywhere. That is to say, the focus of global health should revolve around concerns of equity, social determinants, power and holistic well-being. Nevertheless, the authors suggest that the field is distinguished by the geographical relationship between practitioners and recipients, and we feel that this definition is too limiting and does not do justice to the otherwise strong arguments made in the paper.

### Homo immunologicus: on the limits of critique [^112xx2ZH]. Medical Humanities (2015). Low credibility.

Through a discussion of a range of research drawn from the humanities and social sciences, and with a particular emphasis on work that tackles questions about the discourse of the life sciences, this paper considers some of the difficulties with research that aims to offer a critical analysis of immunology and its relationship to culture. It considers in particular arguments made on behalf of a biopolitical reading of the life sciences and, by examining the uncertain shift between discursive analysis and philosophical claim, it seeks to address some of the underlying assumptions made about the relations between different kinds of knowledge practice in the interplay between life science, philosophy and culture. Drawing on the work of Belgian philosopher of science Isabelle Stengers to consider the ways in which critical and philosophical appraisals of immunology adopt a characteristically modern stance in the way that they address the life sciences, it further seeks to characterise some of the limits that such forms of critique display.

### Does medical humanities matter? The challenge of COVID-19 [^113J78t3]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Other, more deep-seated, hidden and distal issues are more difficult to address and to identify in the first place. It may be possible to address the specific problem of lack of trust by bringing in local leaders, faith leaders and champions, but this is an approach that will not counter the long-standing and deep-seated problem of structural racism that, intersecting with socio-economic disadvantage, has been the underlying cause of differential COVID-19 susceptibility as well as hesitancy. The assumption that all communities trust authority and will respond 'like us' — that is, the included, white, middle class and by implication 'reasonable' citizen — may well demonstrate structural racism in action. Far from acknowledging and building this understanding into the vaccine programme, a controversial UK report published during the pandemic appeared to deny the existence of structural racism concluding that inequalities associated with COVID-19 were entirely owing to socio-economic disadvantage.

In the USA, vaccine hesitancy has also been a function of what has become known as Christian Nationalism. The online journal The Conversation reported in April 2021 that white evangelicals in the USA were the religious group least likely to say they would be vaccinated against COVID-19. Nearly half said they would not get the jab against 30% in the general population. This again illustrates the way in which COVID-19 has become entangled with a developing cultural tendency to distrust science, medicine, expertise more generally and what might be seen as an institutional 'elite'.

This lack of trust in institutions is problematic. The vaccine programme operates on the assumption that individuals are willing to take action in the present to prevent a future undesired event from happening, that is, infection with COVID-19. The anthropologist, Vincanne Adams has gone so far as to suggest that this 'anticipatory episteme' has become a 'defining quality of our current moment' (, 246). Writing before the pandemic, Adams suggested that this 'defining quality is its characteristic state of anticipation, of thinking and living toward the future' (, 246). At that time, this insight was directed towards things like risky health behaviours that might lead to problems in later life, but it is wholly appropriate for our current context. As Adams and colleagues say:

### Science and the imagination in the age of reason [^116sUqb3]. Medical Humanities (2001). Low credibility.

The eighteenth century is commonly thought of as the "age of reason", an age in which the imagination was not given a central role in the arts, far less in science. But in Hume's attempts to account for our belief in a continuing external world he is forced into invoking the activity of the imagination. His views on the activity of the imagination greatly influenced Adam Smith, who adapted them to fashion a theory of the psychology of scientific discovery. In this theory the imagination is shown to be active in creating systematic explanations of the phenomena of nature, to the extent that Smith depicts the aim of scientific theory as that of satisfying the imagination. Smith's account of the logic of scientific theory can be defended even in contemporary philosophy of science. In particular, it can be maintained that all scientific theories are works of the imagination and that the concept of truth does not directly apply to them.

### Toward a limited realism for psychiatric nosology based on the coherence theory of truth [^111gCjjN]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A fundamental debate in the philosophy of science is whether our central concepts are true or only useful instruments to help predict and manipulate the world. The first position is termed 'realism' and the second 'instrumentalism'. Strong support for the instrumentalist position comes from the 'pessimistic induction' (PI) argument. Given that many key scientific concepts once considered true (e.g., humors, ether, epicycles, phlogiston) are now considered false, how, the argument goes, can we assert that our current concepts are true? The PI argument applies strongly to psychiatric diagnoses. Given our long history of abandoned diagnoses, arguments that we have finally 'gotten it right' and developed definitive psychiatric categories that correspond to observer-independent reality are difficult to defend. For our current diagnostic categories, we should settle for a less ambitious vision of truth. For this, the coherence theory, which postulates that something is true when it fits well with the other things we confidently know about the world, can serve us well. Using the coherence theory, a diagnosis is real to the extent that it is well integrated into our accumulating scientific data base. Furthermore, the coherence theory establishes a framework for us to evaluate our diagnostic categories and can provide a set of criteria, closely related to our concept of validators, for deciding when they are getting better. Finally, we need be much less skeptical about the truth status of the aggregate concept of psychiatric illness than we are regarding the specific categories in our current nosology.

### Agency, embodiment and enactment in psychosomatic theory and practice [^113HzxaM]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

The ways that we narrate our experience influence our interactions with others in the social world and this, in turn, reshapes our experience. These kinds of feedback processes are central to what the philosopher Ian Hacking has called 'looping effects'. 12 Looping effects can occur at many levels in the hierarchical organisation of biological and social systems, including the internal neural and hormonal regulation of the body's physiological systems; the bodily-cognitive-emotional cycles that contribute to the amplification of distress; sensorimotor engagements with the environment; interpersonal interactions in dyads, families and other social groups; and the larger social processes of institutionalising particular conceptual categories and practices like medical diagnosis. 13 In his own historical case studies, Hacking shows how looping effects at the broadest conceptual and societal level influence our ontologies. Moreover, looping effects can traverse multiple levels of organisation, linking the different levels (eg, biological and social) needed to understand and explain human experience in health and illness. 14

Many who concede that complex behaviour and cognition can emerge from suitably arranged computational networks would still insist that the most distinctive features of human experience, our conscious awareness and subjectivity, represent a fundamentally different process that cannot be given a materialist account. This so-called 'hard problem' of consciousness is the last bastion of dualists. 15 Efforts to explain consciousness may reduce it to capacities for self-observation and narration, link it with specific brain circuitry that enables arousal, activation, attention and awareness, equate it with the overall capacity for multimodal information integration in the brain, or make it intrinsic to sensory-perceptual engagements. 16 However, these efforts do not satisfy those who see a profound gap between the subjective quality of experience and mechanistic explanations. Although much is made of the difficulty of getting from mechanism to qualia, this conceptual gap is usually of little concern in clinical practice for several reasons: (1) we accept experience as important in itself, whether as an indicator of past or present events or of the ways in which the patient as person understands and endures affliction, pain and suffering; (2) pain and pleasure (and other valenced experiences) provide an essential dimension in judgements about the value, consequences and moral significance of action; and (3) individual experience is central to the social presence and personhood of the other as subject and agent in moral decision-making.

### Medical maternalism: beyond paternalism and antipaternalism [^116u8GUc]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

This paper argues that the concept of paternalism is currently overextended to include a variety of actions that, while resembling paternalistic actions, are importantly different. I use the example of Japanese physicians' non-disclosures of cancer diagnoses directly to patients, arguing that the concept of maternalism better captures these actions. To act paternalistically is to substitute one's own judgement for that of another person and decide in place of that person for his/her best interest. By contrast, to act maternalistically is to decide for another person based on a reasonable understanding of that person's own preferences. The concept of maternalism allows for a more thorough assessment of the moral justification of these types of actions. I conclude that it is possible, at least in principle, to justify Japanese physicians' non-disclosures, and that this justification must be based on an understanding of these actions as maternalistic.

### Does chaos theory have major implications for philosophy of medicine? [^112ZVqvA]. Medical Humanities (2002). Low credibility.

In the literature it is sometimes claimed that chaos theory, non-linear dynamics, and the theory of fractals have major implications for philosophy of medicine, especially for our analysis of the concept of disease and the concept of causation. This paper gives a brief introduction to the concepts underlying chaos theory and non-linear dynamics. It is then shown that chaos theory has only very minimal implications for the analysis of the concept of disease and the concept of causation, mainly because the mathematics of chaotic processes entail that these processes are fully deterministic. The practical unpredictability of chaotic processes, caused by their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, may raise practical problems in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, but it raises no major theoretical problems. The relation between chaos theory and the problem of free will is discussed, and it is shown that chaos theory may remove the problem of predictability of decisions, but does not solve the problem of free will. Chaos theory may thus be very important for our understanding of physiological processes, and specific disease entities, without having any major implications for philosophy of medicine.

### JAD: a forum for philosophy in science [^1172jSho]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

The Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (JAD) is already an established forum for cutting-edge science as well as ethical reflection. But I argue that beyond science and ethics, JAD is also a forum for philosophy in science, and that interdisciplinary researchers asking innovative questions about AD should publish their reflections and findings in JAD.

### Hippocratic concepts of acute and urgent respiratory diseases still relevant to contemporary medical thinking and practice: a scoping review [^112xaTwk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The Greek physician Hippocrates lived during the fifth century before common era (BCE), the golden age of the Greek civilisation, a period to which the birth of Greek rationalism and the "extraordinary awakening of intellectual interest" for both science and philosophy are attributed. Hippocrates, a contemporary of many "enlightened minds", such as Socrates, Plato, Pericles, Sophocles, Thucydides and Euripides, is widely regarded as the "Father of Medicine", as he was the first person to separate medicine from religion, philosophy and superstition and to show the way towards clinical observation, rational reasoning and interpretation of accumulated data. He clearly explained for the first time that diseases had natural rather than supernatural causes. Diseases were given a logical interpretation and were no longer considered to be a punishment from divine wrath.

Several of his writings introduced ethical and moral values into medicine still inspiring for current medical practice. According to Fielding H. Garrison: "The eminence of Hippocrates is three-fold: he dissociated medicine from theurgy and philosophy, crystallized the loose knowledge of the Coan and Cnidian Schools into systematic science, and gave physicians the highest moral inspiration they have".

Hippocratic medicine was transmitted through the centuries by the collection of about 60 manuscripts, known as the "Hippocratic Collection" or "Corpus Hippocraticum". Although they share a common spirit of rationalism, the greater part of the manuscripts differ in glossology, date of composition and in the views they advance, except that all are written in the Ionic dialect, "the standard literary language of philosophy, medicine and science at the time". This heterogeneous character indicates, most certainly, that not all of them were written by Hippocrates himself. Actually, only a few of them are generally attributed to Hippocrates' genius. Taking into account both the fact that there are texts representative of the medical school of Cos, to which Hippocrates belonged, and the disparate nature of the Hippocratic Collection, Jacques Jouanna speaks of "a collection of writings both heterogeneous and homogeneous".

### ED healthcare professionals and their notions of productivity [^116ctVmf]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The combination of constrained resources, patient complexity and rapidly increasing demand has meant that healthcare productivity constitutes a significant problem for emergency medicine. However, healthcare productivity remains a contentious issue, with some criticising the level of professional engagement. This paper will propose that productivity improvements in healthcare could occur (and be sustained) if professionals' perceptions and views of productivity were better understood.

Methods

An 8-month ethnographic study was conducted in a large UK ED, using semistructured interviews with healthcare professionals (HCPs) (n = 26), a focus group and observation. Thematic analysis of the data was undertaken based on an interpretivist philosophy.

Results

The data demonstrate that HCPs accept productivity improvement as part of their contemporary professional role. In particular, their understanding of productivity is focused around five key domains: the patient; the professional; the culture; the process of work and the economic.

Conclusions

By exploring how these HCPs experienced and made sense of productivity improvement and productive healthcare, the data reveals how HCPs may reconcile a culture of caring with one of efficiency. Understanding healthcare productivity from this perspective has potential implications for service improvement design and performance measurement.

### Recommendations for integrating antiracist practice at the JPSM [^111VFU3V]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2022). Medium credibility.

Journals like the JPSM are part of the system of gatekeepers to the academic literature that defines and represents our field. This paper explores how the JPSM leadership, staff and editorial board can design, implement, and foster active antiracist ideas and practice at the individual and system level, focused on an examination of who is represented across the organization, reflective practice on individual attitudes and beliefs, and policy analysis and changes. We explore the current and historical context in the United States that makes this approach foundational to the work of addressing and dismantling systemic racism. We define key terms and a theoretical framework while proposing concrete steps the journal can take in this effort. Together, these actions can actively challenge the ways in which white supremacy shapes the status quo, marginalizing Black Indigenous People of Color, and dehumanizing all. While this paper focuses on discrete actions the JPSM can undertake, it also serves as an invitation to the field at large to commit to the daily practice of antiracism. We do not promote ourselves as experts, only as individuals interested in and committed to antiracism and invite our colleagues to correct, edit, and build upon our suggestions. We hope our proposed approach helps our field to address all forms of oppression, including those due to gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and profession.

### Our vision: an antiracist journal [^117DMsrf]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Our renewed vision for the Journal is to be antiracist at every level. To achieve this, we will go beyond our long-standing charge to advance the knowledge of child development, children's mental health, and prevention and treatment of mental illness to solicit and disseminate research that addresses the systemic presence of racism and its influence on the health and well-being of children of color and their families. We acknowledge that our efforts as a journal to address these inequities have been insufficient and that dismantling the threads of White supremacy requires us to take a more active role. We pledge to do the work to advance research that understands the individual, cultural, and societal factors that contribute to the persistent disparities we have previously noted but failed to correct.
