## Question

Is Tylenol safe to give with an allergy to tramadol?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Tylenol (acetaminophen) is safe to give to someone who has an allergy to tramadol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is any pharmacologic cross-reactivity between tramadol and acetaminophen. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about hypersensitivity to each component and whether that implies cross-reactivity. Next, I will check for any documented drug–drug interaction between acetaminophen and tramadol that would matter clinically. After that, I should review the mechanistic differences to see if there is a plausible immunologic cross-reactivity. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation with caveats about rare acetaminophen hypersensitivity and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because if the mechanisms are unrelated, cross-reactivity is unlikely. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid with µ-opioid receptor activity and monoamine reuptake inhibition, whereas acetaminophen is a non-opioid, non-salicylate analgesic with a distinct, incompletely defined central mechanism; these are different drug classes with different structures, which makes immunologic cross-reactivity biologically implausible [^115WWLht] [^111QHhRX].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory language on hypersensitivity. The FDA labeling for tramadol/acetaminophen combination products explicitly advises not to prescribe the combination in patients with acetaminophen allergy, and separately warns about tramadol hypersensitivity; importantly, it does not state that tramadol allergy predicts acetaminophen allergy or vice versa, which argues against cross-reactivity between the two agents [^117E1bhu] [^1177UDqW].

> I should confirm whether there is any documented interaction between acetaminophen and tramadol that would complicate safety. A high-quality drug–drug interaction database shows no clinically meaningful interaction between acetaminophen and tramadol, supporting that acetaminophen can be used independently of tramadol exposure, including in patients with a tramadol allergy label [^115f9Htp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for rare exceptions. Although acetaminophen hypersensitivity is exceedingly rare, it does exist and can be severe, so a history of acetaminophen allergy would still be a contraindication to acetaminophen regardless of tramadol status; likewise, a tramadol allergy is a contraindication to tramadol, but not to acetaminophen per se [^117E1bhu] [^112NtYFx].

> Let me synthesize this carefully. There is no pharmacologic or immunologic cross-reactivity between tramadol and acetaminophen, and no interaction that would preclude acetaminophen use after a tramadol allergy; therefore, acetaminophen is generally safe to administer in a patient with a tramadol allergy, provided the patient does not also have a separate acetaminophen allergy or other contraindication such as severe hepatic disease or high daily acetaminophen exposure from multiple products [^115f9Htp] [^117UWk89].

> I should double-check practical safety steps. Before giving acetaminophen, confirm there is no history of acetaminophen allergy, keep total daily acetaminophen at or below 3,000–4,000 mg depending on risk factors, and screen for other acetaminophen-containing products to avoid inadvertent overdose; if there is uncertainty about a prior acetaminophen reaction, consider referral for allergy evaluation and, when appropriate, a supervised oral challenge to clarify tolerance [^117UWk89] [^112NtYFx] [^113R1c1W].

> Bottom line, after reviewing mechanism, labeling, and interaction data, acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safe to give to a patient with a tramadol allergy, assuming no independent acetaminophen allergy and adherence to standard dosing and safety checks; I should confirm the allergy history and monitor for any new reactions, but cross-reactivity between tramadol and acetaminophen is not expected [^115f9Htp] [^117E1bhu].

---

In general, **acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safe to use in patients with a tramadol allergy** because there is no pharmacologic cross-reactivity or documented interaction between the two drugs [^115f9Htp]. However, **confirm there is no acetaminophen allergy** or prior severe skin reaction (SJS/TEN, AGEP) before use, as rare acetaminophen hypersensitivity can occur [^117E1bhu] [^116yddug]. If uncertain, consider allergy testing or a supervised oral challenge [^112NtYFx] [^113R1c1W]. Use standard acetaminophen dosing and avoid exceeding 3,000–4,000 mg/day, especially in patients with liver disease or heavy alcohol use [^117UWk89].

---

## Pharmacological differences between tramadol and acetaminophen

Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic with **dual mechanisms** — weak μ-opioid receptor agonism and inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake — whereas acetaminophen is a non-opioid analgesic with a distinct, centrally mediated mechanism that does not involve opioid receptors or serotonin/norepinephrine pathways [^115WWLht] [^111QHhRX]. This mechanistic divergence makes cross-reactivity unlikely.

---

## Evidence regarding cross-reactivity

There is **no evidence of cross-reactivity** between tramadol and acetaminophen; their distinct mechanisms and structures support this. While both can rarely cause hypersensitivity, these reactions are independent and not due to shared immunologic targets.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines and expert reviews indicate that a tramadol allergy **does not preclude acetaminophen use**. Acetaminophen remains a first-line analgesic for mild to moderate pain and is commonly used when opioids are avoided, including in patients with opioid allergies.

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

Although acetaminophen is generally safe, consider the following:

- **Confirm no acetaminophen allergy**: Rare hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, SJS/TEN, AGEP) have been reported [^117E1bhu] [^116yddug].
- **Liver disease and alcohol use**: Use lower doses and avoid exceeding 3,000–4,000 mg/day in patients with hepatic impairment or chronic alcohol use [^1167EhT3].
- **Drug interactions**: Acetaminophen has minimal clinically significant interactions, but review all medications for hidden acetaminophen to avoid overdose [^1133ALx2].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient-specific factors

- **Mild tramadol allergy (e.g. rash)**: Acetaminophen is typically safe; monitor for new reactions.
- **Severe tramadol allergy (e.g. anaphylaxis)**: Acetaminophen is still generally safe, but observe closely on first administration.
- **Multiple drug allergies**: Assess for broader hypersensitivity patterns; consider allergy testing if history is unclear [^112NtYFx].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

If acetaminophen is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider:

- **NSAIDs**: Ibuprofen or naproxen if no NSAID allergy, GI bleeding risk, or renal/cardiovascular contraindications [^1167EhT3].
- **Topical agents**: Capsaicin or topical NSAIDs for localized pain.
- **Non-pharmacologic measures**: Physical therapy, acupuncture, or cognitive behavioral strategies.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is **safe to use in patients with a tramadol allergy**, given the lack of cross-reactivity. Confirm no prior acetaminophen allergy or severe skin reaction, use standard dosing, and monitor for new reactions. If uncertain, consider allergy evaluation or supervised oral challenge [^112NtYFx] [^113R1c1W].

Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis

Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive tramadol and acetaminophen (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen for patients with acetaminophen allergy.

Respiratory Depression

Administer tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. In these patients, alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered. When large doses of tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures (see WARNINGS, Seizure Risk and OVERDOSAGE).

WARNINGS SECTION

Hepatotoxicity

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contains acetaminophen and tramadol HCl. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products (see Boxed Warning).

The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen.

Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well.

Serious Skin Reactions

Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

Suicide Risk

Do not prescribe ULTRACET ® for patients who are suicidal or addiction-prone.
Prescribe ULTRACET ® with caution for patients taking tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs and patients who use alcohol in excess and who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression.

The judicious prescribing of tramadol is essential to the safe use of this drug. With patients who are depressed or suicidal, consideration should be given to the use of non-narcotic analgesics.

Tramadol-related deaths have occurred in patients with previous histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation or attempts as well as histories of misuse of tranquilizers, alcohol, and other CNS-active drugs (see WARNINGS, Risk of Overdosage).

Serotonin Syndrome Risk

The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the use of tramadol products, including ULTRACET, particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs, and triptans, with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), and with drugs which impair metabolism of tramadol (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors). This may occur within the recommended dose (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).

Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis

Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive ULTRACET®(see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue ULTRACET®immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe ULTRACET®for patients with acetaminophen allergy.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tramadol-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.

Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.

Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets.

 Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time.

 Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] QT prolongation/torsade de pointes: Cases of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes have been reported with tramadol use. Many of these cases were reported in patients taking another drug labeled for QT prolongation, in patients with a risk factor for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia), or in the overdose setting.

### Tramadol / paracetamol fixed-dose combination in the treatment of moderate to severe pain [^112cY8Jc]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common reason patients seek medical attention and pain relief has been put forward as an ethical obligation of clinicians and a fundamental human right. However, pain management is challenging because the pathophysiology of pain is complex and not completely understood. Widely used analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) have been associated with adverse events. Adverse event rates are of concern, especially in long-term treatment or at high doses. Paracetamol and NSAIDs are available by prescription, over the counter, and in combination preparations. Patients may be unaware of the risk associated with high dosages or long-term use of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Clinicians should encourage patients to disclose all medications they take in a "do ask, do tell" approach that includes patient education about the risks and benefits of common pain relievers. The ideal pain reliever would have few risks and enhanced analgesic efficacy. Fixed-dose combination analgesics with two or more agents may offer additive or synergistic benefits to treat the multiple mechanisms of pain. Therefore, pain may be effectively treated while toxicity is reduced due to lower doses. One recent fixed-dose combination analgesic product combines tramadol, a centrally acting weak opioid analgesic, with low-dose paracetamol. Evidence-based guidelines recognize the potential value of combination analgesics in specific situations. The current guideline-based paradigm for pain treatment recommends NSAIDs for ongoing use with analgesics such as opioids to manage flares. However, the treatment model should evolve how to use low-dose combination products to manage pain with occasional use of NSAIDs for flares to avoid long-term and high-dose treatment with these analgesics. A next step in pain management guidelines should be targeted therapy when possible, or low-dose combination therapy or both, to achieve maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity.

5.15 Severe Hypotension

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. In patients with circulatory shock, tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in patients with circulatory shock.

5.16 Risk of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness

In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Regularly evaluate such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen.

Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.

5.17 Serious Skin Reactions

Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Tramadol hydrochloride was administered to 550 patients during the double-blind or open-label extension periods in U.S. studies of chronic nonmalignant pain. Of these patients, 375 were 65 years old or older. Table 2 reports the cumulative incidence rate of adverse reactions by 7, 30 and 90 days for the most frequent reactions (5% or more by 7 days). The most frequently reported events were in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system. Although the reactions listed in the table are felt to be probably related to tramadol hydrochloride administration, the reported rates also include some events that may have been due to underlying disease or concomitant medication. The overall incidence rates of adverse experiences in these trials were similar for tramadol hydrochloride and the active control groups, TYLENOL®with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg), and aspirin 325 mg with codeine phosphate 30 mg (Tylenol®with Codeine #3 is the registered trademark of Johnson RW). However, the rates of withdrawals due to adverse events appeared to be higher in the tramadol hydrochloride groups.

Incidence 1% to less than 5%, possibly causally related: The following lists adverse reactions that occurred with an incidence of 1% to less than 5% in clinical trials, and for which the possibility of a causal relationship with tramadol hydrochloride exists.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to tramadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Tramadol and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with impaired hepatic function have not been studied. Based on information using tramadol immediate-release tablets in subjects with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol exposure was higher and half-lives of tramadol and active metabolite M1 were longer than in subjects with normal hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As tramadol and acetaminophen are both extensively metabolized by the liver, the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol extended-release tablets, the excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose based on studies using tramadol alone. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

Reported laboratory abnormalities included elevated creatinine and liver function tests. Serotonin syndrome (whose symptoms may include mental status change, hyperreflexia, fever, shivering, tremor, agitation, diaphoresis, seizures, and coma) has been reported with tramadol when used concomitantly with other serotonergic agents such as SSRIs and MAOIs.

Other clinically significant adverse experiences previously reported with acetaminophen

Allergic reactions (primarily skin rash) or reports of hypersensitivity secondary to acetaminophen are rare and generally controlled by discontinuation of the drug and, when necessary, symptomatic treatment.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^112NtYFx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Acetaminophen hypersensitivity — prevalence, diagnostic testing, and management are summarized as follows: hypersensitivity reactions are "exceedingly rare"; in a clinic review over a 4-year period, 84 patients were identified and 13 were considered to have an allergy based on history and oral challenge testing. The validity of skin testing is unknown; currently the only intravenous formulation is 10 mg/mL, with a reported protocol using 10 mg/mL for skin prick testing and 1 mg/mL as well as undiluted 10 mg/mL for intradermal testing. Other reviews used skin prick tests up to 200 mg/mL despite evidence that concentrations more than 10 mg/mL can be irritants leading to false positives. For confirmation, the current recommendations for definitive evidence of a reaction are oral-based challenge tests, and a meta-analysis including 259 patients estimates the prevalence of true acetaminophen hypersensitivity to be 10.1% in adults and 10.2% in pediatric patients.

### Use of ketoprofen oral challenges to detect cross-reactors among patients with a history of aspirin-induced urticaria [^115dTrDe]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with a history of urticaria induced by a single nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), advising elimination of all drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) can lead to unnecessary avoidance of useful NSAIDs.

Objective

To classify patients with a history of aspirin-induced urticaria as cross-reactors or single-drug reactors by oral challenges with another strong COX-1 inhibitor, namely, ketoprofen.

Methods

Forty otherwise healthy patients with a history of acute urticaria after the ingestion of aspirin underwent single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenges with ketoprofen. In patients who did not tolerate ketoprofen, tolerance tests with drugs exerting either COX-1 inhibition at high doses (acetaminophen and nimesulide) or no COX-1 inhibition at therapeutic doses (rofecoxib and tramadol) were performed.

Results

In 24 patients (60%), ketoprofen induced urticaria that was controlled by an intravenous antihistamine; 18 (75%) of the 24 patients reacted after the first provocative dose. On subsequent challenges, 3 (38%) of 8 ketoprofen reactors did not tolerate nimesulide, whereas acetaminophen tramadol and rofecoxib were tolerated by 18 of 18, 14 of 14, and 16 of 16 ketoprofen reactors, respectively. Three ketoprofen reactors reported the onset of spontaneous recurrent urticaria 1 to 3 years after the challenge tests.

Conclusion

In patients with a history of urticaria induced by a single NSAID, oral challenges with alternative COX-1 inhibitors are helpful in detecting whether they are true single-NSAID reactors; weak COX-1 inhibitors should be challenged subsequently only in those who show multiple-NSAID intolerance.

5.17 Anaphylaxis and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious and rarely fatal hypersensitive reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported hypersensitivity reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tramadol and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately, discontinue tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of tramadol. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.18 Withdrawal

Do not abruptly discontinue tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.19 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery

Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### FDA issues agency-initiated proposed order regarding OTC… [^1159ccBy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Today, FDA issued a proposed administrative order, to address a safety issue related to over-the-counter monograph drug products containing acetaminophen. Based on a comprehensive scientific review of available data, FDA determined that acetaminophen continues to be associated with the risk of rare but serious skin reactions. This proposed order, if finalized, would require drug companies to add a warning to the labeling. The proposed warning below, which is the same as the warning language FDA previously recommended in a 2017 guidance, would alert consumers that the use of acetaminophen may cause severe skin reactions. Allergy alert: Acetaminophen may cause severe skin reactions. Symptoms may include:

- skin reddening
- blisters
- rash If a skin reaction occurs, stop use and seek medical help right away. FDA is seeking comments on this proposed order and instructions on how to submit comments are found below.

After a review of comments, FDA will issue a final order. FDA has communicated about this safety issue in the past.
- In August 2013, FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication informing the public that use of acetaminophen is associated with a risk of rare but serious skin reactions.
- In 2017, FDA issued final Guidance for Industry titled, Recommended Warning for Over-the-Counter Acetaminophen-Containing Drug Products and Labeling Statements Regarding Serious Skin Reaction. The 2017 guidance recommended the addition of language in product labeling warning consumers that acetaminophen may cause severe skin reactions.

Specifically, through Proposed Administrative Order: Amending Over-the-Counter Monograph M013: Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use, the agency proposes to amend the conditions described in OTC Monograph M013 1 to require OTC oral analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products containing acetaminophen to include the above warning on the product labeling about serious skin reactions. 1 OTC Monograph M013 describes the conditions under which OTC IAAA drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective. OTC monograph drug products may be marketed under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act without an approved drug application if they meet the conditions in the relevant OTC monograph and other applicable requirements.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^116kWno2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids — tramadol (alone or in combination with APAP [acetaminophen]) includes safety warnings, CYP-2D6 interaction considerations, and an opioid tolerance definition. Serious anaphylactoid reactions are reported, often following first dose; patients with a history of anaphylactoid reaction to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk. CYP-2D6 inhibiting drugs include antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, propafenone, quinidine [strong inhibitor]); analgesics (methadone [weak inhibitor], propoxyphene); antihistamines (diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine [in vitro], brompheniramine [in vitro], triprolidine [in vitro]); histamine2 receptor antagonists (cimetidine); neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, methotrimeprazine, perphenazine, thioridazine); protease inhibitors (ritonavir), quinine compounds (hydroxychloroquine, quinacrine, quinine); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline), and miscellaneous compounds (clomipramine, ketoconazole, ticlopidine). CYP-2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers include 1% of Asian and Hispanic, 1–10% of Caucasians, 3% of African-Americans, and 16–28% of N. African and Arabic populations. Opioid tolerance is assumed in patients already taking fentanyl 25 mcg/hr OR daily doses of the following oral agents for ≥ 1 week: ≥ 60 mg oral morphine, 30 mg oxycodone, 8 mg hydromorphone, 25 mg of oxymorphone, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

### Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^1133ALx2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE and ACETAMINOPHEN

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, and monitor regularly for these behaviors or conditions. (5.1)
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially during initiation or following a dose increase. (5.2)
Accidental ingestion of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of tramadol. (5.2)
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.3, 7)
Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery. (5.4)
To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5.5)
Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Some of the reported cases followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy; in at least one case, the child had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism (5.6). Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (4). Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. (5.6)
The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1. (5.7, 7)
Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen containing product. (5.9)

### Tramadol with or without paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain [^115u4f93]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tramadol is an opioid analgesic licensed for use in moderate to severe pain. It is considered as a low risk for abuse, so control regulations are not as stringent as for 'strong' opioids such as morphine. It has a potential role as a step 2 option of the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and adverse effects of tramadol with or without paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer-related pain.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases using a wide range of search terms: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched three clinical trials registry databases. The date of the last search was 2 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We selected studies that were randomised, with placebo or active controls, or both, and included a minimum of 10 participants per treatment arm. We were interested particularly in blinded studies, but also included open studies. We excluded non-randomised studies, studies of experimental pain, case reports, and clinical observations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data using a standard form and checked for agreement before entry into Review Manager 5. We included information about the number of participants treated and demographic details, type of cancer, drug and dosing regimen, study design (placebo or active control) and methods, study duration and follow-up, analgesic outcome measures and results, withdrawals, and adverse events. We collated multiple reports of the same study, so that each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. The main outcomes of interest for benefit were pain reduction of 30% or greater and 50% or greater from baseline, participants with pain no worse than mild, and participants feeling much improved or very much improved.

Main Results

We included 10 studies (12 reports) with 958 adult participants. All the studies enrolled participants with chronic malignant tumour-related pain who were experiencing pain intensities described as moderate to severe, with most experiencing at least 4/10 with current treatment. The mean ages were 59 to 70 years, with participants aged between 24 and 87 years. Study length ranged from one day to six months. Five studies used a cross-over design. Tramadol doses ranged from 50 mg as single dose to 600 mg per day; doses of 300 mg per day to 400 mg per day were most common. Nine studies were at high risk of bias for one to four criteria (only one high risk of bias for size). We judged all the results to be very low quality evidence because of widespread lack of blinding of outcome assessment, inadequately described sequence generation, allocation concealment, and small numbers of participants and events. Important outcomes were poorly reported. There were eight different active comparators and one comparison with placebo. There was little information available for any comparison and no firm conclusions could be drawn for any outcome. Single comparisons of oral tramadol with codeine plus paracetamol, of dihydrocodeine, and of rectal versus oral tramadol provided no data for key outcomes. One study used tramadol combined with paracetamol; four participants received this intervention. One study compared tramadol with flupirtine - a drug that is no longer available. One study compared tramadol with placebo and a combination of cobrotoxin, tramadol, and ibuprofen, but the dosing schedule poorly explained. Two studies (191 participants) compared tramadol with buprenorphine. One study (131 participants) reported a similar proportion of no or mild pain at 14 days. Three studies (300 participants) compared tramadol with morphine. Only one study, combining tramadol, tramadol plus paracetamol, and paracetamol plus codeine as a single weak-opioid group reported results. Weak opioid produced reduction in pain of at least 30% from baseline in 55/117 (47%) participants, compared with 91/110 (82%) participants with morphine. Weak opioid produced reduction in pain of at least 50% in 49/117 (42%) participants, compared with 83/110 (75%) participants with morphine. There was no useful information for any other outcome of benefit or harm.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited, very low quality, evidence from randomised controlled trials that tramadol produced pain relief in some adults with pain due to cancer and no evidence at all for children. There is very low quality evidence that it is not as effective as morphine. This review does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different is very high. The place of tramadol in managing cancer pain and its role as step 2 of the WHO analgesic ladder is unclear.

### Oral analgesics for acute nonspecific pain [^1165k5m9]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Physicians most often recommend or prescribe oral medication for relief of acute pain. This review of the available evidence supports the use of acetaminophen in doses up to 1,000 mg as the initial choice for mild to moderate acute pain. In some cases, modest improvements in analgesic efficacy can be achieved by adding or changing to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The safest NSAID is ibuprofen in doses of 400 mg. Higher doses may offer somewhat greater analgesia but with more adverse effects. Other NSAIDs have failed to demonstrate consistently greater efficacy or safety than ibuprofen. Although they may be more expensive, these alternatives may be chosen for their more convenient dosing. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors provide equivalent efficacy to traditional NSAIDs but lack a demonstrable safety advantage for the treatment of acute pain. For more severe acute pain, the evidence supports the addition of oral narcotic medications such as hydrocodone, morphine, or oxycodone. Specific oral analgesics that have shown poor efficacy and side effects include codeine, propoxyphene, and tramadol.

### Use of nonopioid analgesics and adjunctive agents in the management of pain in rheumatic diseases [^115tLRLq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Antirheumatic analgesic medications generally fall into one of the following categories: acetaminophen, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tramadol, traditional opioids, or adjunctive analgesics. This article does not discuss corticosteroids, opioids, or topical analgesics. Acetaminophen, usually indicated early for mild pain, is often used in combination with other drugs. It has established safety. Traditional NSAIDs are effective in relieving moderate pain in certain inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions. There are many effective choices, but as a class it is fraught with the risk of serious peptic ulcer disease and its complications. Cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitors are NSAIDS that reduce the gastrointestinal risk and platelet-mediated bleeding. All NSAIDs may produce peripheral edema, hypertension, and potentiate warfarin. The evidence that coxibs cause thrombotic heart disease is weak. Tramadol is an alternative to musculoskeletal pain management, particularly in patients with moderate to moderately severe pain who do not respond to or who cannot tolerate acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or opioids. The role of analgesic adjuvants is discussed.

### Randomized clinical trial of dexketoprofen / tramadol 25 mg / 75 mg in moderate-to-severe pain after total hip arthroplasty [^116ADufe]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Patient population

The patients were men and women aged 18–80 yr, undergoing standard primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty because of osteoarthritis (excluding osteoarthritis secondary to systemic or metabolic diseases, trauma, or infections) and experiencing pain at rest of at least moderate intensity on the day after surgery. Women participating in the study had to be either of non-childbearing potential or willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method.

Patients with known allergy or contraindication to the study drugs or rescue medication (RM) were excluded from the study, as were patients using and not able to stop analgesics other than those specified in the protocol. Medications whose concomitant use with the study drugs or RM were not advisable or might confound the study results were restricted during pre-specified time frames (related to drug characteristics such as half-life). Restricted medications included monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, methotrexate, antibacterial sulphonamides, and ondansetron. Anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and antiplatelet agents were also restricted, with the exception of standard perioperative thromboprophylaxis and cardioprophylactic use of low doses of aspirin (≤ 325 mg). Patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, severe hepatic or severe cardiac dysfunction, history of gastrointestinal disorders, bleeding disorders, severe asthma, and epilepsy were excluded from participation in the study (according to the investigator's judgement after assessment of the medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and laboratory safety tests at screening). Patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, chronic opioid users (recent use of major opioids or tramadol for more than 1 week), and pregnant or breast-feeding women were also excluded.

### FDA warns of rare but serious skin reactions with acetaminophen… [^116yddug]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Additional Information for Health Care Professionals
- Rarely, acetaminophen can cause serious, potentially fatal skin reactions, such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
- The evidence supporting causality primarily comes from a small number of cases published in medical literature in which patients were rechallenged with acetaminophen and had a recurrence of the serious skin reaction. Data Summary FDA reviewed the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database and the medical literature for evidence of an association between acetaminophen and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

The evidence supporting causality between acetaminophen and serious skin reactions primarily comes from a small number of published cases in which patients were rechallenged with acetaminophen and had a recurrence of a serious skin reaction. 1–3
- In one case, a 7-year-old girl with fever and sore throat was treated with three doses of acetaminophen, and 12 hours later, she developed an erythematous rash over her gluteal region and legs. Her condition worsened, and she was admitted to a hospital. Her skin biopsy was compatible with TEN. Six months later, an allergist questioned the diagnosis of TEN due to acetaminophen and performed an oral rechallenge with acetaminophen 250 mg. No other drugs were used. Thirty minutes later, the patient developed diffuse urticaria and erythema and was readmitted to the hospital. All drugs were stopped with resolution of the eruption and widespread desquamation. Skin patch tests with acetaminophen only resulted in subcorneal pustules.

He experienced a recurrence of AGEP with subsequent administration of intravenous propacetamol, a prodrug of acetaminophen. 3 In addition to the three positive rechallenge cases, the medical literature contained several cases of SJS, TEN, and AGEP in which the only drug administered prior to the reaction was acetaminophen, or acetaminophen hypersensitivity was demonstrated by skin testing or other means. 1–20 There were no deaths reported in the literature, but the majority of cases required hospitalization. All cases resolved with discontinuation of the drug.

### Tramadol use in a patient with Brugada syndrome and morphine allergy: a case report [^1122vB2E]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Brugada syndrome is a rare rhythm disorder which may cause serious arrhythmias in patients undergoing anesthesia. Medications particularly used during local anesthesia, propofol infusion and anticholinesterases, can aggravate Brugada syndrome. These medicines should be avoided in the presence of alternative medicines. We believe that, when local anesthetics are avoided, morphine is a safe analgesic, whereas tramadol may be an option in patients with morphine contraindication. However, the best choice of analgesia in patients with Brugada syndrome will be clarified with future research involving larger case series.

### Tramadol hydrochloride (tramadol HCl) [^116bS7AQ]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Seizure Risk

Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol hydrochloride within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol hydrochloride above the recommended range. Concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride increases the seizure risk in patients taking:

Administration of tramadol hydrochloride may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking:

Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections). In tramadol hydrochloride overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure.

Anaphylactoid Reactions

Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol hydrochloride. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive tramadol hydrochloride (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Respiratory Depression

Administer tramadol hydrochloride cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered. When large doses of tramadol hydrochloride are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol, respiratory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures (see WARNINGS, Seizure Risk and OVERDOSAGE).

Interaction with Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants

Tramadol hydrochloride should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, anesthetic agents, narcotics, phenothiazines, tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics. Tramadol hydrochloride increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients.

Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma

Tramadol hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury. The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients. Additionally, pupillary changes (miosis) from tramadol may obscure the existence, extent, or course of intracranial pathology. Clinicians should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving tramadol hydrochloride tablets. (See Respiratory Depression .)

### Tramadol / acetaminophen combination tablets and codeine / acetaminophen combination capsules for the management of chronic pain: a comparative trial [^112uaTRz]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Opioid/acetaminophen (APAP) combination analgesics are widely prescribed for the relief of moderate pain. Tramadol is a synthetic analgesic that has been shown to be effective both alone and in combination with APAP.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of tramadol/APAP tablets with codeine/APAP capsules.

Methods

This 4-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-control, double-dummy, multicenter trial compared tramadol/APAP (37.5 mg/325 mg) with codeine/APAP (30 mg/300 mg) for the management of chronic nonmalignant low back pain, osteoarthritis (OA) pain, or both in adults. Pain relief (scale, 0 = none to 4 = complete) and pain intensity (scale, 0 = none to 3 = severe) were measured 30 minutes and then hourly for 6 hours after the first daily dose each week. Patients and investigators assessed the efficacy (scale, 1 = poor to 5 = excellent) of each medication, and patients recorded daily doses of study and rescue medications.

Results

A total of 462 patients (mean age, 57.6 years) were randomly assigned to treatment, with 112 (24%) reporting chronic low back pain, 162 (35%) reporting OA pain, and 188 (41%) reporting both low back and OA pain; 309 patients (67%) received tramadol/APAP and 153 (33%) received codeine/APAP. Pain relief and changes in pain intensity were comparable from day 1, as early as 30 minutes after the first dose, and lasted for at least 6 hours. Total pain relief scores (11.9 for tramadol/APAP; 11.4 for codeine/APAP) and sum of pain intensity differences (3.8 for tramadol/APAP; 3.3 for codeine/APAP) were also comparable throughout. Overall assessments of efficacy by patients (mean score 2.9 in each treatment group) and investigators (mean score 3.0 for tramadol/APAP, 2.9 for codeine/APAP) were similar for the 2 treatment groups. Equivalent mean doses (3.5 tablets or capsules daily) and maximum daily doses (5.5 tablets or 5.7 capsules) were used in the 2 treatment groups. The overall incidence of adverse events was comparable, with a significantly higher proportion of patients in the codeine/APAP group reporting somnolence (24% [37/153] vs 17% [54/309], P = 0.05) or constipation (21% [32/153] vs 11% [35/309], P < 0.01) and a larger proportion of patients in the tramadol/APAP group reporting headache (11% [34/309] vs 7% [11/153], P = 0.08).

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that tramadol/APAP tablets (37.5 mg/325 mg) are as effective as codeine/ APAP capsules (30 mg/300 mg) in the treatment of chronic nonmalignant low back pain and OA pain and are better tolerated.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^1167EhT3]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic management of acute pain should be tailored for each patient, including a review of treatment expectations and a plan for the time course of prescriptions. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line treatment options for most patients with acute mild to moderate pain. Topical NSAIDs are recommended for non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. Acetaminophen is well tolerated; however, lower doses should be used in patients with advanced hepatic disease, malnutrition, or severe alcohol use disorder. Nonselective NSAIDs are effective but should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or chronic renal disease. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 NSAIDs are a more expensive treatment alternative and are used to avoid the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonselective NSAIDs. Adjunctive medications may be added as appropriate for specific conditions if the recommended dose and schedule of first-line agents are inadequate (e.g., muscle relaxants may be useful for acute low back pain). For severe or refractory acute pain, treatment can be briefly escalated with the use of medications that work on opioid and monoamine receptors (e.g., tramadol, tapentadol) or with the use of acetaminophen/opioid or NSAID/opioid combinations. The opioid epidemic has increased physician and community awareness of the harms of opioid medications; however, severe acute pain may necessitate short-term use of opioids with attention to minimizing risk, including in patients on medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.

### Tramadol acetaminophen [^116MM2da]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION

The following information is based on studies of tramadol alone or acetaminophen alone, except where otherwise noted:

Pharmacodynamics

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol and acetaminophen. Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, from animal tests, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to µ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.

Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to µ-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics).

Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.

Apart from analgesia, tramadol administration may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids.

### IV tramadol – A new treatment option for management of post-operative pain in the US: an open-label, single-arm, safety trial including various types of surgery [^111te2Rp]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Conclusions

This study was a Phase 3, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, uncontrolled, repeat-dose trial to assess the safety of IV tramadol 50 mg in the management of postoperative pain in patients who had undergone elective surgery. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate safety and tolerability, with the primary endpoints including AEs (including local tolerability), clinical laboratory tests, vital sign assessments, and ECGs, and local tolerability.

Both orthopedic and soft tissue surgeries are well represented in the study. Patients underwent various types of surgeries that included breast augmentation, total hip replacement, hernia repair, total knee replacement, abdominoplasty, colon surgery, and hysterectomy. The mean duration of exposure to IV tramadol was 48 h, and over 20% of patients were exposed for at least 72 h (3 days), with the maximum duration being 5 days (124 h).

IV tramadol was found to be well tolerated in this real-world study, with no unexpected safety findings reported. The AEs reported were consistent with known pharmacology of tramadol. In addition, tramadol was shown to be safe and well tolerated in combination with non-opioid analgesics, reflecting the effectiveness of tramadol in this multimodal treatment setting. Importantly, 94.8% of the patients reported that study medication was good, very good, or excellent for controlling pain, and no patient discontinued the study due to a lack of efficacy.

In the context of the ongoing US opioid epidemic, physicians and hospitals are under pressure to minimize the use of conventional, ie, Schedule II, opioids without sacrificing the quality of care. However, clinicians are currently limited in their choices of intravenous analgesics. The approved intravenous analgesics in the US for post-surgical pain generally include three pharmacological classes: acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and conventional opioids. The lack of options contributes to the fact that IV conventional opioids are still heavily used in the acute pain setting. Following administration of intravenous Schedule II conventional opioids, physicians tend to transition patients to oral Schedule II conventional opioids as part of their outpatient pain management. Many of these (including hydromorphone and oxycodone) have been shown to have a significant association with opioid misuse. In the context of a multimodal analgesic treatment paradigm, IV tramadol may fill the gap between non-opioid medicines and conventional opioids and thus may reduce the reliance on conventional opioids in the post-surgical setting.

### Profile of extended-release oxycodone / acetaminophen for acute pain [^116vXF3o]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Contraindications

Patients who should not take ER oxycodone/acetaminophen include those who have experienced a prior allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to oxycodone, acetaminophen, or other component of the pharmaceutical composition, those with severe acute asthma or severe respiratory depression predisposing them to hypercarbia, and those with ileus. Patients who have a known history of allergic reaction to other opioids should exercise caution, since little data exist regarding cross-reactivity for opioid hypersensitivity.

Effect on comorbidities

Adrenal insufficiency

Chronic opioid exposure may cause secondary hypogonadism, with associated sexual dysfunction, infertility, mood disorders, and osteoporosis.ER oxycodone/acetaminophen should be used with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease.

Acute abdomen

Signs/symptoms may be masked by administration of ER oxycodone/acetaminophen.

Biliary obstruction

Patients with biliary duct disease should use ER oxycodone/acetaminophen with caution, as it may cause Sphincter of Oddi spasm and worsen biliary tract dysfunction, with possible progression to acute pancreatitis.

Altered mental status

ER oxycodone/acetaminophen may potentiate CO 2 retention caused by hypoventilation and as such should be used with caution in patients with central nervous system depression or coma. These patients may experience adverse intracranial effects associated with hypercarbia.

GI pathology

Due to its chemical preparation, ER oxycodone/acetaminophen upon ingestion tends to swell and develop increased adhesiveness within the GI tract. Patients with a narrowed intestinal lumen may experience inability to pass the pill through the GI tract. An alternative analgesic regimen should be considered in patients with intestinal narrowing.

Liver disease

Patients with alcohol-related hepatic disease, particularly those consuming more than three alcoholic beverages per day, are at increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity is associated with acetaminophen dosing greater than 4 g/day, as well as long-term exposure to ER oxycodone/acetaminophen.

Substance abuse

As with all narcotic medications, tolerance, chemical dependency, psychological dependency, addiction, and substance abuse may develop with chronic exposure to ER oxycodone/acetaminophen. Reports exist of patients crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved form of the medication, which may result in the uncontrolled delivery of the oxycodone, overdose, and death. The potential for dependency or substance abuse should be assessed for each patient on an individual basis prior to administration of the medication.

### How to define and manage low-risk drug allergy labels [^117QXznv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk stratification approach

Most patients with NSAID allergy histories can tolerate NSAIDs. Several studies of patients with prior NSAID reactions have found that 79% to 86% of patients with an NSAID label and referred to a drug challenge by allergists tolerate NSAIDs. However, these patients had no history potentially consistent with N-ERD. On the contrary, drug challenges are positive in 86% to 100% of patients reporting prior NSAID reactions consistent with N-ERD, and as such, these procedures should only be performed when there is diagnostic uncertainty in clinics or hospitals experienced in managing potential reactions.

The gold standard for diagnosing NSAID hypersensitivity is a drug challenge. Skin testing has no role; it is not standardized nor recommended. Given the variable phenotypes and their complexity, risk stratification approaches have been entirely within the allergy specialist domain. NSAID drug challenges are considered whenever possible for appropriate non-N-ERD phenotype candidates. Although protocols vary widely, a study of 249 individuals demonstrated the safety of a 2-step drug challenge for all non-N-ERD NSAID hypersensitivity. Although no global consensus – currently exists, these data indicate that a 2-step direct oral challenge protocol can be feasibly and safely performed in the outpatient specialist setting to evaluate non-N-ERD phenotypes.

Selective COX-2 inhibitors (ie, celecoxib) and weak COX-1 inhibitors (ie, acetaminophen at < 1 g/d)rarely provoke reactions in cross-hypersensitive patients and can typically be taken safely by patients with suspected or confirmed NSAID hypersensitivity, of any phenotype. In some cases, for example, a severe prior NSAID-induced reaction, the first administration can be performed via a drug challenge under allergist supervision.

The recommendation in patients with NSAID-induced urticaria and angioedema is to proceed with a direct oral challenge with aspirin to evaluate for cross-reactivity to alternate NSAIDs. For patients with a history of non-N-ERD aspirin hypersensitivity and an acute need for aspirin for cardiovascular disease, a 2-step aspirin challenge is suggested.

Wilderness Medical Society acute pain — nonopioid analgesia: Combining acetaminophen with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) should be used as the first-line medication treatment of acute pain in the wilderness, unless there is a specific patient allergy or other contraindication (Recommendation grade: 1A). As the basis of medical therapy for acute injury, these medications should be regularly dosed throughout the acute injury period. NSAIDs do have adverse effects, including renal injury (especially in dehydrated patients) and inhibition of platelet function that can increase bleeding; giving NSAIDs with food can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, and if significant abdominal pain develops, the medication should be stopped. Short-term use for up to 10 days of over-the-counter NSAIDs with standard dosing has been shown to be extremely safe and well tolerated, and an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/d or less or naproxen at 660 mg/d or less has no greater risk than placebo. For acetaminophen, prescription-dose acetaminophen up to 4 g/d in an adult is still appropriate for short-term use; it is considered safe in intoxicated patients, but care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and patients with hepatic dysfunction.

In response to the findings from the 2012 review of NSAIDs, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency reviewed diclofenac in October 2012 and identified a small increased risk of cardiovascular side effects associated with diclofenac compared with other NSAIDs. Factors that can affect diclofenac dose include the condition that is being treated. When treating different types of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended daily dose is 100–150 mg in two or three divided doses. However, all anti-inflammatory medicines (including NSAIDs and Cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitors) should be used at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible period necessary to control symptoms. A physician assessment should consider a patient's need for pain relief and any particular treatment preference they have, as well as any risk factors they may carry.

A limitation of the study was the small sample size due to which the results could not be completely extrapolated to the general population. As well, all patients were suffering from pain due to musculoskeletal conditions (AMSP, POP, AFOA, and AFRA), and hence the study cannot comment on the safety and efficacy of this combination in other clinical conditions. Further, this was a clinical trial set up in a controlled setting, where the role of comorbidities and concomitant medications could not be evaluated completely to generate further evidence, thereby warranting a study in a real-world setting.

### Tramadol use in a patient with Brugada syndrome and morphine allergy: a case report [^115JWhg5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Brugada syndrome is a disorder characterized by sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation without structural heart failure. Although three types of this syndrome have been defined, it can be recognized when the T-segment elevation is followed by T-wave negativity or flattening. The initial symptom in 20% to 30% of patients is supraventricular tachycardia. However, the right bundle branch block may not be detected in some cases.

Although it is considered that tramadol may cause Brugada syndrome by blocking the voltage-dependent sodium channels, there is only one case report published in the literature. Herein, we present our anesthetic practice and the use of tramadol in a 75-year-old female patient who underwent pulmonary lobectomy under general anesthesia and was diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, and discuss the safe use of tramadol in Brugada syndrome in light of literature data.

### Tramadol for osteoarthritis [^111yyjKm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tramadol is often prescribed to treat pain and is associated physical disability in osteoarthritis (OA). Due to the pharmacologic mechanism of tramadol, it may lead to fewer associated adverse effects (i.e.g.astrointestinal bleeding or renal problems) compared to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in 2006.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of oral tramadol or tramadol combined with acetaminophen or NSAIDs in people with osteoarthritis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase databases, as well as the US National Institutes of Health and World Health Organization trial registries up to February 2018. We searched the LILACS database up to August 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of tramadol, or tramadol in combination with acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs versus placebo or any comparator in people with osteoarthritis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 22 RCTs (11 more than the previous review) of which 21 RCTs were included in meta-analyses for 3871 participants randomized to tramadol alone or tramadol in combination with another analgesic and 2625 participants randomized to placebo or active control. Seventeen studies evaluated tramadol alone and five evaluated tramadol plus acetaminophen. Thirteen studies used placebo controls and eleven studies used active controls (two trials had both placebo and active arms). The dose of tramadol ranged from 37.5 mg to 400 mg daily; all doses were pooled. Most trials were multicenter with a mean duration of two months. Participants were predominantly women with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with a mean age of 63 years and moderate to severe pain. There was a high risk of selection bias as only four trials reported both adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment. There was a low risk for performance bias as most studies blinded participants. There was a high risk of attrition bias as 10/22 trials showed incomplete outcome data. Most of the trials were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Moderate quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) indicated that tramadol alone and in combination with acetaminophen had no important benefit on pain reduction compared to placebo control (tramadol alone: 4% absolute improvement, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3% to 5%; 8 studies, 3972 participants; tramadol in combination with acetaminophen: 4% absolute improvement, 95% CI 2% to 6%; 2 studies, 614 participants). Fifteen out of 100 people in the tramadol group improved by 20% (which corresponded to a clinically important difference in pain) compared to 10/100 in the placebo group (5% absolute improvement). Twelve out of 100 people improved by 20% in the tramadol in combination with acetaminophen group compared to 7/100 in the placebo group (5% absolute improvement). Moderate quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) indicated that tramadol alone and in combination with acetaminophen led to no important benefit in physical function compared to placebo (tramadol alone: 4% absolute improvement, 95% CI 2% to 6%; 5 studies, 2550 participants; tramadol in combination with acetaminophen: 4% absolute improvement, 95% CI 2% to 7%; 2 studies, 614 participants). Twenty-one out of 100 people in the tramadol group improved by 20% (which corresponded to a clinically important difference in physical function) compared to 16/100 in the placebo group (5% absolute improvement). Fifteen out of 100 people improved by 20% in the tramadol in combination with acetaminophen group compared to 10/100 in the placebo group (5% absolute improvement). Moderate quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) indicated that, compared to placebo, there was a greater risk of developing adverse events with tramadol alone (risk ratio (RR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.46; 4 studies, 2039 participants) and tramadol in combination with acetaminophen compared to placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.76; 1 study, 308 participants). This corresponded to a 17% increase (95% CI 12% to 23%) with tramadol alone and 22% increase (95% CI 8% to 41%) with tramadol in combination with acetaminophen. The three most frequent adverse events were nausea, dizziness and tiredness. Moderate quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) indicated that there was a greater risk of withdrawing from the study because of adverse events with tramadol alone compared to placebo (RR 2.64, 95% CI 2.17 to 3.20; 9 studies, 4533 participants), which corresponded to a 12% increase (95% CI 9% to 16%). Low quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency) indicated that there was a greater risk of withdrawing from the study because of adverse events with tramadol in combination with acetaminophen compared to placebo (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.50 to 5.16; 2 studies, 614 participants), which corresponded to a 8% absolute improvement (95% CI 2% to 19%). Low quality evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) indicated that there was a greater risk of developing serious adverse events with tramadol alone compared to placebo (110/2459 participants with tramadol compared to 22/1153 participants with placebo; RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.84; 7 studies, 3612 participants), which corresponded to a 1% increase (95% CI 0% to 4%). There were no serious adverse events reported in one small study (15 participants) of tramadol with acetaminophen compared to placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate quality evidence indicates that compared to placebo, tramadol alone or in combination with acetaminophen probably has no important benefit on mean pain or function in people with osteoarthritis, although slightly more people in the tramadol group report an important improvement (defined as 20% or more). Moderate quality evidence shows that adverse events probably cause substantially more participants to stop taking tramadol. The increase in serious adverse events with tramadol is less certain, due to the small number of events.

### Risks of codeine and tramadol in children… [^117NnFUw]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. In April 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a new warning about use of codeine and tramadol in children and teens. Background on Codeine and Tramadol. Codeine and tramadol are opiates, which are a group of medications generally used to treat pain. Codeine also acts as a cough suppressant and is found in some cough and cold medications. Although both codeine and tramadol are effective for treating pain and cough, like other opiates, they can have serious side effects. The main side effect is sleepiness, which can range from mild to extreme. In cases of overdose, these medications can slow breathing or cause it to stop altogether, which can be life-threatening. As with other opiates, there is also a risk of becoming dependent on the medication with repeated use.

Safety Concerns In April 2017, the FDA issued a new warning that recommends against use of codeine and tramadol in children younger than 12 years. The FDA also warns against use in breastfeeding women because of possible harm to infants. For teens aged 12 to 18 years, the FDA warns against using codeine and tramadol if there is a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, or severe lung disease. In particular, neither codeine nor tramadol should be given to children or adolescents as a pain medication after surgery to remove the tonsils or adenoids. Alternative Treatments To treat pain, acetaminophen and ibuprofen are safe for children when taken in the correct weight-based dose. Ibuprofen should not be given to infants younger than 6 months. To treat cough, natural remedies such as steam, extra fluids, honey, and gargling are safe options.

Cough medications are generally not recommended for children younger than 4 years. Ask your pediatrician for more information about safe alternatives to codeine and tramadol in children. The Bottom Line Tramadol and codeine should never be given to children younger than 12 years or taken by breastfeeding women. Always keep all adult medications out of reach of children. When traveling, make sure to read labels carefully because some cough and cold medications that are sold over the counter in other countries may contain codeine.

### Durapain in symptomatic treatment of severe acute pain: a post-marketing, prospective, multicenter, observational study-PRIME study [^11765Xy2]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This was a prospective, multicenter, observational, non-randomized, noncontrolled, single-arm, post-marketing study. tramadol hydrochloride/diclofenac sodium was prescribed as per standard clinical practice of the treating physician. Adult treatment naïve patients aged between 18 and 60 years suffering from severe acute pain were enrolled in the study. Patients with known hypersensitivity to either tramadol or diclofenac or any of the excipients of product, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and patients with any other condition that precluded the use of tramadol hydrochloride/diclofenac sodium in a particular patient, in accordance with the prescribing information, were not included in the study. Tramadol hydrochloride/diclofenac sodium was prescribed by the treating physician as per approved label (generally one tablet twice daily after meals or as directed by the physician for a period not exceeding 5 days). Evaluation of patients was carried out at baseline, and telephonic follow-up was performed on day 2. The second follow-up on day 5 was also done telephonically if the patients did not turn up for the visit. No additional laboratory tests or procedures were performed except those which treating physician felt necessary during routine practice. Concomitant medications other than those prohibited by the locally approved package insert were allowed. During follow-ups, intensity of pain, number of tramadol hydrochloride/diclofenac sodium tablets consumed on each day, overall tolerability, GI tolerability of study medicine, use of gastroprotective agents, and/or antiemetic and other analgesics during treatment were recorded. The intensity of pain was rated on a 4-point scale (0, none; 1–3, mild; 4–6, moderate; and 7–10, severe). Global assessment of effectiveness and tolerability of treatment by patient and physician was noted at the end of the therapy. The global assessment of effectiveness and tolerability was performed on a scale of 1–7 (1, very good; 2, good; 3, fairly good; 4, moderate; 5, slightly poor; 6, poor; and 7, very poor). The safety was also assessed by recording the adverse events. The primary end point of the study was pain intensity difference from baseline to day 5. The secondary end points included incidence of GI events; percentage of patients with severe GI events at each visit; percentage of patients who discontinued the treatment due to GI events; incidence of treatment-related events (other than GI events); percentage of patients using gastroprotective and/or antiemetic during the study period; percentage of patients requiring analgesics during the study period; percentage of patients who rated the tolerability of treatment as "very good", "good", and "fairly good"; and percentage of physicians who rated the tolerability of treatment as "very good", "good", and "fairly good". The study was performed between January and April 2016 after approval from the respective zonal ethics committees, namely, Bangalore Ethics (South), Intersystem Biomedica Ethics Committee (West), Apollo-Gleneagles Hospital–IEC, Hurip Independent Bioethics Committee (East), and Good Society Ethical Research (North). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

### Tramadol / acetaminophen combination tablets for the treatment of osteoarthritis flare pain: a multicenter, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, add-on study [^116wuAzS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

In a flare of osteoarthritis (OA) pain, increasing the dose of standard anti-inflammatory or routine analgesic drugs may not be practical because of an increased incidence of side effects. In patients achieving inadequate pain relief from traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors, it may be appropriate to add an analgesic agent with a different mechanism of action, thereby targeting multiple components of the pain pathway.

Objective

The addition of tramadol/acetaminophen tablets to existing therapy was compared with the addition of placebo in the treatment of OA flare pain.

Methods

This was a multicenter, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, add-on study. Patients received 1 or 2 tramadol/acetaminophen (37.5 mg/325 mg) tablets QID or matching placebo for 10 days in addition to ongoing NSAID or COX-2-selective inhibitor therapy. The primary outcome measures were average daily pain intensity and average daily pain relief scores from days 1 through 5.

Results

Three hundred eight patients were randomized to tramadoUacetaminophen (n = 197) or placebo (n = 111) and were followed for up to 10 days. Patients had a mean (± SD) age of 60.1 ± 9.87 years, and were predominantly female (71.8%) and white (87.7%). Their mean (± SD) pain visual analog score at baseline was 73.2 ± 11.8 mm, and their mean pain intensity score was 2.4 ± 0.5 (on a scale from 0 = none to 3 = severe). Average daily pain intensity and pain relief scores were significantly improved with tramadol/acetaminophen compared with placebo on the primary assessment of efficacy from days 1 through 5 (both, P < 0.001) and on the assessment of efficacy from days I through 10 (both, P < 0.001) Tramadol/acetaminophen was significantly superior to placebo on the patients' and physicians' overall assessments of medication (both, P < 0.001) and on 3 of 4 subscales (pain [P = 0.004], physical function [P = 0.013], and overall [P = 0.008]) of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Questionnaire. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with tramadol/acetaminophen were nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. No serious adverse events were reported in the tramadol/acetaminophen group.

Conclusion

In this study, addition of tramadol/acetaminophen to NSAID or COX-2-selective inhibitor therapy was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of OA flare pain.

### An assessment of the pharmacokinetics of a sustained-release formulation of a tramadol / acetaminophen combination in healthy subjects [^111Rego9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide consistent pain relief and improve convenient sustained release (SR), a fixed-dose combination tramadol/acetaminophen tablet was formulated. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of an SR 75-mg tramadol/650-mg acetaminophen formulation after a single dose compared with an immediate release (IR) 37.5-mg tramadol/325-mg acetaminophen formulation after 2 doses and at steady state and to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic SR formulation profile after a single dose.

Methods

Two clinical trials were conducted: (1) an open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-treatment, crossover study to assess the pharmacokinetic SR (one 75-mg tramadol/650-mg acetaminophen combination tablet) formulation profiles after a single dose and IR (one 37.5-mg tramadol/325-mg acetaminophen combination tablet q6h for 2 doses) formulation profiles after 2 doses and the effect of food intake on healthy male subjects and (2) an open, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment multiple dose crossover study to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic SR and IR formulation profiles. Safety assessments were performed.

Findings

Forty-three subjects completed each study protocol. The SR combination tramadol/acetaminophen formulation was clinically and statistically equivalent to the IR combination formulation in the fasting state. When tramadol and acetaminophen tablets were administered with food, the time to peak plasma concentrations and the tramadol/acetaminophen absorption were unaffected. There was no serious adverse event reported.

Implications

The SR combination tramadol/acetaminophen tablet exhibited similar exposure and absorption rates compared with those of the IR formulation of tramadol, O-desmethyltramadol, and acetaminophen. The SR formulation may be more convenient for patients and has the potential to enhance compliance and pain control. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01880125.

### Efficacy and safety profile of combination of tramadol-diclofenac versus tramadol-paracetamol in patients with acute musculoskeletal conditions, postoperative pain, and acute flare of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: a phase III, 5-day open-label study [^111cGB3z]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

According to the 1995 Support study, approximately half of patients with any medical condition present with pain. Pain remains the most inadequately treated symptom, due to different cultural, attitudinal, educational, legal, and system-related reasons.

Pain has a multifactorial origin, hence it may be difficult to achieve effective pain control with a single drug. Combination therapy of analgesics from different groups is advantageous in targeting both peripheral and central pain pathways and hence, helps in production of analgesia at lower and more tolerable doses of the constituent drugs. Combination therapies can have a positive influence on the ability of individual components to minimize pain, with better tolerability and reduced recovery time.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Analgesic Ladder proposed in 1986 needs revision in the form of customized and patient-centric management of pain. According to the WHO ladder, the combination of paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with opioids was considered as the second step in the treatment of pain, based on increasing pain severity. Now, instead of a ladder, a platform is the need of the hour, as different levels of pain severity and chronicity demand different analgesic platforms of management. Now, the clinician should be able to move up or down the appropriate platform to explore the various treatment options according to the status and needs of the individual patient.

The pharmacologic treatment of pain due to rheumatologic conditions, especially osteoarthritis, has many limitations, in terms of serious adverse effects and low efficacy. Lower doses of paracetamol represent an analgesic option for many patients, especially the elderly. However, historical data demonstrates hepatotoxicity at paracetamol doses greater than the maximum daily recommended dose of 4 gm/day. Data also suggest that paracetamol, at high doses, may add to the risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Opioids may exhibit abuse potential, along with limited efficacy, over time. NSAIDs present a significant GI bleeding risk, along with a risk of a variety of renal complications, and myocardial infarction and other serious cardiovascular complications. In addition, NSAIDs also have ceiling effects, and no therapeutic advantage is gained after increasing dosages beyond those recommended. If the therapeutic advantage of NSAIDs needs to be utilized, then one of the options is to prescribe NSAIDs as a combination therapy. NSAIDs are one of the mainstay treatment options for musculoskeletal pain of moderate intensity. The recent guidelines issued by numerous professional medical societies, recommend NSAIDs at the lowest effective dose and shortest possible period, in view of the associated gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular toxicity.

### Tramadol 37.5-mg / acetaminophen 325-mg combination tablets added to regular therapy for rheumatoid arthritis pain: a 1-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111ofDKB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of tramadol 37.5-mg/acetaminophen 325-mg combination tablets (tramadoUAPAP) as add-on therapy in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain that was inadequately controlled by NSAIDs and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs alone.

Methods

Subjects in this multicenter, double-blind trial were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 1 tramadol/ APAP tablet TID or a matching placebo for 1 week. Stable doses of previous medications were continued during the study. The primary efficacy variable was the mean daily pain relief score over 1 week, measured on a 6-point scale (4 = complete; ' = a lot; 2 = some; 1 = a little; 0 = none; -1 = worse). Secondary outcomes included the mean daily pain intensity score, measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) (from 0 mm = no pain to 100 mm = extreme pain); pain intensity and pain relief at day 7; subjects' and investigators' mean overall assessments of study drug, measured on a Likert scale (from 2 = very good to -2 = very poor); and subjects' assessments of 8 aspects of physical function (measured on the Health Assessment Questionnaire).

Results

Of 277 subjects randomized to treatment, 267 (201 tramadol/APAP, 66 placebo) were included in the intent-to-treat population. Mean (SD) daily pain relief scores at the end of 1 week were significantly greater in the tramadol/APAP group compared with the placebo group (1.04 [0.89] vs 0.78 [0.80], respectively; P = 0.037), and mean daily pain intensity scores at the end of 1 week were significantly lower (47.23 [19.96] vs 53.81 [16.59]; P = 0.018). Physical function at the end of 1 week did not differ significantly between tramadol/APAP and placebo. Two hundred seventy-two subjects (205 tramadol/APAP, 67 placebo) were evaluable for tolerability. One hundred thirty-three of these subjects had at least 1 adverse event. The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the tramadol/APAP group than in the placebo group (57.6% vs 22.4%; P < 0.001). Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 19.0% of the tramadol/APAP group and 3.0% of the placebo group (P = 0.001). Of 213 treatment-related adverse events in tramadol/APAP subjects, nausea (34.1%) was the most frequent, followed by dizziness (20.0%) and vomiting (15.6%). One serious adverse event — chest discomfort, nausea, and vomiting after taking study medication-occurred in a subject receiving tramadol/APAP The symptoms resolved 1 day after discontinuing tramadol/APAP.

Conclusions

In this study, tramadol/APAP used as add-on therapy in subjects with symptomatic RA was associated with a significant improvement in pain relief and a significant reduction in pain intensity compared with placebo, with no improvement in physical function. Use of tramadol/APAP may be considered when analgesics are needed in addition to conventional NSAIDs and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in subjects with RA.

### Tramadol / acetaminophen combination tablets for the treatment of chronic lower back pain: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study [^115bDNAP]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Tramadol and acetaminophen (APAP) have both shown efficacy in the treatment of lower back pain. The combination of these 2 agents has demonstrated synergistic analgesic action in animal models at specific ratios.

Objective

This study assessed the long-term (3-month) efficacy and safety of tramadol 37.5 mg/APAP 325 mg combination tablets in the treatment of chronic lower back pain.

Methods

Patients with at least moderate lower back pain (pain visual analog [PVA] score ≥ 40 mm on a 100-mm scale) were randomized to receive up to 8 tablets of tramadol/APAP per day or placebo for 91 days. Medication was titrated from 1 to 4 tablets/d by day 10. The primary efficacy measure was PVA score at the final visit. Secondary measures included scores on the Pain Relief Rating Scale (PRRS), Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), Roland Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36); the incidence of discontinuation due to insufficient pain relief (Kaplan-Meier analysis); and overall assessments of medication by the patients and investigators.

Results

Three hundred eighteen patients (161 tramadol/APAP, 157 placebo) were included in the intent-to-treat population, defined as all patients who took ≥ 1 dose of study medication and had ≥ 1 postrandomization efficacy measurement. The mean age of the study population was 53.9 years, 63.2% were female, 90.3% were white, and the mean baseline PVA score was 70.0 mm. There were no significant differences between groups at baseline. Tramadol/APAP significantly improved final PVA scores (P = 0.015) and final PRRS scores (P < 0.001) compared with placebo. Tramadol/APAP also significantly improved RDQ scores (P ≤ 0.027) and scores on many subcategories of the SF-MPQ, including total score (P = 0.021). The tramadol/APAP group had significant improvements on the role-physical (P = 0.005), bodily pain (P = 0.046), role-emotional (P = 0.001), mental health (P = 0.026), reported health transition (P = 0.038), and mental component summary (P = 0.008) subscales of the SF-36. The cumulative incidence of discontinuation due to insufficient pain relief was 22.1% for tramadol/APAP and 41.0% for placebo (P < 0.001). Treatment-emergent adverse events in the tramadol/APAP group included nausea (13.0%), somnolence (12.4%), and constipation (11.2%).

Conclusions

In this study, tramadol 37.5 mg/APAP 325 mg combination tablets were effective and had a favorable safety profile in the treatment of chronic lower back pain.

Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms (see WARNINGS).

Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients how to properly take TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Advise patients not to adjust the dose of TYLENOL®with Codeine without consulting a physician or other healthcare professional.
If patients have been receiving treatment with TYLENOL®with Codeine tablets for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, counsel them on the importance of safely tapering the dose and that abruptly discontinuing the medication could precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication (see WARNINGS).

Maximum Daily Dose of Acetaminophen

Inform patients not to take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Advise patients to call their healthcare provider if they have taken more than the recommended dose.

Hypotension

Inform patients that TYLENOL®with Codeine may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) (see WARNINGS; Hypotension).

Anaphylaxis

Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in TYLENOL®with Codeine. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction, and if they develop signs of allergy such as a rash or difficulty breathing to stop taking TYLENOL®with Codeine and seek medical attention. (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity-isn' T it time for APAP to go away? [^116Demib]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever around the world. At the same time, APAP can cause dose-related hepatocellular necrosis, responsible for nearly 500 deaths annually in the United States (US) alone, as well as 100,000 calls to US Poison Control Centers, 50,000 emergency room visits and 10,000 hospitalisations per year. As an over-the-counter and prescription product (with opioids), APAP toxicity dwarfs all other prescription drugs as a cause of acute liver failure in the US and Europe, but it is not regulated in any significant way. In this review the ongoing controversy surrounding the proper role for this ubiquitous pain reliever: its history, pathogenesis, clinical challenges in recognition and management, and current regulatory status are highlighted. A new solution to a 50-year-old problem is proposed.

### Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen [^115WWLht]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The following information is based on studies of tramadol alone or acetaminophen alone, except where otherwise noted:

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol, an opioid agonist and inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin re-uptake, and acetaminophen. Although the mode of action of tramadol is not completely understood, the analgesic effect of tramadol is believed to be due to both binding to µ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.

Opioid activity of tramadol is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O -demethylated metabolite M1 to µ-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.

Acetaminophen is a non-opioid, non-salicylate analgesic. The site and mechanism for the analgesic effect of acetaminophen has not been determined but is thought to primarily involve central actions.

### Effectiveness and safety of new oxycodone / acetaminophen formulations with reduced acetaminophen for the treatment of low back pain [^113BG11x]. Pain Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the analgesic effectiveness/safety of the new oxycodone 7.5- and 10-mg/acetaminophen 325-mg (Percocet) formulations in patients with low back pain (LBP) suboptimally responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, tramadol, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, and/or prn opioids.

Design

Prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, 4-week trial.

Setting

Multicenter.

Patients

Thirty-three men and women (mean age: 52.2 years) with LBP (mean duration: 10.9 years).

Interventions

All prior analgesics were discontinued, and oxycodone/acetaminophen was dosed three times a day (TID), titrated to clinically meaningful pain relief. Initial oxycodone/acetaminophen dose: 2.5/325 mg TID; maximum: 20/650 mg TID.

Outcome Measures

Effectiveness: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Neuropathic Pain Scale 4 score (sharp, hot, dull, and deep pain). Quality of life: BPI and North American Spine Society Lumbar Spine questionnaire.

Safety

Adverse events, physical/neurologic examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests.

Results

In all, 28 of 33 patients (85%) completed the study; discontinuations were for adverse events (N = 3), patient choice (N = 1), and lack of effectiveness (N = 1). The mean oxycodone/acetaminophen dose at the end of treatment was 8.2/325 mg TID. After 4 weeks, treatment significantly reduced BPI pain intensity and improved pain relief (P < 0.0005), improved Neuropathic Pain Scale 4 score (P = 0.007), reduced pain interference with quality of life (P < 0.0004), and reduced disability (P < 0.0001). Treatment was found to be safe and well tolerated. Adverse events were those most commonly expected from an opioid, and most were of mild-to-moderate intensity.

Conclusions

The primary purpose of this study was to preliminarily test the effectiveness of the new formulations of oxycodone/acetaminophen with reduced acetaminophen in the clinical practice setting. The results from this trial suggest that these formulations are effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic LBP. Most patients (67%) reported significant pain relief/tolerable side effects with a TID dosing frequency or less (mean: 3.04 doses/day), suggesting chronic pain patients can experience meaningful pain relief with around-the-clock dosing of oxycodone/acetaminophen and minimal risk of hepatotoxicity. Further long-term, controlled studies of the efficacy/safety of the new formulations of oxycodone/acetaminophen in LBP are warranted to fully characterize efficacy in this patient population and corroborate the findings from our study.

### Review of extended-release formulations of tramadol for the management of chronic non-cancer pain: focus on marketed formulations [^115FyQTE]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

An ideal formulation of an analgesic for chronic non-cancer pain management, with special reference to once-daily Tramadol, would be to provide consistent pain control over a 24-hour dosing interval, fewer sleep interruptions, better quality of life, and increased compliance and convenience because of a simplified dosing regimen (including minimal dependence on being taken with or without meals), as well as a minimization of adverse events associated with peak drug levels. For the purposes of this review, four different formulations of once-daily extended or controlled release Tramadol are considered.

Opioid treatment and Tramadol

The National Pain Centre of Canada guidelines for safe and effective use of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain have made recommendations for physicians deciding to initiate opioid therapy in patients; the Canadian Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain has been available since 2010. Recommendations in the guidelines state that before initiating opioid therapy, comprehensive documentation should be made on the patient's pain and general medical condition, as well as their psychosocial history, psychiatric status, and substance use history. It also recommends that physicians use screening tools such as the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT; National Pain Centre, McMaster University, Ontario, Canada) (accessible at) to help determine a patient's risk for opioid addiction; additionally, before initiating opioid therapy, evidence related to effectiveness in patients with chronic non-cancer pain should be considered. The American Pain Society guidelines (2009) recommend Tramadol in any phase of osteoarthritis as a single therapy or in a combination with acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Similarly, the American College of Rheumatology guidelines (2012) on the management of osteoarthritis recommends Tramadol in patients for whom acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors are no longer effective. The use of strong opioid analgesics for long-term management of chronic non-cancer pain is accepted, although it is still debated in medical practice. They should be prescribed as part of a multimodal treatment plan, with the aim of pain relief and to facilitate rehabilitation.
