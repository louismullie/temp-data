## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about immunology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational framework of innate versus adaptive immunity. Then, I should verify the core functions of the immune system beyond pathogen defense. Next, I will examine key cellular and molecular players and their interactions. After that, I need to review homeostatic and regulatory mechanisms, including neuroimmune and metabolic crosstalk. I will then consider disease contexts such as infection, autoimmunity, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Finally, I should integrate clinical implications, diagnostics, therapeutics, and public health strategies, and close with a concise synthesis that acknowledges uncertainties and future directions.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework. The immune system is classically divided into innate and adaptive arms, with innate immunity providing rapid, pattern-recognized responses and adaptive immunity offering antigen-specific memory. Wait, let me verify the nuance here, because recent work emphasizes that innate responses can be highly specific in context and that adaptive responses are shaped by innate cues, so the dichotomy is pedagogically useful but oversimplified in some older models [^39fe962c] [^8f685f52].

> I need to check the core functions beyond defense. The immune system is not only a defense network but also a homeostatic regulator that maintains tissue integrity, repairs damage, and coordinates with other organ systems; inflammation is a key homeostatic tool that restores balance when normal physiology is perturbed, and immune cells are embedded in metabolic, neural, and barrier circuits that shape health and disease trajectories [^e7ebd99b] [^236c99a5] [^5683f1c1].

> Next, I should review the key cellular and molecular players. Innate effectors include neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and complement, while adaptive effectors are T and B lymphocytes with their antigen receptors. Hold on, I should verify the regulatory layer: FoxP3+ Tregs modulate priming and memory, and stromal cells in lymphoid organs coordinate migration and survival. Surface receptor networks physically link immune cells into functional communities, which has implications for therapeutic targeting [^c1330e37] [^dadc2f7e] [^7872fe22] [^6c51b079].

> Let me consider homeostatic and regulatory mechanisms. Negative feedback loops resolve inflammation once homeostasis is restored, and immune checkpoints balance activation and suppression. I should double-check the neuroimmune angle: the CNS is not strictly immune-privileged; microglia and border-associated immune cells support homeostasis, repair, and plasticity, and the brain modulates immunity via endocrine and neuronal pathways, including sympathetic and parasympathetic circuits [^e7ebd99b] [^80c254f5] [^3a0b7b67].

> I will now examine disease contexts, starting with infection. The immune system detects and clears pathogens, but immunosenescence and micronutrient deficits impair responses, especially in older adults; nutrition can partially offset these deficits, and vaccines remain central, though responses vary with host status and require tailored strategies in immunocompromised patients [^e4fa27f1] [^1544889e].

> For autoimmunity and immune dysregulation, I should confirm that primary immunodeficiencies often present with autoimmunity due to failed tolerance or dysregulated homeostasis. Modern classification encompasses inborn errors of immunity spanning infection, autoimmunity, autoinflammation, allergy, and malignancy, and diagnosis increasingly relies on integrated phenotyping, functional assays, and genetics, with functional validation when possible [^f06bfe4b] [^643a4649] [^6bc0883d].

> In cancer, I need to reconcile the dual roles of immunity. Immune surveillance can eliminate nascent tumors, but tumors evolve escape mechanisms; concomitant immunity illustrates that primary tumors can induce systemic effects that inhibit metastases, yet some metastases proceed despite immune pressure. Therapeutically, checkpoint blockade, CAR-T, and strategies to overcome local and systemic immunosuppression are key, though efficacy varies by tumor and microenvironment [^32f97b51] [^6101cea0] [^2de8c2ba].

> For neurodegeneration, let me verify the emerging paradigm. Peripheral immune exhaustion and senescence can accelerate CNS degeneration, and microglia are central therapeutic targets. Boosting peripheral immunity and modulating checkpoint axes are under exploration, and the microbiome–gut–immune–brain axis provides additional leverage points for intervention [^602cb3aa] [^1d9bf560] [^5294c413].

> I should confirm clinical implications and diagnostics. Suspected immunodeficiency warrants a structured approach: history of infections and inflammatory phenotypes, targeted labs including immunoglobulins, vaccine responses, lymphocyte subsets, and complement, with escalation to functional assays and genetics when indicated. Distinguishing secondary from primary hypogammaglobulinemia avoids misclassification and inappropriate therapy [^5a454842] [^a5180f81] [^d7d6a5a2].

> Therapeutically, I need to ensure I cover replacement, modulation, and precision strategies. Immunoglobulin replacement restores humoral immunity in select deficiencies, immunomodulatory agents target dysregulated pathways, and gene therapy has moved from proof-of-concept to clinical reality in specific IEIs. CRISPR-based in vivo screens in immune cells enable rapid target discovery, and systems immunology guides biomarker-driven combinations [^cc58996a] [^45408360] [^90be61b4] [^d59d5f47].

> Public health and nutrition are integral, so I should double-check the strength of evidence. Daily nutritional self-care supports immune function and resilience, and primary care has a vital role in education. Multiple micronutrient gaps are common even in high-resource settings, and closing them can mitigate infection risk and chronic disease burden, especially in older adults and those with suboptimal diets [^6e33d30d] [^c3765e9b] [^26a0b0d9].

> But wait, what about uncertainties and future directions? I need to ensure I acknowledge them. We still lack a unified theory of immunity, though integrative models are emerging. Interindividual immune variation is substantial and shaped by genes, microbes, and environment, and we are only beginning to map how these dimensions interact. Therapeutically, predicting who benefits from immunomodulation remains imprecise, and combination strategies will likely dominate moving forward [^7e1f2bb6] [^534340c9] [^c0606c0b].

> In summary, I should confirm the synthesis: the immune system is a dynamic, distributed network that defends, repairs, and regulates across the lifespan. Its innate and adaptive arms are deeply interconnected and integrated with metabolic, neural, and barrier systems. Understanding and therapeutically leveraging this complexity requires precise diagnostics, mechanism-informed interventions, and sustained public health strategies that prioritize nutrition, prevention, and equitable access to care [^6c51b079] [^236c99a5] [^6e33d30d].

The immune system is a **complex network** of cells, tissues, and molecules that defends against pathogens, eliminates damaged cells, and maintains homeostasis [^d59d5f47]. It has two main branches: **innate immunity**, which provides rapid, nonspecific defenses, and **adaptive immunity**, which offers delayed but highly specific responses with memory [^39fe962c]. Key components include neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, T cells, B cells, antibodies, and cytokines [^2ca77faf]. The system is tightly regulated to prevent excessive inflammation or autoimmunity, and its function is shaped by genetics, age, nutrition, and the microbiome [^534340c9] [^e4fa27f1] [^27ed4c1e]. Dysfunction can lead to infections, autoimmunity, cancer, and chronic disease; **targeted therapies** such as vaccines, immunoglobulin replacement, and checkpoint inhibitors are used to restore or modulate immune function [^a0074494] [^cc58996a] [^2de8c2ba].

---

## Innate immunity

Innate immunity is the **first line of defense**, providing rapid, nonspecific responses to pathogens and tissue damage [^c1330e37]. It includes:

- **Physical barriers**: skin, mucous membranes, and epithelial layers.
- **Cellular components**: neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.
- **Molecular components**: complement system, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides.

Innate immune cells recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), triggering inflammation and **activating adaptive immunity** [^8f685f52].

---

## Adaptive immunity

Adaptive immunity provides **specific, delayed responses** with immunological memory, enabling faster and stronger responses upon re-exposure [^8eaa38fa]. It includes:

- **T cells**: CD4+ helper T cells coordinate immune responses; CD8+ cytotoxic T cells kill infected or malignant cells.
- **B cells**: produce antibodies that neutralize pathogens or mark them for destruction.
- **Antibodies**: immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, IgD) with distinct roles in immunity.

Adaptive immunity is shaped by antigen exposure, generating memory T and B cells that confer **long-lasting protection** [^46bc1e8e].

---

## Immune regulation

Immune responses are tightly regulated to prevent excessive inflammation and autoimmunity. Key regulators include **regulatory T cells (Tregs)**, which suppress excessive immune responses; **cytokines**, signaling molecules that coordinate immune cell activity; and **immune checkpoints**, inhibitory pathways (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1) that prevent overactivation [^dadc2f7e] [^6c51b079].

---

## Factors influencing immune function

Immune function is influenced by several factors:

- **Genetics**: genetic variation accounts for 20–40% of interindividual immune differences [^7e3f0a75].
- **Age**: immunosenescence reduces immune efficiency with aging [^e4fa27f1].
- **Nutrition**: malnutrition impairs immune function; micronutrients are critical for optimal immunity [^4e25cae7].
- **Microbiome**: gut microbiota modulate immune development and responses [^27ed4c1e].

## Immune system disorders

Dysfunction of the immune system leads to **various disorders**:

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Immunodeficiency | - HIV/AIDS <br/> - Primary immunodeficiencies (e.g. CVID) | Impaired immune responses, increased susceptibility to infections [^fc3527a1] |
| Autoimmunity | - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus | Immune system attacks self-tissues [^c48c1bdc] |
| Hypersensitivity | - Allergies <br/> - Asthma | Exaggerated immune responses to harmless substances [^3e110a6a] |
| Cancer | - Leukemia <br/> - Lymphoma | Malignancies of immune cells or immune dysfunction promoting tumor growth [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and therapies

Understanding immunology informs **clinical practice**:

- **Vaccines**: stimulate adaptive immunity to prevent infectious diseases [^a0074494].
- **Immunoglobulin therapy**: replaces missing antibodies in immunodeficiencies [^cc58996a].
- **Immunosuppressive drugs**: modulate immune responses in autoimmunity and transplantation.
- **Immunotherapy**: harnesses the immune system to treat cancer (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells) [^2de8c2ba].

---

The immune system is a **highly integrated network** that maintains health by defending against pathogens, repairing tissues, and regulating inflammation. Its function is shaped by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, and dysregulation leads to diverse diseases. Modern medicine leverages immunological insights to develop targeted therapies that restore or modulate immune function.

### The immune system in cancer metastasis: friend or foe? [^e7c7cb4c]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Metastatic disease is the leading cause of death among cancer patients and involves a complex and inefficient process. Every step of the metastatic process can be rate limiting and is influenced by non-malignant host cells interacting with the tumor cell. Over a century ago, experiments first indicated a link between the immune system and metastasis. This phenomenon, called concomitant immunity, indicates that the primary tumor induces an immune response, which may not be sufficient to destroy the primary tumor, but prevents the growth of a secondary tumor or metastases. Since that time, many different immune cells have been shown to play a role in both inhibiting and promoting metastatic disease. Here we review classic and new observations, describing the links between the immune system and metastasis that inform the development of cancer therapies.

The innate and the adaptive immune systems have evolved to provide a rapid and specific means for protecting hosts against the many microbes experienced over a lifetime. These two immune responses interact cooperatively to enhance the host defense. Defects in either of these two pathways can have devastating consequences, as evidenced [figure: see text] by primary immune deficiencies, many of which are discussed in this issue of the Pediatric Clinics of North America. The immune system has a central role in the pathogenesis of many disorders that involve an inflammatory response, including allergic and autoimmune diseases. New and more effective therapies for these many disorders will develop as the understanding of the immune system and its many secreted mediators continues to increase.

Recent years have witnessed an explosion of interest in the innate immune system. Questions about how the innate immune system senses infection and empowers a protective immune response are being answered at the molecular level. These basic science discoveries are being translated into a more complete understanding of the central role innate immunity plays in the pathogenesis of many human infectious and inflammatory diseases. It is particularly exciting that we are already seeing a return on these scientific investments with the emergence of novel therapies to harness the power of the innate immune system. In this review we explore the defining characteristics of the innate immune system, and through more detailed examples, we highlight recent breakthroughs that have advanced our understanding of the role of innate immunity in human health and disease.

### Vital role for primary healthcare providers: urgent need to educate the community about daily nutritional self-care to support immune function and maintain health [^6e33d30d]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2023). High credibility.

The importance of self-care to improve health and social well-being is well recognised. Nevertheless, there remains a need to encourage people to better understand how their body works, and how to keep it healthy. Because of its important role, part of this understanding should be based on why the immune system must be supported. This highly complex system is essential for defending against pathogens, but also for maintaining health throughout the body by preserving homeostasis and integrity. Accordingly, the immune system requires active management for optimal functioning and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. In addition to regular exercise, healthy sleeping patterns, cultivating mental resilience, adequate nutrition through healthy and diverse dietary habits is key to the daily support of immune function. Diet and the immune system are closely intertwined, and a poor diet will impair immunity and increase the risk of acute and chronic diseases. To help elucidate the roles of primary healthcare providers in supporting individuals to engage in self-care, an international group of experts reviewed the evidence for the roles of the immune system in maintaining health and for nutrition in daily immune support, and discussed implications for population health and clinical practice.

The inflammatory process: fundamental roles in maintaining whole body homeostasis and integrity

A key component of the innate immune system is the inflammatory response, which goes beyond eliminating infections and repairing tissue injury — two extreme body perturbations that are easily observable. In fact, inflammation also occurs at a lower magnitude in the absence of infection or overt tissue damage to maintain normal cellular, tissue, and systemic homeostasis.

Inflammation is vital for enforcing homeostasis and protecting the functional and structural integrity of tissues and organs throughout the body, in both infectious and sterile situations (ie, those occurring in the absence of microorganisms). When normal (non-inflammatory) homeostatic mechanisms are insufficient to overcome a threat to homeostasis (ie, following an alteration in tissue structure or function or dysregulation of physiological processes), a variety of proinflammatory mediators produced by several types of cells induce an 'inflammatory mode' until normal homeostatic processes can be restored (figure 1). Once this has been achieved, specific negative feedback mechanisms resolve inflammation and homeostasis is once more regulated by the non-inflammatory physiological processes.

To help illustrate the importance of the immune system and the inflammatory response to the normal functioning of the body, specific examples are briefly discussed below.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases: an update [^b5ff122b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Although relatively rare, primary immune deficiency diseases (PIDs) provide an excellent window into the functioning of the immune system. In the late 1960s, observations on these diseases, with their associated infections and genetics, bisected the immune system into humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity. These diseases also represent a challenge in their diagnosis and treatment. Beginning in 1970, a unified nomenclature for the then-known primary immunodeficiency diseases was created by a committee convened by the World Health Organization. Since then, and later under the aegis of the International Union of Immunological Societies, an international committee of experts has met every 2 to 3 years to update the classification of PIDs. During the past 15 years, the molecular basis of more than 100 PIDs has been elucidated. This update results from the latest meeting of this committee in Sintra, Portugal, June 2003, which followed 2(1/2) days of scientific discussions.

A healthy immune system is central to overall health, with roles beyond defending against pathogens

Defending the body against attack by pathogens (such as viruses, bacteria and fungi) is the primary function of the immune system, and the effects of the immune response are often noticeable. The familiar symptoms of a cold (eg, sneezing, runny or congested nose, sore throat, cough, fatigue and body aches) are all signs that the immediate innate defences (particularly inflammation) and the later adaptive immune responses are working to clear the virus from the body. It is obvious that a robust immune response is important to host defence against pathogens, and it is well described that people with a weakened immune system are at increased risk of infection and of those infections becoming more severe.

In addition to its role in defence against pathogens, the immune system is involved in innumerable and interrelated dynamic actions throughout the body, which work together to keep physiological processes in balance (homeostasis) and help the body to function and respond to challenges on a daily basis (figure 1). In simple terms, the immune system may be thought of as an information management system, which continually collects, interprets, communicates and stores data, and sets in motion events to maintain or restore homeostasis. In this way, a properly functioning immune system helps to maintain overall health and plays a role in reducing the risk of a range of chronic diseases that might otherwise occur as the body ages.

Figure 1
The multifaceted roles of the immune system go beyond host defence. Negative feedback mechanisms normally correct small deviations in the body's steady-state variables to regulate homeostasis — but these may be insufficient to maintain stability if deviations are too large; when this happens, inflammatory cells and signals support homeostatic regulation until homeostasis is restored.

### Primary immunodeficiency or not? Making the correct diagnosis [^b8fb23c3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Making a correct diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disease is crucial for the selection of proper therapy. Although many cases go undiagnosed, there are also many instances of incorrect diagnosis that result in years of inappropriate treatment and failure to implement beneficial treatment. This article summarizes 2 actual cases in which incorrect diagnoses led to recommendations of unwarranted high-risk or costly treatments. Had the physicians chosen tests of immune function rather than relying on immunoglobulin levels or cell counts, they would have arrived at the true diagnoses.

### Human primary immunodeficiency diseases: a perspective [^de3894b0]. Nature Immunology (2004). Medium credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency diseases consist of a group of more than 100 inherited conditions, mostly monogenic, predisposing individuals to different sets of infections, allergy, autoimmunity and cancer. Primary immunodeficiencies therefore represent exquisite models of various immunopathological settings. The identification of the associated genes, 100 so far, has generated a plethora of information about the immune system and spurred the analysis of many aspects of the development, function and regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. These findings can potentially contribute to improved care of affected individuals by providing new diagnostic and/or therapeutic tools.

Background

Future and past: A link between the immune system and metastasis

One of the biggest obstacles to finding a cure for most solid cancers is not the removal of the primary tumor, but the elimination of metastases. If tumors were non-metastatic, complete surgical removal would often lead to complete cure. Therefore, understanding and controlling metastatic disease is essential for clinical practice. Metastases arise from solitary solid tumors when cancer cells undergo distinct changes and progress through a multi-step metastatic cascade, creating disseminated tumors that are difficult to treat. The metastatic process consists of 1) invasion of metastatic cancer cells into the local tissue at the primary tumor site, 2) intravasation of metastatic cancer cells into blood or lymph vessels, 3) survival in the circulation, 4) extravasation from the circulation to distant sites, and 5) adaptation to and proliferation in a new environment. Due to the complexity of this process, metastasis is a highly inefficient process. During each step of the metastatic cascade, mutant and therefore potentially immunogenic cancer cells can be recognized and killed by the host immune system. For example, antigens expressed by the primary tumor cells may be presented on MHC-I molecules and recognized by cytotoxic T cells (Box 1), leading to T cell activation and their killing of the tumor cells. Unfortunately for the patient, cancer cells exploit several mechanisms to evade destruction by the immune system, enabling them to proceed through the metastatic cascade. Additionally, under certain circumstances some immune cells and their mediators in fact favor metastatic disease and tumor growth.

Metabolic health

Metabolic health can be defined as the ability of the body to respond efficiently to changes in the supply of food and nutrients, and to the dynamic demands for energy sources, chemical substrates, cofactors and building blocks to support cell and tissue function. This is achieved through regulation of physiological processes. Metabolic health is reflected by adequate condition-specific concentrations of a number of metabolic parameters, such as blood glucose, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 'normal' blood pressure, and a healthy waist circumference — factors that are directly related to the risk of conditions such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The immune system plays an important role in regulating metabolic processes and vice-versa. This immuno-metabolic cross-talk is pivotal in promoting metabolic health throughout the entire life course and plays essential roles in the ability of a host to respond to external challenges and dynamic conditions within the body to maintain homeostasis. Metabolism involves sensing the nutrient balance to allow the host to prioritise energy storage against the requirements for energy and substrates to support tissue growth, function and maintenance. The immune system plays an important role in this sensing.

For example, in adipose tissue (a known 'immunological niche') and the liver, immune cells produce signalling molecules that regulate tissue homeostasis and metabolic functions such as the actions of insulin or the breakdown of triglycerides. The immune system also helps to prevent obesity by orchestrating the transformation of white adipose tissue into beige cells. The development of adipocytes (cells that store fat) and their function (eg, thermogenesis, insulin sensitivity) are supported and maintained by immune cells located in the adipose tissue.

### Overview of the human immune response [^2ca77faf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

The human immune system mobilizes a broad repertoire of innate and adaptive responses to protect against the universe of pathogens it encounters. Central to these protective responses are its mechanisms to distinguish self from nonself. This overview describes the major mechanisms used by the immune system to respond to invading microbes and identifies settings in which disturbed immune function exacerbates tissue injury.

### Towards a general theory of immunity? [^7e1f2bb6]. Trends in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Theories are indispensable to organize immunological data into coherent, explanatory, and predictive frameworks. We propose to combine different models to develop a unifying theory of immunity which situates immunology in the wider context of physiology. We believe that the immune system will be increasingly understood as a central component of a network of partner physiological systems that interconnect to maintain homeostasis.

Other body systems

The integrated roles of the immune system extend throughout the body. For example, there is a mutualistic relationship between the immune system and gut microbiota. The microbiota is critical to the training and development of the immune system; in turn, around 70% of the body's immune cells reside in the gut wallto ensure that there is a diversified and balanced microbiome, that commensals do no overuse host resources, and that immune tolerance to innocuous stimuli is maintained. When immune function becomes impaired (eg, when inflammation becomes chronic), this can result in dysbiosis that adversely affects the functioning of the microbial communities and impairs gut function. Additional roles of the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract have been reported, such as the regulation of intestinal peristalsis and the gut epithelial barrier through the action of immune cells on epithelial cells and neurons.

There is also extensive cross-talk between the interconnected immune and cardiovascular systems. The immune system is essential for formation of new blood vessels, maintaining cardiac composition and function, and healing and regeneration of damaged epithelial and cardiac tissue, thus ensuring homeostasis within the cardiovascular system. In the musculoskeletal system, continual repair of microtears in skeletal muscle after daily use and promoting muscle regeneration after more extensive injury are dependent on the immune system, while strong skeletal muscles (which develop after regular exercise) have emerged as a potent regulator of immune system function. The immune system also has complex interactions with bone, and is essential for regulating the activity of bone cells during bone development and maintenance. In the reproductive system, the immune system has crucial protective activities, participating in ovulation, maintaining the maternal–fetal interface during pregnancy, and regulating mammary gland development.

Conclusions

The immune system is important to the body's function and resilience to challenges, and this goes beyond defence against pathogens. Consequently, immune impairments result in loss of homeostasis and resilience and an increased risk of various diseases. Multiple nutrients are vital to support immune system function. Hence, a poor diet is linked with immune impairments and increased susceptibility to infection. However, such immune impairments are also part of the link between poor diet and many chronic non-communicable diseases. Diet is important in the supply of optimal nutrition; even so, many people — even in well-developed countries — have insufficient intakes of many micronutrients. Micronutrient supplements can help to fill nutrient gaps for immune support where diet is insufficient. There is a public health need to galvanise the community into taking daily care of their immune system through nutrition support. PHCPs already play a central role in educating the community, and should be encouraged to proactively promote nutritional immune self-care. However, there is a need to empower and assist PCHPs by investing in training and providing succinct and reliable information about the immune system and the vital roles of nutrition — including the use of a multiple micronutrient supplement to help close any nutrient gaps that could impair immune function.

### Evolution of lymphoid tissues [^c826fffd]. Trends in Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Lymphoid organs are integral parts of all vertebrate adaptive immune systems. Primary lymphoid tissues exhibit a remarkable functional dichotomy: T cells develop in specialized thymopoietic tissues located in the pharynx, whereas B cells develop in distinct areas of general hematopoietic areas, such as the kidney or bone marrow. Among secondary lymphoid tissues, the spleen is present in all vertebrates, whereas lymph nodes represent an innovation particular to mammals and some birds. A comparative analysis of anatomical, functional and genomic features thus reveals the core components of adaptive immune systems. Such information has guided recent attempts at reconstructing lymphopoietic functions in vivo and in the future might inspire the development of new strategies for medical interventions restoring and modulating immune functions.

The brain

Lifelong maintenance of the brain relies on a healthy immune system. For many years, it was believed that the central nervous system (CNS) was an immune-privileged organ unable to tolerate immune reactivity; thus, the belief was that any immune responses in the brain would need to be eradicated to prevent neurodegeneration. However, immune cells residing in the CNS have been identified, such as the microglia (the brain's resident macrophages) which participate in inflammation and immune responses. It is now clear that the immune system provides homeostatic support to the CNS and helps to maintain the complex and delicate brain environment in optimal condition.

Immune cells recognise the self-components of the CNS and patrol the healthy brain to identify abnormal situations and resolve them before further damage can occur, or facilitate repair if damage has occurred'. uardian' immune cells and signals form part of the protective barriers that exist between the periphery and the brain. In this way, the immune system is essential for preventing and healing damage in the CNS. It also participates in brain plasticity throughout life (ie, the ability of the brain to be restructured to enable it to function in a new way), and is pivotal in supporting learning, memory, cognition and motor function. Cross-talk between the immune system and the CNS coordinates the body's response to stress, infection, and other challenges.

Memory skills, the ability to learn and cognitive and motor function begin to decline with age, which reflects the ageing of the brain but also ageing of the immune system. Restoring communication between the immune system and the brain can help to restore brain function during the ageing process and may be beneficial in pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. The immune system not only supports cognitive functions, but also influences behaviour. The body's natural resilience mechanisms, which allow a person to cope with and recover from mental stresses, are dependent on a properly functioning immune systemthat influences emotional and behavioural processes. Some people are naturally more susceptible to stress, and their ability to manage stress is linked to their inflammatory phenotype; however, it may be possible to improve resilience to stress by changing the inflammatory phenotype.

PHCPs have a crucial role in encouraging daily self-care through nutrition for immune support

Considering the evidence presented, it is evident that the immune system is the centre of human health and resilience. By protecting the body from external stressors such as pathogens, as well as internal stressors that also challenge and disrupt homeostasis, a well-functioning immune system ensures lifelong, optimal functioning of human body cells, tissues and organs. Hence, immune support through nutrition is a high-priority self-care practice that can help to maximise the health and well-being of the population. In situations of inadequate diet or challenging immune stressors, regular use of a micronutrient supplement in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions seems likely to help support a well-functioning immune system. Accordingly, there is a clear public health need to empower the community to take care of their immune system and health through nutritional support, given the annual morbidity and mortality from infections in general, the increasing likelihood of respiratory infections from novel viruses, and the global increase in rates of chronic diseases that involve nutrition and immune impairment. Many people do not fully understand the link between nutrition, immune function and the potential for a healthier life, and might not see the need to improve their daily diet. Poor health literacy among communities is a barrier in community education. Multiple and complex factors have a strong influence on dietary choices and patterns, which can be hard to overcome. Education is needed to enable people to better recognise the direct link between what they eat, the impact on their their immune health and the resulting effects on their overall health and well-being. Furthermore, it is essential to raise awareness that, in keeping with other body systems, the immune system requires daily nutritional support, and that diet is really important but may not be sufficient to meet the recommended dietary allowances for all nutrients, particularly micronutrients that are critical for immune function.

### The immune system in cancer metastasis: friend or foe? [^6101cea0]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Our immune system is capable of recognizing potentially harmful pathogens by the means of antigens. The immune system is educated in such a way that it does not respond to our own antigens. However, as cancer cells acquire a high number of mutations and alterations they express tumor-specific antigens that can be recognized as non-self and thereby activate the immune system, eventually leading to the killing of cancer cells. Besides a direct effect on antigen alteration, mutations can alter protein quantity, processivity and subsequent antigen presentation, thereby favoring recognition by the immune system. In this way, the immune system is able to prevent the occurrence of primary tumors (through immune surveillance) and also the rise of metastasis (through mutation-specific immunity induced by the primary tumor). Over a century ago, murine models of metastasis showed that progressive growth of a primary tumor suppressed the growth of a newly implanted, secondary tumor through a mechanism involving the immune system, a phenomenon now known as concomitant immunity (CI). These data indicate the tumor can induce both an anti-tumor immune response, as well as immunosuppressive mechanisms (e.g. regulatory T cells (Tregs) and immune-suppressive stroma) that allow it to evade an attack by the immune system. However, any secondary metastatic tumors do not initially have the benefit of an immune-suppressive stroma and may not have developed the same defensive mechanisms as the primary tumor and are therefore more vulnerable to be detected and killed by the immune response. Interestingly, in some cases once the primary tumor was surgically removed, the inhibitory influence on metastatic growth was lost, indicating the primary tumor itself might also have a systemic inhibitory effect on metastasis.

### New approaches to the study of immune responses in humans [^d59d5f47]. Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

The human immune system consists of multiple, layered mechanisms of sensing and responding to cellular stress, infection and tissue damage to ensure defense from pathogens, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and the integrity of the holobiont. Every single cell in the body has a role to play, but a few dozen, specialized white blood cells are particularly important in this respect. Understanding the overall state of this multifaceted system in a single individual is challenging, and we are only beginning to do this across populations of individuals, to understand the vast range of inter-individual variation, and the influences of genes and environmental factors that collectively shape the immune system in a given individual. We are also only beginning to understand the changes occurring within this system over time, and how this relates to health and disease susceptibility. Several technological breakthroughs in recent years have enabled these developments and the emergence of a new, complementary approach to studying human immune systems, namely systems immunology. In this paradigm, the focus is shifted from the understanding of individual immune system components and their mechanisms of action, towards analyses of cell–cell interactions, and mechanisms of coordination and regulation within the human immune system.

### Decoding mechanisms and protein markers in lung-brain axis [^2a399ffc]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Regulatory role of the immune system and inflammatory responses

The immune system, a sophisticated defense mechanism within living organisms, is a network of interdependent cells, molecules, and organs. Its primary function is to identify and combat invading pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, as well as to neutralize abnormal cells. This intricate system serves as a crucial mediator of communication from the lungs to the brain (Fig. 2 A). For example, alterations in the gut microbiota, which are often associated with pulmonary diseases, can further modulate immune responses and contribute to neuroinflammatory processes. This finding highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced immune response to protect both lung and brain health, suggesting that interventions aimed at modulating immune function may have beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes in patients with respiratory disorders.

### Immune mechanisms and shared immune targets in neurodegenerative diseases [^602cb3aa]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The immune system plays a major part in neurodegenerative diseases. In some, such as multiple sclerosis, it is the primary driver of the disease. In others, such as Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease, it has an amplifying role. Immunotherapeutic approaches that target the adaptive and innate immune systems are being explored for the treatment of almost all neurological diseases, and the targets and approaches are often common across diseases. Microglia are the primary immune cells in the brain that contribute to disease pathogenesis, and are consequently a common immune target for therapy. Other therapeutic approaches target components of the peripheral immune system, such as regulatory T cells and monocytes, which in turn act within the CNS. This Review considers in detail how microglia, monocytes and T cells contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease, and their potential as shared therapeutic targets across these diseases. The microbiome is also highlighted as an emerging therapeutic target that indirectly modulates the immune system. Therapeutic approaches being developed to target immune function in neurodegenerative diseases are discussed, highlighting how immune-based approaches developed to treat one disease could be applicable to multiple other neurological diseases.

### COVID-19: is there a role for immunonutrition, particularly in the over 65s? [^e4fa27f1]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Immunity focus

The human immune system is comprised of four central components — T cells, B cells, the complement system and phagocytes which are vital in defending the organism against foreign intruders. The immune system is the body's primary defence barrier against infections, and thus any weaknesses could be potentially detrimental to the host.

It has been recognised that a 'well-fed' immune system is one way of helping to provide defence against pathogenic organisms. It has been elegantly stated that an ideal immune system should be 'constantly alert and monitoring for signs of danger or invasion'. Professor Philip Calder is one of the leading experts in nutritional immunology and has published widely on this topic. In his article 'Feeding the Immune System', he explains that the immune system functions by acting as an exclusion barrier, identifying and eliminating pathogens and involving complex interplay between many different cell types and chemical mediators.

Unfortunately a decline in immune function is usually inevitable with ageing, a process referred to scientifically as 'immunosenescence', which typically involves the deterioration of both innate and acquired immune systems. A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed, including (1) declining T cell function attributed to thymic involution and subsequent reduced output of naïve T cells; (2) ageing-associated inflammation, often referred to as 'inflammaging', which paradoxically can reduce immunity and contribute to pathogenic age-related diseases; and (3) poor micronutrient status – a bidirectional relationship between infection/immunity and nutrition whereby changes in one of these components can impact the other. It is also becoming apparent that ageing can modulate immune function and cellular composition in ways that are sex-specific, possibly due to differences in how menopause and andropause unfold.

With regard to respiratory conditions, the combined effects of compromised immune function, frailty and length of exposure to pathogens mean that ageing populations are naturally predisposed to pulmonary disease. Nevertheless, there is hope — innate and acquired immune function may be supported by human nutrition, particularly in instances where this is suboptimal, that is, in clinical settings and the aged, potentially helping to lower the risk of infections and their severity and promote recovery from these.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases: an update from the international union of immunological societies primary immunodeficiency diseases classification committee [^a47b6078]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that affect distinct components of the innate and adaptive immune system, such as neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, complement proteins, natural killer cells, and T and B lymphocytes. The study of these diseases has provided essential insights into the functioning of the immune system. More than 120 distinct genes have been identified, whose abnormalities account for more than 150 different forms of PID. The complexity of the genetic, immunologic, and clinical features of PID has prompted the need for their classification, with the ultimate goal of facilitating diagnosis and treatment. To serve this goal, an international committee of experts has met every 2 years since 1970. In its last meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo, after 3 days of intense scientific presentations and discussions, the committee has updated the classification of PID, as reported in this article.

### Laboratory diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies [^6ef87aa6]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Primary immune deficiency disorders represent a highly heterogeneous group of disorders with an increased propensity to infections and other immune complications. A careful history to delineate the pattern of infectious organisms and other complications is important to guide the workup of these patients, but a focused laboratory evaluation is essential to the diagnosis of an underlying primary immunodeficiency. Initial workup of suspected immune deficiencies should include complete blood counts and serologic tests of immunoglobulin levels, vaccine titers, and complement levels, but these tests are often insufficient to make a diagnosis. Recent advancements in the understanding of the immune system have led to the development of novel immunologic assays to aid in the diagnosis of these disorders. Classically utilized to enumerate lymphocyte subsets, flow cytometric-based assays are increasingly utilized to test immune cell function (e.g., neutrophil oxidative burst, NK cytotoxicity), intracellular cytokine production (e.g. TH17 production), cellular signaling pathways (e.g., phosphor-STAT analysis), and protein expression (e.g. BTK, Foxp3). Genetic testing has similarly expanded greatly as more primary immune deficiencies are defined, and the use of mass sequencing technologies is leading to the identification of novel disorders. In order to utilize these complex assays in clinical care, one must have a firm understanding of the immunologic assay, how the results are interpreted, pitfalls in the assays, and how the test affects treatment decisions. This article will provide a systematic approach of the evaluation of a suspected primary immunodeficiency, as well as provide a comprehensive list of testing options and their results in the context of various disease processes.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases: an update on the classification from the international union of immunological societies expert committee for primary immunodeficiency 2015 [^b610d753]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

A number of the new genes included in this edition of the classification tables are molecules associated not only with the immune system, but also with more generic cellular functions; such defects result in both immunological and non-immunological abnormalities. In addition, there are a number of gain-of-function (GOF) mutations identified such as in PIK3CD. In CARD11 and STAT1 for example, there are both autosomal dominant GOF and autosomal recessive loss of function variants and these different modes of inheritance in the same gene lead to different functional consequences and hence different immunological and clinical phenotypes. The other trend that is increasingly observed is the increase in disorder of immunedysregulation rather than pure immunodeficiency.

The goal of the IUIS Expert Committee on Primary Immunodeficiencies is to increase awareness, facilitate recognition and promote optimal treatment for patients with Primary Immunodeficiencies. In addition to the current report and previous 'classification table' publications, the committee has also produced a 'Phenotypic Approach for IUIS PID classification and Diagnosis: Guidelines for Clinicians at the Bedside', which aims to lead physicians to particular groups of PIDs starting from clinical features and combining routine immunological investigations. This will be further updated to include the newly identified defects. Together these contributions will hopefully allow a practical clinical framework for PID diagnosis.

### Innate and adaptive immunity: specificities and signaling hierarchies revisited [^39fe962c]. Nature Immunology (2005). Medium credibility.

The conventional classification of known immune responses by specificity may need re-evaluation. The immune system can be classified into two subsystems: the innate and adaptive immune systems. In general, innate immunity is considered a nonspecific response, whereas the adaptive immune system is thought of as being very specific. In addition, the antigen receptors of the adaptive immune response are commonly viewed as 'master sensors' whose engagement dictates lymphocyte function. Here we propose that these ideas do not genuinely reflect the organization of immune responses and that they bias our view of immunity as well as our teaching of immunology. Indeed, the level of specificity and mode of signaling integration used by the main cellular participants in the adaptive and innate immune systems are more similar than previously appreciated.

### The immune system in cancer metastasis: friend or foe? [^7cad0fdd]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Over the years, several hypotheses for the disappearance of CI after primary tumor removal have been proposed, including an increased activity of suppressor cells, and the secretion of inhibitory factors by the primary tumor suppressing the growth of metastatic cells. In contrast, other cases showed that the removal of the primary tumor rendered mice immune to a subsequent graft of the same tumor cell line, indicating the primary tumor can induce persistent immunity to a secondary tumor. Interestingly, CI was found to not always be tumor specific, indicating that besides T cells other CI mechanisms are in place to prevent metastasis. If so, those mechanisms would be highly clinically relevant as they would enable a broadly applicable approach to prevent metastasis.

As metastases are considered to be secondary tumors derived from the primary tumor after its establishment, concomitant immunity may be involved in controlling the occurrence of metastasis. Due to the fact that the immune system can both promote and inhibit metastasis, it is of great importance for the clinic to understand which mediators are involved and how they impart their effects, in order to identify new targets to prevent metastatic disease.

Immune cells at the primary tumor site influence metastatic behavior of cancer cells

The infiltration of immune cells into the primary tumor can have positive or negative effects on the patient's prognosis. Tumors not only actively escape from the immune system, they can also co-opt certain immune processes. A major mediator of this co-opting process by the tumor is through modification of the tumor stroma. The stroma consists of several cell types that contribute to tissue homeostasis, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, nerve cells, immune cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Normally, it provides tissue homeostasis by controlling the balance between cell proliferation and cell death through interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and fibroblasts. However in cancer, fibroblasts often induce tumor progression by stimulating the proliferation and invasive phenotype of cancer cells, increasing their metastatic potential. In pancreatic cancer, the dense fibrosis (desmoplasia) has been postulated to play either an inhibitory role constraining tumor growth or a protective role by providing survival signals and possibly impeding drug delivery to the cancer cells. Tumor stroma can also promote the formation of new blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis. Without angiogenesis, a solid tumor will be limited in size and in its ability to access the blood stream for dissemination, an essential aspect to metastasis. Angiogenesis is initiated when the balance between pro-angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic factors changes in favor of the former; this is also known as the angiogenic switch.

### Update: vaccines in primary immunodeficiency [^a0074494]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Vaccines were originally developed to prevent or ameliorate infectious disease. As knowledge of immune function and appreciation of immunodeficiency has developed, researchers have used vaccine responses as a tool to characterize the phenotypes of patients exhibiting various syndromes. Thus it has become possible for a clinician to evaluate individual responses to vaccines to interrogate the immunocompetence of their patients. Although there have been many advances in these areas, we still have much to learn about the quantity and quality of humoral and cellular vaccine responses in healthy and immunodeficient subjects and how that knowledge can then be extrapolated to diagnostic purposes. Adverse effects of vaccines have been recognized for many years, especially the occurrence of infections caused by viable vaccine organisms in immunodeficient hosts. Nevertheless, vaccines are essential for disease prevention in immunodeficient patients, just as they are for healthy subjects. Clinicians must understand the appropriate and safe use of vaccines in patients with immunodeficiency. This review highlights some recent advances and ongoing challenges in application of vaccines for the diagnosis and treatment of immunodeficiencies.

### A physical wiring diagram for the human immune system [^6c51b079]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

The human immune system must maintain the same coordination and cohesion as the body's other homeostatic organ systems despite being composed of highly migratory and circulating cell types that are distributed throughout the body. Diverse arrays of cell-surface proteins organize immune cells into interconnected cellular communities, linking cells through physical interactions that act both for signalling communication and for structural adhesion. The immune system has been described from one perspective as carefully coordinated networks of cell types, where by extension it is these physical linkages that hold the network together. Consequently, immune receptors regulate virtually all stages of cellular activation and are appreciated as critical mediators of a variety of homeostatic and pathological processes, which range from tumour surveillance, to autoimmunity, to infection control. For these reasons, along with their accessibility to systemically administered medicines, immune surface proteins and their interactions are particularly attractive therapeutic targets.

Although the interaction networks that involve secreted proteins have already been systematically catalogued, in the immune system and more generally across existing protein interaction databases, there remains a substantial under-representation of the interactions between cell-surface proteins. Specialized methods have been developed that tackle individual challenges stemming from membrane-embedded surface proteins, such as their typically weak binding affinities, and the low tractability of these proteins for many classic biochemical approaches. These methods, however, generally lack the throughput to systematically characterize whole cell-surface proteomes, or have only had success for specific protein families rather than the full diverse spectrum of surface protein topologies and complexes. Thus, how complete our understanding is of extracellular immune receptor interactions has remained unknown. Moreover, many immune receptors of clinical importance have been left as 'orphans', with their physiological ligands undiscovered despite in some cases decades of study –. Without a systematic picture of the physical interactions that link immune cells, any efforts at present to generate truly systems-level views of immune function will remain patchwork at best.

### The roles of CRISPR-cas systems in adaptive immunity and beyond [^7fd9a579]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and accompanying Cas proteins constitute the adaptive CRISPR-Cas immune system in bacteria and archaea. This DNA-encoded, RNA-mediated defense system provides sequence-specific recognition, targeting and degradation of exogenous nucleic acid. Though the primary established role of CRISPR-Cas systems is in bona fide adaptive antiviral defense in bacteria, a growing body of evidence indicates that it also plays critical functional roles beyond immunity, such as endogenous transcriptional control. Furthermore, benefits inherent to maintaining genome homeostasis also come at the cost of reduced uptake of beneficial DNA, and preventing strategic adaptation to the environment. This opens new avenues for the investigation of CRISPR-Cas systems and their functional characterization beyond adaptive immunity.

### Updates in the understanding of immunoglobulin replacement therapy in primary immune deficiency disorders: function, composition, and role in reconstitution and immunomodulation [^cc58996a]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical indications for immunoglobulin therapy can be broadly classified into replacement therapy for immunodeficiencies, immunomodulatory treatment of inflammatory conditions, and hyperimmune therapy against specific infectious agents. When starting immunoglobulin therapy, there are important considerations for the clinician including indication and function, composition, dosing, route, and safety. Immunoglobulin therapy should be tailored to an individual patient. This review discusses our current understanding and practical considerations for using immunoglobulin therapy for both humoral immune reconstitution and immunomodulation.

### Boosting peripheral immunity to fight neurodegeneration in the brain [^1d9bf560]. Trends in Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Reciprocal communication between the brain and the immune system is essential for maintaining lifelong brain function. This interaction is mediated, at least in part, by immune cells recruited from both the circulation and niches at the borders of the brain. Here, we describe how immune exhaustion and senescence, even if not primary causative factors, can accelerate neurodegenerative diseases. We emphasize the role of a compromised peripheral immune system in driving neurodegeneration and discuss strategies for harnessing peripheral immunity to effectively treat neurodegenerative diseases, including the underlying mechanisms and opportunities for clinical translation. Specifically, we highlight the potential of boosting the immune system by blocking inhibitory checkpoint molecules to harness reparative immune cells in helping the brain to fight against neurodegeneration.

### International multidisciplinary consensus on the definition and clinical approach for monogenic inflammatory immune dysregulation disorders [^c6b68b6e]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) traditionally describe inherited immune system disorders that impair the human defense against infections. In the 1970s, the World Health Organization formed a committee to classify PIDs, a responsibility later assumed by the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) in the 1990s. Over time, it became evident that PIDs are associated with a spectrum of autoinflammatory, autoimmune, atopic manifestations, and susceptibility to malignancy. Notably, noninfectious manifestations are often the primary or initial clinical features of many of these disorders. The growing understanding of their genetic basis, supported by advancements in molecular genetic testing, has led to the adoption of the term inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) due to the identification of mutations without immune deficiency (loss-function) but rather immune over-activation (gain-of-function).

In the most recent IUIS classification update, 555 distinct IEIs are categorized into 10 groups based on immunologic and genetic defects. However, certain disorders from different groups exhibit overlapping features, such as pronounced inflammation alongside immune dysregulation, highlighting the need for unifying term.

The term 'Monogenic Inflammatory Immune Dysregulation Disorders' (MIIDDs) has been introduced as an umbrella concept for a heterogeneous group of conditions. It describes patients with pathogenic gene mutations affecting both innate and adaptive immunity, clinical features of inflammation, and evolving features of immune dysregulation. This unifying term may facilitate the grouping of related disorders within a single conceptual framework, supporting research integration on overlapping disorders regardless of their underlying pathophysiology, as seen in monogenic lupus.

Establishing this framework is important for advancing research and improving patient outcomes. To address this, we conducted a systematic literature review and a modified online Delphi study, engaging an international panel of experts. This process aimed to achieve consensus on the definition and clinical management for patients with MIIDDs.

### Diagnostic modalities in primary immunodeficiency [^643a4649]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

As the field of inborn errors of immunity expands, providers continually update and fine-tune their diagnostic approach and selection of testing modalities to increase diagnostic accuracy. Here, we first describe a mechanistic consideration of laboratory testing, highlighting both benefits and drawbacks of currently clinically available testing modalities. Next, we provide methods in evaluation of patients presenting with concern for inborn errors of immunity as defined by the International Union of Immunological Societies 2019 phenotypic categories: primary antibody deficiencies, cellular and humoral immune deficiency, disorders of the innate immune system, and syndrome-associated and primary immune regulation disorders (PIRDs). Using the suggested approach in this paper as a roadmap highlights the importance of thorough history taking and physical examination as the foundation to guide further diagnostic tests. This is followed by enumeration and functional testing. Finally, to determine the underlying molecular etiology-specific genetic panels, chromosomal microarrays, and broad genetic testing (whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing) are available.

### Innate immunity [^c1330e37]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The innate immune response system forms an important line of defense by deploying a limited number of receptors specific for conserved microbial components.

### Advances in the care of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs): from birth to adulthood [^6c5588d7]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a widely heterogeneous group of inherited defects of the immune system consisting of many clinical phenotypes with at least 300 underlying genetic deficits currently known. Patients with PIDs can present with, or develop during the course of their life, a susceptibility to recurrent and chronic infection along with autoimmune, allergic, inflammatory, and/or proliferative disorders, all potentially leading to end-organ damage. In recent years, a combination of basic and clinical research has greatly improved understanding of the underlying immunological and genetic defects in PIDs, leading to improved diagnosis, classification, and treatment approaches. In this review, we consider some of the key understandings that should direct diagnostic and treatment approaches in PID and offer insights into current and emerging management approaches and the lifelong care of patients from childhood through to adulthood.

### Stromal cell contributions to the homeostasis and functionality of the immune system [^7872fe22]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2009). Medium credibility.

A defining characteristic of the immune system is the constant movement of many of its constituent cells through the secondary lymphoid tissues, mainly the spleen and lymph nodes, where crucial interactions that underlie homeostatic regulation, peripheral tolerance and the effective development of adaptive immune responses take place. What has only recently been recognized is the role that non-haematopoietic stromal elements have in many aspects of immune cell migration, activation and survival. In this Review, we summarize our current understanding of lymphoid compartment stromal cells, examine their possible heterogeneity, discuss how these cells contribute to immune homeostasis and the efficient initiation of adaptive immune responses, and highlight how targeting of these elements by some pathogens can influence the host immune response.

### Primary immunodeficiencies: a rapidly evolving story [^9b0e337b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

The characterization of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) in human subjects is crucial for a better understanding of the biology of the immune response. New achievements in this field have been possible in light of collaborative studies; attention paid to new phenotypes, infectious and otherwise; improved immunologic techniques; and use of exome sequencing technology. The International Union of Immunological Societies Expert Committee on PIDs recently reported on the updated classification of PIDs. However, new PIDs are being discovered at an ever-increasing rate. A series of 19 novel primary defects of immunity that have been discovered after release of the International Union of Immunological Societies report are discussed here. These new findings highlight the molecular pathways that are associated with clinical phenotypes and suggest potential therapies for affected patients.

### Human immune system variation [^534340c9]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

The human immune system is highly variable between individuals but relatively stable over time within a given person. Recent conceptual and technological advances have enabled systems immunology analyses, which reveal the composition of immune cells and proteins in populations of healthy individuals. The range of variation and some specific influences that shape an individual's immune system is now becoming clearer. Human immune systems vary as a consequence of heritable and non-heritable influences, but symbiotic and pathogenic microbes and other non-heritable influences explain most of this variation. Understanding when and how such influences shape the human immune system is key for defining metrics of immunological health and understanding the risk of immune-mediated and infectious diseases.

### Primary immunodeficiencies: 2009 update [^9beba543]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

More than 50 years after Ogdeon Bruton's discovery of congenital agammaglobulinemia, human primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) continue to unravel novel molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern development and function of the human immune system. This report provides the updated classification of PIDs that has been compiled by the International Union of Immunological Societies Expert Committee on Primary Immunodeficiencies after its biannual meeting in Dublin, Ireland, in June 2009. Since the appearance of the last classification in 2007, novel forms of PID have been discovered, and additional pathophysiology mechanisms that account for PID in human beings have been unraveled. Careful analysis and prompt recognition of these disorders is essential to prompt effective forms of treatment and thus to improve survival and quality of life in patients affected with PIDs.

### Neuronal regulation of immunity: why, how and where? [^3a0b7b67]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Neuroimmunology is one of the fastest-growing fields in the life sciences, and for good reason; it fills the gap between two principal systems of the organism, the nervous system and the immune system. Although both systems affect each other through bidirectional interactions, we focus here on one direction - the effects of the nervous system on immunity. First, we ask why is it beneficial to allow the nervous system any control over immunity? We evaluate the potential benefits to the immune system that arise by taking advantage of some of the brain's unique features, such as its capacity to integrate and synchronize physiological functions, its predictive capacity and its speed of response. Second, we explore how the brain communicates with the peripheral immune system, with a focus on the endocrine, sympathetic, parasympathetic, sensory and meningeal lymphatic systems. Finally, we examine where in the brain this immune information is processed and regulated. We chart a partial map of brain regions that may be relevant for brain-immune system communication, our goal being to introduce a conceptual framework for formulating new hypotheses to study these interactions.

### Immunogenomics of cholangiocarcinoma [^34d281d3]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The development of cholangiocarcinoma spans years, if not decades, during which the immune system becomes corrupted and permissive to primary tumor development and metastasis. This involves subversion of local immunity at tumor sites, as well as systemic immunity and the wider host response. While immune dysfunction is a hallmark of all cholangiocarcinoma, the specific steps of the cancer-immunity cycle that are perturbed differ between patients. Heterogeneous immune functionality impacts the evolutionary development, pathobiological behavior, and therapeutic response of these tumors. Integrative genomic analyses of thousands of primary tumors have supported a biological rationale for immune-based stratification of patients, encompassing immune cell composition and functionality. However, discerning immune alterations responsible for promoting tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression from those present as bystander events remains challenging. Functionally uncoupling the tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressing roles of immune profiles will be critical for identifying new immunomodulatory treatment strategies and associated biomarkers for patient stratification. This review will discuss the immunogenomics of cholangiocarcinoma, including the impact of genomic alterations on immune functionality, subversion of the cancer-immunity cycle, as well as clinical implications for existing and novel treatment strategies.

### Update on immune mechanisms in hypertension [^5fd0b690]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

IMMUNE SYSTEM

The immune system encompasses entire organ systems and provides protection from pathogens and foreign bodies. These defense mechanisms are arbitrated by successive and organized responses known as the innate and adaptive immune responses. The innate immune response is present at birth and acts as the first line of defense by rapidly engaging in protective measures against pathogens. The adaptive immune response acts as a delayed secondary antigen-specific response. It is regulated by innate immune cell crosstalk with the ability to retain memory of antigens, correlating to a rapid response during future encounters. The intricacies of immunological mechanistic links in diseases such as hypertension remain relatively obscure.

### Changes in the immune system are conditioned by nutrition [^4e25cae7]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Undernutrition due to insufficient intake of energy and macronutrients and/or due to deficiencies in specific micronutrients impairs the immune system, suppressing immune functions that are fundamental to host protection. The most consistent abnormalities are seen in cell-mediated immunity, complement system, phagocyte function, cytokine production, mucosal secretory antibody response, and antibody affinity. There is a number of physiological situations such as ageing and performance of intense physical exercise associated with an impairment of some immune parameters' response. Nutrition can influence the extent of immune alteration in both of them. There are also numerous pathological situations in which nutrition plays a role as a primary or secondary determinant of some underlying immunological impairments. This includes obesity, eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa), food hypersensitivity and gastrointestinal disorders as some examples. The implications of nutrition on immune function in these disorders are briefly reviewed.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases: an update on the classification from the international union of immunological societies expert committee for primary immunodeficiency 2015 [^6d7ca658]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

We report the updated classification of primary immunodeficiencies compiled by the Primary Immunodeficiency Expert Committee (PID EC) of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS). In the two years since the previous version, 34 new gene defects are reported in this updated version. For each disorder, the key clinical and laboratory features are provided. In this new version we continue to see the increasing overlap between immunodeficiency, as manifested by infection and/or malignancy, and immune dysregulation, as manifested by auto-inflammation, auto-immunity, and/or allergy. There is also an increased number of genetic defects that lead to susceptibility to specific organisms which reflects the finely tuned nature of immune defense systems. This classification is the most up to date catalogue of all known and published primary immunodeficiencies and acts as a current reference of the knowledge of these conditions and is an important aid for the genetic and molecular diagnosis of patients with these rare diseases.

### Mechanisms regulating neutrophil responses in immunity, allergy, and autoimmunity [^3005a6eb]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSIONS

From the description of NETs almost two decades ago, up until now, the field of immunology has become less conservative on what neutrophils are capable of. Beyond pathogen elimination, which still is their prevailing purpose, neutrophils communicate signals of activation, suppression, and migration, guide antigen presentation, and modulate local immune responses. If not regulated properly, neutrophils can inflict damage, but importantly, they can also contribute to tissue maintenance and repair. The compelling question is what guides a neutrophil to assume a specific role or function? Understanding this requires to further dissect cell‐intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in different immunological contexts. With each new piece of the puzzle, we get one step closer to manipulating neutrophil behavior, which opens novel therapeutic avenues for life‐threatening infections, immune‐mediated diseases, and even defects of tissue repair and regeneration.

### Control of adaptive immunity by the innate immune system [^8f685f52]. Nature Immunology (2015). Medium credibility.

Microbial infections are recognized by the innate immune system both to elicit immediate defense and to generate long-lasting adaptive immunity. To detect and respond to vastly different groups of pathogens, the innate immune system uses several recognition systems that rely on sensing common structural and functional features associated with different classes of microorganisms. These recognition systems determine microbial location, viability, replication and pathogenicity. Detection of these features by recognition pathways of the innate immune system is translated into different classes of effector responses though specialized populations of dendritic cells. Multiple mechanisms for the induction of immune responses are variations on a common design principle wherein the cells that sense infections produce one set of cytokines to induce lymphocytes to produce another set of cytokines, which in turn activate effector responses.

### FoxP3 ⁺ regulatory CD4 T cells control the generation of functional CD8 memory [^dadc2f7e]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

During the primary immune response, CD8 memory emerges from an environment of strong immune activation. The FoxP3(+) regulatory CD4 T-cell subset (Treg) is known as a key suppressive component of the immune system. Here we report that Tregs are required for the generation of functional CD8 memory. In the absence of Tregs during priming, the resulting memory cells proliferate poorly and fail to differentiate into functional cytotoxic secondary effectors following antigen reactivation. We find that the Tregs act early, during the expansion phase of primary CD8 effectors, by fine tuning interleukin-2 exposure of CD8 memory precursors. This crucial new role of Tregs has implications for optimal vaccine development.

### The effect of microbiota and the immune system on the development and organization of the enteric nervous system [^65f4ad08]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is essential for digestion of foods, absorption of nutrients and water, energy balance, and protection from pathogenic microorganisms. Most aspects of GI physiology are under neural control, which is exerted via extrinsic nerves (which include both primary afferent and autonomic fibers that ultimately connect the gut tissues with the central nervous system [CNS]) and a vast network of intrinsic enteric neurons (1–5 × 10⁸) and glial cells that are organized into the myenteric and submucosal plexi of the enteric nervous system (ENS). On the basis of their neurochemical properties, enteric neurons are subdivided into multiple subtypes that share molecular, morphologic, and physiological characteristics. Unlike enteric neurons whose cell bodies are restricted to the myenteric and submucosal ganglia, enteric glial cells (EGCs), and neuronal fibers are distributed throughout the gut wall, including the lamina propria of the mucosa. Among other functions, the ENS regulates GI peristalsis, epithelial secretion, intestinal blood flow, and transmucosal movement of liquids largely independently of central nervous system input.

In addition to its motor and secretory functions, the GI tract is the largest sensory organ of the body, which incessantly monitors the dynamic microenvironment of the gut wall and its lumen. Several cellular systems contribute to the sensory function of the gut, including the enteroendocrine cells of the intestinal epithelium, the mucosal immune system, and the ENS. The integrated responses of these cellular networks enable the gut to build highly selective anatomic and functional barriers that allow absorption of useful nutrients and exclusion of harmful chemicals and micro-organisms. Information relating to the chemical composition and caloric value of ingested food, the dynamic equilibrium of the microbial ecosystem of the gut (microbiota), and the physiological state of the gut wall reaches the brain via the neurohumoral pathways of the microbiota–gut–brain (MGB) axis and allows the CNS to generate appropriate homeostatic and behavioral responses.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases: an update from the international union of immunological societies primary immunodeficiency diseases classification committee meeting in budapest, 2005 [^bc9370a7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Although relatively rare, primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) provide an excellent window into the functioning of the immune system. In the late 1960s, observations on these diseases, with their associated infections and genetics, bisected the immune system into humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity. These diseases also represent a challenge in their diagnosis and treatment. Beginning in 1970, a unified nomenclature for the then-known PIDs was created by a committee convoked by the World Health Organization. Since then, and later under the aegis of the International Union of Immunological Societies, an international committee of experts has met every 2 to 3 years to update the classification of PIDs. During the past 15 years, the molecular basis of more than 120 PIDs has been elucidated. This update results from the latest meeting of this committee in Budapest, Hungary, in June 2005, which followed 2 1/2 days of scientific discussions. As a result of this work, new entities have been included, and the nomenclature of some PIDs (specifically of the various forms of class-switch recombination defects, previously known as hyper-IgM syndromes) has been changed.

### ICON: the early diagnosis of congenital immunodeficiencies [^a227fe55]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiencies are intrinsic defects in the immune system that result in a predisposition to infection and are frequently accompanied by a propensity to autoimmunity and/or immunedysregulation. Primary immunodeficiencies can be divided into innate immunodeficiencies, phagocytic deficiencies, complement deficiencies, disorders of T cells and B cells (combined immunodeficiencies), antibody deficiencies and immunodeficiencies associated with syndromes. Diseases of immune dysregulation and autoinflammatory disorder are many times also included although the immunodeficiency in these disorders are often secondary to the autoimmunity or immune dysregulation and/or secondary immunosuppression used to control these disorders. Congenital primary immunodeficiencies typically manifest early in life although delayed onset are increasingly recognized. The early diagnosis of congenital immunodeficiencies is essential for optimal management and improved outcomes. In this International Consensus (ICON) document, we provide the salient features of the most common congenital immunodeficiencies.

### Immunological memory: lessons from the past and a look to the future [^46bc1e8e]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Immunological memory is considered to be one of the cardinal features of the adaptive immune system. Despite being a recognized phenomenon since the time of the ancient Greeks, immunologists are yet to fully appreciate the mechanisms that control memory responses in the immune system. Furthermore, our definition of immunological memory itself continues to evolve, with recent suggestions that innate immune cells also show memory-like behaviour. In this Viewpoint article, Nature Reviews Immunology invites five leading immunologists to share their thoughts on our current understanding of the nature of immunological memory. Our experts highlight some of the seminal studies that have shaped the immune memory field and offer contrasting views on the key questions that remain to be addressed.

### IFNgamma and lymphocytes prevent primary tumour development and shape tumour immunogenicity [^32f97b51]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Lymphocytes were originally thought to form the basis of a 'cancer immunosurveillance' process that protects immunocompetent hosts against primary tumour development, but this idea was largely abandoned when no differences in primary tumour development were found between athymic nude mice and syngeneic wild-type mice. However, subsequent observations that nude mice do not completely lack functional T cells and that two components of the immune system-IFNgamma and perforin-help to prevent tumour formation in mice have led to renewed interest in a tumour-suppressor role for the immune response. Here we show that lymphocytes and IFNgamma collaborate to protect against development of carcinogen-induced sarcomas and spontaneous epithelial carcinomas and also to select for tumour cells with reduced immunogenicity. The immune response thus functions as an effective extrinsic tumour-suppressor system. However, this process also leads to the immunoselection of tumour cells that are more capable of surviving in an immunocompetent host, which explains the apparent paradox of tumour formation in immunologically intact individuals.

### Effector lymphoid tissue and its crucial role in protective immunity [^96a1d27b]. Trends in Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

It is often argued that T cell-mediated immunity to secondary infection is dependent on the 'accelerated' responses of memory T cells in lymph nodes. However, new evidence points to a crucial role for effector memory T cells, which are resident in peripheral tissues, in immune protection. These T cells, which reside in peripheral tissues, are not necessarily bound by an anatomical structure and can be present at many sites. Collectively, they represent a third functional tissue of the immune system, uniquely specialized to mediate protective immunity. We propose that the paradigm 'effector lymphoid tissue' needs to be articulated and developed as a focus of new research to describe and understand the unique role this tissue has in protective immunity.

### Laboratory evaluation of primary immunodeficiencies [^cbc35bb3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiencies are congenital disorders caused by defects in different elements of the immune system. Affected patients usually present clinically with recurrent infections, severe infections, or both, as well as autoimmune phenomena that are associated with many of these disorders. Early diagnosis is essential for referral to specialized care centers and the prompt initiation of appropriate therapy. In this article the authors describe a general approach for the investigation of the most common primary immunodeficiencies, outlining the typical clinical symptoms and most appropriate laboratory investigations.

### Adaptive immunity [^8eaa38fa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The innate immune system provides critical mechanisms for the rapid sensing and elimination of pathogens. Adaptive immunity has evolved to provide a broader and more finely tuned repertoire of recognition for both self- and nonself-antigens. Adaptive immunity involves a tightly regulated interplay between antigen-presenting cells and T and B lymphocytes, which facilitate pathogen-specific immunologic effector pathways, generation of immunologic memory, and regulation of host immune homeostasis. Lymphocytes develop and are activated within a series of lymphoid organs comprising the lymphatic system. During development, sets of gene segments are rearranged and assembled to create genes encoding the specific antigen receptors of T and B lymphocytes. The rearrangement mechanism generates a tremendously diverse repertoire of receptor specificities capable of recognizing components of all potential pathogens. In addition to specificity, another principal feature of adaptive immunity is the generation of immunologic memory. During the first encounter with an antigen (pathogen), sets of long-lived memory T and B cells are established. In subsequent encounters with the same pathogen, the memory cells are quickly activated to yield a more rapid and robust protective response.

### A role of the adaptive immune system in glucose homeostasis [^523da8e7]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Collectively, this work supports that the adaptive immune system is part of the metabolic organ system and that disruptions in its function can result in insulin resistance; however, an absence of B and T cells does not protect from diet-induced insulin resistance. These findings emphasise that results collected in immune-manipulated and diet-manipulated mice must be interpreted carefully as they can be due to a disruption in physiological glucose homeostasis, pathological insulin resistance or a combination of these two events.

### Cruciate ligament healing and injury prevention in the age of regenerative medicine and technostress: homeostasis revisited [^ebd4bb59]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This clinical concepts paper discusses the essential elements of cruciate ligament recuperation, micro-trauma repair, and remodeling.

Methods

Cruciate ligament mechanobiology and tissue heterogeneity, anatomy and vascularity, and synovial membrane and fluid functions are discussed in relationship to deficiency-induced inflammatory responses, nervous and immune system function, recuperation, repair and remodeling, and modern threats to homeostasis.

Results

Cruciate ligament surgical procedures do not appreciate the vital linked functions of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems and immune system function on knee ligament injury recuperation, micro-trauma repair, and remodeling. Enhanced knowledge of these systems could provide innovative ways to decrease primary non-contact knee injury rates and improve outcomes following reconstruction or primary repair.

Conclusions

Restoration of knee joint homeostasis is essential to cruciate ligament recuperation, micro-trauma repair, and remodeling. The nervous and immune systems are intricately involved in this process. Varying combinations of high-intensity training, under-recovery, technostress, and environmental pollutants (including noise) regularly expose many athletically active individuals to factors that abrogate the environment needed for cruciate ligament recuperation, micro-trauma repair, and remodeling. Current sports training practice, lifestyle psychobehaviors, and environmental factors combine to increase both primary non-contact knee injury risk and the nervous and immune system dysregulation that lead to poor sleep, increased anxiety, and poorly regulated hormone and cytokine levels. These factors may create a worst-case scenario leading to poor ligament recuperation, micro-trauma repair, and remodeling. Early recognition and modification of these factors may decrease knee ligament injury rates and improve cruciate ligament repair or reconstruction outcomes.

### Primary immunodeficiencies [^2e29bfcf]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiencies include a variety of disorders that render patients more susceptible to infections. If left untreated, these infections may be fatal. The disorders constitute a spectrum of more than 80 innate defects in the body's immune system. Primary immunodeficiencies generally are considered to be relatively uncommon. There may be as many as 500,000 cases in the United States, of which about 50,000 cases are diagnosed each year. Common primary immunodeficiencies include disorders of humoral immunity (affecting B-cell differentiation or antibody production), T-cell defects and combined B- and T-cell defects, phagocytic disorders, and complement deficiencies. Major indications of these disorders include multiple infections despite aggressive treatment, infections with unusual or opportunistic organisms, failure to thrive or poor growth, and a positive family history. Early recognition and diagnosis can alter the course of primary immunodeficiencies significantly and have a positive effect on patient outcome.

### Innate immunity in allergy [^17024c18]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

10 CONCLUSION

Over 20 years, we have witnessed a remarkable advance in understanding the mechanism of pathogen recognition by the innate immune system. New players involved in the innate immune system continue to be reported. However, despite enormous efforts, our knowledge of how the innate immune system is involved in the development of allergic diseases is still limited, and feasible target molecules or pathways are yet to be discovered. It is necessary to determine how pathogen recognition molecules and subsequent signaling pathways are involved in the development of allergic diseases.

### From bugs to brain: unravelling the GABA signalling networks in the brain-gut-microbiome axis [^5294c413]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal GABA modulates local and systemic immunity by activating immune-cell GABA receptors

A compelling body of evidence implicates immune system dysregulation in psychopathology. However, there are many crucial unanswered questions about whether associated systemic inflammation drives brain pathology or primary alterations to brain function result in changes to immune function in the rest of the body. This has stimulated the assessment of neurochemical involvement, most notably GABA, in immune processes. What has emerged is convincing evidence that the GABA molecular apparatus is expressed in both arms of the immune system — in the innate, e.g. mononuclear phagocytes, and adaptive response factors, e.g. T and B cells. The components of the molecular apparatus include molecules underpinning GABA metabolism, GABA transport and secretion, both GABA A and GABA B Rs, GABA signal regulation by cation chloride co-transporters (CCCs) and effector Ca²⁺ signalling via voltage-dependent channels. Furthermore, functional studies confirm that GABA signalling via both A and B receptor subtypes regulates inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in both arms of the immune system. These findings suggest that the GI GABA system is ideally placed to influence immune function since the gut-associated lymphoid system accounts for ∼70% of the body's immune cells(Fig. 5). In support, the activation of specific GABA A R subtypes induces or suppresses colonic inflammation in addition to impacting barrier permeability. Thus, there is the potential for such GABA-mediated production of local GI immune mediators to distribute more widely throughout the body, allowing systemic inflammation to impair BBB integrity. This would result in a variety of molecules obtaining access to the brain, such as inflammatory cytokines, which negatively impact brain function, thereby contributing to psychological symptoms.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases [^45408360]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Although primary immunodeficiency disorders are relatively rare, intensive investigation of these disorders has yielded a great wealth of understanding of basic immunologic mechanisms in host defense, inflammation, and autoimmunity. These advances have led to important developments for the treatment not only of the primary immunodeficiencies but also for patients with secondary immunocompromised states, autoimmune disorders, hypersensitivity, graft rejection, and graft versus host disease. Correction of a form of severe combined immunodeficiency represents the first true success of human gene therapy. This review introduces the major clinical manifestations of primary immunodeficiency disorders, along with descriptions of essential elements of the pathophysiology of those disorders that have been defined at the molecular level. Key concepts in treatment are also presented. It is critical for the practicing primary care provider and allergist to maintain an index of suspicion for immunodeficiency. Early diagnosis offers the best opportunity for reduced morbidity and survival and is critical for accurate genetic counseling.

### Defining common variable immunodeficiency disorders in 2020 [^8b059e86]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) are the most frequent symptomatic primary immune deficiency in adults. Because there is no known cause for these conditions, there is no single clinical feature or laboratory test that can confirm the diagnosis with certainty. If a causative mutation is identified, patients are deemed to have a CVID-like disorder caused by a specific primary immunodeficiency/inborn error of immunity. In the remaining patients, the explanation for these disorders remains unclear. The understanding of CVID continues to evolve and the authors review recent studies, which have addressed some of these uncertainties.

### Oligodendroglial impact on axonal function and survival-a hypothesis [^ab4ce999]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although multiple sclerosis is considered the prototype of a primary autoimmune disease in the central nervous system, there is emerging evidence that primary oligodendrocyte dysfunctions can suffice to trigger a secondary immune response in the nervous system. This short review focuses on the possible primary role of oligodendrocytes in axon loss and inflammatory demyelination.

Recent Findings

The analysis of natural and engineered mouse mutants has provided unexpected insight into oligodendrocyte function beyond that of axonal myelination for rapid impulse propagation. Specifically, mutations in some genes thought to be required for myelin assembly revealed an additional role of oligodendrocytes in supporting long-term axonal function and survival. Other mutations have been reported that cause both central nervous system demyelination and neuroinflammation, with pathological features known from human leukodystrophy patients. In human multiple sclerosis, demyelination leads invariably to axon loss, but the underling pathomechanisms may not be restricted to that of a primary immune-mediated disorder.

Summary

Collectively, experimental and pathological findings point to a primary role of myelinating glia in long-term axonal support and suggest that defects of lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes contribute to inflammatory myelin diseases.

### Targeting the gut microbiome as a treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis: a conceptional framework [^18492e91]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Interplay between gastrointestinal microbiome, BA metabolism, and immune function in PSC

The gastrointestinal microbiome and metabolism of BAs.

The human gut microbiota consists of thousands of different bacterial species and other microorganisms with defined functions. This microbial ecosystem maintains homeostasis through a tight balance between the mucosal immune system, cell-to-cell signaling, and subsequent release of antimicrobial peptides to control neighboring bacterial clades. Commensal microbial metabolism produces essential vitamins and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and modifies a variety of endogenous and exogenous sources of complex molecules (e.g. BAs and xenobiotics) that can contribute to the gut metabolome. The SCFAs, particularly butyrate, regulate innate and adaptive immune cell generation, trafficking, and function and have anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, SCFAs play an active role in modulating the mucosal immune system to establish a tolerant phenotype against beneficial commensal microbiota. However, the biodiversity of gut microbes implicated in coordinating BA metabolism and their conversion(s) from primary to secondary BAs is narrow and perhaps better defined from a genetic and biochemical context than other aspects of microbial metabolism in the human gut.

### A CRISPR-cas9 delivery system for in vivo screening of genes in the immune system [^90be61b4]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Therapies that target the function of immune cells have significant clinical efficacy in diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity. Although functional genomics has accelerated therapeutic target discovery in cancer, its use in primary immune cells is limited because vector delivery is inefficient and can perturb cell states. Here we describe CHIME: CHimeric IMmune Editing, a CRISPR-Cas9 bone marrow delivery system to rapidly evaluate gene function in innate and adaptive immune cells in vivo without ex vivo manipulation of these mature lineages. This approach enables efficient deletion of genes of interest in major immune lineages without altering their development or function. We use this approach to perform an in vivo pooled genetic screen and identify Ptpn2 as a negative regulator of CD8 + T cell-mediated responses to LCMV Clone 13 viral infection. These findings indicate that this genetic platform can enable rapid target discovery through pooled screening in immune cells in vivo.

### Common variable immunodeficiency: a new look at an old disease [^0b9c0062]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Primary immunodeficiencies comprise many diseases caused by genetic defects primarily affecting the immune system. About 150 such diseases have been identified with more than 120 associated genetic defects. Although primary immunodeficiencies are quite rare in incidence, the prevalence can range from one in 500 to one in 500 000 in the general population, depending on the diagnostic skills and medical resources available in different countries. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the primary immunodeficiency most commonly encountered in clinical practice, and appropriate diagnosis and management of patients will have a significant effect on morbidity and mortality as well as financial aspects of health care. Advances in diagnostic laboratory methods, including B-cell subset analysis and genetic testing, coupled with new insights into the molecular basis of immune dysfunction in some patients with CVID, have enabled advances in the clinical classification of this heterogeneous disease.

The spleen is the main filter for blood-borne pathogens and antigens, as well as a key organ for iron metabolism and erythrocyte homeostasis. Also, immune and hematopoietic functions have been recently unveiled for the mouse spleen, suggesting additional roles for this secondary lymphoid organ. Here we discuss the integration of the spleen in the regulation of immune responses locally and in the whole body and present the relevance of findings for our understanding of inflammatory and degenerative diseases and their treatments. We consider whether equivalent activities in humans are known, as well as initial therapeutic attempts to target the spleen for modulating innate and adaptive immunity.

### The 2015 IUIS phenotypic classification for primary immunodeficiencies [^378f75f5]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

There are now nearly 300 single-gene inborn errors of immunity underlying phenotypes as diverse as infection, malignancy, allergy, auto-immunity, and auto-inflammation. For each of these five categories, a growing variety of phenotypes are ascribed to Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PID), making PIDs a rapidly expanding field of medicine. The International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) PID expert committee (EC) has published every other year a classification of these disorders into tables, defined by shared pathogenesis and/or clinical consequences. In 2013, the IUIS committee also proposed a more user-friendly, phenotypic classification, based on the selection of key phenotypes at the bedside. We herein propose the revised figures, based on the accompanying 2015 IUIS PID EC classification.

### Immunodeficiencies in adults: key considerations for diagnosis and management [^fc3527a1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immunodeficiency, defined as a weakened or dysfunctional immune system that increases susceptibility to infections and cancer, is common in adults. Recent estimates suggest that more than 6% of US adults may be affected, with most cases resulting from secondary immunodeficiencies (SID). These deficiencies arise due to external factors such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, medications, intrinsic factors including systemic diseases, malignancies, and metabolic disorders, or a combination of both. Primary immunodeficiencies, traditionally referred to as "primary immune deficiencies (PID)", are now classified as inborn errors of immunity (IEI). These conditions can also be diagnosed in adult patients, often with delayed diagnoses due to their heterogeneous manifestations. Importantly, this terminology can be misleading, as not all IEI initially present with immunodeficiency, and some may manifest only in adulthood. Moreover, IEI encompasses not only classical primary immunodeficiencies with recurrent or severe infections, but also conditions of immune dysregulation, including autoimmunity, autoinflammation, allergy, and malignancy.

This review aims to provide clinicians with a practical framework for recognizing immunodeficiency in adults, with a focus on SID, which accounts for most cases. We will outline key warning signs, initial diagnostic steps, and indications for specialist referral and management. Additionally, we will discuss common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most frequently diagnosed symptomatic IEI in adults. These considerations are based on a narrative review of literature, expert consensus, and the authors' clinical experience to guide decision making in practice.

### Reprogramming systemic and local immune function to empower immunotherapy against glioblastoma [^2de8c2ba]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Despite massive research efforts devoted to GBM, it remains incurable with the current conventional treatments due to the presence of BBB, infiltrative, heterogeneous and hypoxic pathophysiology. With the advancement of immunotherapy, there is growing interest in leveraging the immune system against GBM. At present, immunotherapeutic approaches developed for GBM include immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, vaccines, oncolytic virus and cytokines therapy, which mainly rely on T cells to exert anti-GBM activity. However, the multiple and unique mechanisms of immunosuppression in GBM disrupt immune function and impede the infiltration of sufficient effector T cells into tumor bed. One major characteristic feature is systemic immunosuppression, constituting one of the most fundamental challenge in the immunotherapy, which might be the primary cause why conventional T-cell based immunotherapies have shown little efficacy to date. Unfortunately, the exact underlying mechanisms behind this immunosuppression remain largely unknown. Local immunosuppressive TME is another hurdle, whose components and functions are well understood up to now, and it mainly acts as a vital facilitator of immune escape and limits the efficacy of immunotherapy. Overall, GBM establish immunosuppression both systemically and locally, impairing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Therefore, multiple disparate modes of immune-oriented treatment are requisite to overcome systemic and local immunosuppression to get rid of GBM.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases in lung disease: warning signs, diagnosis and management [^7ad24a65]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Immunodeficiency diseases (ID) are disorders involving a quantitative and/or functional disorder in the immune response that may lead to a greater risk of infections, immune dysregulation, autoimmune phenomena, inflammation, and cancer. These IDs are classified as primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) if their origin is genetic, and secondary (SID) if acquired.

PIDs comprise a heterogeneous group of more than 300 diseases. The Primary Immunodeficiencies Classification Committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) divides PIDs into 8 groups (9, if we include PID phenocopies), depending on their clinical and immunological phenotype. The various congenital or acquired defects can affect both the innate and the acquired immune system. The most common PIDs are predominantly antibody disorders (56.66%), other well defined PIDs (13.91%), phagocytic disorders (8.73%), predominantly T cell deficiencies (7.47%), and complement deficiencies (4.89%).

The prevalence of PID in Europe and the United States ranges from 41 to 83 per 100,000 inhabitants, depending on the study. The diagnosis of PID often emerges from a picture of recurrent or unusual infections, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory processes or cancers. A careful approach must be taken in the early detection of these signs, in order to avoid unnecessary testing, but without delaying diagnosis. However, since their clinical presentation varies widely and understanding of this area is often limited, underdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are common, generating significant morbidity and mortality and a major social and economic impact. Generally, the early clinical manifestations of PID occur during childhood, but they also are frequently encountered in the second or third decade of life, or even in older patients. Moreover, there are different clinical presentations across various age categories and these presentations in children could widely differ from adult patients with PID.

### Shaping variation in the human immune system [^7e3f0a75]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Immune responses demonstrate a high level of intra-species variation, compensating for the specialization capacity of pathogens. The recent advent of in-depth immune phenotyping projects in large-scale cohorts has allowed a first look into the factors that shape the inter-individual diversity of the human immune system. Genetic approaches have identified genetic diversity as drivers of 20–40% of the variation between the immune systems of individuals. The remaining 60–80% is shaped by intrinsic factors, with age being the predominant factor, as well as by environmental influences, where cohabitation and chronic viral infections were identified as key mediators. We review and integrate the recent in-depth large-scale studies on human immune diversity and its potential impact on health. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

### Development of metastatic HER2 (+) breast cancer is independent of the adaptive immune system [^7c1691b0]. The Journal of Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

The tumour-modulating effects of the endogenous adaptive immune system are rather paradoxical. Whereas some clinical and experimental observations offer compelling evidence for the existence of immunosurveillance, other studies have revealed promoting effects of the adaptive immune system on primary cancer development and metastatic disease. We examined the functional significance of the adaptive immune system as a regulator of spontaneous HER2(+) breast tumourigenesis and pulmonary metastasis formation, using the MMTV-NeuT mouse model in which mammary carcinogenesis is induced by transgenic expression of the activated HER2/neu oncogene. Although T and B lymphocytes infiltrate human and experimental HER2(+) breast tumours, genetic elimination of the adaptive immune system does not affect development of premalignant hyperplasias or primary breast cancers. In addition, we demonstrate that pulmonary metastasis formation in MMTV-NeuT mice is not dependent on the adaptive immune system. Thus, our findings reveal that spontaneous HER2-driven mammary tumourigenesis and metastasis formation are neither suppressed, nor altered by immunosurveillance mechanisms, nor promoted by the adaptive immune system.

### Innate immunity in allergy [^5fefcc21]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Innate immune system quickly responds to invasion of microbes and foreign substances through the extracellular and intracellular sensing receptors, which recognize distinctive molecular and structural patterns. The recognition of innate immune receptors leads to the induction of inflammatory and adaptive immune responses by activating downstream signaling pathways. Allergy is an immune‐related disease and results from a hypersensitive immune response to harmless substances in the environment. However, less is known about the activation of innate immunity during exposure to allergens. New insights into the innate immune system by sensors and their signaling cascades provide us with more important clues and a framework for understanding allergy disorders. In this review, we will focus on recent advances in the innate immune sensing system.

### A toolkit and framework for optimal laboratory evaluation of individuals with suspected primary immunodeficiency [^5a454842]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Knowledge related to the biology of inborn errors of immunity and associated laboratory testing methods continues to expand at a tremendous rate. Despite this, many patients with inborn errors of immunity suffer for prolonged periods of time before identification of their underlying condition, thereby delaying appropriate care. Understanding that test selection and optimal evaluation for patients with recurrent infections or unusual patterns of inflammation can be unclear, we present a document that distills relevant clinical features of immunologic disease due to inborn errors of immunity and related appropriate and available test options. This document is intended to serve the practicing clinical immunologist and, in turn, patients by describing best available test options for initial and expanded immunologic evaluations across the disease spectrum. Our goal is to demystify the process of evaluating patients with suspected immune dysfunction and to enable more rapid and accurate diagnosis of such individuals.

### Rheumatologic and autoimmune manifestations of primary immunodeficiency disorders [^c48c1bdc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although it may seem paradoxical, primary immunodeficiency disorders are frequently complicated by autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. These conditions pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for clinicians caring for these patients. There have been a number of new insights into how immunodeficiencies can predispose to autoimmunity, and rheumatologists should understand the basis for and manifestations of autoimmunity in primary immunodeficiency disorders to more effectively care for these patients.

Recent Findings

A number of mechanisms have recently been found to link primary immunodeficiencies and autoimmunity, including increased homeostatic proliferation in primary immunodeficiencies associated with lymphopenia and defects in regulatory T cells in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Primary immunodeficiencies that affect the innate immune system can also lead to inappropriate inflammation through impairing negative regulatory mechanisms in innate immune cells.

Summary

The realization that primary immunodeficiencies can also impair negative regulation of immune responses has provided a new framework for the understanding of autoimmunity associated with these conditions. These insights may lead to new, more targeted therapies for autoimmune complications in primary immunodeficiency patients.

### Chronological ageing and photoageing of dendritic cells [^6bec89d4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Ageing involves the whole organism, including the immune system. Age-dependent alterations of immune functions are located in both the adaptive and innate parts of the immune system. The most important cell type of the innate immune system are the dendritic cells, because their capacity to induce primary immune responses via professional antigen presentation is crucial for the initiation of the adaptive immune response. Evidence exists that dendritic cells of the systemic immune system, represented by lymph-node and blood-derived dendritic cells, as well as of local immunity, represented by Langerhans cells of the skin, participate in ageing processes. In animal models of older mice, dendritic cells of lymph nodes show degenerative characteristics with decreased adhesion molecule expression, less dendrite formation, and reduced antigen trapping capacity, which together imply disruption of functional activity. In contrast, dendritic cells generated from peripheral blood of elderly people were not impaired in their capacity to induce T-cell responses. Together, these findings indicate that in old individuals in vivo dendritic cells of the systemic immune system are reduced in their functional capacity to stimulate immune responses, whereas in vitro generated dendritic cells are fully functional, and therefore might be used in therapeutic approaches to treat age-associated malfunctions of the immune system. Thus far, only morphological descriptions about age-associated changes of dendritic cells (in particular the Langerhans cells) of the skin exist. In the skin, effects of naturally occurring ageing have to be differentiated from UV-radiation-induced ageing processes. The hallmark of Langerhans cell changes in natural as well as UV-induced skin ageing is their reduction in cell number within the epidermis. In addition, they show an atrophic morphology with less dendrites, and less Birbeck granules. It is assumed that these morphological changes are associated with loss of dendritic cell functions, and that this contributes to age-associated development of skin cancer. Therapeutic strategies against natural and UV-induced skin ageing should include a reduction of these changes of Langerhans cells in order to strengthen the immunological functions of the body's outer surface.

### Human inborn errors of immunity: 2019 update on the classification from the international union of immunological societies expert committee [^f06bfe4b]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

We report the updated classification of Inborn Errors of Immunity/Primary Immunodeficiencies, compiled by the International Union of Immunological Societies Expert Committee. This report documents the key clinical and laboratory features of 430 inborn errors of immunity, including 64 gene defects that have either been discovered in the past 2 years since the previous update (published January 2018) or were characterized earlier but have since been confirmed or expanded upon in subsequent studies. The application of next-generation sequencing continues to expedite the rapid identification of novel gene defects, rare or common; broaden the immunological and clinical phenotypes of conditions arising from known gene defects and even known variants; and implement gene-specific therapies. These advances are contributing to greater understanding of the molecular, cellular, and immunological mechanisms of disease, thereby enhancing immunological knowledge while improving the management of patients and their families. This report serves as a valuable resource for the molecular diagnosis of individuals with heritable immunological disorders and also for the scientific dissection of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying inborn errors of immunity and related human diseases.

### How to investigate a suspected immune deficiency in adults [^886ee3f8]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with immune deficiencies can present with variable clinical phenotypes. This often translates into a significant delay in their diagnosis, and resultant patient morbidity. This review summarises the most common types of immunodeficiency disorders, primary and secondary, along with their key features. It provides a structured approach for the clinician on when to suspect an immunodeficiency, the initial investigations pathway and when a specialist referral should be considered.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^a5180f81]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia — definition and initial management: Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) is characterized by reduced immunoglobulin levels due to a medication or a disease process, leading to decreased antibody production or increased antibody loss, and is distinct from primary hypogammaglobulinemia due to inborn errors of immunity/primary immunodeficiencies, which comprise more than 400 inherited disorders. Of note, the distinction between primary HG and SHG can be challenging to make, and we recommend thorough consideration of both primary and secondary causes when evaluating HG. When iatrogenic causes cannot be removed or underlying conditions cannot be reversed, therapeutic options are not clearly delineated but include heightened monitoring for clinical infections, supportive antimicrobials, and in some cases, immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

### Regulation of the adaptive immune system by innate lymphoid cells [^65fb13c3]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a group of lymphocytes that promote rapid cytokine-dependent innate immunity, inflammation and tissue repair. In addition, a growing body of evidence suggests ILCs can influence adaptive immune cell responses. During fetal development a subset of ILCs orchestrate the generation and maturation of secondary lymphoid tissues. Following birth, ILCs continue to modulate adaptive immune cell responses indirectly through interactions with stromal cells in lymphoid tissues and epithelial cells at barrier surfaces. In this review we summarize the current understanding of how ILCs modulate the magnitude and quality of adaptive immune cell responses, and in particular focus on recent evidence suggesting that ILCs can also directly regulate CD4(+) T cells. Further, we discuss the implications that these pathways may have on human health and disease.

### The burden of COVID-19 in the immunocompromised patient: implications for vaccination and needs for the future [^1544889e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Although individuals with weakened immune systems can be broadly classified as immunocompromised, the disparate immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination and outcomes among this population highlight the overall lack of homogeneity among this group. The underlying medical condition and the use of certain immunosuppressants can substantially affect immune responses to vaccination among immunocompromised individuals. As such, regulatory agencies have recommended extending the primary vaccination series to include 3 doses as well as the administration of additional (booster) doses of COVID-19 vaccines, which have been shown to increase humoral and/or cellular response in certain immunocompromised individuals with initially poor immune responses. Although healthcare professionals and policy-makers have prioritized COVID-19 vaccination with a 3-dose regimen among the immunocompromised population, there is still a need to ensure that these patients remain up-to-date with the recommendations for additional doses, including bivalent vaccines. Moving forward, considerations for the subgroup of immunocompromised populations must remain a priority to protect this group from severe disease.

Knowledge of COVID-19 vaccine–elicited immunogenicity among this population is critical for guiding effective healthcare for these patients. Accordingly, understanding the current challenges and potential limitations of COVID-19 vaccination in this group is essential and can inform not only decisions on additional vaccine doses, but also recommendations for nonpharmaceutical preventive strategies as well as prophylaxis approaches. This also becomes particularly important as variants evolve, making monoclonals and prophylaxis minimally effective. Investing in ways to optimize protection for these individuals can significantly impact the course of this pandemic as prolonged infection can give rise to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with increased potential to escape vaccine- and natural immunity–mediated protection. Furthermore, as COVID-19 potentially transitions from a pandemic to an endemic disease, the establishment of effective healthcare measures remains a public health priority to protect immunocompromised individuals from a persistent infectious threat.

### Practical guidance for the diagnosis and management of secondary hypogammaglobulinemia: a Work group report of the AAAAI primary immunodeficiency and altered immune response committees [^d7d6a5a2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia (SHG) — definition, evaluation, and referral are clarified: "HG by itself is a laboratory definition (with a cutoff that varies with age and between different laboratories) and does not necessarily indicate a clinically symptomatic syndrome". Because "IgG levels alone do not measure B-cell function, and antibody function and vaccine responses need to be evaluated and taken into consideration", "If SHG is uncovered, referral to a clinical immunologist can be considered to aid in these evaluations (Fig 2)".

### Interactions between immune cell types facilitate the evolution of immune traits [^c0606c0b]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

A key precondition for evolution by natural selection is the availability of suitable variation in natural populations. Early studies in evolutionary computation have shown that increased complexity also increases the probability that random mutations produce pleiotropic effects negatively affecting fitness. In other words, complex systems have a greater potential for getting trapped in local fitness optima. Thus, for the Darwinian process of evolution through mutation and selection to work in complex biological systems, these systems need to have evolved evolvability — an architecture such that mutations are likely to result in more adaptive phenotypes.

The immune system is a complex system intimately engaged in maintaining homeostasis and the struggle against pathogens, which makes it a prime target for the process of natural selection. This is evidenced by the fact that genes with immune function are among the fastest-evolving genes in mammalian and avian genomes. In animals, immunity is achieved through an interplay between different types of immune cells –. The immune system of different species, or even that of individuals of the same species, can thus differ not only in individual cell types, but also in the interaction between them –. The relative importance of these two contributions towards the evolvability of the immune system, however, is unclear.

The decisive factor for a system's evolvability is how genotypic variation maps onto phenotypic variation. To address the question of evolvability of immune traits, we focused on the genetic determinants of the relative frequencies of individual immune cell types, also known as immune profiles. We chose this trait because immune profiles are highly variable between individuals, are functionally important in both health and disease –, and are to a large extent determined by genetic factors. At the same time, genetic determinants of immune profile variation remain elusive. Whereas a recent study that included more than half a million participants successfully identified the association of more than a 1,000 genes with the frequencies of five, low-resolution white blood cell types (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils), studies looking at white blood cells with higher resolution, but conducted only on hundreds of individuals, identified only a small number of associated genes –. Approaches combining both higher cellular resolution and necessary sample size have only recently started to emerge, illustrating the need for alternative approaches.

### Primary immunodeficiency diseases: an update on the classification from the international union of immunological societies expert committee for primary immunodeficiency 2015 [^de0b24e0]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Table 9
Phenocopies of PID

The classification this year differs in a number of ways from the previous edition published in 2014. Importantly, each defect is now listed in only one table. The diverse immunological phenotypes of many conditions imply that a very large number of conditions could very readily be listed in multiple tables. However, with the increasing number of identified defects, this would make each table large and cumbersome. For this reason, we chose to list each defect in one table only and to place it according to the most pronounced and fundamental defect. For this reason and as an example, CD40L deficiency is now found in Table 1 amongst combined immunodeficiencies, because CD40L is a T cell signaling molecule whose absence leads to both cellular and humoral defects, even though it was originally described as an antibody deficiency. Although some of our placements may be disputed, the committee came to these decisions after much thought and deliberation.

The title of Table 6 has now been slightly changed to 'Defects in intrinsic and innate immunity' and contains defects characterized by susceptibility to specific organisms. For this reason, the MSMDs (Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease) are now in Table 6, having previously been in Table 5 (Phagocytic Disorders).

In previous editions, we have placed an asterisk against conditions in which 10 or fewer individuals had been described in the literature. However, this is now felt to be an artificial indicator as, once described, a condition may be found in additional patients but not necessarily reported. For this reason, there is no specific indicator of the number of patients identified or reported.

There is a growing appreciation of wide phenotypic variability for many of the individual specific gene defects, reflecting not only the variety of mutations within each gene but also host and/or environmental modifying factors that may impact the phenotype even between individuals with the same mutation within the same gene. The complexities of these conditions in terms of clinical and immunological presentation and heterogeneity cannot easily be captured in the limited space of a table format. For this reason, the furthest right column contains the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) reference for each condition to allow access to a source of greater detail and updated information as to the phenotype.

### Diagnostic interpretation of genetic studies in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases: a working group report of the primary immunodeficiency diseases committee of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma&Immunology [^6bc0883d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency diseases — functional validation and laboratory considerations — note that when possible, functional studies should be performed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified clinical laboratories so results can be used in medical decision making, yet clinical laboratories are insufficiently equipped to evaluate all candidate variants and many cases require detailed mechanistic studies available only in research laboratories; functional methods include flow cytometry and a diverse range of techniques, and given unpredictability an "unbiased functional analysis" has been proposed alongside genetic approaches.

### Trauma: the role of the innate immune system [^e7b859b8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Immune dysfunction can provoke (multiple) organ failure in severely injured patients. This dysfunction manifests in two forms, which follow a biphasic pattern. During the first phase, in addition to the injury by trauma, organ damage is caused by the immune system during a systemic inflammatory response. During the second phase the patient is more susceptible for sepsis due to host defence failure (immune paralysis). The pathophysiological model outlined in this review encompasses etiological factors and the contribution of the innate immune system in the end organ damage. The etiological factors can be divided into intrinsic (genetic predisposition and physiological status) and extrinsic components (type of injury or "traumaload" and surgery or "intervention load"). Of all the factors, the intervention load is the only one which, can be altered by the attending emergency physician. Adjustment of the therapeutic approach and choice of the most appropriate treatment strategy can minimize the damage caused by the immune response and prevent the development of immunological paralysis. This review provides a pathophysiological basis for the damage control concept, in which a staged approach of surgery and post-traumatic immunomonitoring have become important aspects of the treatment protocol. The innate immune system is the main objective of immunomonitoring as it has the most prominent role in organ failure after trauma. Polymorphonuclear phagocytes and monocytes are the main effector-cells of the innate immune system in the processes that lead to organ failure. These cells are controlled by cytokines, chemokines, complement factors and specific tissue signals. The contribution of tissue barrier integrity and its interaction with the innate immune system is further evaluated.

### Immunology of COVID-19: current state of the science [^cf765eca]. Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide, igniting an unprecedented effort from the scientific community to understand the biological underpinning of COVID19 pathophysiology. In this Review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of innate and adaptive immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the immunological pathways that likely contribute to disease severity and death. We also discuss the rationale and clinical outcome of current therapeutic strategies as well as prospective clinical trials to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
