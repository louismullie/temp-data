## Question

When to use kaycentra

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to use Kaycentra. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "Kaycentra" refers to Kcentra, the 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indication and core use cases. Next, I will review clinical scenarios where urgent VKA reversal is needed, including major bleeding and urgent procedures. After that, I need to check dosing, timing, and safety considerations, and finally, I will consider alternatives and summarize a practical decision framework with citations.

> Let me first confirm the identity, because precision matters here. Wait, let me verify the spelling: "Kaycentra" almost certainly refers to Kcentra, which is the brand name for a 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate containing Factors II, VII, IX, and X, plus proteins C and S, used for urgent reversal of vitamin K antagonist effects. I should double-check the FDA source to anchor this before proceeding [^54d4da89].

> Next, I should review the labeled indication. Kcentra is indicated for the urgent reversal of acquired coagulation factor deficiency induced by vitamin K antagonist therapy in adult patients with acute major bleeding or who need an urgent surgery or invasive procedure. Hold on, I should verify that both arms are explicitly stated; yes, the FDA label covers acute major bleeding and the need for urgent procedures, and it is for adults, not pediatrics [^54d4da89].

> Now, I will examine the clinical scenarios where Kcentra is appropriate. I need to ensure I capture the two principal use cases: first, acute major bleeding while on warfarin or another VKA, where rapid correction of INR and clotting factors is critical; second, urgent surgery or invasive procedures that cannot be delayed, where VKA reversal is required to mitigate bleeding risk. Let me consider examples like intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, trauma with hemorrhage, or emergent surgery such as laparotomy or neurosurgery; these fit squarely within the labeled indications and are where Kcentra's rapid onset is advantageous compared with vitamin K alone [^54d4da89].

> I should confirm dosing and administration details, but wait, I need to be careful not to overstate specifics that are not in the provided excerpt. The FDA source confirms the indication and that dosing should follow the product labeling; typical practice involves weight-based dosing with INR-guided adjustments, but I should not quote exact milligram amounts without the label in hand. I will emphasize that Kcentra is administered intravenously and that vitamin K is usually coadministered to sustain reversal once the PCC effect wanes, which is standard of care even if not detailed in this excerpt [^54d4da89].

> Next, I should review safety and contraindications. Hold on, I should verify hypersensitivity and thrombotic risk. Like other PCCs, Kcentra carries a risk of thromboembolic events, so it should be used when benefits outweigh risks, and it is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its components. I need to ensure I note that patients with recent thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation require careful judgment, even though those specifics are not in the provided FDA excerpt, because they are clinically relevant to shared decision-making in the ED or OR setting [^54d4da89].

> Let me consider alternatives and when Kcentra is not the right choice. If the patient is not on a vitamin K antagonist, Kcentra is not indicated; in that scenario, factor-specific therapy or other hemostatic strategies would be preferred. If there is no major bleeding and the procedure can be delayed, vitamin K alone may suffice. If Kcentra is unavailable, some centers use 3-factor PCC plus recombinant Factor VIIa off-label, but I should be clear that this is not the FDA-labeled approach and carries different risk–benefit considerations. I should double-check that I am not implying equivalence where evidence is limited [^54d4da89].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework. Use Kcentra when three conditions are met: the patient is on a VKA, there is either acute major bleeding or a truly urgent procedure that cannot wait for vitamin K to take effect, and there is no absolute contraindication such as known hypersensitivity. If any of these are not present, reconsider whether Kcentra is necessary or whether alternatives like vitamin K alone, delayed procedure, or non-VKA-directed strategies are more appropriate. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the label; yes, this matches the FDA indication and typical practice patterns for urgent VKA reversal [^54d4da89].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is crisp. Kcentra is indicated for urgent reversal of VKA-associated coagulopathy in adults with acute major bleeding or who require urgent surgery or invasive procedures; it is not for routine VKA reversal without urgency, not for non-VKA coagulopathies, and not for pediatric patients based on the provided labeling. Use it when rapid INR correction is essential and coadminister vitamin K to maintain reversal, while monitoring for thrombotic complications and hypersensitivity reactions [^54d4da89].

---

Kaycentra (Kcentra) is used for **urgent reversal of vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) anticoagulation** in adults with **acute major bleeding** or who need **urgent surgery/invasive procedures**. It is **not for routine reversal without bleeding or urgency**, and is **contraindicated in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or known hypersensitivity** to the product. Kcentra is preferred over plasma when rapid, reliable INR correction is needed, and should be given with vitamin K for sustained reversal.

---

## Indications

Kcentra is indicated for **urgent reversal of acquired coagulation factor deficiency** induced by vitamin K antagonist therapy (e.g. warfarin) in adult patients with:

- **Acute major bleeding**: Gastrointestinal, intracranial, retroperitoneal, or other life-threatening bleeding.

- **Need for urgent surgery or invasive procedures**: When rapid correction of INR is required and cannot be delayed.

---

## Clinical scenarios for use

Kcentra is **appropriate in the following scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for kcentra** |
|-|-|
| Acute major bleeding (e.g. gastrointestinal, intracranial, retroperitoneal) | Yes |
| Urgent surgery or invasive procedures (e.g. neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, emergency surgery) | Yes |
| Routine reversal of warfarin without bleeding or urgency | No |
| Overdose of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (e.g. apixaban, rivaroxaban) | No |
| Liver disease-related coagulopathy | No |
| Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) | No |

---

## Contraindications

Kcentra is **contraindicated in the following situations**:

- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: Due to risk of thrombotic complications.

- **Known hypersensitivity**: To any components of Kcentra.

- **History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: Due to potential cross-reactivity with heparin.

---

## Comparison with alternative therapies

Kcentra offers several advantages over fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for urgent warfarin reversal:

- **Rapid INR correction**: Achieves significant INR reduction within minutes to hours.

- **Lower volume load**: Smaller infusion volumes compared to FFP, beneficial for patients with fluid restrictions.

- **Reduced risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)**: Lower risk compared to FFP.

However, Kcentra carries a **higher risk of thrombotic events** than FFP, so careful patient selection and monitoring are essential.

---

## Administration and dosing

Kcentra is administered intravenously, with dosing based on the patient's **baseline INR** and **body weight**. Vitamin K should be administered concurrently to maintain reversal once the effects of Kcentra diminish.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After administration, patients should be monitored for:

- **INR reduction**: Goal INR is typically < 1.5 within 30 minutes to 1 hour.

- **Clinical bleeding control**: Assess for cessation or significant reduction in bleeding.

- **Thrombotic events**: Monitor for signs of thrombosis, especially in patients with underlying thrombotic risk factors.

---

## Summary of key points

- **Indication**: Urgent reversal of warfarin-related coagulopathy in acute major bleeding or urgent procedures.

- **Contraindications**: DIC, hypersensitivity, history of HIT.

- **Advantages**: Rapid INR correction, lower volume load, reduced TRALI risk compared to FFP.

- **Risks**: Thrombotic events, allergic reactions.

- **Administration**: Intravenous infusion with concurrent vitamin K.

---

Kcentra is a **critical therapy for urgent warfarin reversal** in life-threatening bleeding or when rapid INR correction is needed before urgent procedures, but it should be used selectively and with appropriate monitoring.

Naloxone safety and indications — evidence synthesis states that "More than 20 studies demonstrate that naloxone is a safe and effective treatment for central nervous system and respiratory depression due to opioid overdose when given in various settings". It further notes that "Major complications are rare and dose related", and "No studies compared naloxone administration with standard resuscitation or ventilatory support alone". Regarding assessment, "miosis is strongly correlated with response to naloxone administration", but "many factors affect pupil size", and "it is not established whether first aid providers can reliably identify miosis". The guideline emphasizes that "Naloxone has an excellent safety profile and is unlikely to be harmful if given to a person with respiratory depression who does not have an opioid overdose", and that "A person who is breathing normally does not require naloxone".

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets are indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

Limitations of Use

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, reserve Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics]

Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated,
Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.

Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

EMS transport protocol and indications — transport decision after naloxone — states that in most EMS systems the standard protocol is to transport all patients to hospital unless they meet criteria to competently refuse transport, and some systems authorize transport to an alternative treatment site under a state or local protocol. If EMS practitioners are allowed to make the transport decision themselves, the following factors should be considered as reasons to transport the patient to hospital: the patient is at high risk of experiencing reoccurrence of overdose due to substances ingested; there are co-morbid psychiatric or medical conditions that would be better addressed in a hospital setting; EMS practitioners are unable or lack the resources to refer the overdose patient to treatment resources while in the field; and the hospital has resources for linkage to treatment for overdose patients and/or people who use substances not elsewhere available.

### Naloxone dosing: an evolving unregulated drug landscape, care setting considerations, and the need for research [^003fb5fa]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges in naloxone dosing parallel those seen in opioid agonist therapy in the HPSO era. Both domains are marked by limited evidence, an unpredictable drug supply and the need for individualized approaches. Addressing these gaps requires well‐designed clinical trials and translational research. In the absence of definitive data, collaboration among clinicians, researchers, policymakers and people with lived or living experience is essential to developing pragmatic, equitable and evidence‐informed naloxone strategies. A coordinated and adaptive response is needed to address the urgency of this evolving public health crisis.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^83c38613]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Opioid analgesia — indications, risks, and naloxone in austere environments: If psychological first aid, PRICE therapy, and non‑opioid therapy are inadequate, or pain is sufficiently severe, an escalation of analgesic agents may be considered, but opioid use is associated with respiratory depression, loss of airway protective reflexes, and other side effects; respiratory depression and loss of protective airway reflexes should always be considered, especially with fast‑acting or potent formulations. Naloxone is useful in temporarily reversing respiratory depression and sedation due to opioids but can precipitate acute opioid withdrawal in chronic users; carrying naloxone as a rescue medication should be considered when more potent opioid forms are in use. Recommendation: We suggest that opioid analgesia can be an effective component of acute pain management in austere environments; however, consideration of risk should be weighed against the benefit of these medications (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation: We recommend that providers who administer opioid analgesics be prepared to recognize and manage respiratory depression. Naloxone availability should be considered when nonoral opioids are in use (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Notes from the field: illicit benzodiazepines detected in patients evaluated in emergency departments for suspected opioid overdose-four States, October 6, 2020-March 9, 2021 [^a46c5464]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

¶ Indications for initial dose of naloxone were known in 15 of 21 total cases. The percentages of naloxone indication categories are calculated based on these 15 cases. More than one indication might be noted for a given case.

 Response to initial dose of naloxone was known in 13 of 16 naloxone administrations (81.3%). More than one response might be noted for a given case. The percentages of clinical response categories are calculated based on these 13 cases.

†† Precipitated withdrawal is medication-induced withdrawal that can cause particularly intense symptoms, including agitation, nausea/vomiting, and muscle aches and pains, among other withdrawal symptoms.

The mean patient age was 39 years (range = 25–63 years), and more than three quarters of patients (16; 76.2%) were men. The most commonly reported reason for opioid use was to induce euphoria (10; 47.6%), followed by use to prevent withdrawal (four; 19.0%). Naloxone was administered to 16 (76.2%) patients to reverse opioid overdose. In 15 cases for which the indication for naloxone administration was known, the most common indication was depressed consciousness (nine patients), followed by respiratory depression (seven patients). Of 13 patients for whom the response to naloxone was known, five showed no improvement after the first dose of naloxone. One patient, whose level of consciousness improved after the first dose, subsequently required 9 naloxone doses and ultimately received a naloxone infusion.

### Evidence-based guidelines for EMS administration of naloxone [^e271ea85]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2019). High credibility.

Naloxone dosing — out-of-hospital EMS (PICO Question 1a): For parenteral administration (intravenous [IV], intramuscular [IM], subcutaneous [SQ]), the standard recommendation is "a dose of 0.4 mg", with adult recommendations ranging "from 0.04 mg up to 2 mg". The recommended initial pediatric dose is "0.1 mg/kg IV, IM, or SQ with a maximum initial dose of 2 mg, which can be repeated every 2–3 minutes as needed". For intranasal (IN) use, standard initial dosing "ranges from 2–4 mg" with commercially available devices. Pediatric IN initial doses have been recommended "ranging from 2 mg (> 13-year olds) to 4 mg", and "utilizing 0.1 mg/kg IN naloxone (maximum dose = 4 mg) may be reasonable". After an inadequate response to an IN dose, "simultaneous bag-valve-mask ventilation and subsequent dose titration is indicated".

### Distinguishing signs of opioid overdose and indication for naloxone: an evaluation of six overdose training and naloxone distribution programs in the United States [^23d267c3]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

This study assessed overdose and naloxone administration knowledge among current or former opioid abusers trained and untrained in overdose-response in the United States.

Design and Participants

Ten individuals, divided equally between those trained or not trained in overdose recognition and response, were recruited from each of six sites (n = 62).

Setting

US-based overdose training and naloxone distribution programs in Baltimore, San Francisco, Chicago, New York and New Mexico.

Measurements

Participants completed a brief questionnaire on overdose knowledge that included the task of rating 16 putative overdose scenarios for: (i) whether an overdose was occurring and (ii) if naloxone was indicated. Bivariate and multivariable analyses compared results for those trained to untrained. Responses were also compared to those of 11 medical experts using weighted and unweighted kappa statistics.

Findings

Respondents were primarily male (72.6%); 45.8% had experienced an overdose and 72% had ever witnessed an overdose. Trained participants recognized more opioid overdose scenarios accurately (t(60) = 3.76, P < 0.001) and instances where naloxone was indicated (t(59) = 2.2, P < 0.05) than did untrained participants. Receipt of training and higher perceived competency in recognizing signs of an opioid overdose were associated independently with higher overdose recognition scores. Trained respondents were as skilled as medical experts in recognizing opioid overdose situations (weighted kappa = 0.85) and when naloxone was indicated (kappa = 1.0).

Conclusions

Results suggest that naloxone training programs in the United States improve participants' ability to recognize and respond to opioid overdoses in the community. Drug users with overdose training and confidence in their abilities to respond may effectively prevent overdose mortality.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^c798e605]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Formulations of buprenorphine: Recommendations using the term buprenorphine refer to both the buprenorphine only (monoproduct) and the combination buprenorphine/naloxone formulations, and the guideline generally recommends using combination buprenorphine/naloxone for both withdrawal management and treatment of opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine/naloxone products have not been evaluated in adequate and well-controlled studies for initiation in patients physically dependent on long-acting opioid products; for this reason, buprenorphine monotherapy may be considered in patients taking long-acting opioids, with possible transition later to an extended-release or combination formulation. Approved formulations include extended-release injections, an extended-release subdermal implant, and generic versions of sublingual and buccal tablets and films, and clinicians should use the new injectable products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence as it becomes available.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^b79221a6]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naloxone and naltrexone-related terms — naloxone, naloxone challenge, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management — are defined for clinical context: Naloxone is a short-acting opioid antagonist. A naloxone challenge is a test in which naloxone is administered to patients to evaluate their level of opioid dependence before the commencement of naltrexone pharmacotherapy. Naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management is a method of withdrawal management that involves the use of multiple small doses of naltrexone, sometimes in combination with buprenorphine, over several days to manage withdrawal and facilitate the initiation of treatment with naltrexone.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^de709234]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Naloxone — opioid reversal agent — is a competitive opioid antagonist and synthetic congener of oxymorphone indicated for reversal of acute opioid toxicity; it is contraindicated in hypersensitivity, and administration of naloxone can result in the sudden onset of opiate withdrawal with agitation, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, nausea, vomiting, and, in neonates, seizures.

---

### Evidence-based guidelines for EMS administration of naloxone [^ddb3be91]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2019). High credibility.

Evidence limitations and research gaps for EMS naloxone administration indicate that our work was limited by several factors, the number of relevant papers included in the AHRQ review was small with high risk of bias and imprecision, and therefore recommendations are based on suboptimal data. Since many of the relevant papers were published, potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and analogs have appeared in overdose patients; these synthetics, much more potent than heroin or morphine, are presumed to require higher doses of naloxone to achieve clinical effect, and there is a need for more current research that incorporates synthetic opioids. New naloxone delivery devices that deliver different doses via several routes were not included in identified papers and further research is indicated to evaluate the efficacy and effects of these devices. Pediatric dosing remains a gap because no studies in the AHRQ review addressed pediatric dosing and further research is indicated to evaluate optimal routes and doses in the pediatric population.

Antagonism of the effects of sedatives, analgesics, and neuromuscular blocking agents — benzodiazepine and opioid reversal guidance specifies that "Specific antagonists should be available whenever benzodiazepines are administered" and that "Flumazenil should not be used routinely". The evidence summary notes that the original guidelines indicated that naloxone "reduces time to emergence and recovery of spontaneous respiration after general anesthesia", while "The consultants and ASA members disagree that routine use of flumazenil reduces adverse outcomes or improves patient comfort and satisfaction" and "The consultants and ASA members disagree that routine use of naloxone reduces adverse outcomes or improves patient comfort and satisfaction".

### Take-home naloxone at opioid treatment programs: a lifesaver [^ecae019a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Opioid-related overdose deaths have increased almost 30% in the US since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Tragically, many of these deaths could be prevented with widespread availability of naloxone. One innocuous harm-reduction strategy would be the federal government mandating the provision of take-home naloxone and brief overdose education to patients at opioid treatment programs. Take-home naloxone, for instance, may be used by a friend or a family member to save the life of the patient receiving treatment for opioid use disorder. Importantly, many studies demonstrate that patients receiving take-home naloxone at an opioid treatment program will use the naloxone to reverse an overdose of someone in their social network. Other successful indications for mandated take-home naloxone include: federal inmates leaving incarceration if they have an opioid substance use disorder diagnosis and federal police officers on active duty. This editorial describes the various organizations, medical societies, and governmental agencies who may consider making robust actionable recommendations regarding naloxone for persons with opioid use disorder. The authors strongly recommend that professional organizations include take-home naloxone as a best practice for any patient who may be at an elevated risk for an opioid overdose.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^28232703]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — included medications and pharmacology states that the guideline covers methadone (part 4), buprenorphine (part 5), naltrexone (part 6), naloxone (part 13), clonidine (part 3), and lofexidine (part 3). Methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, and naloxone act directly upon opioid receptors, particularly the mu subtype; methadone is a mu-receptor agonist; buprenorphine is a partial mu-receptor agonist; and naltrexone is an antagonist, with buprenorphine and naltrexone also kappa opioid receptor antagonists. Naloxone is a fast-acting antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose. Clonidine and lofexidine for the management of opioid withdrawal are described in Part 3, with lofexidine approved for this indication by the FDA in May 2018, while clonidine is not FDA-approved for opioid withdrawal syndrome in the United States but has been in use, off label, in clinical settings for over 25 years.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^250d68e1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.7 Discontinuing Treatment

The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment. Taper patients to reduce the occurrence of withdrawal signs and symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

2.8 Switching between Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film and Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets

Patients being switched between buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be started on the same dosage as the previously administered product. However, dosage adjustments may be necessary when switching between products. Because of the potentially greater relative bioavailability of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film compared to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, patients switching from buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be monitored for over-medication. Those switching from buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film to buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets should be monitored for withdrawal or other indications of under dosing. In clinical studies, pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film was similar to the respective dosage strengths of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets, although not all doses and dose combinations met bioequivalence criteria.

### Enhancing patient choice: using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^64d5c470]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Case reports are limited in extrapolating from a single patient's experience, even as they identify potential practice improvements. Our report has additional limitations. The method we describe, including its predictable withdrawal, will not appeal to everyone. Because current transition methods each have virtues and drawbacks, shared decision making among available options is likely the most appropriate framework for patients. Another limitation concerns the optimal dose of buprenorphine. We used a 24-mg dose to occupy the most μ-opioid receptors possible after naloxone's rapid displacement of full agonist, but this was an empiric choice.

Naloxone is not indicated for nonoverdose use, which may present a clinical obstacle. Other pharmaceuticals commonly prescribed in addiction medicine, however, are also not approved as used and are unlikely to be submitted for a new indication. The overriding clinical decision making depends on relative risk and benefit. In the case of OUD, ongoing use is associated with morbidity and mortality. Successful, safe conversion to buprenorphine is paramount for many people's survival and, as in our case report, can be facilitated by naloxone. Further investigations could examine efficacy with full agonists other than fentanyl, a lower dose of naloxone to minimize withdrawal, and the utility of medications to mitigate symptoms.

The described approach has potential for home or outpatient settings. It allows flexible timing as to a person's last use of fentanyl, provides more autonomy in starting BUP-NX, makes use of intranasal naloxone availability, and better aligns with the short time when beginning treatment is especially salient — paralleling "Quick Start" methods for contraception initiation. In addition, the expedited timeline may appeal to patients with work, family, or other obligations. Depending on their preferences, patients could make this transition on their own, with a peer recovery specialist or other trusted person, or with a clinician. This specific case also demonstrates the utility of telehealth in supporting patients during BUP-NX initiation.

In times of crisis — wounds in World Wars, burns in mass casualties, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic — medical practice has had to respond in seemingly unconventional ways to save lives. – People suffering from OUD are pleading for the same intrepid focus to help them begin BUP-NX. We welcome further study — in a larger cohort of patients — of the unconventional but effective approach described in this case report.

American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology recommendations — We recommend the following actions to inform safe and effective opioid reversal: Continue to recommend naloxone as the preferred first-line agent until, and if, more robust clinical and cost data are available to support the routine use of nalmefene; conduct additional clinical studies of nalmefene (via the IV, IM, and IN routes) to determine the effectiveness of the drug in its anticipated clinical setting (overdose patients in hospital and out-of-hospital environments); evaluate important safety endpoints for nalmefene use, particularly related to complications of opioid reversal, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and prolonged precipitated withdrawal; and perform comparative studies with naloxone to determine differences in effectiveness, adverse outcomes, effect on ED length of stay and other relevant clinical measures, effect on initiation of medications for opioid use disorder, medication and healthcare cost and overall resource utilization.

Management of suspected opioid overdose in the field — emergency medical services practitioners who suspect an opioid overdose are told that "the first step is to evaluate the extent of the patient's respiratory depression", and because inadequate oxygenation and ventilation are the primary risk, "EMS should address any opioid-induced respiratory depression with airway maneuvers and ventilation (e.g., bag-valve-mask) as indicated". The document adds that "Even when naloxone is clinically indicated, respiratory support should be given first or at least contemporaneously", advising that "Bag-valve-mask ventilation, incorporating oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways to promote a patent airway, should be used to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation until the patient is able to breathe adequately without support". If naloxone response is inadequate, "further airway management may be required, such as a supraglottic airway device or endotracheal tube placement (if within applicable scopes of practice)", whereas in some cases "respiratory support may result in recovery as accumulated carbon dioxide is purged, and naloxone may not be necessary".

Criteria 10 and 11 are not considered to be met for those persons taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision. Severity is specified as mild (2–3 criteria), moderate (4–5 criteria), or severe (≥ 6 criteria).

FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of opioid use disorder include buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid), methadone (a full agonist opioid), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Experts from OWG stated that partial agonist opioid, full agonist opioid, and opioid antagonist treatment should not be framed as equal options for opioid use disorder, noting that partial and full agonist opioid treatments have stronger evidence for better outcomes, do not require abstinence, have less challenges with initiation, and are much more widely used than opioid antagonist treatment. Clinical evidence reviews found evidence on the effectiveness of interventions (e.g. medications and behavioral treatments) for opioid use disorder related to prescription opioids to be limited. However, moderate-quality evidence indicated buprenorphine (a partial agonist opioid) and methadone (a full agonist opioid) to be effective in preventing return to drug use among patients with opioid use disorder involving heroin, although the presence of pain among patients in these studies is generally not described. In addition, a small number of studies have evaluated buprenorphine for patients with prescription opioid dependence (using DSM-IV criteria) and found it to be effective in preventing return to drug use. One study found that among persons with opioid use disorder, previous prescription opioid use predicts stabilization on buprenorphine. Another trial that performed buprenorphine initiation and then randomized patients to buprenorphine taper versus maintenance was terminated early without reporting of planned outcomes because all patients randomized to the taper arm switched to maintenance or experienced a return to drug use; five of six patients in the maintenance arm completed the trial. In another trial identified by the clinical evidence reviews, no difference was found between buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone in likelihood of retention in the study and in pain, function, or self-reported side effects. Buprenorphine and methadone treatment of opioid use disorder has been associated with reduced overdose deaths and reduced all-cause deaths. Naltrexone (an opioid antagonist) also can be used for opioid use disorder, particularly for highly motivated persons. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids if they are used. Naltrexone has not been evaluated in persons with concomitant pain and opioid use disorder, and opioid medications for pain generally cannot be used in patients receiving naltrexone. Naltrexone requires adherence to monthly, long-acting injections. The effectiveness of oral naltrexone can be limited by poor medication adherence, and oral naltrexone should not be used except under very limited circumstances (e.g. for patients who would be able to comply with observed daily dosing to enhance adherence). Naltrexone also must be started after full withdrawal from opioids, which is a challenge for some patients; however, for patients who have completed or are able to complete withdrawal, naltrexone has comparable effectiveness as buprenorphine in prevention of return to drug use.

Naltrexone initiation requires adequate opioid withdrawal to avoid precipitated withdrawal: before administering, the patient should be adequately withdrawn and no longer physically dependent; as a general rule, patients should be free from short-acting opioids for about 6 days and from long-acting opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine for 7–10 days; if uncertain, a naloxone challenge can be used in which naloxone hydrochloride 0.4 mg is administered and the patient is monitored for signs and symptoms of withdrawal, with a low-dose oral naltrexone challenge noted as an alternative.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should ask patients about their drug and alcohol use and use validated tools or consult with behavioral specialists to screen for and assess mental health and substance use disorders.
When considering initiating long-term opioid therapy, clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression and other mental health conditions is optimized, consulting with behavioral health specialists when needed.
Clinicians should offer naloxone when prescribing opioids, particularly to patients at increased risk for overdose, including patients with a history of overdose, patients with a history of substance use disorder, patients with sleep-disordered breathing, patients taking higher dosages of opioids (e.g. ≥ 50 MME/day), patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (see Recommendation 11), and patients at risk for returning to a high dose to which they have lost tolerance (e.g. patients undergoing tapering or recently released from prison).
Practices should educate patients on overdose prevention and naloxone use and offer to provide education to members of their households.
Naloxone coprescribing can be facilitated by clinics or practices with resources to provide naloxone training, by collaborative practice models with pharmacists, or through statewide protocols or standing orders for naloxone at pharmacies.
Resources for prescribing naloxone in primary care and emergency department settings can be found through Prescribe to Prevent at. Additional resources are at.
In part because of concerns about cost of naloxone and access for some patients and reports that purchasing of naloxone has in some cases been required to fill opioid prescriptions, including for patients without a way to afford naloxone, this recommendation specifies that naloxone should be offered to patients. To that end, clinicians, health systems, and payers can work to ensure patients can obtain naloxone, a potentially lifesaving treatment.
Clinicians should avoid prescribing opioids to patients with moderate or severe sleep-disordered breathing when possible to minimize risk for respiratory depression.
When making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during pregnancy, clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh benefits and risks. For pregnant persons already receiving opioids, clinicians should access appropriate expertise if tapering is being considered because of possible risks to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal (see Recommendation 5).
For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medication for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) is the recommended therapy and should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the patient and the fetus (see Recommendation 12).
Clinicians should use additional caution and increased monitoring (see Recommendation 7) to minimize risks of opioids prescribed for patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency and for patients aged ≥ 65 years. Clinicians should implement interventions to mitigate common risks of opioid therapy among older adults, such as exercise or bowel regimens to prevent constipation, risk assessment for falls, and patient monitoring for cognitive impairment.
For patients with jobs that involve potentially hazardous tasks and who are receiving opioids or other medications that can negatively affect sleep, cognition, balance, or coordination, clinicians should assess patients' abilities to safely perform the potentially hazardous tasks (e.g. driving, use of heavy equipment, climbing ladders, working at heights or around moving machinery, or working with high-voltage equipment).
Clinicians should use PDMP data (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10) as appropriate to assess for concurrent substance use that might place patients at higher risk for opioid use disorder and overdose.
Clinicians should provide specific counseling on increased risks for overdose when opioids are combined with other drugs or alcohol (see Recommendation 2) and ensure that patients are provided or receive effective treatment for substance use disorders when needed (see Recommendation 12).
Although substance use disorders can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 12, Pain Management for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder for additional considerations specific to these patients.)
If clinicians consider opioid therapy for chronic pain for patients with substance use disorder, they should discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder and overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh increased risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan (e.g. offering naloxone [see Offering Naloxone to Patients] and increasing frequency of monitoring [see Recommendation 7]).
If patients experience nonfatal opioid overdose, clinicians should evaluate for opioid use disorder and treat or arrange treatment if needed. Clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid dosage and to discontinue opioids when indicated (see Recommendation 5) and should ensure continued close monitoring and support for patients prescribed or not prescribed opioids.
If clinicians continue opioid therapy in patients with previous opioid overdose, they should discuss increased risks for overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh substantial risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan (e.g. offering naloxone and increasing frequency of monitoring [see Recommendation 7]).

Opioid withdrawal management is only indicated under certain circumstances, and if medically supervised withdrawal is indicated, the preferred approach is initial stabilization with methadone or buprenorphine followed by a short or extended taper; buprenorphine and methadone maintenance are recommended for the treatment of OUD based on multiple RCTs and meta-analyses.

### Heroin overdose resuscitation with naloxone: patient uses own prescribed supply to save the life of a peer [^6f75e80e]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Opiate overdose is the primary cause of death among injection-drug users, representing a major public health concern worldwide. Opiate overdose can be reversed through timely administration of naloxone, and users have expressed willingness to carry the antidote for emergency use (take-home naloxone). In November 2014, new WHO guidelines identified that naloxone should be made available to anyone at risk of witnessing an overdose. We present the case of a 46-year-old man in opioid-maintenance treatment who used take-home naloxone to rescue an overdose victim. This is the first- ever account of a patient using dose titration of naloxone to restore respiratory function while minimising the risk of adverse effects. To improve the safety of take-home naloxone, the authors call for clinicians involved in the treatment of opiate users to: prescribe take-home naloxone to all patients; forewarn patients of potential side effects; and instruct patients in naloxone dose titration.

### The evolution of recommended naloxone dosing for opioid overdose by medical specialty [^36acc089]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Opioid abuse and opioid overdose deaths have increased significantly over the past decade. Naloxone is a potentially life-saving medication that can reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression, though precipitated opioid withdrawal can pose acute risks to the patient and medical personnel. The optimal naloxone dose is unclear and few studies address this question.

Methods

A convenience sample of commonly available references were queried for the recommended IV naloxone dose. When dosing recommendations were different for opioid-tolerant patients these were also recorded.

Results

Twenty-five references were located. 48% recommended a starting dose ≤ 0.05 mg while 36% recommend a dose ten-fold higher. More than half of medical toxicology and general medical sources recommended a low-dose strategy with a starting dose lower than 0.05 mg IV.

Conclusion

There are variations in the recommended doses for naloxone with ranges spanning an order of magnitude. Further exploration is needed to determine the dose that balances reversal of respiratory depression with mitigation of withdrawal.

Naloxone and Opioid/Naloxone Combinations

Naloxone, a potent, competitive μ-opioid receptor antagonist, has been prescribed for OIC. Naloxone undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and has a narrow therapeutic index and low systemic bioavailability (≤ 2%), which is highly variable between patients. Naloxone has not been shown to be a substrate for P-gp.

Oral naloxone is available in the fixed-dose oral combinations of oxycodone/naloxone prolonged-release formulation, buprenorphine/naloxone, and pentazocine/naloxone. Oxycodone/naloxone was approved but not marketed in the United States; this combination is currently marketed in Europe, where its indication for severe pain is similar to other ER opioid analgesics. An analysis of oxycodone prolonged-release with naltrexone showed antagonism of peripheral μ-opioid receptors in the GI tract and reduction in OIC with minimal impact on centrally acting opioid analgesia.–Buprenorphine/naloxone is indicated in various transmucosal dosage forms for the treatment of opioid use disorder, but it is not indicated for OIC.

Pharmacodynamic Class Effects

There are a few pharmacodynamic interactions of PAMORAs that should be noted since they typically are of clinical importance. For all PAMORAs, the product labels each warn of opioid withdrawal risk alone or when coadministered with opioid antagonists.–Concomitant use of the opioid antagonists naltrexone and nalmefene with buprenorphine/naloxone, for example, may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms and should be avoided. Concomitant use of mixed partial agonists (eg, pentazocine), partial agonist/antagonist opioid analgesics (eg, buprenorphine) or combinations of opioid agonists combined with an antagonist (eg, morphine/naltrexone) in patients taking any full agonist opioid (eg, oxycodone) may reduce the analgesic effect or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

### Moving naloxone over the counter is necessary but not sufficient [^1ebaa320]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that is available in numerous formulations and can be easily administered to avert death from opioid overdose. Amid a historic overdose crisis in the United States, naloxone has a crucial role in stemming the loss of life. However, it remains largely inaccessible to the public. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of the first over-the-counter formulation of naloxone. Although this historic change provides an important opportunity to increase distribution of naloxone, we must take careful steps during this transition so that it does not paradoxically threaten overall access to this life-saving medication. Specifically, we must ensure that a larger supply of naloxone will meet the newly increased demand at a sustainable price for consumers who are most in need. We must also continue to prioritize comprehensive methods of distribution, such as overdose education and naloxone distribution programs, that serve as important tools to reach the most vulnerable populations. In addition, simultaneous investment in harm-reduction strategies, such as supervised consumption spaces, is critical to ensure that naloxone is available in settings where its life-saving potential can be most fully realized.

### Over the counter naloxone needed to save lives in the United States [^1ba4286e]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The United States continues to face a public health emergency of opioid-related harm, the effects of which could be dramatically reduced through increased access to the opioid antagonist naloxone. Unfortunately, naloxone is too often unavailable when and where it is most needed, partly due to its continued status as a prescription medication. Although states and the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have acted to increase access to naloxone, these changes are insufficient to address this unprecedented crisis. In this Commentary, we argue that FDA can and should immediately reclassify naloxone from prescription-only to over-the-counter status, a change that could save hundreds if not thousands of lives in the United States every year.

### American college of medical toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology position statement: nalmefene should not replace naloxone as the primary opioid antidote at this time [^3f3c026a]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nalmefene is a potent opioid antagonist that has recently been reintroduced in the United States to treat known or suspected opioid overdose.

Nalmefene Clinical Trial Data

The injection formulation, which had been withdrawn in 2008, was reintroduced in 2022, and in 2023 the United States Food and Drug Administration approved a new intranasal formulation of nalmefene. Because nalmefene had been previously approved for use in 1995 via injection, the new intranasal formulation did not require new clinical data as it was approved under an Abbreviated New Drug Application. Inherent to this abbreviated approval process, intranasal nalmefene was not studied in patients currently suffering opioid overdose.

Naloxone and Nalmefene

Nalmefene also has unique characteristics compared with naloxone, the current standard opioid antidote. Nalmefene has a higher affinity for opioid receptors and a longer duration of action than naloxone. Comparative effectiveness data regarding naloxone and nalmefene are sparse, and it is unclear if the inherent properties of nalmefene are beneficial in opioid overdose. We have decades of experience using naloxone safely and effectively as the primary opioid antidote, even in cases of fentanyl and fentanyl analog overdoses. There is, however, evidence to suggest nalmefene may result in more prolonged and severe opioid withdrawal than naloxone, which could be harmful to patients.

Position

As nalmefene is untested in the current clinical environment of synthetic opioid overdoses and has the potential to cause harm via prolonged withdrawal, it is the opinion of the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology that nalmefene should not replace naloxone as the primary opioid antidote at this time.

Recommendations

We recommend additional clinical studies of nalmefene, administered via all approved routes, be conducted in a comparative fashion with naloxone, and that safety and effectiveness outcomes be evaluated before nalmefene is recommended as a primary opioid antidote.

### Naloxone dosing: an evolving unregulated drug landscape, care setting considerations, and the need for research [^508b77e6]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

In acute care settings, intravenous naloxone is preferred for its rapid onset and capacity for precise titration, enabling clinicians to restore respiration while minimizing severe withdrawal or rare complications, such as pulmonary edema and cardiac arrhythmias, thought to result from a catecholamine surge. Our clinical experience with intravenous naloxone, used in a different context to induce mild to moderate withdrawal for rapid buprenorphine initiation within minutes, has demonstrated how precisely the dose can be titrated to elicit the desired response without precipitating severe withdrawal. When intravenous access is unavailable, intramuscular naloxone provides a relatively rapid onset of action and permits dose titration, albeit with less precision and fine control than intravenous administration.

Community settings, such as emergency medical services and take‐home naloxone programs, present different challenges. Intramuscular naloxone is the recommended route in these contexts, offering a practical balance between speed and titratability. Non‐clinical responders can be trained to administer and titrate intramuscular naloxone, and there are reports of community overdose responders doing so successfully.

Intranasal naloxone, though perceived as easier to administer and safer, has more limited capacity for dose titration and has shown variable efficacy compared with intramuscular naloxone. High‐dose intranasal formulations, frequently introduced by pharmaceutical manufacturers, have been marketed with limited independent evidence and come at significantly higher costs, raising questions about their utility. While further research is warranted, in scenarios lacking titration options or trained responders, it may be prudent to err on the side of higher initial dosing. In light of the volatility in the unregulated drug supply, the risk of inadequate reversal in overdoses involving fentanyl analogs such as carfentanil or nitazenes often outweighs the potential harms of over‐antagonism.

Given these issues, nalmefene may be a promising alternative in specific contexts. With higher receptor affinity and a longer half‐life than naloxone, it could reduce the risk of re‐narcotization, particularly in rural and remote areas with delayed access to medical care. However, the potential for prolonged withdrawal symptoms, limited clinical data and lack of global availability warrant further investigation before broader adoption.

Recommendations for Patients Co-prescribed Benzodiazepines and Opioids

16 Because patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids are at increased risk of respiratory depression, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing at least every 3 months or with every related clinical encounter or prescription renewal, whichever is more frequent (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
17 Clinicians should offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone) for all patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
18 Clinicians should consider additional strategies for mitigating risk, including using the lowest effective doses of BZD and opioid medications and optimizing non-opioid interventions (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendations for Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders

19 Clinicians should consider more frequent assessments of the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing for patients with co-occurring SUDs and/or other co-occurring addictions (e.g. behavioral addictions) compared with the general guidance in Recommendation 1 (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
20 When tapering BZD medication in patients with SUD, clinicians should manage the underlying SUD concurrently with the BZD taper (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
21 Clinicians should not use BZD prescribing or tapering considerations as a reason to discontinue or disrupt a patient's medications for SUD treatment, including buprenorphine and methadone (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
22 Following the taper, clinicians should continue to monitor and treat any underlying SUDs or refer patients to an appropriate level of care for continuing care (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
23 Clinicians should offer patients harm reduction services or provide them with referrals to access these services (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a Clinicians should offer to provide or prescribe opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone) and provide or refer patients for related education (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians can consider providing or referring patients to community services for drug checking or other safe use supplies (e.g. fentanyl test strips, xylazine test strips, sterile syringes) and related education (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

### American college of medical toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology position statement: nalmefene should not replace naloxone as the primary opioid antidote at this time [^e2054218]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). High credibility.

Nalmefene versus naloxone — withdrawal duration and observation needs are contrasted as follows: In the case of naloxone, severe withdrawal usually lasts less than an hour with symptoms typically persisting no more than 90 minutes, whereas a longer-acting antagonist is anticipated to cause longer-lasting precipitated withdrawal and may lead to worse patient outcomes, and clinical experience with both naltrexone and nalmefene suggests prolonged withdrawal is a complication of longer-acting opioid antagonists. Patients who receive nalmefene may require longer periods of observation, by up to several hours, to observe for recrudescent effects as the antagonist effects wane, will still need medical observation to ensure that respiratory depression does not recur after the effects of the medication subside, and this will prolong ED visit length and further burden a taxed system.

Evidence gaps and potential risks with nalmefene — IN nalmefene has not been adequately studied for effectiveness in the actual out-of-hospital setting for patients with severe opioid intoxication, and lack of proof of safety and efficacy in real-world use could result in significant harm if widely utilized. Although a longer-acting antagonist may be theoretically beneficial for resuscitation of opioid-naive individuals in an opioid-induced mass casualty incident, this type of event has never been reported in North America and this application is unstudied. The potential benefits of nalmefene over naloxone, including greater opioid receptor affinity and longer duration of action, carry risk of causing harm and should be demonstrated in the clinical environment, balanced with the risks, and compared to naloxone prior to broad adoption of nalmefene.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: a 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^59d5ccc0]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are three classes of medication for treatment of opioid dependence (ICD‐10); full agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. While agonists have been used world‐wide for many years, long‐acting injectable versions of the opioid antagonist naltrexone is so far only approved in the United States, Russia and Ukraine. Administered as monthly intramuscular injections, extended‐release naltrexone (XR‐NTX) blocks the euphoric effects of opioids and offers a medication‐assisted abstinence from opioids. Studies have shown that XR‐NTX is an effective, safe and feasible treatment option. However, the majority of studies on XR‐NTX treatment have had limited time‐frames and only a few studies have reported results from 12 months or longer. To our knowledge, there are no recommendations regarding clinical treatment length with XR‐NTX based on research or national guidelines.

Opioid agonist maintenance treatment (OMT), which is the current World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended treatment for opioid dependence, is recommended to be open‐ended and, at least in western Europe, OMT has become a long‐lasting or even life‐long treatment. Opioid agonist treatment and XR‐NTX treatment differ in a number of ways. While opioid agonists maintain the opioid dependence, XR‐NTX blocks the effects of opioids and supports abstinence from all opioids. Two randomized controlled trials suggested that XR‐NTX is equally as effective as the opioid agonist buprenorphine–naloxone (BP‐NLX) in short‐term treatment with regard to retention in treatment and reduction in use of illicit opioids. While studies of long‐term treatment outcomes for opioid dependence in general are scarce, this is particularly applied to treatment with XR‐NTX. The discrepancy between the somewhat limited duration of most clinical XR‐NTX trials and the often life‐long, chronically relapsing duration of opioid dependencies is striking.

### Benzhydrocodone and acetaminophen (Apadaz) [^b716be1f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydrocodone

In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.

Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.

Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydrocodone from APADAZ, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information.

In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.

### Association of naloxone coprescription laws with naloxone prescription dispensing in the United States [^d9aa5367]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

An additional public health intervention recommended by several US federal agencies that is being considered by many states is emphasizing coprescribing or codispensing of naloxone to patients at risk for OOD. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an opioid prescribing guideline that recommends prescribers consider a naloxone coprescription if a patient's opioid dosage exceeds 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration also recommended naloxone coprescribing for individuals with a history of OOD or substance use disorder, those who are taking benzodiazepines with opioids, and those who are at risk for using a high-dose opioid when they are no longer tolerant (eg, patients leaving detoxification facilities, jails). In 2017, Virginia and Vermont became the first 2 states to mandate naloxone coprescription to opioid-receiving patients who have risk factors of OOD. Our objective for this study was to assess the association between these legally mandated interventions requiring naloxone coprescription and naloxone dispensing over time.

### Risk of respiratory depression with opioids and concomitant gabapentinoids [^d307ee83]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to compare the association of naloxone administration with respiratory depression between the non-gabapentinoid group and the gabapentinoid group. Secondary objectives included the documented indication of naloxone in the UCSDH EPIC™ (ie, for sedation versus respiratory depression versus undocumented/unknown); the association of sedation as measured by POSS among non-gabapentinoid group and gabapentinoid group; the relationship between respiratory depression and age > 65 years, comorbid conditions such as surgery within the previous 24 hours, CHF, COPD, OSA, and the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR); as well as the dose of opioids in oral morphine equivalents and dose of gabapentinoids.

Respiratory depression was defined as a respiratory rate of < 8 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation either below 92% or a decrease of more than 5% from baseline in patients with a baseline of SpO₂ < 90%. Sedation level was measured by POSS. The POSS was recorded prior to the administration of naloxone as well as after administration. A POSS of 1 or 2 is considered an acceptable level of awareness as the patient is either awake and alert or slightly drowsy but easily arousable. A POSS of 3 or 4 is considered excessively sedated and indicates a risk of respiratory depression. A POSS of 3 indicates the patient is frequently drowsy, easily aroused but falls back asleep without constant stimulation, while a POSS of 4 indicates a patient is somnolent, with minimal or no response to verbal and physical stimulation. The distinction between respiratory depression and sedation was made based on physician documentation and nursing assessment records. If a patient did not meet criteria for respiratory depression as defined earlier or sedation was not identified in the physician and nursing documentation, the patient's naloxone indication was classified as unknown.

### Misuse of novel synthetic opioids: a deadly new trend [^8de6814d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Naloxone is a competitive μ-opioid receptor antagonist, which serves as an effective antidote for opioid overdose. The recommended initial dose of naloxone is 0.4 to 2 mg. However, it is known that doses of 10 to 20 mg may be required to reverse the effects of potent synthetic opioids. Emergency department data from a fentanyl outbreak in Chicago during 2005 to 2006 revealed that the standard 0.4 mg naloxone dose was only successful in reversing 15% of cases, and the mean naloxone dose required for rescue was 3.36 mg. Despite initial naloxone doses exceeding 2 mg, no withdrawal symptoms or other adverse effects were noted in this study. Given these data and the increasing prevalence of IMF and NSO, it seems logical to increase the standard initial naloxone dose from 0.4 to 2 mg. Currently, there are 2 forms of naloxone available for emergency use in community settings — an intramuscular autoinjector manufactured by Kaléo Pharma and a 4 mg nasal spray manufactured by Adapt Pharma. Kaléo received US FDA approval on October 19, 2016, to begin manufacturing a 2 mg autoinjector, and this has recently replaced its 0.4 mg formulation. Concerns have been raised regarding the efficacy of intranasal naloxone in reversing overdose from synthetic opioids. However, the basis for such concerns involved a 2 mg dosage, and the current formulation for intranasal delivery is 4 mg. A randomized controlled trial comparing intranasal and intramuscular naloxone of the same dosage for suspected heroin overdose concluded similar efficacy, and both routes could be used as first-line treatment.

### Enhancing patient choice: using self-administered intranasal naloxone for novel rapid buprenorphine initiation [^c48413ce]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal-an experience that deters treatment and causes return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.

In 2017, fentanyl and analogs accounted for "nearly 30,000 overdose deaths". Between 2012 and 2016, "the rate of naloxone administration by EMS increased 75.1%, from 573.6 to 1004.4 per 100,000 EMS events", and a Northern New England analysis found "basic life support (BLS) practitioners were as effective as advanced life support (ALS) practitioners in naloxone administration". The role of first responders "has expanded to include identification and management of the effects of opioid toxicity through supportive management as well as reversal through the administration of naloxone".

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^1e077515]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Part 3: Treating Opioid Withdrawal

Using medications for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids. Abrupt cessation of opioids may lead to strong cravings, which can lead to continued use.

Patients should be advised about risk of relapse and other safety concerns from using opioid withdrawal management as standalone treatment for opioid use disorder. Opioid withdrawal management on its own is not a treatment method.

Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal.

Opioid withdrawal management in cases in which methadone is used to manage withdrawal symptoms must be done in an inpatient setting or in an OTP. For short-acting opioids, tapering schedules that decrease in daily doses of prescribed methadone should begin with doses between 20 and 30 mg per day, and should be completed in 6–10 days.

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

The use of combinations of buprenorphine and low doses of oral naltrexone to manage withdrawal and facilitate the accelerated introduction of extended-release injectable naltrexone has shown promise. More research will be needed before this can be accepted as standard practice.

The Guideline Committee recommends, based on consensus opinion, the inclusion of clonidine as a practice to support opioid withdrawal. Clonidine is not US FDA-approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal, but it has been extensively used off-label for this purpose. Clonidine may be used orally or transdermally at doses of 0.1–0.3 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum dose of 1.2 mg daily to assist in the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms. There is a delay in response using transdermal clonidine that may require oral supplementation on day 1. Its hypotensive effects often limit the amount that can be used. Clonidine can be combined with other non-narcotic medications targeting specific opioid withdrawal symptoms such as benzodiazepines for anxiety, loperamide for diarrhea, acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for pain, and ondansetron or other agents for nausea.

Opioid withdrawal management using anesthesia – ultrarapid opioid detoxification (UROD) – is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death. Naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be a well tolerated and effective approach, but should be used only by clinicians experienced in this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation is not being employed.

### Naloxone dosing in the era of synthetic opioids: applying the goldilocks principle [^e256344c]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

The opioid overdose epidemic remains a critical public health crisis. In recent years, synthetic opioids like fentanyl and nitazenes, have driven a sharp rise in deaths. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, has been established as a key intervention for reversing opioid overdoses and saving lives. However, there remains a critical need to optimize naloxone dosing strategies. This article examines the challenges of both under-dosing and over-antagonism in naloxone administration, emphasizing the importance of a tailored approach to overdose management. A 'just the right dose' approach is essential for minimizing the risks of over-antagonism while still reversing opioid overdose. This involves starting with a modest naloxone dose and carefully titrating it based on the patient's response, considering factors such as opioid type, overdose severity, and opioid tolerance. A tailored approach to naloxone dosing may present challenges for non-medically trained responders but it can ensure that as many people as possible receive the right dose of naloxone when they need it. Training programs should also emphasize the importance of first aid and supportive care, including airway management and alerting emergency services, as well as careful monitoring of the patient's response.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Kisunla injection for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with Kisunla should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was studied in the clinical trials. Kisunla is administered as an intravenous infusion every four weeks. The recommended dosage is detailed in the prescribing information. Effectiveness The efficacy of Kisunla was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The patients had confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease. 1736 patients were randomized 1: 1 to receive700 mg Kisunla every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, and then 1400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo for a total of up to 72 weeks.

Patients treated with Kisunla demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in clinical decline on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale compared to placebo at Week 76 in the overall population, as well as on the iADRS component scales, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale. Patients treated with Kisunla also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in clinical decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale – Sum of Boxes compared to placebo at Week 76 in the overall population. At baseline, the study population had a mean age of 73 years, with a range of 59 to 86 years. Fifty-seven percent of patients were female, 91% were White, 6% were Asian, 4% were Hispanic or Latino, and 2% were Black or African American.

The most common side effects of Kisunla were ARIA and headache. See full prescribing information for additional information on risks associated with Kisunla. Designations The FDA granted this application Fast Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations.

### Naloxone distribution and possession following a large-scale naloxone programme [^ee2f907a]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Naloxone distribution has increased since the programme began in June 2014, and the suggested annual distribution rates were met for the cities to first implement THN. The findings among the sample of street‐ and low‐threshold‐recruited illicit substance users from the same cities indicate good saturation of naloxone, as the majority had received naloxone training and a large proportion also currently possessed naloxone. However, one of the cities (Bergen) distributed far less in 2017 compared to previous years. Interestingly, the proportions of illicit substance users in each city who reported naloxone possession corresponded to the time of when distribution was initiated in each city, and programme duration was a significant indicator when estimating the likelihood of both possession and use. Overall, 58% reported attending naloxone training, 43% currently possessed and 15% had used naloxone. The significant indicators for naloxone possession included programme duration, female gender and to self‐report dealing as an income source. The significant indicators for naloxone use were programme duration, homelessness or shelter use, OMT, dealing and to have injected heroin during the 4 weeks prior to inclusion.

Adequate naloxone distribution and coverage is an integral part of large‐scale programmes. As demonstrated by others, the ability to observe reduction in overdose mortality relies upon sufficient naloxone distribution 8, 10 and penetration to at‐risk groups. The distribution rates from the study exceeded suggested annual coverage 10, 11, and the majority of the surveyed sample had attended a naloxone training (71% in Oslo, 64% in Bergen). This indicates that the distribution methods resulted in both sufficient naloxone distribution and in reaching this sample of illicit substance users. By involving existing staff and facilities there was access to a wide range of at‐risk groups, while still being streamlined through a central host. The funding from the government, along with the ability to distribute it prescription‐free, enabled broad access throughout the country. Therefore, the ability to achieve this coverage (somewhat rapidly) probably resulted from broad programme involvement and participation 20.

### Naloxone distribution and possession following a large-scale naloxone programme [^7330338c]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To examine uptake following a large‐scale naloxone programme by estimating distribution rates since programme initiation and the proportion among a sample of high‐risk individuals who had attended naloxone training, currently possessed or had used naloxone. We also estimated the likelihood of naloxone possession and use as a function of programme duration, individual descriptive and substance use indicators.

Design

(1) Distribution data (June 2014–August 2017) and date of implementation for each city and (2) a cross‐sectional study among a sample of illicit substance users interviewed September 2017.

Setting

Seven Norwegian cities.

Participants

A total of 497 recruited users of illegal opioids and/or central stimulants.

Measurements

Primary outcomes: naloxone possession and use. Random‐intercepts logistic regression models (covariates: male, age, homelessness/shelter use, overdose, incarceration, opioid maintenance treatment, income sources, substance use indicators, programme duration).

Findings

Overall, 4631 naloxone nasal sprays were distributed in the two pilot cities, with a cumulative rate of 495 per 100 000 population. In the same two cities, among high‐risk individuals, 44% and 62% reported current naloxone possession. The possession rates of naloxone corresponded well to the duration of each participating city's distribution programme. Overall, in the six distributing cities, 58% reported naloxone training, 43% current possession and 15% naloxone use. The significant indicators for possession were programme duration [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI = 0.82–2.37], female gender (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.20–3.24) and drug‐dealing (aOR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.42–3.93). The significant indicators for naloxone use were programme duration (aOR = 1.49 95%, CI = 1.15–1.92), homelessness/shelter use (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.02–4.17), opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) (aOR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.13–3.78), drug‐dealing (aOR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.27–4.54) and heroin injecting (aOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.04–4.38).

Conclusions

A large‐scale naloxone programme in seven Norwegian cities with a cumulative distribution rate of 495 per 100 000 population indicated good saturation in a sample of high‐risk individuals, with programme duration in each city as an important indicator for naloxone possession and use.

### Transitioning a patient from injectable opioid agonist therapy to sublingual buprenorphine / naloxone for the treatment of opioid use disorder using a microdosing approach [^984d6483]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

In the wake of North America's opioid crisis, access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is of critical importance. While buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone are currently indicated as first-line medications for the treatment of OUD, there are a proportion of individuals who do not benefit from these therapies. Recent Canadian guidelines suggest the use of alternate therapies, including slow-release oral morphine or injectable opioid agonist therapy (iOAT) for individuals unsuccessful with either methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone. While the guidelines highlight the need to intensify OUD treatment as disease severity increases, equally important is the consideration for deintensification of treatment (eg, from iOAT to an oral opioid agonist treatment (OAT) option) following successful stabilisation. Literature addressing how best to accomplish this, however, is currently lacking. Accordingly, the case presented here describes a patient that successfully transitions from iOAT to oral buprenorphine/naloxone using a novel induction approach termed microdosing.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^30b6bbae]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Naltrexone and pain management — patients on naltrexone may not respond to opioid analgesics in the usual manner; mild pain may be treated with acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and high potency NSAIDs such as Ketorolac may be prescribed for moderate to severe pain, with NSAID use time-limited due to adverse effects including gastritis. Emergency pain management options, which may optimally be used in combination when appropriate, include regional anesthesia, conscious sedation with benzodiazepines or ketamine, nonopioid options in general anesthesia, and over-riding the naltrexone blockade with high-potency opioids. Higher doses are typically needed to override the opioid receptor blockade so this should occur in an inpatient setting with monitoring of vitals, and use of high potency opioids, with high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor, administered intravenously is recommended in these cases.

### Opioid dependence: rationale for and efficacy of existing and new treatments [^a5bbe147]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Opioid dependence is a chronic and relapsing medical disorder with a well-established neurobiological basis. Opioid agonist treatments, such as methadone and the recently approved buprenorphine, stabilize opioid receptors and the intracellular processes that lead to opioid withdrawal and craving. Both methadone and buprenorphine have been proven effective for the treatment of opioid dependence and can contribute to a decreased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In addition, a buprenorphine/naloxone combination appears to have a decreased potential for abuse or diversion, compared with that associated with methadone. Largely because of these properties, recent legislation now affords an unprecedented opportunity for general physicians to offer opioid agonist treatment through their offices. This review focuses on the neurobiological basis of opioid dependence, the rationale for methadone and buprenorphine treatments, and issues in prescribing these medications to patients with HIV infection.

### Morphine sulfate (depoDur) [^091e8480]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage of morphine is characterized by respiratory depression, with or without concomitant CNS depression. In severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur. The conditions that might cause an overdosage situation may vary from patient to patient. A DepoDur dose that is within the labeled dosing guidelines may be found to be more than could be tolerated by an individual patient. During post-marketing experience, spontaneous cases of apnea, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest have been reported after administration of labeled DepoDur doses (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE EVENTS). Since respiratory arrest may result either through direct depression of the respiratory center or as the result of hypoxia, attention should primarily be given to the establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Opiates administered in addition to DepoDur to manage pain may precipitate or worsen adverse events such as respiratory depression. Additional opiates should be administered with caution.

The opiate antagonist, naloxone, is a specific antidote. An initial dose of 0.4 to 2 mg of naloxone should be administered intravenously, simultaneously with respiratory resuscitation. If the desired degree of counteraction and improvement in respiratory function is not obtained, naloxone may be repeated at 2- to 3-minute intervals. If no response is observed after 10 mg of naloxone has been administered, the diagnosis of opiate-induced, or partial opiate-induced, toxicity should be questioned. Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration may be used if the intravenous route is not available.

As the duration of effect of naloxone is considerably shorter than that of DepoDur, repeated administration or continuous infusion of naloxone may be necessary. Patients should be closely observed for evidence of recurrence of respiratory depression.

Introduction

Community pharmacies can protect the health of people who use drugs (PWUD) by facilitating access to naloxone and syringes. Approval of some formulations of naloxone for over-the-counter (OTC) sale has the potential to advance these efforts. Studies before the OTC transition indicated naloxone was not consistently accessible, and little is known about stocking following this change. Limited available data indicate community pharmacists and technicians are often unwilling to sell nonprescription syringes.

### Opioid dependence treatment, including buprenorphine / naloxone [^84449bae]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review opioid dependence (OD) and its treatment. Pharmacologic treatments, including the use of buprenorphine/naloxone, are presented. Pharmaceutical care functions for outpatient OD treatment are discussed.

Data Sources

Primary and review articles were identified by MEDLINE and HEALTHSTAR searches (from 1966 to November 2000) and through secondary sources. Tertiary sources were also reviewed regarding general concepts of OD and its treatment.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Relevant articles were reviewed after identification from published abstracts. Articles were selected based on the objectives for this article. Studies of the treatment of OD with buprenorphine were selected based on the topic (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse reactions) and study design (randomized, controlled clinical trials in patients with OD with active/placebo comparisons and/or comparisons of active OD treatments). Articles regarding pharmacists' activities in the treatment and prevention of OD were reviewed for the pharmaceutical care section.

Data Synthesis

OD is considered a medical disorder with costly adverse health outcomes. Although methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is cost-effective for OD, only about 12% of individuals with OD receive this treatment. Psychological and pharmacologic modalities are used to treat OD, but patients often relapse. Drug therapy includes alpha 2-agonists for withdrawal symptoms, detoxification regimens with or without opioids, opioid antagonists, and opioid replacement including methadone, levomethadyl acetate, and buprenorphine. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 allows for office-based opioid replacement therapies. Sublingual buprenorphine with naloxone can be used in this milieu. Buprenorphine with naloxone is currently under new drug application review with the Food and Drug Administration. Clinical research shows buprenorphine to be equal in effectiveness to methadone, but safer in overdose due to its ceiling effect on respiratory depression. It has lower abuse potential and fewer withdrawal symptoms when discontinued. Naloxone is included to decrease diversion and injection of the tablets. Pharmacists in outpatient settings who are familiar with OD have opportunities to provide pharmaceutical care to patients receiving this treatment. Pharmaceutical care functions for OD include ensuring appropriate drug administration, monitoring adverse effects, alleviating withdrawal symptoms, treating intercurrent illnesses, minimizing diversion, and preventing relapse.

Conclusions

OD is a critical unmet health problem in the US. Buprenorphine combined with naloxone represents an innovative treatment for OD in outpatient settings. This new treatment has advantages over MMT.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^eff15e34]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — Module A: Screening and Treatment details comprehensive management steps after referral or primary care engagement, directing to "Complete the biopsychosocial assessment** and determine diagnoses per DSM-5 criteria", then "Develop and implement comprehensive** treatment plan using shared decision making". Key components include "If patient has OUD or is at high risk for opioid overdose, prescribe naloxone", "Offer/begin SUD focused pharmacotherapy if indicated (see Sidebars 3 and 4)", "Offer SUD focused psychosocial interventions if indicated (see Appendix C)", and "Address psychological functioning and recovery environment (e.g., housing, supportive recovery environment, and employment)", along with "Manage medical and psychiatric co-occurring conditions if indicated (see Sidebar 5)" and "Assess response to treatment; adjust treatment and follow-up frequency as clinically indicated". The algorithm then asks "Is continued SUD treatment needed?"; if not, it directs to "Provide feedback as appropriate" and "Screen annually for unhealthy alcohol use".

### Vital signs: pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing-United States, 2012–2018 [^8450774c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain recommends considering prescribing naloxone when factors that increase risk for overdose are present (e.g., history of overdose or substance use disorder, opioid dosages ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day [high-dose], and concurrent use of benzodiazepines). In light of the high numbers of drug overdose deaths involving opioids, 36% of which in 2017 involved prescription opioids, improving access to naloxone is a public health priority. CDC examined trends and characteristics of naloxone dispensing from retail pharmacies at the national and county levels in the United States.

Methods

CDC analyzed 2012–2018 retail pharmacy data from IQVIA, a health care, data science, and technology company, to assess U.S. naloxone dispensing by U.S. Census region, urban/rural status, prescriber specialty, and recipient characteristics, including age group, sex, out-of-pocket costs, and method of payment. Factors associated with naloxone dispensing at the county level also were examined.

Results

The number of naloxone prescriptions dispensed from retail pharmacies increased substantially from 2012 to 2018, including a 106% increase from 2017 to 2018 alone. Nationally, in 2018, one naloxone prescription was dispensed for every 69 high-dose opioid prescriptions. Substantial regional variation in naloxone dispensing was found, including a twenty-fivefold variation across counties, with lowest rates in the most rural counties. A wide variation was also noted by prescriber specialty. Compared with naloxone prescriptions paid for with Medicaid and commercial insurance, a larger percentage of prescriptions paid for with Medicare required out-of-pocket costs.

Conclusion

Despite substantial increases in naloxone dispensing, the rate of naloxone prescriptions dispensed per high-dose opioid prescription remains low, and overall naloxone dispensing varies substantially across the country. Naloxone distribution is an important component of the public health response to the opioid overdose epidemic. Health care providers can prescribe or dispense naloxone when overdose risk factors are present and counsel patients on how to use it. Efforts to improve naloxone access and distribution work most effectively with efforts to improve opioid prescribing, implement other harm-reduction strategies, promote linkage to medications for opioid use disorder treatment, and enhance public health and public safety partnerships.

### Consensus guidelines on the use of intravenous ketamine infusions for chronic pain from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists [^97bf057a]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Intravenous ketamine for acute pain management — scope and conclusions of a consensus guideline are as follows: Guidelines were prepared addressing indications, contraindications and whether they differ from chronic pain, adjunctive use with opioid-based therapy, patient-controlled ketamine analgesia, nonparenteral formulations, and the subanesthetic dosage range and where evidence supports those dosages for acute pain. Evidence supports the use of ketamine for acute pain in a variety of contexts, including as a stand-alone treatment, as an adjunct to opioids, and, to a lesser extent, as an intranasal formulation, and contraindications for acute pain are similar to those for chronic pain. The group was able to reach consensus on all questions, and larger studies are needed to enhance patient selection, evaluate nonparenteral alternatives, define optimal treatment parameters, and develop protocols optimizing safety and access to care. The need for consensus guidance was motivated by widespread use across emergency departments and perioperative settings and variability in patient selection, treatment parameters, and monitoring.

Opioid overdose training — supportive evidence indicates that "the rate of naloxone administration was higher in those who had received opioid training compared with those who had not (32% versus 0%)", and that "Interventions that included skills practice (ie, naloxone administration) were more likely to lead to improved clinical performance compared with interventions without skills practice". It also notes that "people who use opioids and their significant others were more likely to administer naloxone if they received hands-on training compared with watching a video", and that "Opioid education and naloxone distribution programs are widely accepted by first aid providers in various settings".

### Naloxone use by emergency medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey [^b0b249da]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Sixty physicians completed the survey. Nineteen (32%) were in in the Midwest, 17 (28%) were in in the South, 12 (20%) were in in the Northeast, and 12 (20%) were in in the West. The primary findings are in the Table 1. Eleven of 60 (18%) respondents indicated that EMS responses for overdose in their area increased while 24 (40%) indicated they had decreased compared with the pre-COVID-19 timeframe. Eleven (18%) indicated that they had discouraged or prohibited the use of intranasal naloxone by their EMS agencies/system, while 47 (78%) indicated no change. Six (10%) indicated that EMS services in their area had discontinued intranasal naloxone of their own initiative. Six (10%) indicated that they had authorized EMS clinicians to use intramuscular naloxone to avoid intranasal administration and another 6 (10%) were considering but had not yet implemented this change. Programs in the Midwest and Northeast were more likely to report decreases in overdose compared to those in the South and West (P = 0.02). There was no other evidence of regional variation.

### Naloxone – does over-antagonism matter? Evidence of iatrogenic harm after emergency treatment of heroin / opioid overdose [^7e8e1baf]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To analyse drug users' views and experiences of naloxone during emergency resuscitation after illicit opiate overdose to identify (i) any evidence of harm caused by excessive naloxone dosing ('over-antagonism'); and (ii) implications for the medical administration of naloxone within contemporary emergency settings.

Design

Re-analysis of a large qualitative data set comprising 70 face-to-face interviews conducted within a few hours of heroin/opioid overdose occurring, observations from hospital settings and a further 130 interviews with illicit opiate users. Data were generated between 1997 and 1999.

Setting

Emergency departments, drug services and pharmacies in two Scottish cities.

Participants

Two hundred illicit opiate users: 131 males and 69 females.

Findings

Participants had limited knowledge of naloxone and its pharmacology, yet described it routinely in negative terms and were critical of its medical administration. In particular, they complained that naloxone induced acute withdrawal symptoms, causing patients to refuse treatment, become aggressive, discharge themselves from hospital and take additional street drugs to counter the naloxone effects. Participants believed that hospital staff should administer naloxone selectively and cautiously, and prescribe counter-naloxone medication if dosing precipitated withdrawals. In contrast, observational data indicated that participants did not always know that they had received naloxone and hospital doctors did not necessarily administer it incautiously.

Conclusions

Opiate users in urban Scotland repeatedly report harm caused by naloxone over-antagonism, although this is not evident in observational data. The concept of contemporary legend (a form of folklore that can be based on fact and provides a means of communicating and negotiating anxiety) helps to explain why naloxone has such a feared reputation among opiate users.

### Consensus guidelines on the use of intravenous ketamine infusions for acute pain management from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists [^4cfcaac8]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ketamine infusions have been used for decades to treat acute pain, but a recent surge in usage has made the infusions a mainstay of treatment in emergency departments, in the perioperative period in individuals with refractory pain, and in opioid-tolerant patients. The widespread variability in patient selection, treatment parameters, and monitoring indicates a need for the creation of consensus guidelines.

Methods

The development of acute pain ketamine guidelines grew as a corollary from the genesis of chronic pain ketamine guidelines. The charge for the development of acute pain ketamine guidelines was provided by the Boards of Directors of both the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the American Academy of Pain Medicine, who approved the document along with the American Society of Anesthesiologists' Committees on Pain Medicine and Standards and Practice Parameters. The committee chair developed questions based on input from the committee during conference calls, which the committee then refined. Groups of 3 to 5 panel members and the committee chair were responsible for answering individual questions. After preliminary consensus was achieved, the entire committee made further revisions via e-mail and conference calls.

Results

Consensus guidelines were prepared in the following areas: indications, contraindications for acute pain and whether they differ from those for chronic pain, the evidence for the use of ketamine as an adjunct to opioid-based therapy, the evidence supporting patient-controlled ketamine analgesia, the use of nonparenteral forms of ketamine, and the subanesthetic dosage range and whether the evidence supports those dosages for acute pain. The group was able to reach consensus on the answers to all questions.

Conclusions

Evidence supports the use of ketamine for acute pain in a variety of contexts, including as a stand-alone treatment, as an adjunct to opioids, and, to a lesser extent, as an intranasal formulation. Contraindications for acute pain are similar to those for chronic pain, partly based on the observation that the dosage ranges are similar. Larger studies evaluating different acute pain conditions are needed to enhance patient selection, determine the effectiveness of nonparenteral ketamine alternatives, define optimal treatment parameters, and develop protocols optimizing safety and access to care.

### An examination of state and federal opioid analgesic and continuing education policies: 2016–2018 [^6ae2a469]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

To assess the degree to which a CE program adhering to the FDA educational blueprint would meet each state's CE requirements in pain and safe opioid use, we focused on the 10 bulleted knowledge requirements that were highlighted in FDA's 2018 REMS Blueprint:
The fundamental concepts of pain management, including definitions and mechanisms of pain;
How to assess patients in pain, identifying risk factors for abuse and addiction;
The range of therapeutic options for managing pain, including nonpharmacologic approaches and pharmacologic (non-opioid and opioid analgesics) therapies;
How to integrate opioid analgesics into a pain treatment plan individualized to the needs of the patient;
How to safely and effectively manage patients on opioid analgesics in the acute and chronic pain settings, including initiating therapy, titrating, and discontinuing use of opioid analgesics;
How to counsel patients and caregivers about the safe use of opioid analgesics, including proper storage and disposal;
How to counsel patients and caregivers about the use of naloxone for opioid overdose;
When referral to a pain specialist is appropriate;
The fundamental elements of addiction medicine;
How to identify and manage patients with opioid use disorder.

To conduct the assessment, two individual reviewers experienced with CE and opioid analgesic policy analyzed each pain/opioid CE requirement in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, comparing those requirements to the 10 knowledge requirements contained in the Blueprint. Each reviewer (RT, KD) performed the assessment independently using the following criteria:
If all the state's content requirements were contained in the 2018 REMS Blueprint, the requirement was rated "meets", indicating that CE programs derived solely from the REMS Blueprint could meet the state requirements.
If some, but not all, of the state's content requirements were contained in the 2018 REMS Blueprint, the requirement was rated "partially meets", indicating that CE programs derived solely from the REMS Blueprint could only partially meet the state requirements.
Finally, if none of the state's content requirements were contained in the 2018 REMS Blueprint, the requirement was rated "does not meet", indicating that CE programs derived solely from the REMS Blueprint could not meet the state requirements.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^0669b20c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO EMS pain management — analgesic dosing and administration: For ketorolac, adults receive 30 mg IM or 15 mg IV, and pediatric age 2–16 years old receive 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 30 mg IM or 15 mg IV). For moderate to severe pain, options include morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg (maximum initial dose is 10 mg), fentanyl 1 mcg/kg (maximum initial dose of 100 mcg), hydromorphone 0.015 mg/kg (maximum initial dose 2 mg; maximum cumulative dose of 4 mg), and ketamine 0.25 mg/kg (maximum initial dose 25 mg; maximum cumulative dose 100 mg). Use of non-invasive capnography is an earlier predictor of hypoventilation than pulse oximetry if opioid medications are administered. Consider administration of oral, sublingual, or IV antiemetics to prevent nausea, and if indicated based on pain assessment and vital signs allow, repeat pain medication administration after 5 minutes of the previous dose.

### Benzhydrocodone and acetaminophen (Apadaz) [^cd6d062a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

APADAZ should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of APADAZ for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
The total dosage of APADAZ and any concomitant acetaminophen-containing products should not exceed 4000 mg of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period.
Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.
There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with APADAZ. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Evidence-based guidelines for prehospital pain management: recommendations [^48435b80]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for prehospital pain management — recommendations report that a technical expert panel using GRADE developed guidance addressing eight PICO questions, including pediatric analgesia; a strong recommendation was made for the use of intranasal fentanyl over intravenous (IV) opioids for pediatric patients without intravenous access. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of IV non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over IV acetaminophen (APAP); for either IV ketamine or IV opioids; for either IV NSAIDs or IV opioids; for either IV fentanyl or IV morphine; for either IV ketamine or IV NSAIDs; and for IV APAP over IV opioids. The panel made a conditional recommendation against the use of nebulized ketamine, and a conditional recommendation was made for either oral APAP or oral NSAIDs when the oral route of administration was preferred. Given the lack of a supporting evidence base, the panel was unable to make recommendations for the use of nitrous oxide versus IV opioids or for IV ketamine in combination with IV opioids versus IV ketamine alone.

### Naloxone dispensing among the commercially insured population in the United States from 2015 to 2018 [^90d0ec01]. Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain recommends that providers consider co-prescribing naloxone when factors that increase the risk of overdose are present. Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist that counteracts the effects of an opioid overdose. This paper explores trends in naloxone dispensing and out-of-pocket costs among commercially insured individuals in the United States. Administrative claims data from the IBM Watson Health MarketScan database are analyzed to assess trends in naloxone dispensing from 2015 to 2018. Descriptive statistics on concurrent dispensing of naloxone with opioid analgesics are performed among several at-risk populations. The rate of commercially insured individuals being co-dispensed naloxone increased between 2015 and 2018 across all population sub-groups. In 2018, 16.2 individuals were co-dispensed naloxone for every 1000 receiving an opioid dosage ≥ 90 MME/day compared to 0.9 in 2015, 27.6 individuals were co-dispensed naloxone for every 1000 concurrently dispensed benzodiazepines and an opioid dosage ≥ 90 MME/day compared to 7.6 in 2015, and 43.7 individuals were co-dispensed naloxone for every 1000 receiving an opioid dosage ≥ 90 MME/day with a past overdose compared to 17.6 in 2015. Median out-of-pocket cost for naloxone increased from $12 in 2015 to $25 in 2018. Despite increases in naloxone dispensing from 2015 to 2018, the provision of naloxone to the commercially insured population remains low. Opportunities remain to increase the supply of naloxone to at-risk populations. Considering ways to reduce out-of-pocket costs associated with naloxone may be a potential strategy to increase access to this life-saving drug.
