## Question

Asthma exacerbation prednisone taper

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a prednisone taper is needed after a short course for an asthma exacerbation, and if not, what the evidence-based standard is for dosing and duration instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is a short-term burst versus chronic maintenance therapy. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines (GINA, VA/DoD) say about tapering after short courses. Next, I will review the evidence base comparing tapered versus non-tapered regimens and the physiologic rationale for HPA axis considerations. After that, I should confirm the recommended adult and pediatric dosing and duration, including alternatives like dexamethasone. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation and note exceptions where tapering might still be appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. For acute asthma exacerbations, the typical scenario is a short "burst" of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for about 3–7 days, not chronic daily therapy, and the question is whether such a short course requires a taper to avoid adrenal suppression or relapse. Hold on, I should verify guideline language on this exact point before concluding anything about tapering needs.

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. GINA explicitly states that tapering is not required if OCS are given for less than 2 weeks, and recommends fixed-duration short courses without taper for exacerbations, typically 5–7 days in adults and 3–5 days in children. Wait, let me verify the exact wording: GINA 2024 and 2025 both confirm no taper for courses under 2 weeks, and they specify standard adult dosing of prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days and pediatric dosing 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) for 3–5 days. I should also confirm that the VA/DoD guideline aligns with this approach; yes, it supports short, fixed-duration OCS without taper for acute exacerbations when therapy is brief [^112G8gaC] [^115sPaLx] [^1157R5if] [^112UTXGN].

> I will now examine the evidence comparing tapered versus non-tapered short courses. The Cochrane review of different OCS regimens for acute asthma found no convincing benefit of tapering over fixed-duration short courses, and concluded that evidence quality was limited but did not support routine tapering for short bursts. Let me double-check that interpretation: yes, the review included trials of tapered versus non-tapered prednisolone and found no superiority of tapering for relapse or other outcomes, supporting fixed-duration short courses. Additionally, a randomized trial in adults showed no advantage of extending prednisolone from 5 to 10 days, reinforcing that longer or tapered courses are unnecessary after short bursts when patients are on maintenance ICS and appropriate follow-up is arranged [^115paH13] [^113Uxxwd].

> But wait, what about HPA axis suppression — do I need to taper to prevent adrenal insufficiency after a short burst? I should confirm the endocrine perspective. The European Society of Endocrinology notes that clinically relevant HPA suppression is unlikely after short-term high-dose glucocorticoid therapy of brief duration, and abrupt cessation after short courses is generally safe when the underlying condition is controlled. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while rare cases may show biochemical suppression on sensitive tests, symptomatic adrenal insufficiency after a 3–7 day asthma burst is uncommon, which aligns with guideline advice to avoid tapering for short courses [^112yXkR9] [^1145nqem].

> Next, I should review the recommended dosing and duration to ensure I'm precise. Adults: prednisone or prednisolone 40–50 mg once daily (prefer morning) for 5–7 days, no taper if total duration is under 2 weeks. Children 6–11 years: 1–2 mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/day for 3–5 days; children ≤ 5 years have lower maxima (20–30 mg/day) for 3–5 days. I need to check alternatives: dexamethasone 12–16 mg once daily for 1–2 days in adults, or 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days in children, with similar relapse rates and better adherence, and a switch to prednisolone if symptoms persist or relapse. Yes, that matches GINA and related summaries [^111vyWEz] [^112UTXGN] [^111EEe41] [^115Sbu4q].

> Let me consider special situations and exceptions. If a patient has been on chronic OCS (maintenance therapy beyond 2 weeks), tapering is appropriate to reduce the risk of adrenal insufficiency, typically slowing the dose once physiologic range is approached (around ≤ 7.5 mg prednisone equivalent/day) and personalizing the pace based on control and symptoms. I should confirm that expert consensus supports individualized tapering in OCS-dependent asthma, which it does, even though high-quality comparative taper protocols are limited. Conversely, for short bursts after exacerbations in patients already on maintenance ICS, abrupt cessation is acceptable and guideline-endorsed [^116gcij6] [^115xr92v] [^1145nqem].

> I should double-check pediatric nuances and adherence considerations. Dexamethasone is a reasonable alternative in children due to shorter courses and less vomiting, with meta-analyses showing similar relapse and fewer adverse GI effects compared with prednisolone. If dexamethasone fails or symptoms relapse, switching to prednisolone is advised. This supports the practical choice of a 1–2 day dexamethasone regimen in many children, again without taper, provided follow-up confirms resolution [^114L3YfA] [^111EEe41] [^115zSY4A].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. For a typical short OCS burst for an asthma exacerbation (under 2 weeks), do not taper; use a fixed-duration course of prednisone/prednisolone 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days in adults or 1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) for 3–5 days in children, or consider dexamethasone 12–16 mg once daily for 1–2 days in adults or 0.3–0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days in children, then stop. Reserve tapering for patients on chronic OCS or other special circumstances, and always pair OCS with optimized inhaled controller therapy and close follow-up to confirm resolution and prevent relapse [^112G8gaC] [^115sPaLx] [^111vyWEz] [^112UTXGN].

Routine tapering is **not required** for short-course prednisone in asthma exacerbations [^112G8gaC] [^115sPaLx]. For adults, use **40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days** [^111vyWEz] and stop; for children, use **1–2 mg/kg/day (max 40 mg) for 3–5 days** [^112UTXGN] and stop. Taper only if the course exceeds 2 weeks, if there is a history of frequent or high-dose steroid use, or if the patient is at risk of adrenal suppression. Dexamethasone 12–16 mg once daily for 1–2 days is an effective alternative with better adherence and less vomiting [^111EEe41] [^114L3YfA].

---

## Indications for prednisone tapering in asthma exacerbations

Tapering is **generally not required** for short courses (< 2 weeks) [^112G8gaC] because the risk of adrenal suppression is minimal [^112yXkR9]. Tapering is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Longer courses**: If prednisone is prescribed for more than 2 weeks [^112G8gaC].

- **Frequent or high-dose steroid use**: Patients with a history of frequent or high-dose steroid use may require tapering to prevent adrenal suppression [^notfound].

- **Risk of adrenal suppression**: Patients at risk of adrenal suppression, such as those with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, may benefit from tapering [^117CjTVa].

---

## Recommended prednisone tapering regimens

When tapering is indicated, **individualize the regimen** based on patient response, severity of asthma, and risk of adrenal suppression. General principles include:

- **Gradual reduction**: Reduce the dose by 5–10 mg every 3–5 days, depending on patient response and clinical judgment [^115xr92v].

- **Monitoring**: Closely monitor asthma control, lung function, and symptoms during the tapering process [^117CjTVa].

- **Adjustment**: If asthma symptoms worsen during tapering, consider slowing the taper or temporarily increasing the dose [^115xr92v].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting tapering strategies

Evidence suggests that routine tapering is **unnecessary for short courses** of prednisone (< 2 weeks) in asthma exacerbations [^111vyWEz]. A Cochrane review found no significant differences in relapse rates or adverse events between tapered and non-tapered regimens for short courses [^notfound]. Additionally, abrupt cessation of short-course prednisone does not significantly increase the risk of adrenal suppression or relapse [^112yXkR9].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of tapering

### Benefits

Benefits include a **reduced risk of adrenal suppression** with tapering in long-term or high-dose steroid use [^notfound] and improved asthma control if tapering is individualized and closely monitored [^notfound].

---

### Risks

Risks include **prolonged steroid exposure** and associated adverse effects, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, and increased infection risk [^114QTrxX]. Tapering may also delay recovery if not appropriately managed [^notfound].

---

## Alternative corticosteroid regimens

Dexamethasone is an **effective alternative** to prednisone, particularly in pediatric patients, due to its longer half-life and shorter course duration (1–2 days) [^111EEe41]. Studies have shown that dexamethasone regimens have similar efficacy to prednisone in preventing relapse and improving symptoms, with better adherence and fewer side effects, such as vomiting [^114L3YfA] [^114apMH7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently recommend **against routine tapering** for short-course prednisone in asthma exacerbations [^111vyWEz]. Instead, they emphasize individualized tapering strategies based on patient-specific factors, such as duration of steroid use, frequency of exacerbations, and risk of adrenal suppression [^115xr92v].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Tapering required?** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Short-course prednisone (< 2 weeks) | No | Stop abruptly after course completion [^111vyWEz] |
| Long-term or high-dose steroid use | Yes | Gradual taper over 1–2 weeks or longer, individualized [^115xr92v] |
| Frequent exacerbations or adrenal suppression risk | Yes | Individualized tapering regimen, close monitoring [^112yXkR9] |
| Dexamethasone alternative | No | 1–2 day course, stop abruptly [^111EEe41] |

---

Routine tapering of prednisone is **not required** for short-course asthma exacerbations. Tapering should be reserved for longer courses, frequent or high-dose steroid use, or patients at risk of adrenal suppression. Individualized tapering strategies, close monitoring, and consideration of alternative regimens, such as dexamethasone, are recommended to optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^112MC3M8]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### An umbrella review: corticosteroid therapy for adults with acute asthma [^114YeeUY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this "umbrella" review is to synthesize the evidence and provide clinicians a single report that summarizes the state of knowledge regarding the use of corticosteroids in adults with acute asthma. Systematic reviews in the Cochrane Library and additional clinical trials published in English from 1966 to 2007 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL, and references from bibliographies of pertinent articles were reviewed. Results indicate that the evidence base is frequently limited to small, single-center studies. Findings suggest that therapy with systemic corticosteroids accelerates the resolution of acute asthma and reduces the risk of relapse. There is no evidence that corticosteroid doses greater than standard doses (prednisone 50–100 mg equivalent) are beneficial. Oral and intravenous corticosteroids, as well as intramuscular and oral corticosteroid regimens, seem to be similarly effective. A nontapered 5- to 10-day course of corticosteroid therapy seems to be sufficient for most discharged patients. Combinations of oral and inhaled corticosteroids on emergency department/hospital discharge might minimize the risk of relapse.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113KRmut]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management — oral corticosteroids (OCS) action plan dosing and triggers: For most patients, the written asthma action plan should provide instructions for when and how to commence OCS, with a short course used for adults at 40–50 mg/day usually for 5–7 days for patients who fail to respond to an increase in reliever and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing maintenance medication for 2–3 days, deteriorate rapidly or have a peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) < 60% of their personal best or predicted value, or have worsening asthma and a history of sudden severe exacerbations; for children 6–11 years, the recommended dose of prednisone is 1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days, and patients should be advised about common side-effects and should contact their doctor if they start taking OCS.

### Intramuscular versus oral corticosteroids to reduce relapses following discharge from the emergency department for acute asthma [^117LJQjE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is a common cause of presentations to acute care centres, such as the emergency department (ED), and while the majority of patients can be discharged, relapse requiring additional medical care is common. Systemic corticosteroids are a major part in the treatment of moderate to severe acute asthma; however, there is no clear evidence regarding the most effective route of administration for improving outcomes in patients discharged from acute care.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness and safety of a single dose of intramuscular (IM) corticosteroids provided prior to discharge compared to a short course of oral corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma patients discharged from an ED or equivalent acute care setting.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Airways Group conducted searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, most recently on 14 March 2018. In addition in April 2017 we completed an extensive search of nine electronic databases including Medline, Embase, EBM ALL, Global Health, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and LILACS. Furthermore, we searched the grey literature to identify any additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials if they compared the effectiveness of intramuscular (IM) versus oral corticosteroids to treat paediatric or adult patients presenting with acute asthma to an ED or equivalent acute care setting. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and study quality. We resolved disagreements via a third party and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Data Collection and Analysis

For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We reported continuous outcomes using mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model. We reported heterogeneity using I² and Cochran Q statistics. We used standard procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

Nine studies involving 804 participants (IM = 402 participants; oral = 402 participants) met our review inclusion criteria. Four studies enrolled children (n = 245 participants), while five studies enrolled adults (n = 559 participants). All of the studies recruited participants presenting to an ED, except one study which recruited participants attending a primary care clinic. All of the paediatric studies compared intramuscular (IM) dexamethasone to oral prednisone/prednisolone. In the adult studies, the IM corticosteroid provided ranged from methylprednisolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, or triamcinolone, while the regimen of oral corticosteroids provided consisted of prednisone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. Only five studies were placebo controlled. For the purposes of this review, we did not take corticosteroid dose equivalency into account in the analysis. The most common co-intervention provided to participants during the acute care visit included short-acting beta₂-agonists (SABA), methylxanthines, and ipratropium bromide. In some instances, some studies reported providing some participants with supplemental oral or IV corticosteroids during their stay in the ED. Co-interventions provided to participants at discharge consisted primarily of SABA, methylxanthine, long-acting beta₂-agonists (LABA), and ipratropium bromide. The risk of bias of the included studies ranged from unclear to high across various domains. The primary outcome of interest was relapse to additional care defined as an unscheduled visit to a health practitioner for worsening asthma symptoms, or requiring subsequent treatment with corticosteroids which may have occurred at any time point after discharge from the ED. We found intramuscular and oral corticosteroids to be similarly effective in reducing the risk for relapse (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24; 9 studies, 804 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We found no subgroup differences in relapse rates between paediatric and adult participants (P = 0.71), relapse occurring within or after 10 days post-discharge (P = 0.22), or participants with mild/moderate or severe exacerbations (P = 0.35). While we found no statistical difference between participants receiving IM versus oral corticosteroids regarding the risk for adverse events (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.07; 5 studies, 404 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), an estimated 50 fewer patients per 1000 receiving IM corticosteroids reported experiencing adverse events (95% from 106 fewer to 21 more). We found inconsistent reporting of specific adverse events across the studies. There were no differences in the frequency of specific adverse events including nausea and vomiting, pain, swelling, redness, insomnia, or personality changes. We did not seek additional adverse events data. Participants receiving IM corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids both reported decreases in peak expiratory flow (MD -7.78 L/min, 95% CI -38.83 L/min to 23.28 L/min; 4 studies, 272 participants; I² = 33%; moderate-quality evidence), similar symptom persistence (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.20; 3 studies, 80 participants; I² = 44%; low-quality evidence), and 24-hour beta-agonist use (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.37; 2 studies, 48 participants; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to identify whether IM corticosteroids are more effective in reducing relapse compared to oral corticosteroids among children or adults discharged from an ED or equivalent acute care setting for acute asthma. While we found no statistical differences, patients receiving IM corticosteroids reported fewer adverse events. Additional studies comparing the effectiveness of IM versus oral corticosteroids could provide further evidence clarity. Furthermore, there is a need for studies comparing different IM corticosteroids (e.g. IM dexamethasone versus IM methylprednisone) and different oral corticosteroids (e.g. oral dexamethasone versus oral prednisone), with consideration for dosing and pharmacokinetic properties, to better identify the optimal IM or oral corticosteroid regimens to improve patient outcomes. Other factors, such as patient preference and potential issues with adherence, may dictate practitioner prescribing.

### Initial corticosteroid therapy for asthma [^116QL7X4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the commencement of maintenance pharmacotherapy for asthma: inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with long-acting beta2 agonists.

Recent Findings

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials has examined the starting dose of inhaled corticosteroids (high, moderate, low) and the dose regimen (step down versus constant) in asthma. There was no significant difference in key asthma outcomes for step down compared with a constant inhaled corticosteroid dose. There was no significant difference between high or moderate dose inhaled corticosteroid groups (n = 11) for morning peak expiratory flow, symptoms and rescue medication use. There may be a benefit from high-dose inhaled corticosteroids for airway hyperresponsiveness. There was a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow and nocturnal symptoms in favour of a moderate inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with low-dose treatment. Long-acting beta2 agonists combined with inhaled corticosteroids as initial asthma therapy has been examined in a systematic review of nine randomized controlled trials. Inhaled corticosteroids combined with long-acting beta2 agonists led to significant improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s, morning peak expiratory flow, symptom score and symptom-free days but no difference in exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. A randomized controlled trial of patients with uncontrolled asthma found a benefit of escalating doses of salmeterol/fluticasone compared with fluticasone on asthma control.

Summary

Initial inhaled corticosteroid therapy should begin with a constant, moderate dose. Initial therapy with long-acting beta2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids achieves superior improvement in symptoms and lung function, and at a quicker rate than inhaled corticosteroids alone. There is no benefit in terms of reduced exacerbations unless an escalating inhaled corticosteroid dose strategy is used.

### Prospective, placebo-controlled trial of 5 vs 10 days of oral prednisolone in acute adult asthma [^113Uxxwd]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral steroid treatment in the management of acute adult asthma is unclear. We prospectively studied the effect of 5 vs. 10 days of oral prednisolone in patients with acute asthma requiring hospital admission.

Methods

Each patient received 40 mg of enteric-coated prednisolone daily for 5 days, followed by 5 days of 40 mg prednisolone daily (n = 24) or placebo (n = 20). All were given their usual inhaled asthma therapy including inhaled corticosteroids. Patients kept PEF and symptom diaries for 21 days.

Results

For the 5-day treatment group mean (95% CI) early morning PEF was 6 (-47,+36) l/min lower to day 21 (P = 0.78). There was no evidence of differences in other PEF measures (morning post-bronchodilator, evening or worst of day). One patient in each group had an exacerbation requiring further oral steroids during the 21-day observation period. Asthma symptom scores were worse in the 5-day group on days 6–21 but the significance of this finding was uncertain, as a difference had emerged by day 5 (prior to trial entry).

Conclusions

It may be possible to reduce the standard steroid course to 5 days in acute adult asthma, provided all patients receive inhaled steroids and a personal asthma management plan.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^116kVhmb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future direction

Despite the advent of targeted biologics and OCS drawbacks and disadvantages, corticosteroids continue to be used in asthma management. The goal is to find ways to greatly reduce or eliminate their long‐term use and to better balance the safety and effectiveness of asthma treatments.

There are gaps in knowledge and practice related to OCS stewardship. Systemic corticosteroids are the option of last resort in Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 5 treatment, and GINA recommends gradual decrease and/or discontinuation of OCS after patients achieve a good response to biologic therapies. Ideally, the role of OCS will continue to narrow as the use of novel therapies targeting specific pathways increases.

In order to prevent both the systemic effects and the development of AI associated with long‐term OCS use, steroid‐sparing strategies are needed to advance safety amongst patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Treatments that directly target airway inflammation offer improved overall control of asthma and reduce OCS use. Biologic therapies greatly decrease the role of OCS and, in many cases, eliminate their need entirely.

Education is key to elevating awareness of optimal asthma control for patients, as well as steroid‐sparing strategies amongst clinicians. Ongoing clinical trials are already changing clinical practice by guiding the tapering of OCS and the screening and management of AI after introducing biologics. Importantly, substantial and long‐lasting modifications in prescribing patterns of OCS may well require changes to healthcare systems and collaborations amongst different specialties.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma: common clinical quandaries [^113K8Ar4]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

This narrative review provides evidence-based explanations to some of the common clinical concerns regarding inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for a newly diagnosed asthmatic patient. Better results are obtained when treatment is initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Asthma control can be achieved and maintained in most patients with a low or moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroid administered in two daily doses. Longer duration of treatment provides more sustained benefits than treatment that is intermittent and for short periods of time. The clinical benefits can be observed within 24 hours of commencing treatment and may be more pronounced in patients with an eosinophilic bronchitis. Inhaled corticosteroids provide additional benefit when used in conjunction with prednisone in acute severe asthma. Low doses do not have clinically deleterious side effects on the bones, growth, eye, or hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis. However, they do not normalize lung function and prevent structural changes in the airway wall in all asthmatic patients.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^114HuCD1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Actively Address Asthma Exacerbation Management and Prevention

Best Practice Advice 5: Recognize the cumulative adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids (SCS) use and work to avoid their overuse by preventing future exacerbations

While some asthma exacerbations may require SCS, earlier recognition and use of ICS with SABA or fast-acting LABA for quick relief or early in an exacerbation may mitigate the need for SCS. Rarely, if ever, are SCS required for effective maintenance management, and their use should be minimized where possible due to potential short-term and long-term adverse effects.

Adverse effects resulting from SCS use occur based on cumulative lifetime dose, starting at doses as low as 500 mg of prednisone or equivalent and less than 30 days of exposure. Adverse effects of SCS can occur with both chronic and repeated episodic use with cumulative doses ≥ 1000 mg of prednisone equivalent per year, regardless of the length of treatment. A common regimen for exacerbation management is prednisone (or equivalent) 40–60 mg for 5–10 days, adding up to a cumulative dose of 200–600 mg per exacerbation, approaching or exceeding the long-term effect risk threshold after even a single course of SCS. Higher cumulative SCS doses are associated with increases in cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, fractures, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, kidney impairment, cataracts, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, type 2 diabetes, and weight gain –.

To limit the use of SCS, PCCs can implement asthma treatment that appropriately uses ICS-based therapies in both acute and maintenance regimens, thereby reducing the risk of exacerbations and the need for SCS. PCCs should include monitoring patients for adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially among those with multiple courses of SCS therapy over the years of their asthma care.

### Systematic literature review of systemic corticosteroid use for asthma management [^114kiGgE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, this review demonstrates that OCS and SCS, including long-term OCS, continue to be commonly used and overused for the management of asthma across the disease spectrum and particularly for severe asthma. This use is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Importantly, patients receiving repeated short-term, high OCS dosages may incur a greater risk of AEs than those receiving long-term, low dosages, as the risk of AEs increases with the cumulative OCS dosage. The introduction of biologics has led to a reduction in OCS use in other disease areas, but our review shows that a similar change has not yet occurred for asthma. This is because biologics have only recently been approved for the treatment of severe asthma. Omalizumab was the only add-on biologic therapy available for the treatment of severe asthma during the time periods covered in many of the identified studies. The recent approval of further biologic treatments that reduce asthma symptoms and exacerbation risks and allow OCS tapering for OCS-dependent patients has the potential to reduce future OCS use for patients with asthma.

### Partner randomized controlled trial: study protocol and coaching intervention [^113akCb2]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Short-acting beta 2 -agonists are the treatment of choice for relieving acute symptoms, and systemic corticosteroids may speed recovery and prevent recurrence of exacerbations. Early treatment with these "rescue medications" in an acute exacerbation can reduce ED visits, improve patient outcomes, and can be managed effectively by the parent guided by a written Asthma Action Plan (AAP). Yet, many families come to the ED because of a delayed response to the child's early asthma signs, or failure to implement the steps detailed on their AAP.

Morbidity is reduced and ICS use is higher in patients who report regularly scheduled asthma visits. The guidelines recommend 1) periodic assessments (every 1 to 6 months) to monitor asthma control, assess if the goals of therapy are being met, review medication use and the child's AAP, and adjust treatment as needed; 2) asthma self-management education at diagnosis, with review and reinforcement at every opportunity; 3) a partnership between the primary care provider (PCP), the patient and their family to develop shared treatment goals, select an appropriate treatment regimen, resolve asthma-related concerns, and provide support for day-to-day care. However, maintenance asthma care delivered by PCPs is not optimal. Only 50% of asthmatic children report maintenance care visits twice a year, 70% report some asthma education, and 30–50% have an AAP. Pediatricians report that lack of familiarity with the complex guidelines, lack of agreement with some recommendations, low self-efficacy in their ability to improve patient's self-management behaviors, low expectation of improvements, and the perceived associated high workload deter them from following guideline recommendations. In addition, logistical issues such as lack of time, educational materials, support staff, and inadequate reimbursement are significant barriers to guideline implementation.

### Oral corticosteroids tapering in severe asthma [^114h8Swb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

First marketed 70 years ago, corticosteroids transformed the life of patients suffering from asthma and quickly became the mainstay of treatment for this condition. Despite major developments in therapeutic options since, particularly with the use of inhaled corticosteroids more than 40 years ago, the powerful antiinflammatory effects of oral corticosteroids (OCS) are as of yet impossible to replace completely, explaining their persistent use in asthma management. Most of the time, they are prescribed intermittently to treat severe exacerbations, although some patients require them chronically to achieve asthma control. However, OCS are associated with well-recognized long-term side effects and an increase in mortality. Recent evidence suggests that this risk is related to the cumulative lifetime exposure to OCS, implying that even repeated short courses may have a significant impact on their associated morbidity.

More recently, monoclonal antibodies brought the first real long-term alternative to OCS in severe asthma since the 1950s. They are powerful antiinflammatory agents targeting T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) inflammation with minimal side effects and with corticosteroid-sparing properties. Their availability provoked a change in OCS perception in severe asthma, from a necessary evil to an increasingly avoidable one. With the increasing use of biologics, tapering and cessation of maintenance OCS has become much more common and feasible, but specific guidance on how to proceed is lacking.

Numerous studies exploring steroid-sparing drugs have reported their OCS weaning protocols. The OCS tapering regimens used were quite variable, as were the assessments of asthma control, biomarker use, and screening for adrenal insufficiency, thus making generalization difficult. Many of them also lacked the details needed to be efficiently implemented in clinical practice. An exception would be the ongoing PONENTE trial, investigating the safety and efficacy of OCS tapering after initiation of benralizumab. Although not evidenced-based, it provides a detailed OCS reduction algorithm with systematic assessment of adrenal insufficiency that could be used by clinicians.

Research and guidelines have recognized the need to reach the minimal effective dose when OCS are needed for long-term treatment of severe asthma. To achieve this, their focus and advice has been to optimize asthma control strategies and use of OCS-sparing drugs without clear guidance on how to actually proceed with weaning. Hence, there are currently no standardized guidelines on how and when to safely perform OCS tapering. A recent review identified this lack of clear recommendations as a clinical barrier to reduce OCS exposure in severe asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1157R5if]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

### Similar efficacy of ciclesonide versus prednisolone to treat asthma worsening after steroid tapering [^114Hd5UY]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

Oral corticosteroids effectively treat asthma exacerbations but are associated with well-described side effects.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and safety of a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid with oral prednisolone in patients with worsening of their asthma after medication withdrawal.

Methods

Patients tapered off their inhaled corticosteroids until they reached predefined criteria of "worsening asthma". Randomized patients (n = 130) were treated double blind with either ciclesonide 800mug twice daily (starting with 800mug hourly for 3h after randomization) or prednisolone 40mg once daily for 2 weeks. Spirometry, daily asthma symptoms, morning and evening peak expiratory flow and blood parameters were assessed in all, methacholine challenge and inflammatory measures were determined in induced sputum in a subset of patients.

Results

Ciclesonide was as effective as prednisolone in improving forced expiratory flow in 1s, morning peak expiratory flow and symptoms, the latter improving more rapidly with ciclesonide. No differences were found in methacholine responsiveness or inflammatory measures in sputum or blood. Ciclesonide caused significantly less reduction in morning plasma cortisol levels (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

This study shows that inhaled ciclesonide (800mug twice daily) has comparable efficacy to oral prednisolone (40mg once daily) to regain asthma control in patients with asthma worsening. The more rapid onset and smaller effect on cortisol suppression suggest a better safety profile of ciclesonide.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112c8V5R]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### AARC and PALISI clinical practice guideline: pediatric critical asthma [^114ad4x5]. Respiratory Care (2025). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid regimen — Recommendation 8 states, "We suggest the use of either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone (or an equivalent dose of prednisone/prednisolone) for children treated for critical asthma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)", addressing the question of whether, in children presenting with critical asthma, dexamethasone or methylprednisolone (or an equivalent dose of prednisone/prednisolone) should be administered as the systemic corticosteroid regimen; background notes that recent evidence has suggested that dexamethasone may be similarly effective to prednisone for the management of asthma exacerbations in the ED and hospital setting although the quality of this evidence is low, and the evidence base comprised 2 RCTs, 1 quasi-randomized trial, and 6 observational studies, including four observational studies before and after an institutional protocol change that transitioned to the use of dexamethasone for acute asthma management and 2 additional studies leveraging the Pediatric Health Information System database.

### The use of β ₂-agonist therapy before hospital attendance for severe asthma exacerbations: a post-hoc analysis [^112dFXov]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Implications for future research, policy and practice

There was delay in obtaining medical review or initiating oral prednisone despite high β 2 -agonist use above the predefined levels indicating the requirement for medical review and intervention in half of the patients. This is likely to be an underestimate of the frequency of delay in obtaining medical review and intervention in clinical practice, as the patients were closely followed up in the setting of the clinical trial with implementation of personalised asthma management plans, reinforced at regular clinic review. During periods of overuse, the opportunity exists for patients to seek medical review and receive appropriate medical intervention to reduce the risk of a life-threatening attack. The importance of this behaviour is underlined by the repeated findings from asthma mortality surveys, which showed that marked overuse of β 2 -agonist drugs and associated delay in seeking medical review are important factors contributing to a fatal outcome. In the recent United Kingdom National Review of Asthma Deaths, 39% of patients had been prescribed more than 12 short-acting reliever inhalers in the year before death, and 4% of the patients had been prescribed more than 50 reliever inhalers. During the final attack of asthma, 45% died without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided.

Nonadherence to maintenance ICS therapy before hospital attendance was observed in the Standard group. The use of the SMART regimen reduced nonadherence with ICS therapy, which together with the increased self-administration of ICS therapy in the setting of worsening asthma is likely to be responsible for the reduction in severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids with its use.

Conclusions

In conclusion, many patients take very high doses of inhaled β 2 -agonists for prolonged periods before presentation to hospital with severe asthma. During this period, the opportunity exists to seek medical review and appropriate medical intervention to reduce the risk of a life-threatening attack. The SMART regimen led to reduced nonadherence with ICS therapy, which together with the increased self-administration of ICS therapy in the setting of worsening asthma is likely to be responsible for the reduction in severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids with its use.

### Pharmacological strategies for self-management of asthma exacerbations [^112t4zcC]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Written action plans are effective within asthma self-management, but there are few guidelines about the specific medication adjustments which can be recommended for self-treatment of exacerbations. This review examines pharmacological strategies for self-management of asthma exacerbations in adults, including those for inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2-agonist (ICS/LABA) users. Oral corticosteroids are well-established in clinical practice and clinical trials for the treatment of severe exacerbations, including during combination therapy. Evidence supports 7–10 days treatment, with no need to taper except to reduce side-effects. Doubling the dose of ICS is not effective. Several studies have shown benefit from high-dose ICS (2,400–4,000 microg beclomethasone equivalent) for 1–2 weeks. This may be achieved by adding a high-dose ICS inhaler to maintenance ICS or ICS/LABA therapy. There is inconclusive evidence about acutely increasing the dose of maintenance budesonide/formoterol for exacerbations, and no studies of this approach with fluticasone/salmeterol. For patients taking maintenance budesonide/formoterol, use of the same medication as-needed reduces exacerbations. Short-acting beta2-agonists are still effective in producing bronchodilation during combination therapy; however, a higher dose may be required. There is a need for further studies to clarify remaining issues about self-management of asthma exacerbations, particularly with regard to side-effects of treatment and patient acceptability.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

Self-management of worsening asthma — criteria for adding oral corticosteroids (OCS) specify that if PEF or FEV1 < 60% best, or not improving after 48 hours, continue reliever, continue controller, contact doctor, and add prednisolone* 40–50 mg/day; additionally, add OCS for severe exacerbations (e.g. PEF or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted), or patient not responding to treatment over 48 hours, with adults taking prednisolone* 40–50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days, and tapering is not needed if OCS are prescribed for less than 2 weeks.

### Oral corticosteroids tapering in severe asthma [^116Mvwhq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The OCS consensus report in this issue of the Journal puts forward the important concept of cumulative OCS exposure. Physicians tend to underestimate repeated OCS bursts' long-term side effects. However, research has revealed that there is no benign OCS prescription, as the risk of adverse events is cumulative and escalates with each treatment. An increase in morbidity is seen after only four short courses of OCS. In terms of lifetime cumulative dose, most side effects begin after 1–2.5 g, but the diabetes incidence starts to increase after only 0.5 g. This may be reflected in the 0.5–1 g yearly threshold chosen by the expert panel to indicate poor asthma control. Hopefully, this statement will raise awareness on the consequences of using OCS and reinforce the recommendation that all options must be considered before considering OCS.

Experts agreed that OCS tapering should be attempted in every patient and the Delphi method achieved a consensus on several statements concerning OCS decrease, which are summarized in the graphical abstract available in the publication. Although it does not constitute a specific algorithm, for the first time, it provides clinicians with management strategies on how to proceed with OCS tapering. Many aspects to consider when undertaking OCS weaning were covered, but no agreement could be reached regarding biomarkers. Yet, evidence exists linking OCS responsiveness to Th2 inflammation and small studies suggested that sputum eosinophils, blood eosinophils, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide could be useful in OCS dose adjustments. A large, randomized trial exploring the value of composite biomarkers to titrate OCS therapy should bring more evidence to support biomarker use for OCS tapering.

Major advances have been made in asthma care in the last two decades. OCS, once a frequently unavoidable treatment for severe asthma, are progressively being replaced by safer options. We can dream of a day when OCS will not be needed anymore in asthma management, but until then, we should learn to use them cautiously. Suehs and colleagues provide expert advice establishing groundwork to regulate OCS use. Research will be needed to substantiate future recommendations with evidence-based data.

### Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations? [^111Yww9g]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A short course of systemic corticosteroids is an important therapy in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. Although a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1–2 days) with potential for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the inpatient setting.

Methods

A Medline search was conducted on the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates and symptomatic return to baseline.

Results

Six completed pediatric clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and less vomiting.

Conclusions

The current literature suggests that dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.

### Acute asthma, prognosis, and treatment [^1121MFNw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma affects about 300 million people globally and accounts for 1 in every 250 deaths in the world. Approximately 12 million people in the United States each year experience an acute exacerbation of their asthma, a quarter of which require hospitalization. Acute asthma should be differentiated from poor asthma control. Patients with acute asthma will exhibit increasing shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, and/or wheezing. In contrast, poor asthma control typically presents with a diurnal variability in airflow and is a characteristic that is usually not seen during an acute exacerbation. The history should include a review of comorbidities, adherence to medications, previous episodes of near-fatal asthma, and whether the patient has experienced multiple emergency department visits or hospitalizations, particularly those requiring admission to an intensive care unit involving respiratory failure, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Patient education is important to ensure that the patient understands that asthma is mostly a chronic disease and necessitates the avoidance of allergens, prevention of infections, adherence with routine vaccinations, management of comorbid conditions, and adherence to treatment regimens. This article is a structured review of the available literature regarding the diagnosis and management of acute asthma.

### Doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to prevent asthma exacerbations: randomised controlled trial [^111dqCZv]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Asthma self-management plans that include doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when the condition deteriorates improve asthma control. Whether doubling the dose of corticosteroid in isolation is effective is unknown. We undertook a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteriods when asthma deteriorates.

Methods

390 individuals with asthma who were at risk of an exacerbation monitored their morning peak flow and asthma symptoms for up to 12 months. When peak flow or symptoms started to deteriorate, participants added an active or placebo corticosteroid inhaler to their usual corticosteroid for 14 days to produce a doubling or no change in dose. The primary outcome was the number of individuals starting oral prednisolone in each group.

Findings

During 12 months, 207 (53%) started their study inhaler and 46 (12%) started prednisolone — 22 (11%) of 192 and 24 (12%) of 198 in the active and placebo groups, respectively. The risk ratio for starting prednisolone was therefore 0.95 (95% CI 0.55–1.64, p = 0.8).

Interpretation

We recorded little evidence to support the widely recommended intervention of doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when asthma control starts to deteriorate.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution) [^112arHyN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (25 mg prednisolone per 5 mL) may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution (33.6 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

Cortisone, 125 Triamcinolone, 20

Hydrocortisone, 100 Paramethasone, 10

Prednisolone, 25 Betamethasone, 3.75

Prednisone, 25 Dexamethasone, 3.75

Methylprednisolone, 20

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Oral corticosteroids tapering in severe asthma [^113aNT8T]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Suehs and colleagues (pp.) provide an expert consensus report on the important topic of OCS use and tapering in patients with asthma, including statements on less frequent conditions such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. A modified Delphi method was used to develop a consensus (> 70% agreement) among 131 experts from different specialties, mostly pulmonologists (73%) and allergists (18%), in addition to patient advocacy organization representatives. Although opinions sometimes differed, some general principles for use and reduction of OCS were agreed on.

This study is a first major attempt to provide clinicians with guidelines based on expert opinion specifically on OCS use for asthma. In the absence of evidenced-based clinical data to support such recommendations, using a Delphi approach to reach consensus statements is a sensible and pragmatic approach. The study included a considerable number of experts, more than expected in a usual Delphi method. However, the criteria used for expert selection were sound and the resulting panel, although large, had the required expertise in severe asthma needed to provide valuable opinions.

The project undertaken by the panel of experts is substantial, with 296 final statements to agree on, from an initial 1,447 raw statements produced from brainstorming. Nevertheless, the participating experts were dedicated, with 96 of the 131 answering the three ranking rounds.

In line with current recommendations, almost all experts on the panel (95%) agreed that our goal should be not to use OCS, but they also acknowledged that maintenance OCS, although a last resort, are still required in some situations. On this matter, the optimal daily OCS dose-reaching consensus was equivalent to 5 mg of prednisone. Up until now, only the Global Initative for Asthma group committed to an "acceptable" OCS dose for maintenance therapy and they settled on the dose corresponding to the physiological steroid production, 7.5 mg daily. However, the lower threshold agreed on by the experts may only reflect the submitted statements as it seems that 7.5 mg was not an option to choose from.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117PBi3B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of hospital admission and mortality. They contribute to long-term decline in lung function, physical capacity and quality of life. The most common causes are infective, and treatment includes antibiotics, bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids as anti-inflammatory agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD, and to compare the efficacy of parenteral versus oral administration.

Search Methods

We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and checked references of included studies and trials registries. We conducted the last search in May 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally with an appropriate placebo, or comparing oral corticosteroids with parenteral corticosteroids in the treatment of people with acute exacerbations of COPD. Other interventions (e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics) were standardised for both groups. We excluded clinical studies of acute asthma.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Sixteen studies (n = 1787) met inclusion criteria for the comparison systemic corticosteroid versus placebo and 13 studies contributed data (n = 1620). Four studies (n = 298) met inclusion criteria for the comparison oral corticosteroid versus parenteral corticosteroid and three studies contributed data (n = 239). The mean age of participants with COPD was 68 years, median proportion of males 82% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) per cent predicted at study admission was 40% (6 studies; n = 633). We judged risk of selection, detection, attrition and reporting bias as low or unclear in all studies. We judged risk of performance bias high in one study comparing systemic corticosteroid with control and in two studies comparing intravenous corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid. Systemic corticosteroids reduced the risk of treatment failure by over half compared with placebo in nine studies (n = 917) with median treatment duration 14 days, odds ratio (OR) 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.67). The evidence was graded as high quality and it would have been necessary to treat nine people (95% CI 7 to 14) with systemic corticosteroids to avoid one treatment failure. There was moderate-quality evidence for a lower rate of relapse by one month for treatment with systemic corticosteroid in two studies (n = 415) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97). Mortality up to 30 days was not reduced by treatment with systemic corticosteroid compared with control in 12 studies (n = 1319; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.66).FEV1, measured up to 72 hours, showed significant treatment benefits (7 studies; n = 649; mean difference (MD) 140 mL; 95% CI 90 to 200); however, this benefit was not observed at later time points. The likelihood of adverse events increased with corticosteroid treatment (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.59 to 3.43). Overall, one extra adverse effect occurred for every six people treated (95% CI 4 to 10). The risk of hyperglycaemia was significantly increased (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.86 to 4.19). For general inpatient treatment, duration of hospitalisation was significantly shorter with corticosteroid treatment (MD -1.22 days; 95% CI -2.26 to -0.18), with no difference in length of stay the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Comparison of parenteral versus oral treatment showed no significant difference in the primary outcomes of treatment failure, relapse or mortality or for any secondary outcomes. There was a significantly increased rate of hyperglycaemia in one study (OR 4.89; 95% CI 1.20 to 19.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence to support treatment of exacerbations of COPD with systemic corticosteroid by the oral or parenteral route in reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and relapse by one month, shortening length of stay in hospital inpatients not requiring assisted ventilation in ICU and giving earlier improvement in lung function and symptoms. There is no evidence of benefit for parenteral treatment compared with oral treatment with corticosteroid on treatment failure, relapse or mortality. There is an increase in adverse drug effects with corticosteroid treatment, which is greater with parenteral administration compared with oral treatment.

### Primary care provider preferences for glucocorticoid management of acute asthma exacerbations in children [^116pvstB]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Primary care providers (PCP) frequently care for children with acute asthma exacerbations in the outpatient setting. The objective of this study is to evaluate PCP preferences and perceptions regarding oral glucocorticoids prescribed from both outpatient primary care and ED settings for the treatment of children with acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

PCPs belonging to the Colorado Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics were surveyed between February and May 2019. Survey items were generated by a multidisciplinary team and underwent content and criteria validation and pilot testing. Survey items evaluated PCP preferred oral glucocorticoid and dosing regimen for children with acute asthma exacerbations, provider- and patient-level factors contributing to glucocorticoid preferences, and perception of glucocorticoid regimens in terms of treatment failure, resolution of symptoms and adherence.

Results

A total of 109 of 600 (18.2%) PCPs responded. Equal proportions of PCPs reported preferring oral prednisone/prednisolone (50.5%) and oral dexamethasone (49.5%) for children with acute asthma exacerbations. Forty-four percent of PCPs reported no preference in type of glucocorticoid utilized by surrounding emergency departments (EDs). However, for children receiving dexamethasone in the ED but with persistent symptoms on PCP follow-up, 50.5% of PCPs would switch patients to prednisone/prednisolone. PCPs did not perceive more treatment failure or rapid resolution of symptoms with dexamethasone but reported better adherence with dexamethasone.

Conclusion

There is variability in PCP glucocorticoid management of pediatric acute asthma exacerbations. There is a need for further investigations to evaluate for differences in clinical outcomes based on PCP glucocorticoid treatment choices.

### Geographical differences in the use of oral corticosteroids in patients with severe asthma in Spain: heat map based on existing databases analyses [^1139Zdmw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common and potentially serious chronic inflammatory respiratory disease with a substantial burden on patients, their families, and the community. It causes respiratory symptoms, limitation of activity, and exacerbations that sometimes require urgent health care and might have fatal consequences. The prevalence of asthma is higher in industrialized western countries (10%) compared to the underdeveloped countries (≤ 1%), although this may be due to an underestimation of cases in the less developed health systems. Within western countries, its prevalence is higher in urban areas than in the rural population. It has been estimated that approximately 5–10% of asthma patients have severe disease. Severe asthma is defined as uncontrolled asthma despite adherence with optimized high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS); long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) therapy and treatment of the contributory factors, or disease that worsens when high dose treatment is decreased.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends a stepwise approach to asthma therapy, aiming to optimize symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations. Despite these recommendations, patients with asthma remain at high risk of severe exacerbations due to the lack of adherence to maintenance therapy, overuse of reliever therapy, poor inhaler technique, comorbidities, or difficult-to-treat asthma. Hence, many patients with severe asthma require two or more oral corticosteroid (OCS) bursts per year for managing their exacerbations. According to a recently published analysis of the International Severe Asthma Registry, patients with severe asthma have an average of four severe exacerbations per year, and therefore, require four bursts per year on average. Considering the adverse events associated with the use of OCS, recent guidelines allow their use as the last therapeutic alternative. Furthermore, due to the higher risk of adverse effects, an expert consensus recommends tapering of OCS for the treatment of asthma, while focusing on the general objective of avoiding the use of OCS. However, the use of both maintenance OCS and the repetitive bursts for acute asthma exacerbations lead to cumulative adverse events thereby, increasing the healthcare costs.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to assess progress before stopping oral corticosteroids. Limit treatment to 1–2 days if the oral corticosteroid is dexamethasone, switching to prednisolone if there is a failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112yXkR9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used for conditions such as exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic skin reactions, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a United States insurance database study of 1.5 million adults, 21% had received at least one course of oral glucocorticoids during the last three years, with a median dose of 20 mg prednisone equivalent and a median duration of 6 days. A starting dose of 50 mg of prednisone tapering to zero within 5–7 or 10–14 days are typical treatment regimens for exacerbation of asthma (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention.).

There is no evidence that such short treatment periods lead to clinically relevant suppression of HPA axis, although there is lack of large high-quality studies. Suppression as evaluated by a 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test has been reported. However, this test is less validated than a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test and should be interpreted with caution. While adrenal insufficiency is unlikely after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, clinicians should be aware that even short-term glucocorticoid treatment can lead to complications such as increased incidence of sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolism, and fractures.

R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice)

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115hMT4R]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain close monitoring during exacerbation treatment, and titrate treatment according to the response. Transfer patients immediately to an acute care facility when presenting with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation not responding to treatment or continuing to deteriorate. Obtain close monitoring in patients with little or slow response to short-acting β-agonists.

### Two days of dexamethasone versus 5 days of prednisone in the treatment of acute asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^116tZzDe]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Dexamethasone has a longer half-life than prednisone and is well tolerated orally. We compare the time needed to return to normal activity and the frequency of relapse after acute exacerbation in adults receiving either 5 days of prednisone or 2 days of dexamethasone.

Methods

We randomized adult emergency department patients (aged 18 to 45 years) with acute exacerbations of asthma (peak expiratory flow rate less than 80% of ideal) to receive either 50 mg of daily oral prednisone for 5 days or 16 mg of daily oral dexamethasone for 2 days. Outcomes were assessed by telephone follow-up.

Results

Ninety-six prednisone and 104 dexamethasone subjects completed the study regimen and follow-up. More patients in the dexamethasone group reported a return to normal activities within 3 days compared with the prednisone group (90% versus 80%; difference 10%; 95% confidence interval 0% to 20%; p = 0.049). Relapse was similar between groups (13% versus 11%; difference 2%; 95% confidence interval -7% to 11%, P = 0.67).

Conclusion

In acute exacerbations of asthma in adults, 2 days of oral dexamethasone is at least as effective as 5 days of oral prednisone in returning patients to their normal level of activity and preventing relapse.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to continue systemic (oral) corticosteroids for 5–7 days in adult patients (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and for 3–5 days in pediatric patients (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) to reduce the risk of relapse.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115Sbu4q]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbations in primary or acute care for children 5 years and younger — assess severity while starting SABA and oxygen: "SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 minutes for first hour) and oxygen (to maintain saturation 94–98%)". Recommend escalation and transfer criteria: "Recommend immediate transfer to hospital if there is no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours;… respiratory rate > 40/minute… or if oxygen saturation is < 92% on room air". Systemic corticosteroid options and dosing include: "Consider oral prednisolone/prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day… up to a maximum of 20 mg/day for children aged 0–2 years, and 30 mg/day for children aged 3–5 years, for up to 5 days; or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 days". If relapse or non‑resolution occurs with dexamethasone, "consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone". Note measurement caution: "oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color".

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116KTsTS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.

### The efficacy of dexamethasone compared to prednisone / prednisolone for the management of pediatric patients with acute exacerbation of asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114apMH7]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This updated meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of dexamethasone compared to prednisone/prednisolone for the management of pediatric patients with acute exacerbation of asthma.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched from the inception to March 8, 2025.

Study Selections

Randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of dexamethasone with prednisone/prednisolone on hospital admission, relapse, readmission, length of hospital stay, pediatric respiratory assessment measure (PRAM) score, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, noncompliance, and vomiting among pediatric patients with acute asthma exacerbation were identified. Studies other than randomized controlled trials, studies lacking both groups and those not reporting the outcomes of interest were excluded. A random-effects model was adopted to pool data.

Results

Sixteen studies with 1481 individuals in the dexamethasone group and 1436 individuals in the prednisone/prednisolone group were included. No significant differences were found between dexamethasone and prednisone/prednisolone groups in terms of the risk of hospitalization (RR 0.96, 95% CI (0.79, 1.17), I² = 0.00%), ICU admission (RR 0.64, 95% CI (0.08, 4.88), I² = 0.00%), relapse (RR 0.99, 95% CI (0.71, 1.38), I² = 0.00%), hospital readmission (RR 0.90, 95% CI (0.34, 2.35), I² = 30.98%), the PRAM score (RR -0.24, 95% CI (-0.54, 0.06), I² = 41.30%), the length of hospital stay (RR -2.69h, 95% CI (-6.91, 1.53), I² = 69.50%), and noncompliance (RR 0.47, 95% CI (0.07, 3.01), I² = 65.20%). Moreover, dexamethasone decreased the risk of vomiting (RR 0.39, 95% CI (0.25, 0.59), I² = 26.62%) compared to prednisone-prednisolone.

Conclusion

Dexamethasone was not inferior to prednisolone/prednisone in the management of pediatric asthma exacerbation.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^115o6Ere]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department (ED) visits annually. Between 12 to 16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to locate unpublished studies. The most recent search was run in October 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing two types of corticosteroids (oral, intra-muscular, or inhaled) with placebo for outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Six trials involving 374 people were included. One study used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. The review was split into two reviews and although the latest search yielded no additional placebo controlled trials an additional IM study was included. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (Relative risk (RR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2 to 0.74). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.89) and there were fewer subsequent hospitalizations (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.95). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta(2)-agonists (mean difference (MD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI -5.6 to -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI -0.47 to 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.38 to 0.44) in the first 7 to 10 days, while rarely reported, showed no significant differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. From these results, as few as ten patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Authors' Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an asthma exacerbation significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care, hospitalizations and use of short-acting beta(2)-agonist without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular and oral corticosteroids are both effective.

### Expert consensus on the tapering of oral corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma. A Delphi study [^115xr92v]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: There is a need to minimize oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in patients with asthma to prevent their costly and burdensome adverse effects. Current guidelines do not provide recommendations for OCS tapering in patients with asthma. Objectives: To develop expert consensus on OCS tapering among international experts. Methods: A modified Delphi method was used to develop expert consensus statements relating to OCS use, tapering, adverse effects, adrenal insufficiency, and patient-physician shared decision-making. Initial statements proposed by experts were categorized, filtered for repetition, and presented back to experts over three ranking rounds to obtain consensus (≥ 70% agreement). Measurements and Main Results: One hundred thirty-one international experts participated in the study, and 296 statements were ranked. Numerous recommendations and guidance regarding appropriate OCS use were established. Experts agreed that OCS tapering should be attempted in all patients with asthma receiving maintenance OCS therapy, with personalization of tapering rhythm and speed. The importance of recognizing individual adverse effects was also established; however, a unified approach to the assessment of adrenal insufficiency was not reached. Shared decision-making was considered an important goal during the tapering process. Conclusions: In this Delphi study, expert consensus statements were generated on OCS use, tapering, adverse-effect screening, and shared decision-making, which may be used to inform clinical practice. Areas of nonconsensus were identified, highlighting uncertainty among the experts around some aspects of OCS use in asthma, such as adrenal insufficiency, which underscores the need for further research in these domains.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116gcij6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112G8gaC]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112MXZew]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids in children with severe exacerbations — A dose of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 20 mg/day for children under 2 years of age and 30 mg/day for children aged 2–5 years, is currently recommended (Evidence A). Several studies have failed to show any benefits when OCS are given earlier during periods of worsening wheeze managed in an outpatient setting, whereas a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of hospitalization when OCS were administered in the emergency department, but no clear benefit when given in the outpatient setting. A course of 3–5 days is sufficient in most children of this age and can be stopped without tapering, but the child must be reviewed after discharge to confirm recovery. In children discharged from the emergency department, an intramuscular corticosteroid may be an alternative to a course of OCS for preventing relapse, but the risk of long-term adverse effects must be considered and there is insufficient evidence to recommend intramuscular over oral corticosteroids.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^111o8dnF]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Yellow zone asthma — ICS dose escalation evidence indicates that several recent randomized controlled studies have failed to demonstrate that doubling doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in those already receiving ICS therapy is effective, whereas the EPR3 guidelines state that the preliminary evidence suggests that quadrupling the dose of an ICS for 7 days, starting at the first appearance of worsening symptoms, can prevent exacerbations. In a randomized trial, 208 patients at least 16 years old with current asthma stabilized on an ICS (200–1,000 μg of beclomethasone) were randomized to placebo or a quadrupled ICS dose, with intervention criteria of worsening asthma control, onset of an upper respiratory tract infection (RTI), peak expiratory flow (PEF) decrease by 15% on 2 consecutive days, or PEF decrease by 30% on 1 day; OCS-requiring exacerbations occurred in Eighteen of 197 (9%) versus 29 of 203 (14%), yielding a risk ratio of 0.64 (95% confidence limits 0.37 — 1.11, P = 0.11), and per-protocol analysis showed a risk ratio of 0.43 for requiring an OCS.

### Building toolkits for COPD exacerbations: lessons from the past and present [^113rXDqd]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Exacerbation treatment

Despite a greater understanding of the biology and complexity of COPD exacerbations, this has not (yet) translated into novel therapies to treat exacerbations. There has been no new intervention to treat COPD exacerbations since the widespread adoption of non-invasive ventilation to treat exacerbations with hypercapnoeic respiratory failure in the early 1990s. From the first introduction of guidelines such as GOLD in 1997, the therapy for an exacerbation is unchanged. As described below, despite being commonly used, there remain significant research knowledge gaps in determining which exacerbations do and do not require treatments with antibiotics and corticosteroids.

Systemic corticosteroids were first used in rheumatological disease during the late 1940s. Despite evidence in the late 1980s that many hospitalised patients were being treated with systemic corticosteroids, it was only at the turn of the millennium that small randomised clinical trails (RCTs)first documented clinical efficacy, suggesting benefit on lung function and outcomes such as length of hospital stay. Around the same time, the first small outpatient trials of steroids at exacerbation reported, with modest benefits confirmed in a larger 2003 RCT. Later it was defined that short course (5 days) treatment was as effective as longer 14 day courses, and without the need to taper dose. With a greater emphasis on exacerbation phenotyping, more recent studies have documented the ability to safely withhold steroids in exacerbations without an eosinophil signal. However, the practicality of achieving this at point-of-care, and the optimal blood eosinophil cut-off to guide steroid therapy remain to be determined, and there are ongoing trials in the area. Given the toxicity associated with repeated courses of corticosteroids, the need for effective novel anti-inflammatory agents is also great. Disappointingly, there is no evidence of benefit with the anti-TNF agent entanerceptor roflumilast, for example.

### Managing corticosteroid-related comorbidities in severe asthma [^117CjTVa]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in severe asthma remains all too common despite advances in asthma treatment. Use of OCS is associated with significant toxicity that can have a lasting adverse impact on a patient's overall health. Monoclonal antibodies have been developed that reduce both the rate of occurrence of OCS-treated exacerbations and the OCS requirements in patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. This article describes strategies to prevent and best manage endocrine complications associated with OCS use and provides guidance on OCS dose management after the introduction of steroid-sparing therapies. (1) We identify OCS-dependent patients and assess for comorbidities including bone health, glycemic control, and adrenal function; (2) we begin attempts at OCS dose optimization before or soon after introducing a steroid-sparing biologic therapy; (3) we taper OCS, using explicit criteria for asthma control; (4) we assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis integrity once a physiologic dose of OCS is achieved to guide further the rate of OCS taper; and (5) we manage corticosteroid-related comorbidities as detailed in this article.

The evolution of eligibility criteria since the key single-center study has led over time to study populations in the larger multicenter studies that more precisely reflect patients for whom biologic therapy is appropriate in real-world clinical practice. The inclusion criteria for the most recent studies ensured that patients have severe asthma with active eosinophilic inflammation. In addition, the need for stable OCS use prior to initiation of a biologic has been introduced, with three of the four most recent studies (SIRIUS, VENTURE and PONENTE) requiring a stable OCS dose prior to enrollment/screening.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111vyWEz]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

### Randomized clinical trial of intramuscular vs oral methylprednisolone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations following discharge from an emergency department [^111rqBzF]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of long-acting IM methylprednisolone to tapering oral methylprednisolone in adult asthmatic patients discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a single IM dose of 160 mg depot methylprednisolone vs 8-day tapering of a total dose of 160 mg oral methylprednisolone in adult asthmatic patients (age range, 18 to 45 years) who were discharged from the ED following standardized treatment for an acute exacerbation. The primary end point was relapse, which was defined as the need to seek unscheduled care at a doctor's office, clinic, or ED for symptoms of persistent or worsening asthma within 10 days of ED discharge.

Results

Of 190 patients enrolled into the study, 180 completed the study and the follow-up at 10 days (96%). The relapse rate was nearly identical for the two treatment groups (IM administration, 14.1% [13 of 92 patients]; oral administration, 13.6% [12 of 88 patients]; difference, 0.5% [95% confidence interval, - 9.6 to 10.6%]).

Conclusions

Single-dose IM methylprednisolone administered to adult asthmatic patients at ED discharge appears to be a viable therapeutic alternative to a course of oral methylprednisolone. Clinicians may choose to base the route of administration of corticosteroids on concerns about nonadherence to therapy or on the ability of a patient to afford a prescription for outpatient medication.

Glucocorticoid tapering safety — Evidence from included studies: One study considered only the patient group tapering glucocorticoids (n = 131), and another evaluated a rapid, individualized steroid-reduction algorithm after benralizumab initiation in 598 patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma; across all five studies, the data showed no symptomatic adrenal insufficiency or clinical events related to potential adrenal insufficiency during follow-up. The authors note that these results suggest it is often safe to stop glucocorticoids abruptly after short-term high-dose use, and that after long-term use, more rapid tapering at supraphysiologic dosing followed by a slower taper at physiologic dosing appears safe; no studies compared different tapering schemes.

### Development of methodology for assessing steroid-tapering in clinical trials for biologics in asthma [^116FxViv]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Trial design and OCS-tapering schedule

In the key single-center study, the OCS dose was reduced providing the patient had not experienced a defined exacerbation and target doses were 0, 2.5 and 5 mg/day in patients requiring daily OCS doses of < 10, 10– < 15 and ≥ 15 mg/day at baseline, respectively. Additional information detailing the criteria for not further reducing OCS dose during the OCS reduction period for each study can be found in the Additional file 1.

Building upon the OCS-tapering methodology used in the single-center study, the subsequent trials were able to use a more tailored approach (Fig. 1 a and b). SIRIUS was the first study to include an OCS dose optimization phase, which aimed to reduce a patient's OCS dose to the lowest possible effective dose while maintaining asthma control prior to randomization to biologic treatment. During the 3–8-week OCS dose optimization phase in SIRIUS, OCS dose was reduced weekly until asthma worsening was observed, defined as worsening of asthma symptoms (a ≥ 0.5-point increase in Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]-5 score) or an exacerbation. The optimized OCS dose was the dose that was one titration step higher than the OCS dose received when the patient saw an onset of asthma worsening; the patient then maintained this optimized dose for 2 weeks. Subsequently, patients entered the induction phase (4 weeks) where they were randomized to biologic or placebo treatment, stratified by previous duration of OCS use (< 5 years versus ≥ 5 years) as previously noted and received the optimized dose of OCS. Following the induction phase, patients entered a 16-week dose reduction phase in which the OCS dose was reduced in a stepwise manner based on asthma control and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, with a target of 0 mg/day only for those who had reached an optimized dose of < 25 mg/day prior to randomization (Fig. 1 a). For those on an optimized dose ≥ 25 mg/day, a target of 0 mg/day was not possible within the 24-week study in order to protect the patient from the risk of adrenal crisis. It is unclear whether the inclusion of multiple sites in multiple countries impacted the optimization of OCS dose, given the likelihood that OCS management practices varied across these sites/countries, and this may also be applicable to the other multicenter studies reported in this article.

### The patient with asthma in the emergency department [^112h47vp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is a highly prevalent disease that presents commonly to the emergency department (ED) in acute exacerbation. Recent asthma treatment guidelines have added content dedicated to the management of acute exacerbations. Effective management of an exacerbation requires rapid assessment of severity through physical examination, measurement of peak expiratory flow rate, and response to initial treatment. Most therapies are directed at alleviating bronchospasm and decreasing airway inflammation. While inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen are the initial and often only therapies required for patients with mild moderate exacerbations, high-dose beta agonists and inhaled anti-cholinergics should also be given to patients with severe exacerbations. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous magnesium and Heliox-driven nebulization of bronchodilators should be considered for patients presenting with severe and very severe exacerbations. Early recognition and appropriate management of respiratory failure are required to mitigate the risk of complications including death. Disposition should be determined based on serial assessments of the response to therapy over the first 4 h in the ED. Patients stable for discharge should receive medications, asthma education including a written asthma action plan, and should have follow-up scheduled for them by ED staff. Rapid implementation of evidence-based, multi-disciplinary care is required to ensure the best possible outcomes for this potentially treatable disease.

### Clinical management and outcome of refractory asthma in the UK from the British thoracic society difficult asthma registry [^114fCYcr]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

This audit provides the first outcome data on a well characterised cohort of adults with severe refractory asthma. We report significant changes in important healthcare outcomes, particularly reductions in unscheduled visits, hospital admissions and rescue oral steroids, which taken collectively suggests a reduction in severe exacerbations. Improvement was also seen in lung function, but notably daily reliever medication use was not different, suggesting persistent symptomatic morbidity in this group. Because of the precise characterisation of this group, we believe this is due to asthma and not other non-asthma comorbidities.

As this is an observational clinical registry, we cannot exclude the possibility that the improvement in healthcare outcomes simply represents 'regression to the mean', since at the time of referral and initial assessment, patients are likely to be clinically unwell. However, 60–75% of patients in these centres are tertiary referrals and had difficult asthma for prolonged periods prior to assessment, making regression to the mean unlikely to be the entire explanation for the observed improvement. Even at baseline, in this severe asthmatic population, hospital admission rate was relatively low, but unscheduled healthcare contact and rescue steroid courses were high. With appropriate specialist management, hospital admission rates were further reduced, suggesting the economic cost of refractory asthma is unlikely to be driven by hospital admission.

The commonest therapeutic strategy was initiation of maintenance steroids, which is consistent with the reduction in peripheral blood eosinophils and the reduction in rescue oral steroid courses. The dissociation between FeNO, clinical outcome and blood eosinophilia is consistent with other data, which have shown that FeNO-based strategies have not been able to reduce exacerbation rates. In a recent oral steroid tapering study, which included FeNO as part of the steroid reduction algorithm, weekly Asthma Control Questionnaire and forced expiratory volume in 1 s measurement were the major drivers of steroid reduction, with minimal contribution from daily FeNO. Collectively, these data question whether FeNO is useful in adjusting steroid dose in patients on maintenance or frequent bursts of oral steroids.

The increase in BMI is also consistent with more steroid exposure, but BMI also increased in subjects not on maintenance oral steroids at follow-up. This latter group remained on high-dose inhaled steroids but rescue steroid exposure in the preceding 12 months was relatively low (median 1, IQR 0–3), suggesting that BMI increase is not exclusively related to oral steroid exposure in this population, and reduced exercise capacity due to persistent asthma may be relevant.

### Dexamethasone for acute asthma exacerbations in children: a meta-analysis [^114L3YfA]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Dexamethasone has been proposed as an equivalent therapy to prednisone/prednisolone for acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. Although multiple small trials exist, clear consensus data are lacking. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether intramuscular or oral dexamethasone is equivalent or superior to a 5-day course of oral prednisone or prednisolone. The primary outcome of interest was return visits or hospital readmissions.

Methods

A search of PubMed (Medline) through October 19, 2013, by using the keywords dexamethasone or decadron and asthma or status asthmaticus identified potential studies. Six randomized controlled trials in the emergency department of children ≤ 18 years of age comparing dexamethasone with prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations were included. Data were abstracted by 4 authors and verified by a second author. Two reviewers evaluated study quality independently and interrater agreement was assessed.

Results

There was no difference in relative risk (RR) of relapse between the 2 groups at any time point (5 days RR 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–1.78, Q = 1.86, df = 3, I2 = 0.0%, 10–14 days RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.77–1.67, Q = 0.84, df = 2, I2 = 0.0%, or 30 days RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.03–56.93). Patients who received dexamethasone were less likely to experience vomiting in either the emergency department (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12–0.69, Q = 3.78, df = 3, I2 = 20.7%) or at home (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14–0.74, Q = 2.09, df = 2, I2 = 4.2%).

Conclusions

Practitioners should consider single or 2-dose regimens of dexamethasone as a viable alternative to a 5-day course of prednisone/prednisolone.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117C8Q9T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question II: What Is the Optimal Tapering Scheme in Patients no Longer Requiring Chronic Glucocorticoid Treatment for the Underlying Condition?

Four randomized-controlled trials were included, and one single-arm study. The GRADE table is shown in Supplementary Table S5, and details of the studies are shown in Supplementary Table S6 (see section on Supplementary Material). Three studies compared the effects of a tapering scheme of glucocorticoids vs placebo after short-term use of high dose glucocorticoids in a total of 135 patients with multiple sclerosis, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. One study compared the effects of tapering vs continuing glucocorticoids after long-term use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who achieved remission or low disease activity, so only data of the patient group tapering glucocorticoids (n = 131) were considered. The last study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a rapid, individualized steroid-reduction algorithm after beralizumab initiation in 598 patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma. Although adrenal function was not the primary endpoint of included studies, Burmester et al predefined symptomatic adrenal insufficiency as one of their secondary outcomes, and Menzies-Gow et al as a safety outcome, and from the three other studies data on (serious) adverse events and hospital readmission were used as a proxy for symptomatic adrenal insufficiency/adrenal crisis. The data showed no symptomatic adrenal insufficiency and no clinical events related to potential adrenal insufficiency during follow-up in all five studies.

Although the total number of included patients is relatively small and there is heterogeneity due to various underlying diseases, results from the included studies suggest that it is often safe to stop glucocorticoids abruptly after short-term use of high dose glucocorticoids. After long-term use of glucocorticoids, more rapid tapering of glucocorticoids when on a supraphysiologic dosing, followed by a slower taper when on physiologic glucocorticoid dosing, appears to be a safe strategy. There were no studies identified comparing different tapering schemes.

### Internet-based tapering of oral corticosteroids in severe asthma: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^117BKRRi]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with prednisone-dependent asthma the dose of oral corticosteroids should be adjusted to the lowest possible level to reduce long-term adverse effects. However, the optimal strategy for tapering oral corticosteroids is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether an internet-based management tool including home monitoring of symptoms, lung function and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)) facilitates tapering of oral corticosteroids and leads to reduction of corticosteroid consumption without worsening asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.

Methods

In a 6-month pragmatic randomised prospective multicentre study, 95 adults with prednisone-dependent asthma from six pulmonary outpatient clinics were allocated to two tapering strategies: according to conventional treatment (n = 43) or guided by a novel internet-based monitoring system (internet strategy) (n = 52). Primary outcomes were cumulative sparing of prednisone, asthma control and asthma-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), exacerbations, hospitalisations and patient's satisfaction with the tapering strategy.

Results

Median cumulative sparing of prednisone was 205 (25–75th percentile -221 to 777) mg in the internet strategy group compared with 0 (-497 to 282) mg in the conventional treatment group (p = 0.02). Changes in prednisone dose (mixed effect regression model) from baseline were -4.79 mg/day and +1.59 mg/day, respectively (p < 0.001). Asthma control, asthma-related quality of life, FEV1, exacerbations, hospitalisations and satisfaction with the strategy were not different between groups.

Conclusions

An internet-based management tool including home monitoring of symptoms, lung function and FE(NO) in severe asthma is superior to conventional treatment in reducing total corticosteroid consumption without compromising asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.

### Dexamethasone associated with significantly shorter length of hospital stay compared with a prednisolone-based regimen in pediatric patients with mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations [^117GUhj7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

A retrospective chart review was done to evaluate the efficacy of a course of dexamethasone for pediatric patients hospitalized with a mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbation compared with a prednisone-based regimen. Patients were identified based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10) discharge diagnosis codes for asthma and cross-referenced with pharmacy dispense reports during the study period of June 2011 to January 2016. Baseline characteristics were similar among the 2 groups. The median length of hospital stay in the dexamethasone and prednisolone groups were 1.31 and 1.75 days, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval - 2.1–3.1), P < .001. After accounting for significant confounding variables, the difference in length of stay remained significantly longer in the prednisolone group with a hazard ratio of 1.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.4–2.3), P < .001. A course of dexamethasone is associated with a significantly shorter length of stay for mild to moderate asthma exacerbations compared with a prednisone-based regimen.

### The use of β ₂-agonist therapy before hospital attendance for severe asthma exacerbations: a post-hoc analysis [^115ons9H]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

An exploratory post hoc analysis of data was undertaken from a 24-week multicentre, prospective, open-label, RCT of the SMART versus Standard regimens in asthma patients aged 16 to 65 years. Eligible patients had a physician's diagnosis of asthma, a current prescription for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and at least one asthma exacerbation in the preceding year. Patients who had high baseline reliever use were not excluded, and there was no step-down in maintenance inhaled treatment on entry into the study. Full details of the trial have been published. The Study Protocol is available at, and see the Supplementary Material for further details. All patients provided written informed consent, and the New Zealand Multi-Region Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (MEC/09/11/127).

There were 151 patients randomised to receive 200/6 μg budesonide/formoterol via MDI (Vannair, AstraZeneca NZ Limited, Auckland, New Zealand; this is the MDI formulation of Symbicort Turbuhaler), two actuations twice daily as maintenance with extra doses for relief of symptoms as per the SMART regimen (SMART group), and 152 patients were randomised to receive 200/6 μg budesonide/formoterol via MDI, two actuations twice daily as maintenance with salbutamol 100 μg via MDI (Ventolin, GlaxoSmithKline NZ Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) for relief of symptoms (Standard group). Five study visits occurred over 24 weeks. At the first visit, all participants had their inhaler technique checked and were provided verbal instructions and written asthma self-management plans corresponding to their randomised regimen. Patients who previously had GP-prescribed prednisone for self-initiation during an exacerbation were able to continue with this practice during the study. Patients who self-initiated prednisone for asthma were advised to also seek medical review. This analysis is restricted to patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma that resulted in an acute presentation to a hospital Emergency Department and/or admission to hospital during the study period.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^11765Qen]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department visits annually. Between 12–16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation and this review examines the evidence for using systemic corticosteroids to improve outcomes after discharge from the ED.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register was searched using the terms: a) Asthma OR Wheez* b) Glucocorticoid OR Steroid* AND c) Exacerbat* OR Relapse* OR Emerg*. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to determine if unpublished studies which met the inclusion criteria were available. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials were eligible for selection. Studies were included in this review if they dealt with the outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations using glucocorticoids at discharge and reported either relapse rate or PFTs. Two independent reviewers first identified potentially relevant studies and then selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Agreement was assessed using kappa (k) statistics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers; authors were contacted to verify the extracted data and clarify missing information. When author contact was unsuccessful, missing data were estimated from graphs where possible. Sensitivity, sub-group and overall analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

A search that yielded 229 references identified 169 (73%) original publications. Reviewers identified 8 studies for potential inclusion (k = 0.76); 18 references were added by searching publication reference lists and contact with authors. Of these 26 articles, a total of 7 were included in the overview. Two studies used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.73). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (OR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta-agonists (weighted mean difference (WMD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI: -5.5, -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI: -0.47, 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.44) in the first 7–10 days, while rarely reported, showed no differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. It appears that IM corticosteroids are similarly efficacious to a 7–10 day tapering course of oral agents. From these results, as few as 13 patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an acute exacerbation of asthma significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care and decreases beta-agonist use without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular corticosteroids appear as effective as oral agents.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (orapred) [^114rhsgp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Orapred ODT are packaged in a blister. Patients should be instructed not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. The blister pack should then be peeled open, and the orally disintegrating tablet placed on the tongue, where tablets may be swallowed whole as any conventional tablet, or allowed to dissolve in the mouth, with or without the assistance of water. Orally disintegrating tablet dosage forms are friable and are not intended to be cut, split, or broken.

Multiple Sclerosis

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

Pediatric

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of Orapred may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

Nephrotic Syndrome

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

Asthma

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses.

It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

2.2 Recommended Monitoring

Blood pressure, body weight, routine laboratory studies, including serum potassium and fasting blood glucose, should be obtained at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Appropriate diagnostic studies should be performed in patients with known or suspected peptic ulcer disease and in patients at risk for reactivation of latent tuberculosis infections.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114zsRLf]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (oral corticosteroids), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days in adult patients, and 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years) for moderate or severe exacerbations, especially if the patient is deteriorating or has not responded to increased reliever and/or maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114QTrxX]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbation — oral corticosteroids (OCS) course and risks: OCS should usually be continued for 5–7 days in adults and 3–5 days in children, and patients should be advised about common short‑term side-effects including sleep disturbance, increased appetite, reflux and mood changes. In adults, the risk of sepsis and thromboembolism is also increased after a short course of OCS, and use of 4–5 lifetime courses in adults is associated with a dose‑dependent increased risk of long‑term adverse effects such as osteoporosis, fractures, diabetes, heart failure and cataract. This emphasizes the importance of optimizing asthma management after any severe exacerbation to reduce the risk of further exacerbations.

### Corticosteroids for acute severe asthma in hospitalised patients [^111Egr2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are currently used routinely in the management of acute severe asthma. The optimal dose and route of administration continues to be debated. Some investigators have reported a greater benefit of higher doses of corticosteroids in the management of severe asthma, while others have not.

Objectives

To determine whether higher doses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intravenous or intramuscular) are more effective than lower doses in the management of patients with acute severe asthma requiring hospital admission.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Asthma Register. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they met the following broad inclusion criteria: described as randomised controlled trials, included patients with acute severe asthma, compared different doses of corticosteroids (any route) in 2 or more treatment arms, and had a minimum period of follow up of 24 hours. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and disagreement was resolved by third party adjudication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed as weighted mean differences (WMD) for primary pulmonary function outcomes using a fixed effects model. For the purposes of the review, three broad categories of corticosteroid dose (equivalent dose of methylprednisolone in 24 hours) were defined in advance: low dose (≤ 80 mg), medium dose (> 80 mg and ≤ 360 mg) and high dose (> 360 mg). There were thus 3 main comparison groups: low versus medium dose, medium versus high dose and low versus high dose.

Main Results

Nine trials were included; a total of 344 adult patients have been studied (96 with low dose, 85 with medium dose and 163 with high dose corticosteroids). Only 6 trials provided sufficient data for the meta-analysis. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences detected in % predicted FEV1 among comparison groups after 24, 48 or 72 hours. At 48 hours, the weighted mean difference was -3.3% predicted (95% confidence interval -12.4 to + 5.8) for the low vs medium dose comparison, -1.9% predicted (95% CI -8.1 to + 4.3) for the medium vs high dose comparison and + 0.5% predicted (95% CI - 7.8 to + 8.8) for the low vs high dose comparison. There appeared to be no significant differences in side effects or rates of respiratory failure among the varying doses of corticosteroids. A further search was conducted on 3rd August 2000. No new trials were identified.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences were identified among the different doses of corticosteroids in acute asthma requiring hospital admission. Low dose corticosteroids (≤ 80 mg/day of methylprednisolone or ≤ 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone) appear to be adequate in the initial management of these adult patients. Higher doses do not appear to offer a therapeutic advantage.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115sPaLx]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is no need to taper the dose of oral corticosteroids, either in the short term or over several weeks, in patients on maintenance ICSs.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^114QRn2S]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Yellow zone symptom-based action plan — In mild persistent asthma, intermittent corticosteroid bursts under predetermined criteria consisted of open-label budesonide (800 mcg twice daily) for 10 days or prednisone (0.5 mg/kg of body weight per day) for 5 days if symptoms worsened, and the 3 treatments produced similar increases in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) and similar rates of asthma exacerbations; based on these results, the authors suggest that it is possible to treat mild persistent asthma with short intermittent courses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or oral corticosteroids (OCS) taken when symptoms worsen.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113cb6mr]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD asthma guideline — considerations for stepping down therapy detail patient selection, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) tapering, long-acting beta agonist (LABA) discontinuation, and action planning. Do not reduce ICS dose in patients who cannot be closely monitored, such as those who are planning to travel or have inconsistent follow-up appointments, and avoid stepping down in individuals at high risk of severe exacerbations, such as pregnant individuals or those with recent acute illnesses. For tapering, decrease the ICS dose gradually by 25–50% every 3 months with the goal to reach the lowest effective maintenance dose that continues to control asthma symptoms, and assess asthma symptoms regularly throughout the tapering process to ensure stable control. LABAs can generally be discontinued without a taper, as they do not require a gradual reduction like ICS. Patients should have a written action plan to monitor for any signs of worsening asthma; ensure that the patient has a written asthma action plan that includes instructions for recognizing early signs of worsening asthma and steps to take, including medication adjustments and when to seek medical attention, and make sure they have access to adequate medication and know what actions to take if symptoms return or worsen after discontinuing LABA or stepping down the ICS.

Methods

CAMP inclusion criteria and definition of asthma exacerbation

The CAMP study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial that investigated the safety and efficacy of inhaled budesonide versus nedocromil versus placebo in 1041 pediatric patients over a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. The CAMP Genetics Ancillary Study was approved by the Brigham and Women's Hospital Internal Review Board, protocol # 2015P001622/BWH. Informed consent and assent was obtained from parents and participants respectively.

The trial has been described. Briefly, the inclusion criteria were for 5–12 year old children at time of screening, with chronic asthma symptoms for at least 6 months in the year prior to interview, PC 20 < 12.5 mg/mL, and other factors. Children were excluded if their asthma was severe, had a confounding or complicating condition, or the child could not perform acceptable spirometry or methacholine challenge. Diary card and other clinical characteristics were collected prior to randomization.

Asthma exacerbations were defined as the need for oral prednisone for treatment of asthma which are also called steroid bursts. Clinics instructed patients/caregivers to recognize an asthma exacerbation based on symptoms or by decrease in peak flow to < 80% personal best. Oral prednisone was prescribed "if the patient uses more than 12 puffs of albuterol in 24 hours", or had symptom code described as "one or more asthma episodes that last longer than 2 hours or result in shortened normal activity, seeing a doctor for acute care, or going to a hospital for acute care", or if peak flow dropped to < 50% of personal best despite bronchodilator usage. Prednisone dose and duration in addition to tapering protocol were specified in the protocol, and the physician could decide on an extended course of oral steroid depending on the clinical response.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1164RQb6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Burden of oral corticosteroid use in severe asthma: challenges and opportunities [^115zFbtX]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past 70years, oral corticosteroids (OCS) have played an important role in the management of acute and chronic asthma; however, their use is associated with an increased incidence of adverse events, chronic diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes, and mortality, as well as increased healthcare resource utilization and costs. Despite a consensus that the use of OCS should be minimized in asthma treatment strategies, many patients still routinely receive long-term or frequent short courses of OCS. Add-on biologics can help to improve asthma control in patients with severe asthma and evidence of type 2 inflammation; in clinical trials and real-world studies, both short- and long-term OCS-sparing effects have been demonstrated. In this review, we discuss the benefits and burdens of OCS in patients with severe asthma from the perspective of both patients and healthcare providers and outline potential methods for reducing reliance on OCS. Given the risk of adrenal insufficiency or crisis upon cessation of OCS, we discuss the need for clear guidance and algorithms for the tapering of OCS together with the requirement for multidisciplinary patient-provider interactions as part of an effective OCS stewardship scheme.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^113xqzFL]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Interventions

Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to next exacerbation within 180 days.

Results

Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; p = 0.006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; p = 0.005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^113at2R4]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD asthma CPG — step-down therapy is presented as: "stepping down (not discontinuing) inhaled corticosteroids dose or discontinuing long-acting beta agonists. (Weak for | Not reviewed, Not changed)". It is standard practice to make decisions about stepping down therapy after a patient has maintained asthma control on a regimen for at least three months, and even when a patient is on a stable regimen for three or more months, stepping down is avoided during pregnancy, times of stress, recent acute illness, planned travel, peak allergen seasons, and/or for patients who cannot be closely monitored. The recommendation is based on four SRs and two RCTs, with the strongest evidence to avoid complete discontinuation of ICS in adults due to increased exacerbations and asthma symptoms; an SR showed asthma exacerbations were statistically no more likely among patients who reduced the ICS dose compared to those who maintained their ICS dose, another SR found that lowering ICS dose versus continuing a stable dose resulted in inconclusive evidence for exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life, while the same SR reported that stepping down the ICS component of a ICS/LABA versus continuing a stable dose ICS/LABA resulted in equivalent levels of asthma control and asthma-related quality of life. For patients on ICS/LABA, stepping down to ICS alone versus continued stable dose ICS/LABA was examined in both an SR and an RCT; the SR found statistically significant differences favoring continued ICS/LABA therapy with respect to asthma control and asthma-related quality of life, although the authors noted the evidence was insufficient to show effects on important outcomes such as exacerbations requiring hospital admission and serious adverse events.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115vEybj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

*The open-label benralizumab treatment period consists of a 4-week induction phase, a variable OCS tapering phase and a 24–32-week maintenance phase

Patient selection

Across the OCS-tapering studies, patients had similar asthma disease phenotypes (Table 2); all studies targeted patients with severe asthma who were on regular maintenance OCS. Continuous OCS use was required for all studies but the amount of time patients were required to have been receiving maintenance OCS differed (Table 2). There were also differences in the prednisone equivalent OCS dose required for eligibility for the five studies (Table 2). Additionally, patients in SIRIUS were stratified at randomization by history of maintenance OCS use (< 5 years versus ≥ 5 years) based on an assumption that OCS tapering would be more difficult in patients who had been receiving maintenance OCS for a long period. Further differences in eligibility criteria included varying exacerbation history and blood eosinophil count requirements (Table 2).

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^112QgzPX]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are an important therapy for severe asthma and COPD exacerbations, and their use is recommended for patients who do not respond to initial bronchodilator therapy (Table 2). Interestingly, although corticosteroids are recommended for both diseases, their benefit in COPD exacerbations seems to be driven by a subpopulation with high T2 inflammation and elevated eosinophil counts, drawing interest in using eosinophil levels to guide steroid administration among patients who are not critically ill.–

Strong evidence supports corticosteroids for asthma and COPD exacerbations treated in the acute care setting. – Few studies have evaluated corticosteroids in adult patients who are critically ill with asthma exacerbations, particularly those necessitating mechanical ventilation. For COPD exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation (either noninvasive ventilation [NIV] or invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), one study found that corticosteroids were associated with a reduction in duration of IMV and rate of NIV failure, whereas another study found no difference in outcomes.

Among patients managed in acute care settings, the recommended regimen is prednisone 1 mg/kg/d up to 50 mg/d or equivalent for 5 to 7 days for asthma and prednisone 40 mg/d for 5 days for COPD based on studies showing shorter courses (5–7 days vs 10–14 days) resulted in similar rates of treatment failure and relapse with reduced risk of pneumonia and death.– Of the few studies conducted in patients who are critically ill, most used higher doses. However, very high doses (ie, methylprednisolone > 240 mg/d) have been associated with increased treatment failure, duration of IMV, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and adverse events, including hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy and fungal infections. Currently evidence to suggest routine use of higher corticosteroid doses is limited, and we recommend prednisone 40 to 50 mg/d for at least 5 days with consideration of higher doses in patients with life-threatening disease or those not responding to initial therapy.
