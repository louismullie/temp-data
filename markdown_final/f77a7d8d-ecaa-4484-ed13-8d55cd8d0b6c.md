## Question

Return to play moderate concussion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about return-to-play after a "moderate" concussion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "moderate concussion" is a valid clinical category or if modern guidance avoids grading. Then, I should verify the universal principles of removal from play, rest, and graded return. Next, I will examine age-specific management, especially pediatric and adolescent nuances. After that, I need to check the stepwise progression details, including symptom thresholds and exertional testing. Finally, I will consider special populations, documentation and clearance requirements, and synthesize a practical timeline with caveats and red flags.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I should not jump to conclusions about "moderate concussion". Modern concussion management no longer uses grading scales like mild, moderate, or severe; instead, clinicians diagnose sport-related concussion and manage recovery individually, so "moderate" is imprecise and should be interpreted as a clinically meaningful injury with more than minimal symptoms or a longer expected recovery trajectory rather than a formal grade [^32733571] [^bbbc27f1].

> Next, I should review the universal foundation: immediate removal from play with no same-day return is mandatory across ages and levels. Continuing to play increases symptom burden and prolongs recovery, and this is consistently endorsed by pediatric, sports medicine, and public health guidance, so I need to ensure I anchor on that principle before discussing timelines [^e088aa94] [^ab67bf14] [^39345545].

> I will now examine the acute phase management. After a brief period of relative rest for 24–48 hours, athletes should begin a gradual, symptom-limited resumption of cognitive and physical activity; strict rest beyond this window is discouraged because it may delay recovery and worsen outcomes, and this shift from "rest-is-best" to "active recovery" is supported by contemporary guidelines and trials, including pediatric data showing early, symptom-limited activity is safe and may reduce symptom burden when adhered to [^36ad3d8f] [^f4f7e14d] [^fbbb42f9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about exercise intensity. I initially thought "moderate-intensity" exercise could start at 72 hours, but wait, I should verify the nuance: current guidance supports symptom-limited, subsymptom threshold aerobic activity as early as 24–48 hours, with intensity titrated to not provoke or worsen symptoms; moderate intensity may be appropriate for some after the first week if tolerated, whereas pushing moderate-to-high intensity too early risks symptom flare and delayed recovery, so I need to correct that overstatement and emphasize individualized titration [^36ad3d8f] [^f4f7e14d] [^07c2274a].

> For pediatric and adolescent athletes, I should confirm a more conservative approach. Children and teens generally recover more slowly, with typical recovery 2–4 weeks, and they should not return to unrestricted sport in fewer than 7 days; moreover, return to full academics should precede full return to sport, and each step in the progression should be at least 24 hours without symptom exacerbation before advancing, which means a realistic minimum of 10–14 days for many youth even when symptoms resolve promptly [^e088aa94] [^a2e66069] [^7611c878].

> Let me think about the stepwise progression itself. The 6-stage model is widely adopted: Stage 1 symptom-limited daily activities; Stage 2 light aerobic exercise (about 5–10 minutes of walking or stationary cycling); Stage 3 sport-specific noncontact drills; Stage 4 noncontact training with progressive resistance; Stage 5 full-contact practice after medical clearance; Stage 6 unrestricted return. Each stage should be at least 24 hours, and if symptoms recur, the athlete drops back to the prior stage and retries after 24 symptom-free hours, which I should double-check is consistent with CDC and CISG-aligned guidance [^7ce4c945] [^eb9dd951] [^a2e66069].

> I need to ensure I incorporate exertional testing, especially for those with persistent symptoms or high-performance demands. Exertional tolerance assessments using symptom-threshold approaches can unmask deficits not seen at rest and help set safe training intensities; they are safe to implement within the first week for many and are particularly useful when symptoms linger or when the athlete must return to high-exertion sport [^ea747534] [^80645d1d].

> But wait, what if the athlete is elite or in a specialized setting? In professional or high-resource environments, some organizations allow earlier initiation of graded exertion with close supervision, yet even there, minimum stand-down periods are often extended to 11–21 days in many leagues, and neurobiologic recovery may lag behind symptom resolution, so objective measures and conservative judgment remain prudent even when athletes feel "fine" [^b686a112] [^66812c57].

> I should confirm documentation and clearance requirements. Clinicians should document progression through the stepwise protocol, and final return to unrestricted sport should occur only after medical clearance by a licensed healthcare provider trained in concussion management; in many jurisdictions, written clearance is required for youth athletes, and return to learn should precede return to play in students [^a286e01b] [^eb9dd951] [^79fa2614].

> Next, I should review red flags and when to extend the timeline or refer. Worsening symptoms, seizures, focal deficits, repeated vomiting, or declining consciousness warrant urgent evaluation; persistent symptoms beyond 2–4 weeks, multiple concussions, or comorbidities such as migraine, ADHD, anxiety, or depression should prompt referral to a concussion specialist and may necessitate a slower, individualized progression with multidisciplinary support [^2b216d8e] [^abb5f4f6].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline while acknowledging variability. For an adult with a clinically meaningful concussion and several symptoms, a realistic earliest return is often 2–3 weeks if recovery is smooth: 1–2 days of relative rest, then 7–10 days through the graded stages, and finally medical clearance before contact. For adolescents, given longer recovery and the academic prerequisite, 3–4 weeks is common, and for children, 4–6 weeks or more may be needed. These ranges align with observational data showing most athletes return within 21 days, while a substantial minority require longer than 28 days, especially youth and those with higher initial symptom burden [^8bc48c70] [^e088aa94] [^4e2cb2e6].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed the original "moderate" framing. Since modern care does not grade concussion severity, "moderate" should be operationalized as a concussion with more than minimal symptoms, slower recovery, or higher risk features; in such cases, I would extend the rest period toward 48 hours, start exertion at lower intensities, maintain longer intervals between stages, and ensure objective readiness with exertional testing and neurocognitive baselines when available, always prioritizing safety over speed [^32733571] [^ea747534] [^ab67bf14].

---

Return to play after a moderate concussion follows a **stepwise, symptom-guided protocol** [^eb9dd951] with at least 24–48 hours of relative rest [^36ad3d8f], then gradual progression through six stages over 7–14 days, advancing only if asymptomatic at each step [^7ce4c945]. Medical clearance is required before contact or competition [^eb9dd951], and the process is **individualized** based on age, prior concussions, and recovery trajectory [^ab67bf14]. Premature return increases the risk of recurrence, prolonged symptoms, and rare second impact syndrome [^bb30618e] [^d40cf819], so athletes should not return until fully recovered and cleared by a healthcare professional [^39345545].

---

## Stepwise return-to-play protocol

The **six-stage protocol** is widely endorsed [^7ce4c945]:

| **Stage** | **Activity level** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Relative rest | 24–48 hours of cognitive and physical rest; no screen time or strenuous activity [^36ad3d8f] [^98f9b98c] |
| 2 | Light aerobic activity | 5–10 minutes of walking or stationary cycling at 70% max heart rate; no resistance training [^7ce4c945] |
| 3 | Sport-specific exercise | Running or skating drills without head impact; add progressive resistance training [^eb9dd951] |
| 4 | Non-contact training drills | Harder drills with coordination and thinking; progressive resistance training [^eb9dd951] |
| 5 | Full-contact practice | Medical clearance required; restore confidence and assess functional skills [^eb9dd951] |
| 6 | Return to sport | Normal game play after medical clearance [^eb9dd951] |

---

Each stage lasts at least 24 hours; if symptoms recur, the athlete returns to the previous stage and retries after 24 symptom-free hours [^7ce4c945] [^c44f3342].

---

## Medical clearance and monitoring

Medical clearance is required before contact or competition [^eb9dd951], and clinicians should monitor symptoms, cognition, and balance at each stage [^66812c57]. Neurocognitive testing may be used to support decisions but is not the sole determinant of readiness [^52ddc196] [^7611c878].

---

## Individualized factors influencing return-to-play decisions

Several factors **individualize the timeline**:

- **Age**: Children and adolescents recover more slowly; a more conservative approach is recommended [^7611c878] [^b7e98a9a].
- **Prior concussions**: History of concussion increases risk of recurrence and may prolong recovery [^4c72aa0b] [^b7b64a3c].
- **Symptom severity and duration**: Higher initial symptom burden predicts longer recovery [^bf150eb0] [^2b859e29].
- **Sport and level of play**: Contact and collision sports require stricter protocols and medical oversight [^7611c878] [^66812c57].

---

## Risks associated with premature return

Premature return increases the risk of:

- **Recurrent concussion**: Higher risk of repeat injury and prolonged recovery [^bb30618e] [^b7b64a3c].
- **Second impact syndrome**: Rare but potentially fatal if a second injury occurs before full recovery [^d40cf819] [^ba4222f2].
- **Prolonged symptoms**: Higher likelihood of persistent post-concussive symptoms [^bb30618e] [^b7b64a3c].

---

## Current evidence and consensus guidelines

Current guidelines emphasize:

- **Gradual, symptom-limited progression**: No same-day return; advance only if asymptomatic [^eb9dd951] [^d364fea3].
- **Brief rest followed by active recovery**: 24–48 hours of rest, then subsymptom aerobic activity may aid recovery [^36ad3d8f] [^f4f7e14d].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Persistent symptoms (> 4 weeks) warrant referral to concussion specialists [^2b216d8e] [^c99fd461].

---

## Typical timeline for return to play

Most athletes recover within 7–14 days, but moderate concussions often require **2–4 weeks** or longer, especially in youth or those with prior concussions [^8bc48c70] [^e088aa94] [^bf150eb0].

---

Return to play after a moderate concussion requires a **stepwise, symptom-guided protocol** with medical clearance and individualized adjustments. This approach minimizes risks and supports safe, sustainable return to sport.

### Managing sports-related concussions from time of injury through return to play [^11ef1381]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussions continue to generate widespread interest. A concussion is a complex pathophysiologic process, with or without loss of consciousness, that results in a disturbance of brain function. Risk factors include age < 18 years, female sex, and history of a previous concussion. A sideline physical examination with standardized assessment tools can assist diagnosis. Management for suspected concussion begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest. A stepwise return-to-play protocol, taking into consideration state laws, with a gradual increase in activity until the athlete is able to perform full activity without symptoms should be followed. Neuropsychologic testing may be used as a tool in management. For prolonged concussion, physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbance may be required. Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in prevention. The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.

### Central nervous system trauma management of concussions in athletes [^549e91ff]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The care of athletes with concussions is challenging because each patient has different symptoms. An athlete should never be returned to play until completely asymptomatic. Classification systems for concussions are not based on scientific evidence and represent some practitioners' best guess at what is safe for young athletes. Many experienced team physicians believe they can allow an athlete to play safely if there are no symptoms at rest and no symptoms with increasing intensity of exercise. Abbreviated neuropsychological testing and balance tests show promise for use in the field to increase the sensitivity of our neurological evaluation on injured athletes. Any neuropsychological or balance evaluation is more helpful if baseline data is collected on athletes before they are injured.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: concussion in the young athlete [^6b2f9ac8]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and can be very challenging for clinicians to diagnose and manage. Debate exists over not only the incidence of long-term risks of multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes after sports-related head injury. Decisions on returning athletes to competition can be difficult, and there are limited prospective data on which to make these decisions. This has resulted in the existence of a number of published guidelines and consensus statements on the management of concussion in athletes. Athletes sustaining a concussion need appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments can be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma may result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. Delivery of care and decisions on return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

### Circus-specific extension of the 6th international consensus statement on concussion in sport [^97331357]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The Return to Circus guideline adopts the CISG criteria for progression through stage 3 (online supplemental appendix 2), which includes a minimum of 24 hours and no more than mild symptom exacerbation with prescribed activities. Mild symptoms are defined as an increase of less than or equal to two points from pre-exercise baseline of symptom severity based on a 0–10 scale (0 representing no symptoms and 10 representing the worst imaginable symptoms) and the symptoms lasting less than 1 hour. Criteria to proceed to stage 4 (online supplemental appendix 2) includes an absence of concussion symptoms with physical or cognitive activities, or any abnormalities on related objective concussion testing. Following the Return to Circus guideline, the earliest return to full training would be 8 days postinjury and 9 days for performance. However, symptoms and recovery from concussion are unique and variable, so artists and coaches should understand that appropriate progression through each stage often requires more than 1 day and, therefore, longer than 8–9 days to safely return to full training or performance. It is acknowledged that some professional sports settings with an on-site HCP team with concussion training and a structured concussion management plan choose to use an accelerated/enhanced RTS protocol, with earliest return of 6 days postinjury. Circus companies and professional organisations with access to an enhanced HCP management protocol may also choose to make similar decisions about their individual RTS protocols based on their available resources, baseline testing, clinical skill sets and overall risk management assessment.

HCP reassessment and clearance is considered most critical before moving a circus artist from stage 5 moderate risk circus skills to stage 6 high risk circus skills (online supplemental appendix 2) to best align with current international sports and dance protocols. Though in cases with accessible healthcare, an HCP should be providing reassessment and guidance throughout the course of recovery for a circus artist. This is consistent with the dance guidelinethat recommends HCP clearance before moving to high-risk activity and concomitant heightened physiological load. It is also consistent with sports guidelines, where similarly, the CISG recommends medical clearance before progression from moderate aerobic exercise to individual sports-specific exercise that may involve the risk of inadvertent head impactand the Australian Sport Commission concussion guideline which places HCP checkpoint clearance before an athlete's return to contact and high-risk activities.

### Sports-related concussions: diagnosis, complications, and current management strategies [^c72299c4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussions (SRCs) are traumatic events that affect up to 3.8 million athletes per year. The initial diagnosis and management is often instituted on the field of play by coaches, athletic trainers, and team physicians. SRCs are usually transient episodes of neurological dysfunction following a traumatic impact, with most symptoms resolving in 7–10 days; however, a small percentage of patients will suffer protracted symptoms for years after the event and may develop chronic neurodegenerative disease. Rarely, SRCs are associated with complications, such as skull fractures, epidural or subdural hematomas, and edema requiring neurosurgical evaluation. Current standards of care are based on a paradigm of rest and gradual return to play, with decisions driven by subjective and objective information gleaned from a detailed history and physical examination. Advanced imaging techniques such as functional MRI, and detailed understanding of the complex pathophysiological process underlying SRCs and how they affect the athletes acutely and long-term, may change the way physicians treat athletes who suffer a concussion. It is hoped that these advances will allow a more accurate assessment of when an athlete is truly safe to return to play, decreasing the risk of secondary impact injuries, and provide avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting the complex biochemical cascade that results from a traumatic injury to the brain.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^ab67bf14]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Return to sport after concussion — Concussion-related symptoms and signs should be resolved before returning to sport, and a return-to-play progression involves a gradual, stepwise increase in physical demands and sport-specific activities without return of symptoms before the final introduction of exposure to contact. The athlete should also demonstrate psychological readiness for returning to play, the progression is individualized based on injury characteristics, age, history of SRC, level of play, and supervision, and the return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric; in general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage.

### Concussion management in combat sports: consensus statement from the association of ringside physicians [^c0f8409e]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Various organisations and experts have published numerous statements and recommendations regarding different aspects of sports-related concussion including definition, presentation, treatment, management and return to play guidelines.

To date, there have been no written consensus statements specific for combat sports regarding management of combatants who have suffered a concussion or for return to competition after a concussion. In combat sports, head contact is an objective of the sport itself. Accordingly, management and treatment of concussion in combat sports should, and must, be more stringent than for non-combat sports counterparts.

The Association of Ringside Physicians (an international, non-profit organisation dedicated to the health and safety of the combat sports athlete) sets forth this consensus statement to establish management guidelines that ringside physicians, fighters, referees, trainers, promoters, sanctioning bodies and other healthcare professionals can use in the ringside setting. We also provide guidelines for the return of a combat sports athlete to competition after sustaining a concussion. This consensus statement does not address the management of moderate to severe forms of traumatic brain injury, such as intracranial bleeds, nor does it address the return to competition for combat sports athletes who have suffered such an injury. These more severe forms of brain injuries are beyond the scope of this statement. This consensus statement does not address neuroimaging guidelines in combat sports.

### Diagnosis and management of acute concussion [^44a96876]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, there have been major advances in the basic and clinical science of concussion and mild traumatic brain injury. These advances now provide a more evidence-informed approach to the definition, diagnosis, assessment, and management of acute concussion. Standardized clinical tools have been developed and validated for assessment of acute concussion across injury settings (eg, civilian, sport, military). Consensus guidelines now provide guidance regarding injury management and approaches to ensure safe return to activity after acute concussion. This article provides a brief, high-level overview of approaches to best practice in diagnosis, assessment, and management of acute concussion.

Short-term risks of continued exposure after concussion or premature return to play include that continuing to play immediately after a concussion is a risk of increased symptom burden, worsening of the injury, and prolonged recovery, athletes who return to sport before full recovery are at increased risk of repeat concussion, some research has demonstrated that athletes who return to sport after SRC following standard return to sport protocols had an increased rate of musculoskeletal injury, and the "Second Impact Syndrome" is both rare and controversial and is considered by some to be a potentially life-threatening complication.

### Retirement and activity restrictions following concussion [^7cbd73f5]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is prevalent at all levels of play. Increased attention from sports media and scientific and medical communities has prompted players and physicians to explore the long-term effects of concussion and ask the questions of when and how players should begin to mitigate their concussion risk. The authors evaluate their risks from the perspective of epidemiology, symptomatology, neuropsychological performance, and biomechanics. The authors propose that there is not a set number of concussions that necessitates retirement in athletes and, aside from a few absolute contraindications to return to collision sport, return to play should be an individualized process.

### Sports medicine update: concussion [^32c677dd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

A systematic approach is required for patients with a suspected concussion. Although standardized tools can aid in assessment, the diagnosis of concussion remains a clinical one. At the time of diagnosis, patients should be given both verbal and written review of the common symptoms of concussion, expected course of recovery, as well as strategies to manage symptoms. Most patients benefit from a brief period of rest, followed by a gradual reintroduction of activities, and a graduated return-to-sport protocol. Patients with prolonged recovery from a concussion may benefit from exercise, vestibular, and cognitive rehabilitation programs.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^f4f7e14d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion clinical practice guidelines — communication and education: Evidence from high-quality clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) state that most people recover well and typically do not have significant difficulties that last more than 1 to 3 months post injury. High-quality CPGs based on moderate-level evidence indicate that after an initial period of rest for the first 24 to 48 hours, patients with concussion should be encouraged to avoid activities that have a high risk for another concussion but gradually resume normal activity, based on their tolerance. Physical therapists must educate patients who have experienced a concussive event about self-management of symptoms, the importance of relative rest (rest as needed) instead of strict rest, the benefits of progressive re-engagement in activities, the importance of sleep, safe return-to-activity pacing strategies, and potential signs and symptoms of the need for follow-up care with a physician, physical therapist, or other health care providers, and must educate patients and their families/caregivers about symptoms and functional limitations associated with concussion and stress that most patients with concussion recover relatively quickly.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for concussion, more specifically with respect to return to activity, LCG 2023 guidelines recommend to encourage patients to perform a variety of types and intensities of physical activity based on their tolerance, including moderate-to-vigorous aerobic physical activities and light routine physical activities (such as standing).

### Return-to-play criteria after athletic concussion… [^603dd818]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

A minireview of recently published studies using a variety of techniques suggests that persistent cerebral dysfunction occurs for at least 1 month in many concussed athletes. In view of the frequency, the young age of the injured individuals, and the lack of procedures to document the complex postinjury healing process in the brain, a postconcussion return-to-play interval of at least 4 weeks is imperative. During recovery in the first few days after concussion, it is important to emphasize to the athlete that physical and cognitive rest are required. Activities that require concentration and attention may exacerbate symptoms and delay recovery.

Return to play after a concussion follows a stepwise process as outlined by the Canadian Academy of Sports Medicine6: no activity, complete rest until asymptomatic with normal neurologic examination results; light aerobic exercise, such as walking or stationary cycling, and no resistance training; sport-specific exercise with progressive addition of resistance training; noncontact training drills; full-contact training after medical clearance; and game play. With this stepwise progression, the athlete should continue to proceed to the next level if asymptomatic at the current level. If any postconcussion symptoms occur, the patient should drop back to the previous asymptomatic level and try to progress again after 24 hours. Twenty-five athletes had experienced prior medically diagnosed concussions. Return to practice and/or RTP occurred a mean of 13. 8 days after injury, excluding 7 athletes either "sitting out" the remainder of the sport season or retiring secondary to recurring concussions. Evidence suggests that, for younger athletes and for those with a learning disability or prior concussions, RTP time should be extended. 3An excellent brief overview of the most recent consensus statements has been published.
8. The summary and agreement statement of the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport4defined concussion as "a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by traumatic biomechanical forces". This indicates that safe RTP might require at least 4 to 6 weeks to facilitate more complete recovery and to protect from reinjury, reported by Guskiewicz et al28to occur much more frequently in the immediate period after a concussion. Consequently, for athletes competing in many sports, concussion would be a season-ending injury.

### Current recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of concussion in sport: a comparison of three new guidelines [^0877d755]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable debate within the sports medicine community about the role of concussion and the risk of chronic neurological sequelae. This concern has led to significant confusion among primary care providers and athletic trainers about how to best identify those athletes at risk and how to treat those with concussion. During the first quarter of 2013, several new or updated clinical practice guidelines and position statements were published on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of mild traumatic brain injury/concussion in sports. Three of these guidelines were produced by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, The American Academy of Neurology, and the Zurich Consensus working group. The goal of each group was to clearly define current best practices for the definition, diagnosis, and acute and post-acute management of sports-related concussion, including specific recommendations for return to play. In this article, we compare the recommendations of each of the three groups, and highlight those topics for which there is consensus regarding the definition of concussion, diagnosis, and acute care of athletes suspected of having a concussion, as well as return-to-play recommendations.

### Sport-related concussion: optimizing treatment through evidence-informed practice [^30f2ae97]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Concussion is one of the most common injuries in sport and recreation today. Reports of concussion have increased in recent years, likely due to increased societal awareness and the risk of longer-term sequelae. Presently, treatment includes a period of prescribed rest in the acute period following injury, followed by a protocol of graded exertion. Despite an initial period of rest and attempts at a gradual return to play, up to 30% of individuals may have ongoing symptoms past the acute period. The goal of this viewpoint is to introduce the reader to the most common symptoms of concussion and the need for a new, more active paradigm during treatment.

### Diagnosis of concussion: the role of imaging now and in the future [^8ef5abdd]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The primary role of neuroimaging in the clinical context of sports-related concussion is the exclusion of a more severe, unsuspected intracranial injury. Computed tomography remains the test of choice for this purpose. Magnetic resonance imaging is more commonly used as a secondary test for the investigation of persistent symptoms. New imaging techniques are currently being developed to detect the molecular and cellular changes underlying concussion that are invisible with standard structural imaging. In the future, these techniques may be used as tools for directing rehabilitation after concussion and aiding in the decision of when it is safe for an athlete to return to play.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^eb9dd951]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Return to sport after sports-related concussion — a staged progression is outlined: symptom-limited activity with the objective of reintroduction of normal activities of daily living and that symptoms should not worsen with activity; light aerobic exercise with walking, stationary biking, and controlled activities that increase heart rate; sport-specific exercise such as running, skating, or other sport-specific aerobic exercise avoiding risk of head impact; noncontact training drills with sport-specific noncontact training drills that involve increased coordination and thinking and progressive introduction of resistance training; full-contact practice; and return to sport. RTS progressions should be individualized based on the injury, athlete's age, history, and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity and progressions may vary between athletes. Consider written clearance from a health care professional before RTS as directed by local laws and regulations.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for concussion, more specifically with respect to return to activity, LCG 2023 guidelines recommend to encourage patients with prolonged symptoms to become gradually more active and educate them about tolerance levels. Counsel patients to recognize the point at which mild symptoms have onset, for any activity (physical or cognitive), and to push to or beyond that point in a manner not resulting in a significant or prolonged exacerbation of symptoms.

Return to sport recommendations

The timing of return to sport is often the most important issue for athletes, coaches and parents. Clinicians face the challenge of helping the athlete return at the appropriate time that does not compromise the athlete's health or performance.

At all participation levels (professional, elite, community/recreational), an athlete who is diagnosed with concussion should not be permitted to return to sport on the day the concussion is sustained. All athletes diagnosed with concussion should undergo serial clinical evaluations in the days following the injury.

Athletes participating at the elite level, who are removed from the playing arena with a suspected head injury, but are not diagnosed with concussion following a multifaceted, SCAT5-based assessment performed by an experienced clinician, may return to the game.

Even if no diagnosis of concussion has been made, athletes removed from sport with suspected concussion should undergo serial re-evaluations for up to 48 hours because of the possibility of delayed symptom onset. For the athlete who is diagnosed with concussion, monitoring should continue at regular intervals until the athlete is cleared to return to sport (box 2).

Box 2
Criteria for return to sport after concussion in team collision sport

Athletes who have been diagnosed with concussion, may only return to sport after:

Concussion-related symptom scores, at rest and with match-intensity exercise, have returned to baseline levels.
Neurological examination (including balance testing) is normal.
Cognitive testing (computerised and/or pencil-and-paper) has returned to baseline or age-appropriate norms.

Athletes should follow a graded return to sport protocol before returning to unrestricted sport. This process typically takes 7 days, although there is variability in this time due to athlete-specific factors (eg, history, initial symptom severity, age) and this time interval is not evidenced-based. Expert consensus is that professional athletes supported by advanced care settings (as outlined below) may return on a slightly faster timeline than non-professional athletes, in cases where initial symptoms rapidly resolve, and a thorough medical and neuropsychological evaluation can be carried out by experienced providers. The athlete must have been exposed to high-intensity exercise before being cleared to participate in unrestricted sport.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for concussion, more specifically with respect to return to activity, LCG 2023 guidelines recommend to encourage patients with a history of concussion to gradually resume normal activity (activities of daily living, work, school, duty, leisure) after a brief period of rest during the acute phase (24–48 hours) after injury, based upon their tolerance as long as the activity does not pose a risk for concussion.

Sideline disposition and reassessment — the primary end point for sideline assessment is to determine the probability that an athlete has sustained a concussion; if the athlete is deemed unlikely to have had a concussion, continued participation should be safe, whereas if the evaluation indicates a definite or probable concussion, the athlete should be removed from participation with no same day return to play, and sport-related concussion is an evolving injury and should be serially reassessed when suspected.

### Return to play after sports concussion in elite and non-elite athletes? [^dc331843]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the published literature relating to the difference in concussion management strategies between elite and non-elite athletes.

Design

Systematic literature review of concussion management.

Intervention

Pubmed, Medline, Psych Info, Cochrane Library and Sport Discus databases were reviewed using the MeSH keywords brain concussion and mild traumatic brain injury, combined with athletic injuries. Each were then refined by adding the keyword "return to play" (RTP). English language and human studies only were assessed.

Results

For the Medline search, using "brain concussion" as a keyword, 4319 articles were found; this was decreased to 111 when RTP was used to refine the search. When "mild traumatic brain injury" was used, 2509 articles were found; this decreased to 39 when RTP was used to refine the search. Following initial review, these articles form the basis of the discussion below.

Conclusions

The non-elite athlete may not have the same resources available as the elite athlete (such as the presence of trained medical staff during practice and competition, a concussion programme as part of sideline preparedness, the benefit of neuropsychological or postural testing, as well as consultants with expertise in concussion readily available) and as a result will generally be managed more conservatively. Younger athletes often have a greater incidence of concussion with longer recovery time frames; however, they are often managed with less expertise and with limited resources.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^36ad3d8f]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Activity and exercise after sport-related concussion: Exercise intolerance is an objective physiological sign of acute concussion that seems to reflect impaired autonomic function and control of cerebral blood flow. Emerging data suggest that symptom-limited activity, including activities of daily living and noncontact aerobic exercise, may begin as soon as tolerated after an initial brief period (24–48 hours) of cognitive and physical relative rest. There is some preliminary evidence that subsymptom threshold exercise improves recovery in acute concussion, and early symptom-limited graded exercise testing seems to be safe in athletes. Early activity and exercise do not take the place of a graded return to sport.

### What are the most appropriate return-to-play guidelines for concussed child athletes? [^b7e98a9a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine concussion literature for specific guidelines regarding return to play (RTP) following sport-related concussion in child athletes. To make recommendations regarding the most appropriate RTP guidelines for child athletes following sport-related concussion.

Design

A literature review of concussion literature.

Intervention

A literature search was conducted using Medline and Embase databases from 1998 to 2008. More than 60 articles and two websites were reviewed.

Results

There is a paucity of research on sport-related concussion in child athletes, particularly younger children (age 5–12 years). In particular, there is no research on RTP guidelines for child athletes following sport-related concussion. Child athletes take longer to recover from concussions than adults. Concussion symptoms may resolve before cognitive function has completely recovered. Concussion assessment and management in children can be confounded by their growth and development, as well as the lack of trained medical personnel involved with youth sports. There are no child-specific assessment tools for concussion.

Conclusions

RTP decisions in children should be made cautiously and should be individualised. No concussed child athlete should be allowed to RTP the same day. Physical and cognitive rest is very important to allow for the resolution of concussion symptoms. Child athletes should remain symptom free for several days before starting a medically supervised stepwise exertion protocol. Further research is needed to elucidate the effects of concussion in children and to determine the most appropriate RTP guidelines. Child-specific concussion assessment tools need to be developed to improve concussion assessment and management in children.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC | Mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^bf150eb0]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Post-Same day evaluation and treatment

This is the period of time beginning the day after the injury and up to RTP. SRC is a treatable condition. The majority of athletes with SRC recover within a typical timeframe, currently defined as 2 weeks for adults and up to 4 weeks for children. The number and severity of the initial symptom burden is the best predictor for the duration of recovery after SRC.

During this time, symptom-specific interventions can be implemented while recovery is being monitored. It is also important that pre-existing, coexisting, and/or resulting comorbidities are addressed (eg, headache, anxiety, depression cervical spine pain).

Current evidence suggests strict rest after SRC slows recovery and increases the probability of prolonged symptoms. After a brief period of relative rest (24–48 hours), athletes may gradually and progressively resume cognitive and physical activity provided it does not produce new symptoms or exacerbate their existing symptoms. Recent studies have shown progressive moderate aerobic exercise within the first week helps safely speed recovery. Cognitive work should be modified or limited to that which does not produce or exacerbate symptoms.

Return to driving

No widely accepted return to driving protocols exist. Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual perception, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC. A decision on driving status should be part of the monitoring period.

Medication

Medications routinely prescribed prior to the SRC should be continued. Evidence of efficacy is limited and most athletes do not require the use of over-the-counter and/or prescription medications for acute SRC symptoms. In select situations where medication is considered, judicious use at the lowest dose for the shortest period of time is recommended. There is no current evidence that nutraceuticals are efficacious in the prevention or treatment of SRC.

Return to learn

RTL (or return to class) is the process of transitioning back to class following SRC. Athletes should have regular medical follow-up after SRC to monitor recovery and help with return to class. Some athletes may require a short-term absence from or adjustment to their academic load after injury and then progressed as tolerated. The vast majority of athletes do not require prolonged absence from school or formal academic accommodations (eg, 504 Plan or Individualised Education Plan) after SRC. While RTL and RTP may progress simultaneously, successful completion of RTL precedes the final clearance for RTP (figure 1).

### Systematic review of prognosis and return to play after sport concussion: results of the international collaboration on mild traumatic brain injury prognosis [^4c72aa0b]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To synthesize the best available evidence on prognosis after sport concussion.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and other databases were searched (2001–2012) with terms including "craniocerebral trauma" and "sports". Reference lists of eligible articles were also searched.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials and cohort and case-control studies were selected according to predefined criteria. Studies had to have a minimum of 30 concussion cases.

Data Extraction

Eligible studies were critically appraised using a modification of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria. Two reviewers independently reviewed and extracted data from accepted studies into evidence tables.

Data Synthesis

Evidence was synthesized qualitatively according to modified SIGN criteria, and studies were categorized as exploratory or confirmatory based on the strength of their design and evidence. After 77,914 records were screened, 52 articles were eligible for this review, and 24 articles (representing 19 studies) with a low risk of bias were accepted. Our findings are based on exploratory studies of predominantly male football players at the high school, collegiate, and professional levels. Most athletes recover within days to a few weeks, and American and Australian professional football players return to play quickly after mild traumatic brain injury. Delayed recovery appears more likely in high school athletes, in those with a history of previous concussion, and in those with a higher number and duration of postconcussion symptoms.

Conclusions

The evidence concerning sports concussion course and prognosis is very preliminary, and there is no evidence on the effect of return-to-play guidelines on prognosis. Our findings have implications for further research. Well-designed, confirmatory studies are urgently needed to understand the consequences of sport concussion, including recurrent concussion, across different athletic populations and sports.

### Are we permitting pediatric athletes with sports-related concussion to return to play too soon after concussion? [^c2600134]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidelines permitting return to play for athletes who have sustained a concussion rely on resolution of cognitive and physical symptoms. Evolving evidence suggest that vascular, radiologic and cerebral metabolic abnormalities persist in some athletes beyond the period of clinical recovery. This commentary addresses these issues and raises a question as to whether physicians are permitting pediatric athletes with concussion to return to play too soon after concussion.

### Current concepts in the treatment of sports concussions [^56120939]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

The management of patients with sports-related concussion (SRC) is comprehensive and includes preseason planning, education, initial evaluation, postinjury assessment, disposition, return-to-play decisions, and consideration of long-term brain health. Several recent publications have addressed sports concussion management using the best available evidence, and we review them here. The diagnosis and management of sports concussion have evolved over the past several decades, and with a greater understanding of the importance of both short- and long-term sequelae, there has been a clear trend toward recognizing and treating these brain injuries more cautiously and developing a proactive approach to management and return-to-play decision making. Although each of these used different methodologies in their review of the literature, their conclusions are fairly consistent, providing basic guidelines for contemporary approaches to management of SRC. Although many questions remain unanswered, there are several areas of agreement including the importance of education, preseason assessment, the benefit and utility of a standardized multimodal assessment on the sidelines, individualized treatment and return-to-play protocols, and the benefit of a multidisciplinary team in managing complicated injuries. This paper reviews these current sports concussion guidelines and the best available evidence that guides current management of SRC.

Clinical management roles and expected recovery — sports medicine physicians are uniquely trained to provide care across the continuum of sport-related concussion (SRC) from acute evaluation through return to learn and return to sport and to manage complications and coexisting medical issues; although most SRCs resolve within 1 to 4 weeks, athletes with complicated or prolonged recovery may require a multidisciplinary team with specific expertise across concussion management.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^ea747534]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Concussion — exertional intolerance assessment (evidence synthesis) reports that evaluating symptoms and physiological metrics at rest is not sufficient to effectively detect lingering postconcussion exertional intolerance, and that strong evidence indicates exertional assessments using symptom thresholds can provide important insights into recovery and that exertional tolerance tests are a key assessment strategy for individuals with concussion with persistent symptoms who desire to return to high-exertion activities. Common outcome measures with exertional tests include self-reported symptom exacerbation, heart rate, and blood pressure. Potential risks, harms, and implementation considerations include exacerbation of concussion-related symptoms, varying comfort levels and preferences for exercise modalities, a general lack of fitness limiting the utility of an exertional assessment, and comorbid conditions where exercise may be contraindicated or require modifications to testing protocols. Emerging evidence suggests exertional tests are safe and may be beneficial for athletes to help make return-to-play decisions and may be administered within the first week of injury, and GDG group consensus was that exertional tests may be useful for providing initial postconcussion measures and setting target exertion levels for promoting brain healing and health, regardless of whether exertional intolerance is suspected.

### Sports-related concussion increases the risk of subsequent injury by about 50% in elite male football players [^6644f26c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the short-term and long-term sequelae of concussion, and about when athletes who have sustained such injuries can safely return to play.

Purpose

To examine whether sports-related concussion increases the risk of subsequent injury in elite male football players.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

Injuries were registered for 46 male elite football teams in 10 European countries in the 2001/2002–2011/2102 seasons. Two survival models were used to analyse whether concussion increased the subsequent risk of an injury in the first year.

Results

During the follow-up period, 66 players sustained concussions and 1599 players sustained other injuries. Compared with the risk following other injuries, concussion was associated with a progressively increased risk of a subsequent injury in the first year (0 to < 3months, HR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.23; 3 to < 6months, HR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.89; 6-12months, HR = 4.07, 95% CI 2.14 to 7.76). In the second model, after adjustment for the number of injuries in the year preceding the concussion, this injury remained significantly associated with the risk of subsequent injury in the first year (HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.05).

Conclusions

Concussion was a risk factor for sustaining subsequent injury within the following year. In-depth medical evaluation, which includes neurological and cognitive assessment, is warranted within the concussion management and return-to- play process.

### Effectiveness of return to activity and return to school protocols for children postconcussion: a systematic review [^c44f3342]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Time progression through guidelines

What is the recommended time to progress through the stages of RTA and RTS protocols?

Two summary statements provided evidence for the time between stages in RTA/RTS protocols, and one descriptive study reported the probability of complete RTA in adolescent athletes with concussion. The RTA/RTS protocols created by the CanChild group provide recommendations on the time between stages.

The time between stages in RTA/RTS protocols should be a minimum of 24 hours to ensure there is no symptom exacerbation before beginning the next stage. The updated CanChild RTA/RTS protocols recommend that children take a minimum 24 hours between steps. If symptoms are exacerbated at any point during the protocol, the child should go back one step and remain at that level of activity until they are symptom-free for 24 hours before trying to progress again

Probability estimates predict successful RTP within 7 days after injury, but the times to RTP are highly variable between different strata including sex and age. A descriptive epidemiological study found the majority of high school athletes would return to play within 7–21 days after sustaining a concussion. This study used Kaplan-Meier curves and time-to-event analysis to determine evidence-based and objective estimates of when an adolescent athlete is likely to return to play; these estimates can be used to describe the likely prognosis of SRC in the paediatric population. After a new concussion, the probability to RTP within 1–2 days was 2.5%. The probability to RTP within 3 days increased to 35% and within 7–9 days, it increased to 71.3%. These results suggest it is unlikely for an adolescent athlete to RTP within 1–2 days postconcussion and align with the current recommendations to rest for this period of time with the expectation that children with uncomplicated concussions can expect to begin RTP protocols within 3 days after a concussive injury. Given the methodological limitations of this observational study, it was rated as a Level 4 quality of evidence (table 1).

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^e088aa94]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for concussion, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, sport-related concussion, return to sport, AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to remove athletes with suspected sport-related concussion immediately from play and do not return to full sports participation until they have returned to their baseline level of symptoms and functioning and completed a full stepwise return-to-sport progression without a return of concussion symptoms. Offer a return to the full academic workload before a return to full sports participation if injury recovery occurs during the academic year.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^953125e4]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents — concussion's definition, signs, and symptoms must be understood to diagnose it and rule out more severe intracranial injury. Pediatric health care providers should have a good understanding of diagnostic evaluation and initial management strategies. Effective management can aid recovery and potentially reduce the risk of long-term symptoms and complications. Because every concussion has its own unique spectrum and severity of symptoms, individualized management is appropriate. The reduction, not necessarily elimination, of physical and cognitive activity is the mainstay of treatment. A full return to activity and/or sport is accomplished by using a stepwise program while evaluating for a return of symptoms. An understanding of prolonged symptoms and complications will help the pediatric health care provider know when to refer to a specialist. Because concussion symptoms often interfere with school, social life, family relationships, and athletics, a concussion may affect the emotional well-being of the injured athlete.

Grading scales for sport-related concussion (SRC) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have limited recommended use: more than 25 grading scales have been published, but because these scales are based on expert opinion alone, the 2001 Vienna Concussion in Sport Group recommended the discontinuation of their use in describing SRC or guiding return to play, and current recommendations are to diagnose the SRC without labels such as mild, moderate, or severe or as simple versus complex and to use current consensus protocols to guide return to play.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC | Mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^54e891c8]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Return to play

RTP is the process of transitioning back to practice and competition after SRC. Athletes should have regular medical follow-up after SRC to monitor recovery and help with RTP. RTP begins when athletes have reached their baseline level of symptoms, cognition and balance/postural stability.

Pharmacological therapy that has been prescribed for management of SRC symptoms must be considered carefully by the team physician. The decision to progress to and through RTP while on newly prescribed medication is made by the team physician. Progression involves a stepwise progression and increase in physical demands and sport-specific activities without return of symptoms before the final introduction of exposure to contact. The athlete also should demonstrate psychological readiness for RTP (figure 2).

Figure 2
Return to play.

It is essential that the team physician understand:

RTP is decided by the team physician.
RTP follows a stepwise progression after an athlete has reached preinjury level of symptoms and function.
RTL precedes final clearance for RTP.
The majority of SRCs resolve in 2–4 weeks (varies by age).

It is desirable that the team physician:

Provide the ongoing care and monitoring of the athlete with SRC.
Participate in the RTL process.
Coordinate the RTP process.
Recognise that the number and severity of initial symptom burden is the best predictor for the duration of recovery after SRC.
Understand that limited cognitive rest and early subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise is recommended for the treatment of SRC.

Diagnostic testing

The diagnosis of SRC is clinical, and dependent on history, including mechanism of injury and physical examination. Some tests have been proposed as tools to aid in the clinical diagnosis. Other tests have been used for research purposes related to SRC. For each, more research is needed.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^213ffbfa]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) — return-to-sport course and restrictions: Return decisions "should follow an individualized course," and are "best accomplished by following a graduated stepwise program updated by the Berlin Concussion in Sport Group (Table 5)." For younger athletes, "a more conservative approach… is warranted." Critically, "No athlete should be allowed to return to play on the same day as the injury," yet "10% to 38% of young athletes reported returning to play on the same day as the injury." Furthermore, "Athletes should not be allowed to return to contact, collision, or high-risk activities until symptoms of the concussion have resolved and a return-to-sport progression has been completed," because "Premature return to contact increases the risk of more severe injury, repeat injury, and prolonged recovery."

---

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^b7b64a3c]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute management of SRC — removal from play, rest, and graded activity are specified as follows: athletes who are suspected to have a concussion should be removed from play and not be allowed to return the same day. Continuing to play increases risk, with athletes who continued to play also 8.8 times more likely to have a recovery longer than 21 days, and an additional head impact within 24 hours of the first associated with a longer recovery time (52.3 vs 36.9 days). Extremes of rest may be harmful, as several studies show that athletes recommended strict rest take longer to recover and often report higher symptom burdens than those who rest for only a few days, and a study of cognitive rest showed athletes who did not reduce cognitive load took the longest to improve while even mild reductions resulted in similar recovery times to extreme rest. In light of recent research, a reasonable approach to physical rest includes immediate removal from play and, while symptoms are consistent, limiting physical exertion to brisk walking but avoiding complete inactivity; allowing some light cardiovascular activity, such as brisk walking, although not allowing a return to full sports participation, seems prudent and is supported by recent research. This exercise is intended to be subsymptom exercise, meaning the intensity is limited to a level that does not increase or provoke symptoms, and may be self-monitored or through a formal physical therapy program. When returning to school, it is beneficial for the student to receive academic adjustments to reduce workload and environmental triggers, and communication with teachers and school staff implementing adjustments is important for a smooth transition back to school.

### Development of a conservative protocol to return children and youth to activity following concussive injury [^807e7adc]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Consensus-based guidelines exist for adult athletes returning to play after concussion, but there are no protocols developed specifically for children. The goal of this knowledge translation research was to develop evidence-based materials to inform physicians about pediatric concussion.

Methods

A pediatric concussion protocol was developed based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence procedures.

Results

This return to activity protocol was developed to guide management when children/youth sustain a concussion. The protocol incorporated 3 main themes: (a) a protocol must include return to all activity, including sport and school; (b) existing consensus-based adult protocols are not appropriate for children; and (c) a more conservative protocol is needed. After pilot testing, the developed protocol is being used across Ontario.

Conclusion

Implementation of these new pediatric recommendations is an important addition to prevention of subsequent concussions during vulnerable recovery periods, with potential to facilitate recovery by preventing prolonged symptomatology, and secondary sequelae.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: concussion in sport [^1c473b28]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

PURPOSE OF THE STATEMENT: ▸ To provide an evidence-based, best practises summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion. ▸ To establish the level of evidence, knowledge gaps and areas requiring additional research.

Importance Of An Amssm Statement

▸ Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. ▸ Sports medicine physicians are specifically trained to provide care along the continuum of sports concussion from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. ▸ The care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. ▸ While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.

Definition

▸ Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum.

Pathophysiology

▸ Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. ▸ Experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature cognitive or physical activity occurs before complete recovery the brain may be vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction.

Incidence

▸ It is estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the USA per year during competitive sports and recreational activities; however, as many as 50% of the concussions may go unreported. ▸ Concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in football, hockey, rugby, soccer and basketball. RISK FACTORS FOR SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION: ▸ A history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of sustaining another concussion. ▸ A greater number, severity and duration of symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a prolonged recovery. ▸ In sports with similar playing rules, the reported incidence of concussion is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. ▸ Certain sports, positions and individual playing styles have a greater risk of concussion. ▸ Youth athletes may have a more prolonged recovery and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic injury. ▸ Preinjury mood disorders, learning disorders, attention-deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD) and migraine headaches complicate diagnosis and management of a concussion.

Diagnosis Of Concussion

▸ Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a healthcare provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in the recognition and evaluation of concussion. ▸ Graded symptom checklists provide an objective tool for assessing a variety of symptoms related to concussions, while also tracking the severity of those symptoms over serial evaluations. ▸ Standardised assessment tools provide a helpful structure for the evaluation of concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools is available.

Sideline Evaluation and Management

▸ Any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be stopped from playing and assessed by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. ▸ Recognition and initial assessment of a concussion should be guided by a symptoms checklist, cognitive evaluation (including orientation, past and immediate memory, new learning and concentration), balance tests and further neurological physical examination. ▸ While standardised sideline tests are a useful framework for examination, the sensitivity, specificity, validity and reliability of these tests among different age groups, cultural groups and settings is largely undefined. Their practical usefulness with or without an individual baseline test is also largely unknown. ▸ Balance disturbance is a specific indicator of a concussion, but not very sensitive. Balance testing on the sideline may be substantially different than baseline tests because of differences in shoe/cleat-type or surface, use of ankle tape or braces, or the presence of other lower extremity injury. ▸ Imaging is reserved for athletes where intracerebral bleeding is suspected. ▸ There is no same day RTP for an athlete diagnosed with a concussion. ▸ Athletes suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be monitored for deteriorating physical or mental status.

Neuropsychological Testing

▸ Neuropsychological (NP) tests are an objective measure of brain-behaviour relationships and are more sensitive for subtle cognitive impairment than clinical exam. ▸ Most concussions can be managed appropriately without the use of NP testing. ▸ Computerised neuropsychological (CNP) testing should be interpreted by healthcare professionals trained and familiar with the type of test and the individual test limitations, including a knowledgeable assessment of the reliable change index, baseline variability and false-positive and false-negative rates. ▸ Paper and pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, test different domains and assess for other conditions which may masquerade as or complicate assessment of concussion. ▸ NP testing should be used only as part of a comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used in isolation. ▸ The ideal timing, frequency and type of NP testing have not been determined. ▸ In some cases, properly administered and interpreted NP testing provides an added value to assess cognitive function and recovery in the management of sports concussions. ▸ It is unknown if use of NP testing in the management of sports concussion helps prevent recurrent concussion, catastrophic injury or long-term complications. ▸ Comprehensive NP evaluation is helpful in the post-concussion management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complicated courses.

Return To Class

▸ Students will require cognitive rest and may require academic accommodations such as reduced workload and extended time for tests while recovering from a concussion.

Return To Play

▸ Concussion symptoms should be resolved before returning to exercise. ▸ A RTP progression involves a gradual, step-wise increase in physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. ▸ If symptoms occur with activity, the progression should be halted and restarted at the preceding symptom-free step. ▸ RTP after concussion should occur only with medical clearance from a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. SHORT-TERM RISKS OF PREMATURE RTP: ▸ The primary concern with early RTP is decreased reaction time leading to an increased risk of a repeat concussion or other injury and prolongation of symptoms. LONG-TERM EFFECTS: ▸ There is an increasing concern that head impact exposure and recurrent concussions contribute to long-term neurological sequelae. ▸ Some studies have suggested an association between prior concussions and chronic cognitive dysfunction. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to more clearly define risk factors and causation of any long-term neurological impairment.

Disqualification From Sport

▸ There are no evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying/retiring an athlete from a sport after a concussion. Each case should be carefully deliberated and an individualised approach to determining disqualification taken.

Education

▸ Greater efforts are needed to educate involved parties, including athletes, parents, coaches, officials, school administrators and healthcare providers to improve concussion recognition, management and prevention. ▸ Physicians should be prepared to provide counselling regarding potential long-term consequences of a concussion and recurrent concussions.

Prevention

▸ Primary prevention of some injuries may be possible with modification and enforcement of the rules and fair play. ▸ Helmets, both hard (football, lacrosse and hockey) and soft (soccer, rugby) are best suited to prevent impact injuries (fracture, bleeding, laceration, etc.) but have not been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of concussions. ▸ There is no current evidence that mouth guards can reduce the severity of or prevent concussions. ▸ Secondary prevention may be possible by appropriate RTP management.

Legislation

▸ Legislative efforts provide a uniform standard for scholastic and non-scholastic sports organisations regarding concussion safety and management.

Future Directions

▸ Additional research is needed to validate current assessment tools, delineate the role of NP testing and improve identification of those at risk of prolonged post-concussive symptoms or other long-term complications. ▸ Evolving technologies for the diagnosis of concussion, such as newer neuroimaging techniques or biological markers, may provide new insights into the evaluation and management of sports concussion.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^f5ceb628]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Disqualification from sport — retirement decisions after concussion — lacks prescriptive thresholds and emphasizes individualized assessment: there are no evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying or retiring an athlete from sport after concussion; therefore, each athlete should be carefully and individually assessed to determine the safety and potential long-term health consequences of continued participation, there is no "set" number of concussions or repetitive head impact exposures that should force retirement from a season or from sport, and it is likely that athletes with higher numbers of diagnosed concussions will be seen in clinical settings as the diagnosis and awareness of concussion is improved, considerations for retirement from sport include the length of concussion recovery (progressively longer recovery in subsequent SRCs or symptom resolution), patterns of developing concussion with less force, or increasing severity of concussions, as well as the presence of structural brain abnormalities, persistent neurological deficit, or imaging findings suggesting additional/other pathology, and individual and family tolerance of risk and perception of the benefit of sport participation should be considered and explored in a process of shared decision-making.

The acute assessment of sport-related head trauma in soccer, similar to other sports, emphasises early recognition, especially of moderate-severe TBI, that needs to be addressed in a hospital setting to perform neuroimaging evaluations. Sub-concussive events are not addressed in this section due to current recognition limitations. A critical part of the side-line assessment is the rapid screening for suspected concussion rather than making a definitive diagnosis. Players with suspected concussion following a significant head impact or displaying symptoms should undergo a side-line screening using appropriate assessment tools. The side-line assessment should quickly evaluate consciousness, cranial nerves, and balance while identifying potential severe injury warning signs. The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) 6 and child SCAT6 are the most established instruments for side-line assessment. Delayed-onset symptoms of concussion are well documented, underscoring the importance of follow-up evaluations after a suspected concussion, even if initial side-line screening is negative. If SCAT6 indicates a potential concussion, the athlete should be promptly removed from playing. Despite being well established, these recommendations are often largely disregarded. The SCAT protocol's requirement to isolate the affected athlete for 10–15 min may contribute to its low compliance. While feasible in American Football due to the possibility to pause game time, in soccer, where the game continues without interruption, athletes are often eager to resume play, leading to an increased risk of undetected concussions.

After removal from play, a resting phase is recommended to mitigate post-concussion symptoms. This rest period also helps reduce brain energy demands following a concussion, promoting recovery. A gradual return-to-play strategy should be implemented after the initial resting phase (24–48 h). A sufficient period of absence from sports participation protects athletes from the harmful effects of repeated concussions. Clinical recovery involves the complete resolution of post-concussion-related symptoms, usually occurring in 7–10 days for most athletes. Persisting symptoms (> 4 weeks) should be evaluated with multimodal clinical assessment and can benefit from rehabilitative interventions. Immediate symptom burden represents the most important prognostic factor for prolonged recovery and risk of developing chronic post-concussion syndrome. Other potential contributors shared with other sports include younger age and prior history of concussion, headache, and psychiatric issues. Notably, the intricate process of brain recovery may extend beyond the period of clinical symptoms, potentially exposing the athletes to heightened risks if they prematurely return to play.

Exertional tolerance and aerobic exercise after concussion — physical therapists should implement a symptom-guided, progressive aerobic exercise training program for patients with exertional intolerance and/or those planning return to vigorous physical activity; selection of modality and protocol should focus on goals, comfort, lifestyle, and access, and initiation timing may vary, with stabilization of symptoms to a moderate or lower level of irritability as a guiding criterion; therapists may implement progressive aerobic training for all patients, including those without exertional intolerance or plans for vigorous activity, to reduce deconditioning, promote functional brain healing, and provide a nonpharmaceutical option to improve mental health.

### Exercise intolerance and time to medical clearance to return to sport following sport-related concussion in adolescents [^07c2274a]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Adolescent participation in sport is associated with a myriad of beneficial outcomes, including developmental benefits in mental and physical health. However, sports participation is also the main context for adolescent injury. Injuries can hinder the physical and mental health benefits promoted by sport. Unique among sports injuries, sport-related concussion (SRC) is caused by biomechanical forces to the head, neck or body, which are transmitted to the brain. With an estimated one in nine adolescent players suffering a concussion each yearand with typical recovery for youth participants ranging from 14 to 28 days, SRC is a burdensome injury. Moreover, due to the vulnerability associated with brain neurodevelopment, adolescents may be more susceptible to SRC and the associated consequences. Often referenced as a snowflake injury, SRC produces a heterogeneity of signs and clinical symptoms. Moreover, recovery times range widely, with the majority of adolescents recovering in weeks, while roughly 30% experience persisting symptoms taking longer than a month before medical clearance to return to sport (RTS). It remains unclear if females experience longer recovery following concussion compared with males, with a roughly even number of studies finding longer recovery in females as studies detecting no difference. Conversely, prior research suggests that adolescent females are at higher risk of developing persisting symptoms following concussion. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis and management of SRC is complex. A multifaceted approach is necessary to guide recovery including diagnosis, management, rehabilitation and prevention of persisting postconcussive symptoms.

The formerly recommended rest-is-best approach has quickly become outdated, replaced with recommendation of an early return to symptom-tolerated exercise. Within the current multifaceted approach to SRC management, adolescents are encouraged to abstain from activity for just 24–48 hours following injury. Prolonged strict/complete cognitive and physical rest until total symptom resolution may prolong recovery. Current evidence suggests engagement in light-to-moderate-intensity physical activity (PA) that only mildly exacerbates SRC symptoms promotes a quicker recovery time course. This shift in clinical management recognises the potential negative effects of prolonged inactivity, including deconditioning, mood disturbances, academic disruption and delayed neurological recovery. However, to prescribe symptom-limited exercise following SRC, clinicians are encouraged to perform incremental exertion testing to determine an individual's symptom-exacerbation heart rate (HR) threshold.

### Median time to return to sports after concussion is within 21 days in 80% of published studies [^8bc48c70]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To perform a systematic review of the literature and evaluate the return to play (RTP) time frame after a concussion diagnosis. Our secondary purpose was to analyze and compare different prognostic variables affecting concussions, time to return to school, time to symptom resolution of concussive symptoms, and time each patient spent in the RTP protocol.

Methods

A PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library database literature review was performed in August 2022. The studies needed to report, in days, the length of time a patient/athlete was removed from play due to concussion management. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool was used for risk of bias for each study, and Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria were used for quality assessment.

Results

There were 65 studies included in the systematic review and a total of 21,966 patients evaluated. The RTP time intervals ranged from 1 to 1,820 days, with 80.7% of the median RTP time frames for each study within 21 days. Preconcussion risk factors for prolonged RTP included female sex, younger age, presence of psychiatric disorders, and history of previous concussion. Postconcussion risk factors included severe symptom scores at initial clinic visit, loss of consciousness, nonelite athletes, and delayed removal from competition. The most common sports resulting in concussion were contact sports, most commonly football and soccer. Median time to return to school was 3 to 23 days. Median time to symptom resolution ranged from 2 to 11 days. Median time in RTP protocol was 1 to 6 days.

Conclusions

Median time to return to sports after concussion is within 21 days in 80% of published studies.

### Sport-related concussion [^a674ef30]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents. Athletes seldom report concussive symptoms, which makes the diagnosis a challenge. The management of sport-related concussion has changed significantly over the last several years. The previously used grading systems and return-to-play guidelines have been abandoned in favor of more individualized assessment and management. Neuropsychological testing is being used more frequently to assist in management. After recovery, it is recommended that an athlete's return-to-play progress in a gradual, stepwise fashion while being monitored by a health care provider. Proper assessment and management of a sport-related concussion is crucial, because repeat concussions can result in decreased neurocognitive functioning, increased symptomatology, and, at times, catastrophic outcomes.

Return to learn after concussion — Sport-related concussions can include changes in attention, cognitive processing speed, learning, short-term memory, and executive function that make learning difficult, and return to learn is the process of transitioning back to the classroom after concussion using individualized academic adjustments. School personnel should be informed of the injury and implement an initial school support plan without delay, and athletes with persisting symptoms often benefit from further academic support with symptom-limited physical activity; however, return to sport training activities should follow a successful return to the classroom for student-athletes.

### Is early activity resumption after paediatric concussion safe and does it reduce symptom burden at 2 weeks post injury? The pediatric concussion assessment of rest and exertion (pedCARE) multicentre randomised clinical trial [^fbbb42f9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Investigate whether resuming physical activity (PA) at 72 hours post concussion is safe and reduces symptoms at 2weeks, compared with resting until asymptomatic.

Methods

Real-life conditions, multicentre, single-blinded randomised clinical trial, conducted in three Canadian paediatric emergency departments (ED). Children/youth aged 10- < 18 years with acute concussion were recruited between March 2017 and December 2019, and randomly assigned to a 4-week stepwise return-to-PA protocol at 72 hours post concussion even if symptomatic (experimental group (EG)) or to a return-to-PA once asymptomatic protocol (control group (CG)). The primary outcome was self-reported symptoms at 2weeks using the Health and Behaviour Inventory. Adherence was measured using accelerometers worn 24hours/day for 14 days post injury. Adverse events (AE) (worsening of symptoms requiring unscheduled ED or primary care visit) were monitored. Multivariable intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses adjusting for prognostically important covariates were examined. Missing data were imputed for the ITT analysis.

Results

456 randomised participants (EG: N = 227; mean (SD) age = 13.3 (2.1) years; 44.5% women; CG: N = 229; mean (SD) age = 13.3 (2.2) years; 43.7% women) were analysed. No AE were identified. ITT analysis showed no strong evidence of a group difference at 2weeks (adjusted mean difference = -1.3 (95% CI:-3.6 to 1.1)). In adherent participants, initiating PA 72 hours post injury significantly reduced symptoms 2weeks post injury, compared with rest (adjusted mean difference = -4.3 (95% CI:-8.4 to -0.2)).

Conclusion

Symptoms at 2weeks did not differ significantly between children/youth randomised to initiate PA 72 hours post injury versus resting until asymptomatic; however, many were non-adherent to the intervention. Among adherent participants, early PA was associated with reduced symptoms at 2weeks. Resumption of PA is safe and may be associated with milder symptoms at 2weeks.

### Natural history of concussion in sport: markers of severity and implications for management [^11a8ef10]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based clinical data are required for safe return to play after concussion in sport.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to describe the natural history of concussion in sport and identify clinical features associated with more severe concussive injury, using return-to-sport decisions as a surrogate measure of injury severity.

Study Design

Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

Male elite senior, elite junior, and community-based Australian Rules football players had preseason baseline cognitive testing (Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Trail-Making Test-Part B, and CogSport computerized test battery). Players were recruited into the study after a concussive injury sustained while playing football. Concussed players were tested serially until all clinical features of their injury had resolved.

Results

Of 1015 players, 88 concussions were observed in 78 players. Concussion-associated symptoms lasted an average of 48.6 hours (95% confidence interval, 39.5–57.7 hours) with delayed return to sport correlated with ≥ 4 symptoms, headache lasting ≥ 60 hours, or self-reported "fatigue/fogginess". Cognitive deficits using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Trail-Making Test-part B recovered concomitantly with symptoms, but computerized test results recovered 2 to 3 days later and remained impaired in 35% of concussed players after symptom resolution.

Conclusion

Delayed return to sport was associated with initially greater symptom load, prolonged headache, or subjective concentration deficits. Cognitive testing recovery varied, taking 2 to 3 days longer for computerized tests, suggesting greater sensitivity to impairment. Therefore, symptom assessment alone may be predictive of but may underestimate time to complete recovery, which may be better estimated with computerized cognitive testing.

### Maximizing recovery from concussions for youth participating in sports and recreational activities [^680ea0c1]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Concussions have become a public health issue. This public health concern has drawn the attention of many states in which laws were created to address concussions safety, recognition of signs and symptoms, immediate removal, medical clearance, and return-to-play protocols. Most state legislation focused on student athletes participating in organized sports. However, the rise in concussion can be directly attributed to children, youth, and adolescents participating in nonsports-related events. Maximizing recovery from a concussion involves implementing education programs that focus on recognition of symptoms, treatment, and return-to-learn options. Treatment strategies used to address concussed youth include physical and cognitive rest and minimizing external stimuli that can increase symptoms. Because learning is a direct outcome for all youth, a return-to-learn protocol based on a collaborative school-based team approach is suggested.

### On-the-field management of athletic head injuries [^d40cf819]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Head injuries are prevalent in collision sports. Concussions represent the relatively benign end of the spectrum of injuries. Severe closed head injuries include epidural hematomas, acute subdural hematomas, intracerebral hematomas, intraventricular hematomas, subarachnoid hemorrhages, and diffuse axonal injuries. Second impact syndrome represents a severe cerebral autoregulatory dysfunction that can lead to death in an athlete who sustains a second (often minor) closed head trauma while still symptomatic from a previous head injury. Generally, athletes who have suffered a severe closed head injury should not return to play. Exceptions include athletes asymptomatic for 1 year who return to a noncontact sport and those who recover completely from an epidural hematoma without underlying brain injury. Several guidelines for returning athletes to play have been proposed and are commonly used. The team physician has the responsibility of on-the-field evaluation and management of athletes with head injuries, as well as of advising them when it is safe to return to play.

### Progression through return-to-sport and return-to-academics guidelines for concussion management and recovery in collegiate student athletes: findings from the ivy league-big ten epidemiology of concussion study [^6135195f]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Timing of exertion initiation relative to symptom resolution influences days to full sport

The shortest time to return to full sport ≤ 14 days occurred in athletes who initiated sport-related exertion on the same day their symptoms resolved, which was a median 2 days longer in athletes who initiated exertion after symptoms resolved, and 4 days longer in athletes who initiated exertion before symptoms resolved. Further, initiating exertion just 3–4 days prior to symptom resolution was associated with decreased likelihood of a prolonged return to full sport > 28 days. In contrast, initiating exertion considerably before (7+ days) symptom resolution corresponded to a higher likelihood of delayed recovery beyond 28 days. These are novel findings, suggesting there may be prolonged-delay consequences of returning an athlete to sport too quickly; yet, there may be benefits of starting exertion at an appropriate time shortly before symptom resolution. Often, an athlete's progress on the timeline to symptom resolution is only known in retrospect, emphasising the importance of continual monitoring of athletes' symptom recovery. This observational study could motivate future research using approaches including real-time monitoringto identify whether an optimal time to introduce exertional activity exists. In addition, those with prolonged recovery > 28 days generally had a greater number of symptoms. We controlled for this as this may be a potential reason for the longer initial rest period or delay in initiation of a return protocol. Accordingly, the results of this study should motivate further research to identify appropriate timing and intensities for sport-related exertion activities as part of an RTS progression in collegiate athletes, and the benefits or consequences of initiating exertion activities relative to symptomology.

### Return-to-play decisions [^7a81511f]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Concussions occur as a result of forces directed to the head or neck, or from impulsive forces transmitted from the body to the head. They result in the rapid onset and spontaneous recovery of short-lived impairment of neurologic function. Concussions represent a functional, rather than structural, disturbance, and do not result in abnormalities on standard structural imaging. This article discusses a comprehensive approach to return to play in sports concussion, including managing athletes returning after prolonged postconcussion syndrome, multiple concussions, and intracranial hematomas and craniotomy.

### Oculomotor executive dysfunction during the early and later stages of sport-related concussion recovery [^a64a4d37]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Executive dysfunction represents the most persistent sequela of mild traumatic brain injury. It is, however, largely unclear whether a sport-related concussion similarly contributes to a persistent executive dysfunction even when an athlete has been cleared medically for return to play. Here, individuals with a diagnosis of a sport-related concussion-and their age- and sex-matched controls-completed an oculomotor assessment during the acute and later stages of injury recovery. Prosaccades (i.e., saccade to a target) and executive-related antisaccades (i.e., saccade mirror-symmetrical to a target) were completed: (1) 2–6 days after a concussive event (initial assessment), and (2) 14–20 days after the initial oculomotor assessment when individuals were cleared for return to play (follow-up assessment). At the initial assessment, the concussed group produced antisaccade reaction times (RT) that were 93ms longer than the control group (p < 0.001), whereas prosaccade RTs did not differ between groups (p = 0.25). At the follow-up assessment, concussed and control groups produced comparable pro- and antisaccade RTs (ps > 0.31); however, the former group exhibited a continued increase in directional errors (p < 0.05). That initial assessment antisaccades-but not prosaccades-differed between groups indicates that the acute recovery of a concussion is associated with a selective executive-related oculomotor deficit, and the continued increase in directional errors at the follow-up assessment suggests that such a deficit persists even when an athlete has been cleared medically for return to play. The antisaccade task may therefore serve to assess subtle executive deficits and determine when an athlete may return to play safely.

### Biomarkers of neurobiologic recovery in adults with sport-related concussion [^b686a112]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sport-related concussion (SRC), a form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a prevalent occurrence in collision sports. This is exemplified by Australian football, with an annual participation exceeding 500 000 individuals and an incidence of 6 to 10 SRCs per 1000 player match-hours. The ramifications of SRC may transcend short-term symptoms, with evidence linking repeated SRCs to chronic neurologic consequences.,

A factor likely increasing the risk of cumulative and chronic consequences is repeated SRCs in short succession. Multiple sporting associations have recently extended mandatory minimum return to play times after SRC, generally ranging from 11 to 21 days depending on the sport and level of competition. While return to play decisions after this period should be contingent on symptom resolution, progression through a graded loading program, and medical clearance, there is a common misconception that this timeframe universally defines recovery. This concern is pronounced in community sport, where medical guidance may be limited. Adding to the complexity, symptoms are subjective and athletes may not disclose them. Neurobiologic disruptions can persist beyond symptoms, and such changes may contribute to vulnerability to repeated SRC. Recognizing these challenges supports individualized return to play approaches, necessitating the development of objective tools for personalized assessment of both clinical and neurobiologic recovery.

### Updates in the general approach to pediatric head trauma and concussion [^8860ae06]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute recognition and management of traumatic brain injury along the spectrum from mild to severe is essential in optimizing neurocognitive outcomes. Concussion is common following head trauma in children, and resulting symptoms can last for months if not diagnosed and managed properly. Emerging evidence and consensus demonstrate that a program of cognitive and physical activity with a graduated return to play, sport, and school may improve outcomes following concussion. "Return to Play" legislation for youth has been adopted by most states. Outcomes of patients with severe traumatic brain injury have improved.

### Time before return to play for the most common injuries in professional football: a 16-year follow-up of the UEFA elite club injury study [^ba4222f2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The 31 most common injury diagnoses together are responsible for more than three-quarters of all injury-related time loss in professional football. This means that this study's data will give medical professionals useful prognostic information about when an injured player can be expected to be available for full participation in team activities again following the majority of all injuries that they will encounter. The study also shows that there are several diagnoses for which the absence following a re-injury is significantly longer than after an index injury highlighting the importance to avoid recurrences.

Mild injuries: potential to stay and play

Most of the 31 most common injury diagnoses are mild carrying a median absence of 7 days or less. Several of them may be considered 'stay-and-play' injuries meaning that players could suffer such an injury without being forced to miss a single game. Representatives of these mild injuries were contusions and joint injuries or pain syndromes of the lower extremity, which have good healing potential or show sufficient responsiveness to medical treatment within very few days. Due to such a limited period of absence these injuries, despite being common, will probably have limited impact on teams' performance and players' long-term health. One exception to this are concussions which may have long-lasting effects. A second impact syndrome, that is a second blow to the head before symptoms from a prior concussion has been totally resolved, may have serious consequences. To prevent repeated concussions in general, and the second impact syndrome in particular, a structured rehabilitation protocol has been developed. According to this protocol, and according to international consensus, athletes who have suffered a concussion should progress their activity level in a stepwise manner, without recurrent symptoms, over a minimum of 6 days before they are allowed to RTP. With this in mind, it is surprising that the median period of absence following a concussion in this cohort was only 5 days, meaning that at least 50% of the concussed athletes in this cohort RTP before the recommended minimum of 6 days of rehabilitation

### Returning to sports | HEADS UP… [^7ce4c945]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- The 6-Step Return to Play Progression is based on the International Concussion in Sport Guidelines.
- Parents and athletes should work closely with the team's certified athletic trainer when available. 6-Step Return to Play Progression After a concussion, an athlete should only return to sports practices with the approval and under the supervision of their healthcare provider. Each step typically takes a minimum of 24 hours. It is important for an athlete's parent and coach to watch for concussion symptoms after each day's return to sports progression activity. An athlete should only move to the next step if they do not have any new symptoms at the current step. If an athlete's symptoms come back or if he or she gets new symptoms, this is a sign that the athlete is pushing too hard. The athlete should stop these activities and the athlete's medical provider should be contacted.

After more rest and no concussion symptoms, the athlete can start at the previous step. Step 1: Back to regular activities The athlete is back to their regular activities and has the green-light from their healthcare provider to begin the return to sports progression. You can learn more about the steps to return to regular activities. Step 2: Light aerobic activity Begin with light aerobic exercise only to increase an athlete's heart rate. This means about 5 to 10 minutes on an exercise bike, walking, or light jogging. No weight lifting at this point. Step 3: Moderate activity Continue with activities to increase an athlete's heart rate with body or head movement. This includes moderate jogging, brief running, moderate-intensity stationary biking, moderate-intensity weightlifting.

Step 4: Heavy, non-contact activity Add heavy non-contact physical activity, such as sprinting/running, high-intensity stationary biking, regular weightlifting routine, non-contact sport-specific drills. Step 5: Practice & full contact Athlete may return to practice and full contact in controlled practice.

### Return to play guidelines in pediatric concussion: a systematic review of current literature [^38f6566d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric concussions, particularly in youth sports, are a significant public health concern, with up to 18% of children experiencing one by age 17. Return-to-play (RTP) guidelines aim to protect athletes from the adverse effects of repeated injuries, but these protocols vary widely based on factors such as age, sport, and geography. This review synthesizes current literature on RTP guidelines for pediatric concussions to provide evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed was conducted using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms "return to play", "pediatric concussion", and "mild traumatic brain injury". Studies published between January 2000 and December 2023 were included if they focused on RTP protocols for children aged 5 to 17. After screening 60 articles, 45 were selected for review. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.

Results

RTP protocols showed significant variability influenced by age, gender, and sport type. Common themes included initial rest followed by a gradual return to activity. Female athletes generally required longer recovery periods. Multidisciplinary care and early therapeutic interventions, such as vestibular therapy, were associated with better outcomes and faster recovery.

Conclusions

There is a need for standardized, evidence-based RTP guidelines to address inconsistencies in concussion management. Future research should focus on creating universally applicable protocols, with attention to gender, sport-specific factors, and early intervention to improve recovery outcomes for young athletes.

### Concussion management in combat sports: consensus statement from the association of ringside physicians [^3e1d76e6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Current practices in non-combat sports

In non-combat sports, it is universally agreed that, if an athlete is suspected to have suffered a concussion, he or she must be immediately removed from play and evaluated. If a concussion is diagnosed, he or she must not be allowed to return to sport (RTS) on the day of injury. The most recent consensus statement also recommends that athletes with a suspected concussion have a thorough evaluation, performed in a distraction free environment (eg, locker room and training room) rather than on the sideline. Most professional non-combat sports organisations have developed specific protocols for evaluating head injuries during a game. The overwhelming majority of non-combat sports organisations also require athletes who have sustained a concussion to go through an RTS protocol that consists of a gradual, stepwise increase in physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. Many non-combat sports organisations also require medical clearance by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussion prior to full RTS without any restriction. In some cases of professional athletics, an 'unaffiliated physician' who practices independently of the team decides final clearance to RTS.

All consensus statements agree that when an athlete sustains a concussion, an initial cognitive and physical rest period is needed prior to beginning an RTS protocol. However, what is not currently agreed on is the amount or duration of rest needed. Some statements recommend not beginning an RTS progression until the athlete no longer reports any concussion-related symptoms. Other publications recognise that (1) the current published evidence evaluating the effect of rest following a sports-related concussion is sparse and (2) light exercise may promote recovery after an initial period of rest. A 2016 publication that summarised a meeting of 37 concussion experts stated that, 'strict rest is contraindicated (after concussion) and may exacerbate the effects of (the) injury'. This same publication also summarised that concussion symptoms and impairments are treatable and that concussions in which symptoms last a prolonged period of time be managed by a multidisciplinary team with active rehabilitation depending on the individual's clinical profile. The most recent consensus statement recommends that there should be 'a brief period of rest during the acute phase (24–48 hours) after injury, patients can then be encouraged to become gradually and progressively more active while staying below their cognitive and physical symptom-exacerbation thresholds (eg, activity level should not bring on or worsen their symptoms)'.

### Acute physical and mental activity influence on concussion recovery [^2aeec692]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physical activity (PA) and mental activity (MA) postconcussion has received renewed attention to improve concussion management; however, most protocols start after several days and do not assess the acute window. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess PA and MA in the first 48 h postconcussion on the time to symptom-free status and return to play.

Methods

We recruited 78 NCAA Division I athletes (male, 51.3%; age, 19.6 ± 1.4 yr; height, 173.7 ± 11.5 cm; weight, 80.1 ± 23.2 kg) who were diagnosed with a sports-related concussion. Participants completed a 0–5 PA and MA scale daily until fully cleared for return to participation (mean, 15.1 ± 6.9 d). A quadratic model regression assessed PA and MA over the first 2 d (acute) postconcussion on to time to symptom-free status and return to play.

Results

The overall model was significant for both time to symptom free (r2 = 0.27, P = 0.004) and return to play (r2 = 0.23, P = 0.019). Reported PA was the only significant predictor for time to symptom-free (P = 0.002) and return-to-participation (P = 0.006) day. Reported MA was not associated either outcome.

Conclusions

The primary finding of this study was that mild to moderate PA acutely postconcussion was associated with reduced time to symptom free and return to participation as opposed to either lower or higher levels of PA. Conversely, acute MA was not associated with recovery outcomes. These results further elucidate the role of postconcussion PA.

### Predictors of clinical recovery from concussion: a systematic review [^2b859e29]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Concussions can have large adverse effects on cognitive functioning and balance in the first 24 hours following injury. Injured athletes report diverse physical, cognitive and emotional symptoms during the first week following injury, and a greater number and severity of symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a slower recovery. There is tremendous interest in identifying factors that might influence outcome from sport-related concussion.

For most injured athletes, cognitive deficits, balanceand symptomsimprove rapidly during the first 2 weeks following injury. The return to play timeframe is often reported to be within 10 days. However, this tends to be based on group-level findings only, not clinical outcomes from individual athletes, and group statistical analyses can obscure subgroup results and individual differences. Some athletes might return to play while still symptomatic, well before clinical recovery. During the past 10 years, there has also been accumulating evidence suggesting that a sizeable minority of high school and collegiate athletes take much longer than 10 days to clinically recover and return to sports.

The longer recovery times might partially reflect changes in the medical management of concussion, with adoption of the gradual return to play recommendations from the Concussion in Sport Group statements from the conferences in Pragueand Zurich. These return to play recommendations include no same-day return to play and a sequential progression through a series of steps prior to medical clearance for return to sports. In contrast, from 1995 to 1997, 31% of concussed high school and collegiate athletes returned to play during the same game that they sustained a concussion. Those sustaining grade 1 concussions returned on average 4 days following injury and those sustaining grade 2 concussions returned, on average, 8 days following injury.

However, the translation of the Prague and Zurich return-to-play recommendations into clinical practice has likely been gradual. There is clear evidence that from 2005 to 2008 many concussed high school athletes in the USA were returned to play prematurely, in a manner not consistent with the practice recommendations. Studies conducted in the past few years seem to reflect a change in clinical management. For example, in a study conducted between 2012 and 2014, of the 1429 concussions reported among youth, high school and college-level athletes, 3.1% returned to play within 24 hours of injury.

### Effectiveness of return to activity and return to school protocols for children postconcussion: a systematic review [^98f9b98c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

How much physical rest is recommended/what is the recommended duration of physical rest and what is the supporting evidence behind these recommendations?

Three consensus recommendations created by systematic reviewsaddressed this question and were informed by the evidence cited in question 6. An updated report from the American Academy of Pediatrics also provided recommendations to healthcare providers for the management of paediatric and adolescent concussion and recommendations for physical rest. All current consensus statements, including most recent updates to the CanChild group's 2015 protocolrecommend 1–2 days of immediate physical rest as part of initiating a gradual resumption of subsymptom physical activity.

Consensus recommendations from the CISG have traditionally been directed towards an adult population recovering from SRC. Updates between the 4thand 5th editionsof the CISG recommendations include no longer resting until symptom resolution, but instead resting for 24–48 hours before gradually reintroducing cognitive and physical activity at a subsymptom threshold level. No specific recommendations were created for the child or adolescent population in the 4th CISG consensus statement.

The differences in management of youth and adults with concussion are highlighted in the 5th CISG statement, stating that management for children should consider special paradigms for the developing child in all areas including diagnosis and management. A brief period of cognitive and physical rest with gradual symptom-limited physical and cognitive activity is recommended; however, specifications surrounding length of management are not provided.

In 2015, the CanChild group developed a conservative RTA protocolfor the paediatric population that had been adapted from the 4th CISG consensus. Step 1 of the protocol suggested rest and limited activity until patients had been symptom-free for 1 week. However, updates to the CanChild group's RTA protocol were made in 2019 to reflect the 5th CISG consensus and now recommend physical rest with symptom-guided activity for 24–48 hours before beginning an RTA/RTS protocol.

Children with concussion should be immediately removed from play and their physical exertion should be limited. These most current guidelines recommend that children initially undergo 24–48 hours of rest before resuming a gradual RTA that does not exacerbate symptoms. The level of evidence assigned to these recommendations was Level 1, Level 2 or Level 4 (see table 1) because they were consensus documents based off of systematic reviews of the literature or expert opinion, respectively.

### Return to play time for the 30 most common injuries in the UEFA women's elite club injury study [^09c9c026]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Moderate injuries – The leading cause of absence in professional football

Moderate injuries, resulting in a median absence of 8 to 28 days, appear to be the most common in women's football. This is true in terms of the number of diagnoses included in the category, with 16 of the 30 most common diagnoses, in terms of the total number of absence days caused, being responsible for 37% of the total absence caused by injuries during the study period, and in terms of the total number of injuries. In fact, the seven most common injury diagnoses in our study were all moderate injuries. Six of these (hamstring muscle injury (structural), groin adductor pain, ankle lateral ligament injury, quadriceps muscle injury (structural), calf muscle injury (structural) and knee medial collateral ligament injury) were also the six most common in men's football. The only exception to this similarity, between men's and women's football, were concussions which were less common and not among the seven most common injury types in men's football and also caused shorter absence in men's football and was thus considered a mild injury.

The relative frequency of concussions in the women's game has been described and discussed previouslyand is concerning since concussions may have long-lasting effects, especially if players suffer a second blow to the head before a prior concussion has been totally resolved, known as the second impact syndrome. A structured rehabilitation protocol has been developed to reduce the risk of second impact syndromes. This protocol states, in accordance with international consensus, that athletes suffering from a concussion should stepwise increase their activity level over a period of a minimum of 6 days, without recurrent symptoms, before they are allowed to RTP. It is thus encouraging that the median period of absence following a concussion in this cohort was 9.0 days, indicating that at women's elite level clubs the minimum recommended period of 6 days of rehabilitation is respected in most cases.

### Legal and ethical implications in the evaluation and management of sports-related concussion [^cea57a37]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Legal and ethical implications in sports-related concussion — scope and physician duties are outlined as follows: This position paper reviews and compares the components of sports-related concussion laws, including education, removal from play, and clearance for return to play, and it highlights the challenges privacy laws present while proposing an ethical framework encompassing professionalism, informed decision-making, patient autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, conflicts of interest, and distributive justice. Physicians caring for concussed athletes have an ethical obligation to ensure that their primary responsibility is to safeguard the current and future physical and mental health of their patients, and physicians have a duty to provide athletes and their parents with information about concussion risk factors, symptoms, and the risks for postconcussion neurologic impairments. Physicians should facilitate informed and shared decision-making among athletes, parents, and medical teams while protecting athletes from potential harm, and including concussion evaluation and management training in neurology residency programs, as well as developing a national concussion registry, is stated to benefit patients by supporting policy and clinical guideline development.

### Diagnosis and management of sports-related concussion: a 15-year-old athlete with a concussion [^a39d1bdf]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Concussion in youth athletes is a growing problem worldwide. During the past decade, significant progress has been made in standardization of the assessment of young athletes, and a growing appreciation of metabolic vulnerability, activity, and cognitive challenges has led to guidelines and suggestions for rest from the field as well as cognitive rest from school. Outcome data have begun to establish groups linked to symptom class, genetics, and sex who are at risk of worse outcomes from concussions. Decisions regarding return to activity are now based on at-rest symptoms, graded increases in activity, and neuropsychological testing. Using the case of Ms X, a 15-year-old otherwise healthy high school student who fell while skiing, evaluation, prognosis, and management of concussion are discussed.

### Returning to school following sport-related concussion [^45933f6f]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Following sport-related concussion, the priorities for student athletes are return to school and extracurricular activities. Consensus-based practice recommendations emphasize rest and gradual resumption of activities. Specific evidence-based recommendations are not available. This article provides recommendations, strategies, and a general approach to the recovery process. Most youth recover clinically and return to their normal activities within the first month following injury. It is best to avoid prolonged time off from school and restrictions on social and recreational activities because these might result in adverse consequences, such as life stress, depression, and falling behind in school.

### Progression through return-to-sport and return-to-academics guidelines for concussion management and recovery in collegiate student athletes: findings from the ivy league-big ten epidemiology of concussion study [^684483f5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most athletes with SRC progressed through an RTS protocol as expected based on a determination from the athletes' clinicians. Also, most athletes reached stages of the protocol in an order generally consistent with best practice guidelines that are relevant to the collegiate-athlete population; namely, the 2017 CISG consensus statementand 2014 NATA position statement. Those guidelines are specific regarding return-to-sport, but are comparatively vague regarding academic activities, which may explain why the timing of resuming full academics varied the most of the five stages we studied. We found that time to return to full play varied systematically based on stages of return relative to symptom resolution, specifically return to full academics and initiation of exertion. Two-thirds of the athletes exhibited a brief period of physical and cognitive rest (ie, 24–48 hours) during the acute phase of SRC, which we controlled for in the analysis. Taken together, the results suggest concussion management teams adhere to current guidelines, and the timing of each return stage corresponds to overall time to return to sport; however, future guidelines should address the timing of academic return more directly and specifically for collegiate athletes. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report on a large population of athletes with SRC and the timing of reaching stages relevant to a RTS protocol. Below we discuss the findings and contributions, including evidence in support of CISG and NATA recommendations and evidence that could inform updates.

### Physical therapy evaluation and treatment after concussion / mild traumatic brain injury [^80645d1d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2020). High credibility.

Aerobic exercise after concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) — Physical therapists should implement a symptom-guided, progressive aerobic exercise training program for patients who have experienced a concussive event and exhibit exertional intolerance and/or are planning to return to vigorous physical activity levels, with selection of modality and protocol focused on patient goals, comfort, lifestyle, and access to equipment; timing may vary by patient, but stabilization of symptoms to a moderate or lower level of irritability may be a guiding criterion. Physical therapists may implement progressive aerobic training for all patients who have experienced a concussive event, including those who do not exhibit exertional intolerance and those who do not intend to engage in vigorous physical activity, to reduce risk for deconditioning, promote functional brain healing, and provide a nonpharmacological option to improve mental health.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^67f96d15]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Sideline assessment tools, return-to-play caution, and emergency referral red flags — use and limitations: Tools such as the King-Devick Test and vestibular/ocular motor screening have demonstrated some usefulness in SRC evaluation, but at this time there are not enough studies of adequate quality to recommend their inclusion in the SCAT. Sideline assessment tools can assist health care providers but are not intended to be used in isolation for making the diagnosis of SRC and, particularly in younger athletes, have not been studied adequately to recommend widespread use. Despite limited normative data, it is preferable to compare performance with an athlete's own preinjury status, yet preinjury assessments are often not obtained or available immediately after injury. Because symptoms or deficits may not present immediately, repeat assessments are crucial after head trauma, and if a concussion assessment has been initiated it is better to err on the side of caution and keep an athlete from returning to play on that day, while continuing serial assessments, unless the assessor is confident that SRC has not occurred. Red flags that warrant urgent referral to an emergency department include weakness or tingling in the arms or legs, severe or progressively increasing headache, loss of consciousness, deteriorating level of consciousness, repeated episodes of vomiting, a combative state, and seizures or convulsions.

### Symptom-based assessment of the severity of a concussion [^7e449e8c]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Object

Current grading systems of concussion and return-to-play guidelines have little empirical support. The authors therefore examined the relationships of the characteristics and symptoms of concussion and the history of concussion to three indicators of concussion severity-number of immediate symptoms, number of symptoms at the initial follow-up examination, and duration of symptoms — to establish an empirical basis for grading concussions.

Methods

Forty-seven athletes who sustained concussions were administered alternate forms of an Internet-based neurocognitive test until their performances were within normal limits relative to baseline levels. Assessments of observer-reported and self-reported symptoms at the sideline of the playing field on the day of injury, and at follow-up examinations were also obtained as part of a comprehensive concussion management protocol. Although loss of consciousness (LOC) was a useful indicator of the initial severity of the injury, it did not correlate with other indices of concussion severity, including duration of symptoms. Athletes reporting memory problems at follow-up examinations had significantly more symptoms in general, longer durations of those symptoms, and significant decreases in scores on neurocognitive tests administered approximately 48 hours postinjury. This decline of scores on neurocognitive testing was significantly associated with an increased duration of symptoms. A history of concussion was unrelated to the number and duration of symptoms.

Conclusions

This paper represents the first documentation of empirically derived indicators of the clinical course of postconcussion symptom resolution. Self-reported memory problems apparent 24 hours postconcussion were robust indicators of the severity of sports-related concussion and should be a primary consideration in determining an athlete's readiness to return to competition. A decline on neurocognitive testing was the only objective measure significantly related to the duration of symptoms. Neither a brief LOC nor a history of concussion was a useful predictor of the duration of postconcussion symptoms.

### A prospective study of postconcussive outcomes after return to play in Australian football [^d48e84b0]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Decisions regarding safe return to play after concussion in sport remain difficult.

Objective

To determine whether a concussed player returned to play using an individual clinical management strategy is at risk of impaired performance or increased risk of injury or concussion.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

All elite Australian football players were followed for 4 seasons. Players were recruited into the study after sustaining a concussive injury. Outcome measures included performance statistics (disposals per hour match-time), injury rates, and recurrence of concussion on return to play. A subset of players had brief screening cognitive tests performed at baseline and after their concussion. Noninjured players matched for team, position, age, and size were chosen as controls.

Results

A total of 199 concussive injuries were observed in 158 players. Sixty-one concussive injuries were excluded from analysis because of incomplete data (45 players) or presence of concurrent injury (16 players). Of the 138 concussive injuries assessed, 127 players returned to play without missing a game (92%). The remainder of concussed players returned to play after missing a single game (8%). Overall, there was no significant decline in disposal rates in concussed players on return to competition. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in injury rates between concussed and team, position, and game-matched controls. In the subset of players who had completed screening cognitive tests, all had returned to their individual baseline performance before being returned to play.

Conclusion

Return to play decisions based on individual clinical assessment of recovery allows safe and appropriate return to sport following a concussive injury.

### Returning to sports and activities… [^16d38de2]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Returning to Sports and Activities After a concussion, an athlete should only return to sports practices with the approval and under the supervision of their health care provider. When available, be sure to also work closely with your team's certified athletic trainer. Below are six gradual steps that you, along with a health care provider, should follow to help safely return an athlete to play. Remember, this is a gradual process. These steps should not be completed in one day, but instead over days, weeks, or months. It is important for an athlete's parent and coach to watch for concussion symptoms after each day's return to play progression activity. An athlete should only move to the next step if they do not have any new symptoms at the current step. If an athlete's symptoms come back or if he or she gets new symptoms, this is a sign that the athlete is pushing too hard. The athlete should stop these activities and the athlete's medical provider should be contacted.

After more rest and no concussion symptoms, the athlete can start at the previous step. Step 1: Back to regular activities Athlete is back to their regular activities and has the green-light from their healthcare provider to begin the return to play process. An athlete's return to regular activities involves a stepwise process. It starts with a few days of rest and is followed by light activity and moderate activity that do not worsen symptoms.

### Managing return to activities | HEADS UP… [^2b216d8e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Returning to play Guiding the recovery of individuals of any age with mTBI who participate in competitive or recreational activities requires careful management to avoid re-injury or prolonged recovery. Athletes engaged in collision sports require special management and evaluation to ensure full recovery prior to their return to play. Managing an Athlete with a Concussion For many healthcare professionals, the first chance to assess a young athlete with a suspected concussion will not be on the sidelines, but an office or emergency department. This examination will likely include a physical examination, covering cognition, neurology, balance, and most importantly, any signs of deteriorating neurological function.

When managing an athlete with concussion, a healthcare professional's management plan should cover both returning to school and to play, and should:

- Monitor both physical and cognitive activities
- Consider concussion history
- Be individualized to the athlete. Return to Play Progression 6-Step Return to Play Progression It is important for an athlete's parent and coach to watch for concussion symptoms after each day's return to play progression activity. An athlete should only move to the next step if they do not have any new symptoms at the current step. If an athlete's symptoms come back or if he or she gets new symptoms, this is a sign that the athlete is pushing too hard. The athlete should stop these activities and the athlete's medical provider should be contacted. After more rest and no concussion symptoms, the athlete can start at the previous step.

Before the start of the season, healthcare professionals should learn about state, league, or sports governing body's laws or policies on concussion. Some policies may require health care professionals to take a training program or provide written clearance as part of the return to play process for young athletes. When to refer to a specialist Remember, most people will recover quickly and fully following a concussion. Some will have symptoms for weeks or longer. Healthcare professionals should consider referral to a concussion specialist if:

- The symptoms worsen at any time,
- The symptoms have not gone away after 2 to 4 weeks, or
- The patient has a history of multiple concussions or risk factors for prolonged recovery. This may include a history of: migraines, depression, mood disorders, or anxiety, as well as developmental disorders such as learning disabilities and ADHD.

### Quality improvement in neurology: concussion quality measurement set [^2c0d35c8]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Current standard of care for concussion — published consensus statements and evidence-based guidelines generally converge on several key recommendations, including (1) removal from and avoidance of at-risk activities, such as contact sports, until medical evaluation and clearance, (2) lack of an indication for acute neuroimaging for the routine diagnosis of concussion in absence of red flags, (3) assessment of concussion-related symptoms, (4) completion of a neurologic physical examination, and (5) a gradual return to physical and cognitive activities prior to medical clearance. The work group aimed to incorporate these key recommendations and several others into quality measures, but lack of current evidence and anticipated difficulty with measurement implementation prevented the development of several proposed measures.

### Characteristics and outcomes of athletes with slow recovery from sports-related concussion: a CARE consortium study [^4e2cb2e6]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

CARE Consortium and Protocol

The NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium is a 30-site study of the natural history and neurobiology of concussion previously described. In brief, participants completed a preseason baseline evaluation consisting of demographics, medical history, concussion-like symptoms, postural control, and neurocognitive functioning. All CARE sites used a common definition of concussionwith diagnosis made by a local team physician. Concussed participants were reassessed at 5 additional postinjury time points: within 6 hours and again 24–48 hours after injury, at clearance to initiate return to play progression (defined herein as the asymptomatic time point), at clearance for unrestricted return to play (RTP), and 6 months postinjury. Concussed participants reported symptoms to the medical staff daily, up to 14 days after injury and then weekly if they had not yet returned to unrestricted play. Symptoms were captured using the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool–3rd Edition (SCAT-3) symptom list, a 22-item inventory with severity ranked on a 0–6 scale. Percent completion of the daily symptom reports was used as a metric of clinical care assessment frequency. The presiding clinician's examination served as the gold standard for determining an athlete's readiness to initiate the return to progression protocol, and for unrestricted RTP.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

Before participation, all participants gave written informed consent. The research protocol and consent form were approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating site and the US Army Human Research Protection Office. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Participants

All varsity athletes at 26 civilian universities and all varsity athletes and cadets from 4 military service academies within the United States were eligible to participate. Between Fall 2014 and Spring 2018, a total of 34,709 athletes and cadets were enrolled in the CARE Consortium and completed a minimum of 1 baseline evaluation. After enrollment and intake, 3,361 concussions were recorded. A previous reportused this same cohort to characterize the natural history of concussion recovery including the median time from injury to initiation of graded exercise and to clearance for RTP.

### Concussion in sport: the consensus process continues [^79fa10b1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Planning ahead: the process

The sixth International Consensus Conference on Concussion in Sport was first postponed to October of 2021 due to the pandemic. Given the interactive nature of the conference, the consensus format lends itself far better to an engaged on-site meeting rather than an online or hybrid format. Global time zones posed additional challenges in agreeing on optimal scheduling of key sessions online. Unfortunately, due to travel limitations and the lack of ability to have participants from around the globe participate meaningfully in two full days of meetings followed by the expert panel consensus seminar, virtually or in a hybrid format, the Conference was again rescheduled — this time to Amsterdam on 27 October 2022–29 October 2022. This conference brings together researchers, clinicians and stakeholders with an interest in concussion in adults, children and athletes with disabilities, to summarise and present the latest science, discuss the current state of the evidence and write the sixth International Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport.

A series of systematic reviews on key topics in SRC (acute screening, follow-up postinjury evaluation, rest and exercise, treatment/rehabilitation, persistent symptoms, recovery, return to sport, residual/long-term effects, retirement, risk reduction/prevention) are currently in preparation. The conference begins with 2 days of open meetings where the latest evidence is summarised and discussed. The accepted abstracts for each topic area will be presented as posters and the two top ranked abstracts in each category will be presented as podium presentations at the beginning of each topic of discussion. Each systematic review will then be presented, followed by a discussion period, which will be scribed for reference during the panel meeting. The third day is a consensus meeting that focuses on answering predetermined clinically relevant questions. The participants in the consensus meeting have been selected based on their expertise and/or publishing record in SRC, while keeping in mind geographical and specific areas of content knowledge. Finally, the fourth day will focus on development and updating of tools such as the SCAT. The scientific committee is cogniscant that SRC is a critical area of public health interest and will embrace a broader spectrum of topics, experts and participants than ever before. A separate manuscript will describe the details of the methodology used. While consensus will be sought, dissenting opinions will be acknowledged and taken into full consideration. Athletes' input will also be sought as part of this process. The science will be robust, the emerging advice will be athlete-centred, and the accompanying tools freely accessible.

### Progression through return-to-sport and return-to-academics guidelines for concussion management and recovery in collegiate student athletes: findings from the ivy league-big ten epidemiology of concussion study [^e7f1a356]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Measures of initial rest, return-to-academics and return-to-sport

Athletic trainers, paired with members of the multidisciplinary concussion management team, re-initiate and progress student athletes through academic and athletic activities following concussion. This study does not directly evaluate details of the RTS protocols and the extent to which practices vary across study sites; however, each site must comply with the NCAA concussion management checklist. Instead, each site records whether the athlete had an initial period of 24–48 hours physical rest and cognitive rest immediately post-injury.

Our data collection form asks 'Did the student progress through the return to play protocol as expected?' with a binary (yes/no) response to indicate if any stage of the RTS was repeated or incomplete. Also, dates are recorded when each athlete (1) self-reported being asymptomatic (ie, returned to baseline symptoms), and returned to (2) exertion activity, (3) limited sport and (4) full sport, and (5) full academics. Each of these milestones is relevant to one of the stages in the RTS and return-to-academics strategies in the 2017 CISG consensus statement and the 2014 NATA position statement. For example, our 'exertion activity' milestones corresponds to either 'light aerobic exercise' (stage 2) or 'sport-specific exercise' (stage 3) in the 2017 CISG consensus statement; 'limited sport' corresponds to either 'sport-specific exercise' (stage 3) or 'non-contact training drills' (stage 4). We refer to these as return-to-activity stages.

Profiles describing sequence of return

We determined the sequence in which each athlete reached the five return-to-activity stages. We then classified each athlete according to the 'profile' describing their return.

Outcome identification

The primary outcome was returning to full sport ≤ 14 days post-injury (ie, yes/no), with prolonged delay to full sport > 28 days as a secondary outcome. The timing of these outcomes is based on finding that 50% of student athletes in the Ivy League and Big Ten return to full sport in 14 days, yet one-third require longer than 28 days, making them clinically relevant. Further, these outcomes are easily translated into weekly increments, to aid in interpretation.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: a joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^7611c878]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Important considerations for return to sport

A multidisciplinary, collaborative concussion management approach is encouraged, but the final return to sport decision should be made by the team clinician or an appropriately licensed healthcare professional.

Although evidence is limited, return to sport in child athletes, whose brains are still developing, should follow a more conservative approach than adults. A more conservative approach to return to sport should be taken with the paediatric population: children should not be permitted to return to unrestricted sport in fewer than 7 days, with several organisations mandating longer periods of time for this group.

On-line symptom and cognitive self-evaluation for readiness to return to sport by athletes is strongly discouraged. Athletes should not be taking medication to treat concussion-related symptoms when performing cognitive tests or returning to sport. Computerised neurocognitive test batteries (eg, CogState Sport, ImPACT) have cost implications, especially at community level, and should not take precedence over programmes to provide clinical care. Computerised batteries should not be used as the sole criterion for return to sport decision-making. Neurocognitive test batteries need to be interpreted as part of a comprehensive clinical evaluation — preferably by a neuropsychologist, when available.

Independence in the concussion management process

Many factors can complicate presentation, diagnosis and recovery from concussion, making additional medical opinions valuable in concussion management. In addition, television coverage and commentary of injuries in collision sport and the high profile of concussion as a public health issue, has placed medical management and return to sport decisions under increased scrutiny. Because of this, auditing of concussion diagnoses and management may be useful for quality assurance, training and medicolegal purposes.

Auditing strategies currently used in different collision sports include:
Independent, unaffiliated neurological consultants who may assist with recognition of mechanisms of injury associated with potential concussion (live or on video), assist sideline concussion evaluation and follow-up on confirmed cases. The independent, unaffiliated consultant is often a neurosurgeon, neurologist, emergency medicine physician or rehabilitation medicine physician with expertise in managing traumatic brain injury.
Peer review of team doctor decisions, case-by-case follow-up and referral to an expert panel for difficult cases.
An independent concussion consultant to evaluate players in the days following injury.
Using match officials in the community g ame who, when suspecting a possible concussion, may indicate removal from sport and direct the injured athlete to enter a process of formal medical evaluation and stand-down (eg, Blue Card system in rugby union).

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^c99fd461]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Exercise for persistent postconcussive symptoms — Activity and exercise that does not exacerbate symptoms are recommended for those with PPCS, and a formal symptom-limited aerobic exercise program has been shown to be safe and improve resolution of persistent symptoms compared with controls and should be considered in athletes with symptoms lasting longer than expected. It is ideal for those with PPCS to be evaluated by a provider or multidisciplinary team with expertise in complicated concussion management.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^a2e66069]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents — graduated return-to-sport (RTS) program specifies Stage 1 symptom-limited activity with daily activities that do not provoke symptoms and the goal of gradual reintroduction of work and/or school activities; Stage 2 light aerobic exercise such as walking or stationary cycling at slow-to-medium pace with no resistance training to increase heart rate; Stage 3 sport-specific exercise of running or skating drills with no activities with risk of head impact to add movement; Stage 4 noncontact training drills with harder drills and possible progressive resistance training to achieve exercise, coordination, and increased thinking during sport; Stage 5 full-contact practice after medical clearance with full, normal training activities to restore confidence and allow coaching staff to assess functional skills; and Stage 6 return to sport with normal game play for full clearance/participation. Recommend 48 h of relative physical and cognitive rest before beginning the program and no more than 1 step should be completed per day; if any symptoms worsen during exercise, the athlete should return to the previous step and consider prolonging and/or altering the program for pediatric and/or adolescent patients with symptoms over 4 wk. Although beginning symptom-limited aerobic activity may be appropriate, children and adolescents should not fully return to sports until they have also successfully returned to full academics, and they should not advance beyond step 2 until they return to their preinjury symptom level and are fully participating in school. Each step should take at least 24 hours, and it may take the athlete under a week to resume full game participation, provided that symptoms do not return; if symptoms return while the athlete is in the program, the athlete should wait 24 hours, and if the symptoms have resolved, he or she may then attempt the previous step that was completed without symptoms and continue the progression if symptoms do not recur. Reevaluation by a health care provider is indicated for any athlete with continued return of symptoms with exertion; athletes with a history of multiple concussions or a prolonged recovery (over 4 weeks) may need a longer period to progress through each step, and a specialist with experience in concussion management may be needed to create an appropriate return-to-activity program.

### Investigating the range of symptom endorsement at initiation of a graduated return-to-play protocol after concussion and duration of the protocol: a study from the national collegiate athletic association-department of defense concussion, assessment, research, and education (CARE) consortium [^41c172f8]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Organizations recommend that athletes should be asymptomatic or symptom-limited before initiating a graduated return-to-play (GRTP) protocol after sports-related concussion, although asymptomatic or symptom-limited is not well-defined.

Hypotheses

(1) There will be a range (ie, beyond zero as indicator of "symptom-free") in symptom severity endorsement when athletes are deemed ready to initiate a GRTP protocol. (2) Baseline symptom severity scores and demographic/preinjury medical history factors influence symptom severity scores at the commencement of the GRTP protocol. (3) Greater symptom severity scores at GRTP protocol initiation will result in longer protocol duration. (4) Symptom severity scores will not differ between those who did and did not sustain a repeat injury within 90 days of their initial injury.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

Across 30 universities, athletes (N = 1531) completed assessments at baseline and before beginning the GRTP protocol, as determined by local medical staff. Symptom severity scores were recorded with the symptom checklist of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-3rd Edition. Nonparametric comparisons were used to examine the effect of medical, demographic, and injury factors on symptom endorsement at GRTP protocol initiation, as well as differences in symptom severity scores between those who did and did not sustain a repeat injury within 90 days. A Cox regression was used to examine the association between symptom severity scores at GRTP protocol initiation and protocol duration.

Results

Symptom severity scores at the time when the GRTP protocol was initiated were as follows: 0 to 5 (n = 1378; 90.0%), 6 to 10 (n = 76; 5.0%), 11 to 20 (n = 42; 3.0%), and ≥ 21 (n = 35; 2.0%). Demographic (sex and age), medical (psychiatric disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disorder), and other factors (baseline symptom endorsement and sleep) were significantly associated with higher symptom severity scores at the GRTP initiation (P < .05). The 4 GRTP initiation time point symptom severity score groups did not significantly differ in total time to unrestricted RTP, χ 2 (3) = 1.4; P = 0.73. When days until the initiation of the GRTP protocol was included as a covariate, symptom severity scores between 11 and 20 (P = 0.02; hazard ratio = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.06–1.96) and ≥ 21 (P < .001; hazard ratio = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.34–2.63) were significantly associated with a longer GRTP protocol duration as compared with symptom severity scores between 0 and 5. Symptom severity scores at GRTP initiation did not significantly differ between those who sustained a repeat injury within 90 days and those who did not (U = 29,893.5; P = 0.75).

Conclusion

A range of symptom severity endorsement was observed at GRTP protocol initiation, with higher endorsement among those with higher baseline symptom endorsement and select demographic and medical history factors. Findings suggest that initiation of a GRTP protocol before an absolute absence of all symptoms is not associated with longer progression of the GRTP protocol, although symptom severity scores > 10 were associated with longer duration of a GRTP protocol. Results can be utilized to guide clinicians toward optimal GRTP initiation (ie, balancing active recovery with avoidance of premature return to activity).

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^d684803c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Sport-related concussion (SRC) is a common injury in recreational and organised sport. Over the past 30 years, there has been significant progress in our scientific understanding of SRC, which in turn has driven the development of clinical guidelines for diagnosis, assessment and management of SRC. In addition to a growing need for knowledgeable healthcare professionals to provide evidence-based care for athletes with SRC, media attention and legislation have created awareness and, in some cases, fear about many issues and unknowns surrounding SRC. The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) formed a writing group to review the existing literature on SRC, update its previous position statement, and to address current evidence and knowledge gaps regarding SRC. The absence of definitive outcomes-based data is challenging and requires relying on the best available evidence integrated with clinical experience and patient values. This statement reviews the definition, pathophysiology and epidemiology of SRC, the diagnosis and management of both acute and persistent concussion symptoms, the short-term and long-term risks of SRC and repetitive head impact exposure, SRC prevention strategies, and potential future directions for SRC research. The AMSSM is committed to best clinical practices, evidence-based research and educational initiatives that positively impact the health and safety of athletes.

### Improving health and safety at camp [^73b75380]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Camp head injury and concussion management — Head injuries can cause long-term symptoms and complications, and appropriate management is essential for reducing physical and cognitive deficits. Camp activities should be designed to limit head injury risk, and camps should provide proper equipment and supervision to decrease the incidence and severity of head injuries. Camp staff should understand concussion definition, signs, and symptoms and should follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state-specific return-to-play guidelines before participation resumes; if an on-site qualified health care provider is unavailable for suspected head injuries, children should be taken to the nearest medical facility for urgent evaluation.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: a joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^f4a1b7c7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Signs of concussion and expected actions

A number of sporting codes refer to mandatory or discretionary visible signs of concussion, which may guide the immediate course of action (tables 1 and 2). The signs defined as mandatory and discretionary may differ, as may the course of action. In some sports (AFL, NFL, NRL, rugby), mandatory signs indicate immediate removal from the field of play. In other sports (NHL), mandatory signs are indications for a mandatory off-field evaluation.

A mandatory or discretionary sign in combination with a mechanism of injury involving head contact significantly increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of concussion.

Table 1
Mandatory signs of concussion and appropriate action

Table 2
Discretionary signs of concussion and appropriate action

It is possible to diagnose concussion immediately. However, due to delayed presentation, excluding a diagnosis of concussion may take up to 48 hours following head contact. During this period – whether the athlete continues to play, or not – serial evaluations, as described in the Berlin Consensus Statement, should be completed by a medical practitioner. The Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT5)(either complete or in part) and Concussion Recognition Tool (CRT5)should be used to trigger or when conducting initial evaluations. The SCAT5 should be used for serial evaluations (described in the 'Management on and around the field of play' section).

The 'stunned' athlete, who has very short-lived, temporary signs or symptoms that fall within the current definition of concussion, could have a pathological process or injury type that may in the future be proven to be transient and not necessarily reflect a concussion. In these instances, some codes have implemented temporary removal for an evaluation and, no matter what the outcome, this should be followed by further serial assessments. If doubt exists, the athlete should not return to the field of play that day.

Sport-specific challenges for diagnosis and management of concussion

In sports that do not have a replacement policy (eg, football/soccer), there may be additional challenges contributing to increased pressure on athletes to under-report symptoms. Clinicians are at a significant disadvantage when required to make 'on-the-run' and 'on-the-field' decisions with insufficient time for an appropriate evaluation. Sports in which the laws do not facilitate the recommended 10 min off-field assessment should look to policymakers to make law changes rather than expecting clinicians to compromise the concussion evaluation and, possibly, athlete safety.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement on concussion in sport [^bbbc27f1]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Definition of concussion — concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function that involves a complex pathophysiologic process, is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury classified at the less severe end of the brain injury spectrum, and clinical signs and symptoms cannot be otherwise explained by drug, alcohol, medication use, other injuries, or other comorbidities.

### Grade 1 or "ding" concussions in high school athletes [^5579936f]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Recent concussion management guidelines have suggested that athletes with mild (grade 1) concussions may be returned to play if asymptomatic for 15 minutes. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of a current concussion management guideline in classifying and managing mild concussion.

Hypothesis

High school athletes diagnosed with a grade 1 concussion will demonstrate measurable decline in neuropsychological functioning that persists during the 1st week of recovery.

Study Design

Prospective study designed to evaluate neuropsychological functioning both prior to and following concussion.

Methods

Forty-three high school athletes completed neuropsychological test performance and symptom ratings prior to the season and at two times during the 1st week following mild concussion.

Results

Thirty-six hours after injury, mildly concussed high school athletes demonstrated a decline in memory (P < 0.003) and a dramatic increase in self-reported symptoms (P < 0.00001) compared to baseline performance.

Conclusions

Athletes with grade 1 concussion demonstrated memory deficits and symptoms that persisted beyond the context in which they were injured. These data suggest that current grade 1 return-to-play recommendations that allow for immediate return to play may be too liberal.

Clinical Relevance

A reconsideration of current concussion grading systems appears to be warranted.
