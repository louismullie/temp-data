## Question

Older woman with diabetes presents with fever, confusion, hypotension, elevated creatinine, and MRI evidence of subcutaneous soft tissue gas; received fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

A 63-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by one of her neighbors because of fever and confusion. She has a 10-year history of diabetes mellitus and hemorrhoids. Her medications include insulin and metformin. Her blood pressure is 90/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 115/min, the respirations are 21/min, and the temperature is 39.5℃ (103.1℉). The cardiopulmonary examination shows no other abnormalities. The serum creatinine level is 2.5 mg/dL. An MRI shows swelling of subcutaneous soft tissue and gas. She is resuscitated with IV fluids. Broad-spectrum empiric IV antibiotics are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer Choices:
A. High-dose IV steroids
B. Image-guided needle aspiration
C. Surgical debridement
D. No further management is indicated at this time

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which next step is most appropriate for a 63-year-old woman with diabetes, fever, confusion, hypotension, elevated creatinine, and MRI evidence of subcutaneous gas after fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why MRI gas is pivotal. Then, I should verify the standard of care and whether antibiotics alone suffice. Next, I will review guideline-backed timing for surgical source control. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of image-guided aspiration. I should also consider whether steroids help or harm in this context. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, prioritized recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. Subcutaneous gas on MRI in a toxic-appearing patient with diabetes, hypotension, and confusion strongly suggests necrotizing soft tissue infection, and gas formation is a hallmark that heightens concern for clostridial or polymicrobial necrotizing infections, including Fournier's gangrene depending on location, with mortality that remains high despite modern care [^111YYvW6] [^111KxkVQ] [^114j2S3K].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the standard of care. The cornerstone of NSTI management is early surgical debridement plus broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care, and antibiotics alone are insufficient because they cannot eradicate devitalized tissue and ongoing bacterial proliferation within necrotic planes [^113GSnmq] [^1167puWs] [^115He6aW].

> I need to check the timing next. Multiple high-quality guidelines recommend early surgical source control, ideally within 6–12 hours of presentation, and advise not to delay surgery for imaging once the diagnosis is established or strongly suspected; delays worsen outcomes, and scheduled re-debridements every 12–24 hours are often necessary until necrosis is controlled [^112aMeRh] [^115DZT4o] [^114q1mfi] [^114qiECt].

> Wait, let me verify the role of image-guided aspiration. Needle aspiration is not appropriate here because it does not provide definitive source control for necrotizing infection and can delay life-saving debridement; guidelines emphasize proceeding directly to surgical exploration when suspicion is high, reserving imaging adjuncts for diagnostic uncertainty rather than treatment delays [^115He6aW] [^112JBKL9] [^114q1mfi].

> I should double-check the steroid question. High-dose IV steroids are not indicated in NSTI and may blunt host defenses; steroids are occasionally considered for uncomplicated cellulitis, but this patient has systemic toxicity and gas-forming necrosis, so steroids would likely worsen outcomes rather than help [^116a7rCB] [^113GSnmq].

> Let me synthesize. The most appropriate next step is urgent surgical debridement, with simultaneous continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemodynamic support, and with plans for serial re-debridements as needed; this approach aligns with contemporary reviews and multisociety guidelines and offers the best chance to reduce mortality and morbidity in this high-risk presentation [^113GSnmq] [^115He6aW] [^112aMeRh].

> Final answer: C. Surgical debridement.

---

The most appropriate next step is **surgical debridement** [^113GSnmq] because MRI evidence of subcutaneous gas in a diabetic patient with fever, confusion, and hypotension indicates necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) [^113GSnmq], a surgical emergency requiring urgent source control [^115He6aW]. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluids are necessary but insufficient alone; **delaying surgery increases mortality** [^112aMeRh]. High-dose steroids are contraindicated in sepsis, and image-guided aspiration is inadequate for source control in NSTI [^115He6aW].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting surgical debridement

- **MRI evidence of subcutaneous gas**: Strongly suggests NSTI, including necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene, which are life-threatening and require immediate surgical intervention [^113GSnmq].

- **Systemic toxicity**: Fever, confusion, and hypotension indicate severe sepsis or septic shock, mandating urgent source control via surgical debridement [^115He6aW].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Increases risk and severity of NSTI, making early surgical management critical [^notfound].

- **Guideline support**: IDSA and WSES/SIS-E recommend prompt surgical consultation and early debridement for suspected NSTI or gas gangrene [^115He6aW] [^112aMeRh].

---

## Risks of delaying surgical intervention

Delaying surgery increases **mortality**, with NSTI mortality ranging from 20% to over 30% and rising with delays [^113GSnmq]. It also worsens outcomes, including higher risks of limb loss, prolonged ICU stay, and multiorgan failure [^notfound].

---

## Inappropriateness of alternative options

- **High-dose IV steroids**: Contraindicated in sepsis; may worsen immunosuppression and infection control [^notfound].

- **Image-guided needle aspiration**: Inadequate for NSTI; does not provide definitive source control and may delay necessary surgery [^notfound].

- **No further management**: Not indicated; NSTI requires aggressive surgical and antimicrobial therapy [^113GSnmq].

---

## Recommended management plan

Immediate actions include **urgent surgical consultation** for debridement [^115He6aW] and continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with MRSA, gram-negative, and anaerobic coverage [^1161PQHd]. Provide aggressive supportive care with fluids, vasopressors, and ICU monitoring as needed [^116G9k4e]. Plan serial debridements every 12–24 hours until necrosis is resolved [^114qiECt].

---

Surgical debridement is the **most appropriate next step** because it provides definitive source control in NSTI, which cannot be achieved with antibiotics alone [^113GSnmq]. Early surgery is critical to reduce mortality and morbidity [^112aMeRh].

Case presentation

A 52-year-old Chinese woman was brought to the emergency room due to the history of worsening thirst, polydipsia, nausea and fatigue for 10 days and loss of consciousness after vomiting for half a day. When she was 40 years old, she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but she hesitated to receive any medical treatment.

On admission, she developed septic shock. Her temperature was 36.3 °C and blood pressure was 105/62 mmHg which was maintained with norepinephrine. She has tachypnea with respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min and rapid heart rate of 135 beats/min. The laboratory results showed a leukocytosis of 14.2 × 10⁹ per L with 95.8% neutrophils. Her procalcitonin concentration was severely increased at 170 ng/mL, and her blood lactate level was 4.8 mmol/L. She had abnormal renal function markers, including serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels of 3.0 mg/dL and 17.7 mmol/L, respectively. She had hyperglycemia with a blood glucose concentration of 27.8 mmol/L. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. And she was treated with intravenous fluid, received norepinephrine, bowel rest, intravenous injection of small doses of insulin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, septic shock was not improved and primary lesions leading to septic shock was unknown. Therefore, perform an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm the diagnosis.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^112JmoCK]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSTI can rapidly progress to a life-threatening septic process, unless its evolution is curtailed by aggressive surgical debridement. Key to this is prompt diagnosis which can be straightforward in typical cases where patients present with classical features, but mimics and occult disease can confuse diagnostic accuracy. Several scoring systems which can be practicably applied in the ED, have been proposed, based on laboratory indices and cross-sectional imaging, but no test is infallible. Clinicians need to exercise a high threshold for considering the diagnosis of NSTI, use scoring systems judiciously, but fundamentally, surgical exploration remains the diagnostic gold standard.

### Cervical necrotizing fasciitis, diagnosis and treatment of a rare life-threatening infection [^11613UGV]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance

Necrotizing fasciitis is a relatively uncommon and potentially life-threatening soft tissue infection, with morbidity and mortality approaching 25% to 35%, even with optimal treatment. The challenge of diagnosis for necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) is their rarity, with the incidence of approximately 1000 cases annually in the United States. Given the rapid progression of disease and its similar presentation to more benign processes, early and definitive diagnosis is imperative.

Findings

Signs and symptoms of NSTIs in the early stages are virtually indistinguishable from those seen with abscesses and cellulitis, making definitive diagnosis difficult. The clinical presentation will depend on the pathogen and its virulence factors which ultimately determine the area and depth of invasion into tissue. There are multiple laboratory value scoring systems that have been developed to support the diagnosis of an NSTI. The scoring system with the highest positive (92%) and negative (96%) predictive value is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC). The score is determined by 6 serologic markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), total white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine, and glucose. A score ≥ 6 is a relatively specific indicator of necrotizing fasciitis (specificity 83.8%), but a score < 6 is not sensitive (59.2%) enough to rule out necrotizing fasciitis. In terms of imaging, computed tomography (CT) imaging, while more sensitive (80%) than plain radiography in detecting abnormalities, is just as nonspecific. Computed tomography imaging of NSTIs demonstrates fascial thickening (with potential fat stranding), edema, subcutaneous gas, and abscess formation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 86%, though MRI may not show early cases of fascial involvement of necrotizing fasciitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Necrotizing soft tissue infections are rapidly progressive and potentially fatal infections that require a high index of clinical suspicion to promptly diagnose and aggressive surgical debridement of affected tissue in order to ensure optimal outcomes. Prompt surgical and infectious disease consultation is necessary for the treatment and management of these patients. While imaging is useful for further characterization, it should not delay surgical consultation. Necrotizing soft tissue infection remains a clinical diagnosis, although plain radiography, CT imaging, and ultrasound can provide useful clues. In general, the management of these patients should include rapid diagnosis, using a combination of clinical suspicion, laboratory data (LRINEC score), and imaging (MRI being the recommended imaging modality), prompt infectious disease and surgical consultation, surgical debridement, and delayed reconstruction. Laboratory findings that can more strongly suggest a diagnosis of NSTI include elevated CRP, elevated WBC, low hemoglobin, decreased sodium, and increased creatinine. Imaging findings include fascial thickening (with potential fat stranding), edema, subcutaneous gas, and abscess formation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started in all cases of suspected NSTI. Surgical debridement, however, remains the lynchpin for treatment of cervical necrotizing fasciitis.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: technical report [^112Au7pu]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — diagnostic cues and imaging role: Necrotizing fasciitis has a high rate of mortality, making early diagnosis critical, yet diagnosis is challenging with no specific criteria and requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. Suggestive findings include severe pain disproportionate to clinical findings, failure to respond to initial antibiotics, a hard wooden feel of subcutaneous tissue, systemic toxicity, and crepitus. Sensitivity and specificity of imaging is ill-defined and findings are not reliably present. The Infectious Diseases Society of North America notes that CT and MRI can demonstrate findings but may delay definitive diagnosis and treatment. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria rate initial evaluation with radiography as "usually appropriate", and radiographs may demonstrate soft tissue gas. CT with or without contrast can detect soft tissue gas with high sensitivity and may be appropriate given test speed and can show fascial thickening, deep fascial fluid collections, and intermuscular septal edema, while MRI with or without contrast can detect these findings but is less sensitive than CT for soft tissue gas.

Bacteremia management — Early source control and imaging are emphasized, and intravenous (IV) to oral transition is allowed with defined duration. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed; repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection; antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate when bacteremia cleared promptly and there is no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess, and Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the article is to present recent epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical data for the surgical, antimicrobial, and adjunctive management of necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTI).

Recent Findings

NSTI can be caused by a broad variety of organisms. Reports about NSTI caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria are increasing. Owing to the rareness of NSTI, general clinical awareness is low and prompt diagnosis is often delayed. New diagnostic instruments (scoring systems, MRI) have either a low accuracy or are time consuming and cannot guide clinicians reliable currently. The value of adjunctive measures (intravenous immunoglobulin, hyperbaric oxygen therapy) is uncertain as well. Morbidity and mortality in NSTI remain high, ranging from 20 up to over 30%.

Summary

Early radical surgical debridement and empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment remain the cornerstones of therapy in NSTI. Further clinical research is necessary to shorten diagnostic pathways and to optimize surgical, antimicrobial, and adjunctive treatment.

### Management of sepsis: a 47-year-old woman with an indwelling intravenous catheter and sepsis [^116vDzNq]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Severe sepsis is the term used to describe the host response to infection when complicated by acute organ dysfunction. Severe sepsis occurs in more than 750,000 individuals in the United States each year, with a hospital mortality of about 30%. Although the classic presentation is of florid shock with frank hypotension, fever, and elevated white blood cell count, many patients can present with cryptogenic shock (shock without hypotension) with more subtle signs of vital organ compromise. Using the case of Ms C, a 47-year-old woman with short gut syndrome and an indwelling intravenous catheter who developed an episode of severe sepsis secondary to a central line infection, treatment of sepsis is discussed. Management consists of prompt intervention with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, even in the absence of hypotension, and institution of a variety of strategies in the emergency setting to prevent development or worsening of vital organ dysfunction. Although advances in understanding the host immune response have fueled considerable interest in immunomodulatory therapy, the role of such agents in clinical practice remains limited and controversial.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" persist and can be useful in describing SSTIs as reported by Napolitano.

Uncomplicated SSTIs carry low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are improperly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to the most probable pathogen and local resistance patterns in impetigo, erysipelas, or mild cellulitis with drainage and debridement or simple surgical drainage in skin abscess.

Complicated SSTIs are associated with high risk for life-threatening infection. In patients who have complicated SSTIs, it is of paramount importance to initiate appropriate and adequate broad-spectrum initial empiric antibiotic therapy and to consider the need for surgical intervention for drainage and/or debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided in four classes:
Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.
Class 2: patients are either systemically unwell with stable co-morbidities or are systemically well, but have a comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
Class 3: patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and/or hypotension).
Class 4: patients have sepsis syndrome and life-threatening infection; for example necrotizing fasciitis.

What are the resuscitation principles in patients with necrotizing infection?

Supportive treatment in managing necrotizing infections must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process (recommendation 1A).

Early detection of sepsis and prompt aggressive treatment of the underlying organ dysfunction is an essential component for improving outcomes of critical ill patients. Necrotizing infections may present with a fulminant course and may be associated with great morbidity and high case-fatality rates, especially when they occur in conjunction with TSS.

Early blood cultures, empirical antibiotic treatment, and intensive care for hemodynamic and metabolic support should be performed as soon as possible. Moreover, patients may lose fluids, proteins, and electrolytes through a large surgical wound. In addition, hypotension is caused by vasodilation induced by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to infection. Fluid resuscitation and analgesia are the mainstays of support for patients with advanced sepsis usually combined with vasoactive amines associated with mechanical ventilation and other organ function supports, if needed. No ideal fluid exists: resuscitation therapy must be prompt and immediate as in any type of shock.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1125yTLj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In stable patients with suspected Fournier's gangrene, we suggest to consider performing a CT scan (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we recommend that imaging should not delay surgical intervention (strong recommendation based on moderate quality evidence, 1B).

In patients with Fournier's gangrene and hemodynamic instability persisting after proper resuscitation, we suggest against CT imaging (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene is mainly clinical. Plain radiographs, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate gas in the soft tissue planes as well as help determine the extent of the disease. Evidence of gas formation is present in nearly half of all patients with FG and is highly specific (94%). Ultrasonographic findings typically include marked thickening of the scrotal skin, soft tissue inflammation, collections/abscesses, and subcutaneous gas. In addition, US can demonstrate paratesticular fluid, which is seen prior to clinical crepitus, and scrotal contents along with Doppler blood flow can be examined. As imaging evaluation in patients with FG may be limited by several factors, including the presence of concurrent acute renal failure or patient hemodynamic instability, making transport to the imaging department unsafe, bedside and point-of-care ultrasound have emerged as useful tools for FG diagnosis. US has multiple advantages: it can be promptly performed at the patient's bedside, can evaluate the scrotal contents, and does not require radiation or intravenous contrast. For these reasons, US can be suggested in cases where a CT scan is not available or not feasible. Otherwise, a contrast-enhanced CT-scan plays an important role in diagnosing and planning the treatment of Fournier's gangrene, because it has greater specificity for evaluating disease extent than plain radiography, US, or physical examination alone and may also identify a potential underlying cause. CT has a sensitivity approaching 90% for the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections, in addition to high specificity (93.3%). MRI with gadolinium contrast is an excellent soft tissue imaging modality, but is of limited value in an emergency setting due to its extended time of examination and limited access to emergency MRI scanning in many centers. Furthermore, given the utmost importance of a timely surgical treatment, imaging is not mandatory in treating emergent cases of Fournier's gangrene with clinical or hemodynamical impairment and we suggest not delaying surgical treatment in these patients to obtain any form of imaging.
2.C - in patients with Fournier's gangrene, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

### Fever and the rational use of antimicrobials in the emergency department [^114d2K7Z]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Any patient presenting to the emergency department (ED) with fever triggers consideration of the administration of an antimicrobial. Empiric antimicrobial therapy has become a cornerstone of treatment. Frequently, the decision to initiate empiric treatment needs to be made before the definitive diagnosis is known. In such cases, an organized approach is helpful. This article aims to provide a systems-based approach to prescribing antimicrobials to patients presenting to the ED with fever, while understanding the risk associated with overutilization. An understanding of the key considerations is needed to ensure that decisions are made well and appropriate treatment begins promptly.

Despite advances in antibiotic and surgical management and supportive care for necrotizing soft tissue infections, morbidity and mortality remain substantial. Although there are clinical practice guidelines in place, there still remains much variability in choice and duration of antibiotic therapy, time to initial surgical debridement, and use of adjuvant medical therapies. This article offers an overview of necrotizing soft tissue infections with a focus on current diagnostic and treatment modalities.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^112GCf3M]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging is another diagnostic modality to consider. Plain films have been demonstrated to be of low sensitivity and specificity and should not be used in the diagnosis of NSTI but may be useful in certain patient groups such as intravenous drug users to identify foreign bodies. Cross-sectional imaging appears to have some promise. CT seems to be the most clinically available, with images that are rapidly acquired and interpretable by surgeons. The first reported series of 67 patients with NSTI who underwent CT scanning as part of their management concluded that CT was 100% sensitive and 81% specific. Those investigators concluded that CT could reliably exclude NSTI. The features specifically assessed were soft tissue asymmetry, muscle necrosis, gas and fluid collections.

The findings of this study were confirmed and extended by a group which examined a series of 305 patients undergoing CT imaging for NSTI assessment. Using these data, the authors synthesized a weighted scoring system based on the presence of fascial air, muscle/fascial edema, fluid tracking, lymphadenopathy and subcutaneous edema. A value greater than six or greater had a sensitivity of 86.3%, a specificity of 91.5% with an AUC of 0.928.

Although the presented evidence is compelling, most studies are collected retrospectively and the few studies with a control group generally rely on patients with non-NSTI, which can introduce significant heterogeneity. To address this issue, a large prospective observational study is currently underway in Northern Europe called the Immune Failure in Critical Therapy study. This project aims to recruit 400–500 patients collecting data on several diagnostic, treatment and outcome variables.

NSTI can be reliably diagnosed in the ED (abridged summary)

Dr Kimberly Davis MD, MBA, Professor of Surgery, Yale School of Medicine

NSTIs represent an infrequently encountered, but rapidly progressive soft tissue infection, which requires prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical debridement. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, as delays in treatment are associated with greater morbidity. Although clinical signs can be varied, several clinical tests have been used to generate predictive tools for NSTI.

Wong and colleagues have proposed the 'laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis' (LRINEC) score. This involves the assessment of C-reactive protein (CRP), white cell count (WCC), hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine and glucose and the assignment of a score, depending on the level of the variable. A score of > 6 is highly suggestive of an NSTI.

The strength of this score appears to be in identifying patients where there is a very high or low suspicion of NSTI. Although this has some obvious practical significance, it leaves a middle group of patients where the diagnosis remains uncertain. This is where imaging can play a significant role.

Radiology has traditionally had a limited role to play in NSTI diagnosis, but the advent of widely accessible cross-sectional imaging has changed this paradigm. Although MRI offers high-resolution soft tissue imaging, CT is timely, widely available and amenable to rapid interpretation by non-radiologists, until formal reporting.

A CT scoring system has been described for use in patients with equivocal physical and laboratory findings based on the presence of fascial air, edema, fluid tracking and lymphadenopathy. A score greater than 6, generated a high sensitivity and specificity for NSTI.

In summary, diagnosis of NSTI requires a high index of suspicion and early surgical exploration is required; however, in equivocal cases, laboratory and imaging scoring systems can be used in the ED to assess the likelihood of the need for debridement.

### Necrotizing fasciitis: strategies for diagnosis and management [^114Fjoqz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotising fasciitis (NF) is a rare soft tissue infection, primarily involving the superficial fascia and resulting in extensive undermining of the surrounding tissues. If untreated, it is invariably fatal, and thus a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis is required. Mortality remains still high in NF despite use of modern powerful antimicrobial drug regimens and advances in the care of the critically ill patients. Overall mortality ranges from 25 percent to 73 percent in the published literature. The disease's manifestation can range from a fulminant presentation to a subtle and insidious development.

Fournier gangrene — this variant of necrotizing soft tissue infection involves the scrotum and penis or vulva; the average age at onset is 50–60 years, and eighty percent of patients have significant underlying diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus; early features include fever, pain, erythema, and swelling of the genitalia, with progression to cutaneous necrosis and crepitus indicating gas in soft tissue; disease is usually limited to skin and subcutaneous tissue with testes, glans penis, and spermatic cord typically spared, may extend to the perineum and anterior abdominal wall, and most cases are caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora, with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species sometimes present and S. aureus known to cause this infection as the sole pathogen; management requires prompt, aggressive surgical debridement to remove all necrotic tissue while sparing deeper structures when possible.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^116Udhq5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are associated with a high mortality and require prompt recognition and treatment, consisting of aggressive surgical debridement and critical care support. Diagnosis is a key step, which is generally made in the operating room (OR), but the decision to debride requires guidance. This is frequently made on clinical grounds, but NSTI can be occult in presentation and several other infective processes can mimic NSTI. It is unknown whether the various scoring systems described in the literature can enable clinicians to reliably diagnose NSTI in the emergency department, rather than the OR. The topic was debated at the 36thAnnual Point/Counterpoint Acute Care Surgery Conference and the following article summarizes the discussants points of view along with a summary of the evidence.

Necrotizing fasciitis — definition, clinical features, and bacteriology are detailed. Necrotizing fasciitis is "an aggressive subcutaneous infection that tracks along the superficial fascia", and "it is the superficial fascia that is most commonly involved". The initial presentation "is that of cellulitis", progressing with "systemic toxicity, often including high temperatures, disorientation, and lethargy", and a distinguishing feature is "the wooden-hard induration of the subcutaneous tissues". In the monomicrobial form, pathogens "are S. pyogenes, S. aureus, V. vulnificus, A. hydrophila, and anaerobic streptococci (Peptostreptococcus)", with most infections "community acquired and present in the limbs, with approximately two-thirds in the lower extremities". Cases after varicella or trivial injuries are "usually due to S. pyogenes", and in group A streptococcal disease with hypotension and organ failure, mortality is "ranging from 30% to 70%". Among S. pyogenes cases, "Nearly 50%" have "no portal of entry" and instead develop deep infection at a site of nonpenetrating trauma. Polymicrobial infection is "most commonly associated with 4 clinical settings" including perianal/abdominal sources, decubitus ulcers, injection sites in illicit drug users, and spread from genital sites.

### Aggressive soft tissue infections [^113Ccwh5]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) are characterized by rapidly progressive infection that causes tissue necrosis with associated sepsis and multisystem organ failure. A rapid diagnosis is essential to decreasing the morbidity and mortality of NSTIs. There must be a high index of suspicion based on history and physical examination. There are no adjunct laboratory values or imaging that have high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of NSTI. The treatment involves emergent, radical surgical debridement of involved tissues and broad spectrum antibiotics. Follow-up should include close monitoring of the wound and repeat debridements in the operating room.

NSTI type II is a mono-microbial infection. Among Gram-positive organisms, GAS remains the most common pathogen, followed by MRSA. Unlike type I infections, type II infections may occur in any age group and in persons without any underlying illness. Other pathogens include Aeromonas hydrophila and V. vulnificus. Mono-microbial necrotizing fasciitis due to Gram-negative pathogens (bacteroides and E. coli) have also been reported, though these infections are typically seen in immunocompromised, diabetic, obese, and postoperative patients.

Gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), or type III NSTI, is an acute infection by clostridium or bacillus of healthy living tissue that occurs spontaneously or as a result of traumatic injury. Recurrent gas gangrene, occurring several decades after the primary infection, has also been described.

The use of antimicrobial therapy is an adjuvant treatment and must be combined with early surgical debridement. Once the diagnosis is made and blood cultures have been drawn, broad-spectrum coverage should be urgently commenced. Initial antibiotic therapy for necrotizing infections is empirical in nature because microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) may require > 24 h before they are available for a more detailed analysis.

Since it is impossible to exclude with certainty a polymicrobial necrotizing infection, an aggressive broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should initially be selected to cover Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms until culture-specific results and sensitivities are available. An acceptable empiric antibiotic regimen should always include antibiotics, which cover MRSA with the additional benefit of inhibiting invasive GAS virulence proteins. For the treatment of MRSA, we refer to the previous paragraphs.

For the treatment of Gram-negative bacteria, the use of piperacillin-tazobactam in the setting without high local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae optimizing pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic parameters is appropriate. Carbapenems, administered in adequate dosage, including meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or doripenem may be used in the settings with high local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae. Culture-specific results and sensitivities can direct both broadening of antimicrobial regimen if it is too narrow and a de-escalation if it is too broad particularly in critically ill patients where de-escalation strategy is one of the cornerstones of antimicrobial stewardship programs. The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and MDRO non-fermenters.

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment of MRSA infections in… [^1131cRoq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Skin and Soft-Tissue Infections in Community-Associated MRSA Simple abscesses or boils may be managed with incision and drainage alone; more data are needed on the use of antibiotics in this setting. Antibiotics are recommended for patients who have abscesses associated with severe or extensive disease or rapid progression in the presence of associated cellulitis; signs and symptoms of systemic illness; associated comorbidities or immunosuppression; very young or very old age; abscesses in areas difficult to drain; associated septic phlebitis; or lack of response to incision and drainage alone. Empiric therapy for five to 10 days is recommended pending culture results for outpatients with purulent cellulitis. Infection from β-hemolytic streptococci does not usually require empiric therapy.

For those with nonpurulent cellulitis, five to 10 days of empiric therapy for β-hemolytic streptococcal infection is recommended, based on the patient's clinical response. Empiric coverage for community-associated MRSA is recommended in patients who do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics, and also may be considered in those with systemic toxicity. MRSA Bacteremia and Infective Endocarditis BACTEREMIA AND INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS, NATIVE VALVE. A clinical assessment to identify the source and extent of the infection with elimination and/or debridement of other sites of infection is recommended. Additional blood cultures two to four days after initial positive cultures and as needed thereafter are recommended to document clearance of bacteremia. Echocardiography is recommended for all adults with bacteremia.

Clindamycin and linezolid should not be used if there is concern of infective endocarditis or an endovascular source of infection, although they may be considered in children with bacteremia that rapidly clears and is not related to an endovascular focus. Data are insufficient to support the routine use of combination therapy with rifampin or gentamicin in children with bacteremia or infective endocarditis. The decision to use combination therapy should be individualized. Echocardiography is recommended in children with congenital heart disease, bacteremia lasting more than two to three days, or other clinical findings suggestive of endocarditis. In patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be used with drainage procedures.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis missed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging [^1125exHX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare but deadly disease. Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections can be challenging for a variety of reasons. Point-of-care (POC) ultrasound (US) has been described as a diagnostic tool to help the acute care clinician make the early diagnosis that is imperative to optimize outcomes.

Objective

To report a case of Group A Streptococcus NF recognized with POC US, and subsequent negative findings on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Case Report

A 54-year-old diabetic woman presented to the Emergency Department with atraumatic right foot and lower leg pain associated with fever. Examination was concerning for NF, and a POC US was performed, which showed thickened deep fascia and fluid tracking along the deep fascial plane, with fluid pockets measuring 6 mm in depth, consistent with NF. Surgical consultation was obtained. Per request, CT and MRI of the patient's lower extremity were performed; both were interpreted by the radiologist as showing changes consistent with cellulitis. Septic shock and multisystem organ failure ensued; the patient was eventually taken to the operating room, where operative findings were consistent with NF. Operative cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes.

Conclusion

NF is a surgical emergency. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to ensure the necessary aggressive management needed to optimize outcomes. This case illustrates the utility of POC US to make the prompt diagnosis of NF, particularly in light of subsequently negative CT and MRI.

### Fournier gangrene: a review for emergency clinicians [^111qzsFy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fournier gangrene (FG) is a rare, life-threatening infection that can result in significant morbidity and mortality, with many patients requiring emergency department (ED) management for complications and stabilization.

Objective

This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the current data for the emergency medicine evaluation and management of FG.

Discussion

Although originally thought to be an idiopathic process, FG has been shown to have a strong association for male patients with advanced age and comorbidities affecting microvascular circulation and immune system function, most commonly those with diabetes or alcohol use disorder. However, it can also affect patients without risk factors. The initial infectious nidus is usually located in the genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, or perineum. FG is a mixed infection of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora. The development and progression of gangrene is often fulminant and can rapidly cause multiple organ failure and death, although patients may present subacutely with findings similar to cellulitis. Laboratory studies, as well as imaging including point-of-care ultrasound, conventional radiography, and computed tomography are important diagnostic adjuncts, though negative results cannot exclude diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive medications.

Conclusions

FG requires a high clinical level of suspicion, combined with knowledge of anatomy, risk factors, and etiology for an accurate diagnosis. Although FG remains a clinical diagnosis, relevant laboratory and radiography investigations can serve as useful adjuncts to expedite surgical management, hemodynamic resuscitation, and antibiotic administration.

What is the best timing of re-exploration?

Consider to plan the first re-exploration within 12–24 h and to repeat re-exploration(s) until the patient is free of necrosis (recommendation 1C).

There is a lack of literature examining outcomes in necrotizing infections when surgical re-debridements are performed in early versus delayed intervals. Scheduled re-explorations should be done at least every 12–24 h after the initial operation or sooner if clinical local or systemic signs of worsening infection become evident, as well as with worsening laboratory parameters (particularly WBC count). Re-explorations should be repeated until the time when very little or no debridement is required.

A prospective observational study by Okoye et al. showed that delayed re-debridement after initial source control in necrotizing infections results in worse survival and an increased incidence of acute kidney injury. The authors concluded that further studies to identify the optimal time interval for re-debridement are warranted.

Necrotizing fasciitis, including Fournier gangrene — evaluation and treatment — should prioritize urgent surgery and broad empiric antibiotics: prompt surgical consultation is recommended for patients with aggressive infections associated with signs of systemic toxicity or suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene (strong, low); empiric antibiotic treatment should be broad (eg, vancomycin or linezolid plus piperacillin-tazobactam or plus a carbapenem, or plus ceftriaxone and metronidazole) because the etiology can be polymicrobial or monomicrobial (group A Streptococcus, community-acquired MRSA) (strong, low); and penicillin plus clindamycin is recommended for documented group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis (strong, low). Necrotizing SSTIs differ from the milder, superficial infections and these deep infections involve the fascial and/or muscle compartments and are potentially devastating due to major tissue destruction and death.

Abstract

Necrotizing soft tissue infections are rare bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues with a high morbidity and mortality rate, requiring prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. These represent a spectrum of disease resulting in tissue necrosis that is rapidly progressive; however, they remain a diagnostic challenge because the average surgeon or emergency medicine provider may only see one or two over the course of their career. Diagnosis is largely clinical and based on subtle physical examination findings, physiologic instability, and laboratory derangements. Aids to diagnosis such as scoring systems and cross-sectional imaging may be used; however, the findings are not specific, so management should not be based on these alone. The most common cause of necrotizing soft tissue infection is polymicrobial infection; however, specific bacteria such as clostridial species, group A streptococcal, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and aquatic bacteria may also be causative. Initial management includes broad spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation for severe sepsis, and early aggressive surgical debridement. Often, these patients require multiple operative debridement to achieve source control, and a low threshold for repeat debridement should be maintained because these infections can progress rapidly. Once source control is achieved, patients may be left with extensive wounds requiring multidisciplinary care and wound management. Necrotizing infections have long been viewed based on mortality outcomes alone because of their rarity and severity. Over recent years, more reports have shown a decrease in the mortality rates from those previously reported, allowing for a focus on methods to improve morbidity of these infections.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of infected fluid collections [^116bm7mh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infected fluid collections are common and occur in a variety of clinical scenarios throughout the body. Minimally invasive image-guided management strategies for infected fluid collections are often preferred over more invasive options, given their low rate of complications and high rates of success. However, specific clinical scenarios, anatomic considerations, and prior or ongoing treatments must be considered when determining the optimal management strategy. As such, several common scenarios relating to infected fluid collections were developed using evidence-based guidelines for management. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Simple abscesses

7) Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed (Recommendation 1 C).

Complex abscesses

8) Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete or for the abscesses with significant cellulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

9) Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA (Recommendation 1 C).

10) Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure (Recommendation 1 C).

Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections

11) A rapidly progressive soft tissue infection should be always treated aggressively as a necrotizing soft tissue infection (Recommendation 1 C)

12) Both CT and MRI may be useful for diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. However MRI may be difficult to perform under emergency situations. (Recommendation 2 C).

13) In unstable patients, ultrasound may be useful to differentiate simple cellulitis from necrotizing fasciitis (Recommendation 2 C).

Management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

14) Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock caused by NSTI require early source control, antimicrobial therapy, and supportive treatment (Recommendation 1 C).

Source control in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

15) Surgical source control must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process caused by NSTI (Recommendation 1 C).

Hyperbaric oxygen in patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections

16) Although the benefit of adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy remains controversial, it may be considered where it is available (Recommendation 2 C).

Skin and soft tissue infections are among the most common reasons for people to seek medical advice. They also represent one of the most common indications for antimicrobial therapy and account for approximately 7–10% of hospitalisations in North America. Although non-limb and non-life threatening infections may be treated on an out-patient basis with oral antibiotics, patients with more serious acute skin and soft tissue infections may require admission to hospital for management; this decision is especially true if the infection is rapidly progressive. We provide a concise overview of the differential diagnosis and approach to management of community-acquired rapidly progressive skin and soft tissue infections.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is uncommon and difficult to diagnose, and it cause progressive morbidity until the infectious process is diagnosed and treated medically and surgically. The literature addressed NF contains confusing information, inaccurate bacteriologic data, and antiquated antibiotic therapy. A delay in diagnosis is associated with a grave prognosis and increased mortality. The main goal of the clinician must be to establish the diagnosis and initially treat the patient within the standard of care. This review is planned as a guide for the clinician in making an early diagnosis of NF and initiating effective medical and surgical therapy.

CT scan and ultrasound studies are also useful (strong, moderate). 31. Cultures of blood and abscess material should be obtained (strong, moderate). 32. Vancomycin is recommended for initial empirical therapy. An agent active against enteric gram-negative bacilli should be added for infection in immunocompromised patients or following open trauma to the muscles (strong, moderate). 33. Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillin (eg, nafcillin or oxacillin) is recommended for treatment of pyomyositis caused by MSSA (strong, moderate). 34. Early drainage of purulent material should be performed (strong, high). 35. Repeat imaging studies should be performed in the patient with persistent bacteremia to identify undrained foci of infection (strong, low). 36. Antibiotics should be administered intravenously initially, but once the patient is clinically improved, oral antibiotics are appropriate for patients whose bacteremia cleared promptly and those with no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic abscess. Two to 3 weeks of therapy is recommended (strong, low).

Importance

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are severe life- and limb-threatening infections with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, there has been minimal improvement in outcomes over time.

Observations

NSTIs are characterized by their heterogeneity in microbiology, risk factors, and anatomical involvement. They often present with nonspecific symptoms, leading to a high rate of delayed diagnosis. Laboratory values and imaging help increase suspicion for NSTI, though ultimately, the diagnosis is clinical. Surgical exploration is warranted when there is high suspicion for NSTI, even if the diagnosis is uncertain. Thus, it is acceptable to have a certain rate of negative exploration. Immediate empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, further tailored based on tissue culture results, are essential and should be continued at least until surgical debridement is complete and the patient shows signs of clinical improvement. Additional research is needed to determine optimal antibiotic duration. Early surgical debridement is crucial for improved outcomes and should be performed as soon as possible, ideally within 6 hours of presentation. Subsequent debridements should be performed every 12 to 24 hours until the patient is showing signs of clinical improvement and there is no additional necrotic tissue within the wound. There are insufficient data to support the routine use of adjunct treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin. However, clinicians should be aware of multiple ongoing efforts to develop more robust diagnostic and treatment strategies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Given the poor outcomes associated with NSTIs, a review of clinically relevant evidence and guidelines is warranted. This review discusses diagnostic and treatment approaches to NSTI while highlighting future directions and promising developments in NSTI management.

Mediastinal extension

Severe infections can spread to the mediastinum, either posteriorly from the retropharyngeal space, or anteriorly through visceral and anterior cervical spaces. Subtle reactive edema (ME) should not be mistaken for treatable mediastinal disease. Accurate delineation of mediastinal abscesses is important (Fig. 28). Although small mediastinal abscesses may be treated conservatively, especially wide-spread abscesses may require surgery after a clinical multidisciplinary evaluation. Extending the imaging field of view from the neck to the mediastinum is straightforward with contrast-enhanced CT but requires more time and effort with MRI because sequences may need to be specifically tailored for the mediastinum. This requires more scanning time and radiologist supervision. In the chest area, susceptibility effects caused by interfaces between soft tissues and air cause artifacts that may degrade diagnostic performance.

Necrotizing fasciitis

Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck is a rapidly progressing and life-threatening infection caused by bacteria. The infected tissue becomes necrotic as a process involving vasculitis with microthrombosis and edema of the subcutaneous tissues progresses, leading to severe systemic toxicity in the later stages. Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck is a rare condition, given that the incidence of 2 per 1,000,000 inhabitants per year has been reported in Denmark. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis usually present with pain, swelling, crepitation, and erythema; typically, the pain is out of proportion to the swelling or erythema. Comorbidities include diabetes and liver cirrhosis. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are key determinants of prognosis. In an uncertain case, early surgical exploration may be the best approach.

Generally, findings of necrotizing versus non-necrotizing fasciitis may overlap. On MRI, necrotizing fasciitis in the neck is suggested by widespread edema, fluid collections along the fascial planes, and gas formation (Fig. 29).

### Therapies for necrotising fasciitis [^115jhMJp]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Necrotising fasciitis is a rare but life-threatening infectious disease emergency. Delays in diagnosis and treatment are common, and mortality rates often exceed 30%. Successful management of this disease requires high clinical suspicion and aggressive action. The mainstays of therapy include early and wide surgical debridement, antibiotics and supportive care, with prompt surgical intervention. Adjunctive modalities, such as protein synthesis inhibitors, hyperbaric oxygen and intravenous immunoglobulin, may have a role, but their effectiveness remains unproven. New rapid diagnostic tools are emerging that promise to revolutionize early detection of necrotising fasciitis. Research into the molecular microbiology, especially regarding group A streptococcus, are providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of necrotising soft tissue infections and identifying future targets for rationally designed interventions.

### Necrotizing soft tissue infections in the intensive care unit [^112WnwWn]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a severe illness that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is often caused by a wide spectrum of pathogens and is most frequently polymicrobial. Care for patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection requires a team approach with expertise from critical care, surgery, reconstructive surgery, and rehabilitation specialists. The early diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection is challenging, but the keys to successful management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection are early recognition and complete surgical debridement. Early initiation of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy must take into consideration the potential pathogens. Critical care management components such as the initial fluid resuscitation, end-organ support, pain management, nutrition support, and wound care are all important aspects of the care of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection. Soft tissue reconstruction should take into account both functional and cosmetic outcome.

Neutropenic fever skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — episode classification and empiric spectrum are described as follows: An "initial" episode refers to the first episode of neutropenic fever requiring systemic antimicrobial therapy, whereas a "persisting episode" is "persistent neutropenic fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy beyond days 4–7", and episodes may also be recurrent. During the initial episode, "gram-negative bacteria should be primarily targeted by the initial antibiotic regimen because they are associated with high mortality rates", and although gram-positive bacteria are more common, "the addition of antibiotics with gram- positive activity including MRSA is not recommended unless physical findings suggestive of inflammation in the skin and soft tissues are present, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, and risk factors for MRSA are present". For persistent or recurrent episodes, "antibiotic-resistant bacterial or fungal pathogens (including Candida) may be encountered".

Case presentation

A 53-year-old female with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with weekly methotrexate, type 2 diabetes mellitus, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and two previously documented COVID-19 infections (most recently documented 6 months prior) presented to the emergency department with one week of dyspnea and malaise after a trip to the Gulf Shores. She had a COVID-19 exposure and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 in the outpatient setting three days prior to admission. In the emergency department her initial vital signs demonstrated an oxygen saturation of 72% on room air, a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 76/50 mmHg, and a temperature of 98.2 F. Her initial laboratory evaluation was notable for a white blood cell count of 13.7 × 10³/µL, serum creatinine of 2.3 m/dL, procalcitonin of 6.4 ng/mL and a lactic acid level of 8.8 mmol/L. Legionella urine antigen was not tested. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse bilateral consolidations concerning for multifocal pneumonia. She was resuscitated with IV fluids and a norepinephrine infusion was started for persistent hypotension and shock. She received supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather face mask and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) were initiated. Due to the severity of her critical illness, she was transferred by helicopter to a tertiary care center for further management.
