## Question

In the NOVA study on influenza, did remidavir achieve its primary endpoints?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether in the NOVA study on influenza, remidavir achieved its primary endpoints. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any "NOVA" trial is present in the provided materials. Then, I should verify whether remdesivir has any influenza trials in this corpus. Next, I will check if "remidavir" is a typo for remdesivir or a different antiviral. After that, I should review what influenza antivirals are actually represented here. Finally, I will conclude whether the primary endpoint question can be answered from these sources and note any gaps that require clarification [^115bxuXM] [^111zeshK] [^114EbBsy] [^113qtgQS] [^116qMnmY] [^114ubm9y].

> Let me first confirm the existence of a "NOVA" study in the provided documents; wait, let me verify that carefully because misnaming is common in trial queries, and I do not want to miss a synonym or sub-study designation. I have no hits for any study explicitly titled or nicknamed "NOVA" across the remdesivir trials summarized here, which instead include ACTT-1, Solidarity, DisCoVeRy, REDPINE, and PLATCOV, all evaluating remdesivir for COVID-19 rather than influenza [^115bxuXM] [^111zeshK] [^114EbBsy] [^113qtgQS] [^113YH1Yt] [^115W1TR5].

> Next, I should review whether remdesivir is studied for influenza anywhere in this collection; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before surveying the influenza-focused content. Scanning the influenza trials and guidance here, I see neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir), the cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir, and other agents like pimodivir, but no influenza trials of remdesivir are provided, whereas every remdesivir entry pertains to COVID-19 indications or trials [^116qMnmY] [^114ubm9y] [^1177DJoR] [^116JS8fx] [^112xWYg2] [^116nJGGh] [^115bxuXM] [^111zeshK].

> I need to check whether "remidavir" could be a different antiviral rather than a misspelling; hmm, wait a minute, pimodivir for influenza A is present here and could sound superficially similar, but it is a PB2 polymerase inhibitor unrelated to remdesivir, and its recent phase 3 results showed no added clinical benefit in hospitalized patients over standard care, making it distinct from remdesivir's COVID-19 program [^116nJGGh]. Let me reconsider: the most plausible interpretation is that "remidavir" refers to remdesivir, but again, all remdesivir data here are COVID-19 focused, not influenza [^115bxuXM] [^111zeshK] [^114EbBsy] [^113qtgQS] [^115W1TR5].

> I will now examine what influenza antivirals and endpoints are actually represented to ensure I am not overlooking a remdesivir-influenza link; hold on, I should verify across guidelines and labels. The IDSA and WHO influenza guidance, as well as FDA labels and systematic reviews here, consistently reference neuraminidase inhibitors and baloxavir for treatment or prophylaxis, without remdesivir, reinforcing that the influenza evidence base in this packet does not include remdesivir trials or a study named "NOVA" [^116qMnmY] [^112xWYg2] [^116JS8fx] [^114ubm9y] [^115Y1Y7R] [^115DFsF5].

> But wait, what if "NOVA" referred to a vaccine or coadministration program rather than an antiviral trial; I should double-check for any similarly named vaccine studies. The vaccine content present relates to ARCT-2303 coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine, which is unrelated to remdesivir or influenza antiviral efficacy endpoints, so this does not resolve the query about remdesivir in influenza either [^112LLePt].

> Given these checks, I need to ensure my conclusion is precise: the provided corpus contains no "NOVA" study of remdesivir for influenza and, in fact, includes only COVID-19 remdesivir trials, so I cannot determine whether such a study met its primary endpoints from these materials; if the user meant a different agent or an external study, I should confirm the correct drug and trial identifier to proceed accurately [^115bxuXM] [^111zeshK] [^114EbBsy] [^113qtgQS] [^115W1TR5].

I can't find a drug named "remidavir" or an influenza trial called "NOVA". Please confirm the exact drug name (did you mean **remdesivir** or another antiviral?) and provide the full study name or a registry ID (e.g. an NCT number) for "NOVA". If you meant remdesivir, the available evidence [^115bxuXM] and guidelines [^1174AFSe] pertain to **COVID-19, not influenza** [^111zeshK]. If you meant another influenza antiviral, I can verify whether it met its primary endpoint once you **specify the study**.

### Immunogenicity and safety of self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (ARCT-2303), with or without co-administration of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in adults: A phase 3, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, multicentre study [^112LLePt]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

The endpoints for the first co-primary immunogenicity objective, confirmation of the superiority of ARCT-2303 over ARCT-154, were the respective GMTs of neutralising antibodies against Omicron XBB.1.5.6; 718 (95% CI: 652–791) after ARCT-2303 compared with 263 (236–293) in the historical ARCT-154 cohort. The GMT ratio of 2.7 (95% CI: 2.3–3.2) met the prespecified criterion for superiority, with the lower limit of the 95% CI being greater than 1.0. The result of the sensitivity analysis, using the number of previous COVID-19 vaccine doses and the strain composition of the previous dose as stratification factors, was similar with a GMT ratio of 2.79 (95% CI: 2.37–3.29).

Further, the SCRs were 73.8% (349/473; 95% CI: 69.6–77.7) after ARCT-2303 and 45.5% (175/385; 40.4–50.6) after ARCT-154; a difference of 28.4% (21.8–34.9) with a lower 95% CI limit that was higher than the non-inferiority threshold of −5%, thereby also meeting the criterion for the second co-primary objective.

As the first two co-primary objectives were met, we assessed the immune responses against the four influenza strains in QIV between the co-administered group (1a) and the separately administered group (3a) in young adults. Fig. 2 shows that when QIV was administered concomitantly with the ARCT-2303 vaccine, the response was non-inferior to that observed when QIV was administered alone, with the lower limits of the 95% CIs of the GMT ratios for all four influenza strains higher than the inferiority threshold of 0.67.

### Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 [^117D5Uor]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine with properties to inhibit viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. Positive results from early studies attracted media attention and led to emergency use authorization of remdesivir in COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the evidence regarding the effects of remdesivir as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is required.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of remdesivir compared to placebo or standard care alone on clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 16 April 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included RCTs evaluating remdesivir for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized adults compared to placebo or standard care alone irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting. We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We followed standard Cochrane methodology for data collection and analysis in the included studies.

### Zanamivir for influenza in adults and children: systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^1112feMi]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe the potential benefits and harms of zanamivir through a systematic review of clinical study reports from randomized placebo-controlled trials and regulatory information.

Data sources included clinical study reports, trial registries, electronic databases, regulatory archives, and correspondence with manufacturers. The eligibility criteria for selecting studies comprised randomized placebo-controlled trials involving adults and children with confirmed or suspected exposure to natural influenza.

The main outcome measures were the time to first alleviation of symptoms, influenza outcomes and complications, hospital admissions, and adverse events in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.

- **Results**: The review included 28 trials in stage 1 (judgment of appropriate study design) and 26 in stage 2 (formal analysis). For adults, zanamivir reduced the time to the first alleviation of symptoms of influenza-like illness by 0.60 days (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.81, P < 0.001, I(2) = 9%), equating to an average reduction of 14.4 hours or a 10% reduction in mean symptom duration from 6.6 days to 6.0 days. The time to symptom alleviation was shorter in all participants when any relief drugs were allowed compared with no use. However, zanamivir did not reduce the risk of self-reported investigator-mediated pneumonia (risk difference 0.17%, -0.73% to 0.70%) or radiologically confirmed pneumonia (-0.06%, -6.56% to 2.11%) in adults. The effect on pneumonia in children was also not significant (0.56%, -1.64% to 1.04%). Additionally, there was no significant effect on otitis media or sinusitis in both adults and children.

### Antivirals for treatment of severe influenza: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115DFsF5]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Our search identified 11,878 citations, of which 8,944 remained after removing duplicates. After screening 8,944 titles and abstracts and 459 full texts, eight randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.

- **Study selection**: The eight eligible trials included a total of 1,424 participants, ranging from 30 to 615 per trial. The mean age ranged from 36 years to 60 years, for trials that reported mean or median age. The proportion of male patients ranged from 43% to 78%, and the proportion of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza ranged from 79% to 100%.

The interventions included oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, rimantadine, zanamivir plus rimantadine, and baloxavir plus neuraminidase inhibitors. Direct comparisons between antivirals and standard care or placebo were available for oseltamivir and peramivir in three trials. Standard care was based on local institutional protocols or the primary physician's discretion, typically without the use of neuraminidase inhibitors.

The other five trials compared different antivirals: two trials compared oseltamivir against peramivir, one compared oseltamivir against zanamivir, one compared zanamivir and rimantadine against rimantadine alone, and one trial compared baloxavir plus various neuraminidase inhibitors against neuraminidase inhibitors alone.

- **Risk of bias**: The risk of bias of eligible trials for each outcome is presented in the appendix.

### Oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin combination antiviral therapy versus oseltamivir monotherapy for the treatment of influenza: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 2 trial [^113i1v6G]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Influenza continues to have a significant socioeconomic and health impact despite a long-established vaccine program and approved antivirals. Preclinical data suggest that combination antivirals might be more effective than oseltamivir alone in the treatment of influenza.

We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase 2 trial of combination antivirals versus monotherapy for the treatment of influenza. Participants aged ≥ 18 years with influenza at increased risk of complications from influenza were randomized by an online computer-generated randomization system to receive either oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin or oseltamivir alone for 5 days, and were followed for 28 days. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants with the virus detectable by polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs at Day 3. Among the secondary outcomes were safety and time to alleviation of influenza clinical symptoms. Identifier: NCT01227967.

Between March 2011 and April 2016, we randomized 633 participants. Seven participants were excluded from analysis: three were given treatment without randomization, three withdrew before taking any medication, and one was lost to follow-up. The primary analysis included 394 participants, excluding 47 in the pilot phase, 172 without confirmed influenza, and 13 without an endpoint sample. Eighty of 200 (40.0%) participants in the combination arm had virus detectable at Day 3 compared to 97 of 194 (50.0%) [95% C. I., 0.2–19.8%, p = 0.046] in the control arm. There was no benefit, however, in multiple clinical secondary outcomes.

### Oral oseltamivir improves pulmonary function and reduces exacerbation frequency for influenza-infected children with asthma [^116ZvKQB]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). High credibility.

Among asthmatic children, influenza is associated with increased hospitalizations. Although vaccination is safe and effective among asthmatic children, its protective efficacy varies and uptake rates can be low. In comparison, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is effective against all influenza strains and can reduce the severity and duration of influenza among adults and children. This study determined the effects of oseltamivir among influenza-infected children with asthma.

- **Methods**: Asthmatic children (6–12 years of age) were randomized to receive oseltamivir (2 mg/kg) or placebo twice daily as a syrup. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to freedom from illness. Secondary endpoints included the area under the symptom score-hour curve, the proportion of patients with asthma exacerbations, and changes in forced expiratory volume at one second during the dosing period. Analysis was performed for both the intent-to-treat infected (n = 179) and per protocol (n = 162) populations.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint for this study was not met. Oseltamivir tended to reduce the time to freedom from illness in the intent-to-treat infected population (10.4 hours, 8%; P = 0.5420), the per protocol population (24.3 hours, 17%; P = 0.1607), and patients who started treatment less than 24 hours after symptom onset (39.8 hours, 25%; P = 0.0780). However, an improvement in pulmonary function was observed. The improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second was significantly greater among oseltamivir-treated patients (10.8% versus 4.7%; P = 0.0148). Oseltamivir-treated patients also experienced improved outcomes.

### Oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin combination antiviral therapy versus oseltamivir monotherapy for the treatment of influenza: A multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 2 trial [^115DojYu]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

In this large double-blind prospective multicenter RCT conducted in multiple countries, a virologic treatment benefit was observed without improved clinical outcomes. This observation calls into question whether changes in viral shedding from an antiviral can be used to predict changes in clinical outcomes. It is possible that assessing viral shedding by PCR at a fixed time point after influenza diagnosis is not sufficiently sensitive as an overall measure of antiviral efficacy, and other, more comprehensive or alternative measures might be required.

Until the relationship between changes in viral shedding and changes in symptoms is better understood, the results of this study argue that using primary virologic endpoints for clinical trials of promising antiviral agents should be met with appropriate caution. There may be other benefits of reducing viral shedding, such as lower infectivity and decreased emergence of antiviral resistance, although this study was not designed to assess these important public health outcomes. In our population of patients with seasonal influenza, close to one-half of participants stopped shedding the virus within 3 days with oseltamivir alone.

It is known that patients who are hospitalized with severe influenza and/or other influenza strains such as H5N1 and H7N9 shed higher amounts of virus for longer periods of time. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if the lack of clinical benefit in our population would apply to those who are hospitalized with severe influenza or infected with other strains of influenza.

### A randomized study evaluating the effectiveness of oseltamivir initiated at the time of hospital admission in adults hospitalized with influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections [^115f8nSd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Influenza-associated hospitalizations result in high morbidity and mortality. We sought to determine if early empiric anti-influenza therapy improves outcomes of hospitalized patients with influenza-associated lower respiratory tract infections (I-LRTIs).

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, unblinded trial of adult patients hospitalized with I-LRTIs in Kentucky during 2009–2012. Patients were randomized to group A (standard of care) or group B (standard of care plus oseltamivir as early as possible but within 24 hours of enrollment). The primary outcome was development of clinical failure (a composite variable including failure to reach clinical improvement within 7 days, transfer to intensive care 24 hours after admission, or rehospitalization or death within 30 days). Intent-to-treat (ITT) (all LRTI) and per-protocol (PP) (I-LRTI) analyses were done.

- **Results**: A total of 1107 patients were enrolled and included in the ITT analysis, 556 in group A and 551 in group B. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 5 days (interquartile range, 5) for both groups; oseltamivir was initiated on median day 6 in group B. There was no difference in the development of clinical failure (group A, 25%, and group B, 24%; p = 0.561). In the PP analysis, 11 of 45 (24%) patients in group A and 4 of 29 (14%) patients in group B had clinical failure (P = 0.414).

- **Conclusions**: Initiation of oseltamivir more than 5 days after illness onset did not reduce clinical failures among hospitalized patients with I-LRTIs. However, we did not enroll our projected sample size of I-LRTIs.

### Efficacy and safety of remdesivir in people with impaired kidney function hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia: A randomized clinical trial [^113qtgQS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The study REDPINE, published by Meghan E. Sise and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, focuses on COVID-19 pneumonia. The trial sought to examine the effect of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and renal impairment. The study was a multi-center, double-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 243 patients (104 female, 139 male).

The inclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 12 years hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia with acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or kidney failure. Key exclusion criteria included patients on invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or dialysis for AKI.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Remdesivir group**: n = 163 received an intravenous dose of 200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily on days 2–5.
	- **Placebo group**: n = 80 received a matching intravenous saline placebo.

- **Primary outcome**:
	- There was no significant difference in the rate of death or invasive mechanical ventilation through day 29 (29.4% vs. 32.5%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.32).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in the rate of death by day 29 (25.2% vs. 28.8%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.39).

- **Safety outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in grade ≥ 3 adverse events and serious adverse events.

In conclusion, for patients aged ≥ 12 years hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia with AKI, CKD, or kidney failure, remdesivir was not superior to placebo with respect to the rate of death or invasive mechanical ventilation.

### Oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin combination antiviral therapy versus oseltamivir monotherapy for the treatment of influenza: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 2 trial [^112mDqdW]. The Lancet. Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Participants were assessed on Study Day 0 (pre-dose), and on Study Days 3, 7, and 28. Originally, the study was designed with visits on Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 28. However, in 2012, after completion of a pilot study, modifications were made to simplify visits and improve enrollment. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs to test for the influenza virus were collected on Days 0, 3, and 7, with blood samples collected on Days 0, 3, 7, and 28. The study teams were trained through in-person sessions, training videos, and pre-study quality assurance tests, which involved swabs assaying for housekeeping genes from nasal epithelium. Participants were given diary cards to be completed twice daily from Day 0 to Day 7, once daily for Days 8–14, and again on Day 28.

- **Outcomes**: The first 50 participants randomized were part of a pilot study to determine the virologic endpoint for the primary efficacy analysis based on virologic and practical considerations (actual N = 47). These participants underwent NP and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, with all samples tested by both PCR and tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50) measurements. Additionally, duplicate virologic samples were obtained on Day 0 to assess the reproducibility of the virologic assays. Following the pilot study analysis, without unblinding to treatment, the primary endpoint was established as the percentage of participants with virus detectable by PCR in NP swab at Day 3. Secondary clinical endpoints included time to alleviation of influenza clinical symptoms.

### Intravenous zanamivir or oral oseltamivir for hospitalised patients with influenza: An international, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 trial [^113FWM6a]. The Lancet. Respiratory Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Neuraminidase inhibitors are effective for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. However, there is an unmet need for intravenous treatment for patients admitted to the hospital with severe influenza. We studied whether intravenous zanamivir was a suitable treatment in this setting.

- **Methods**: In this international, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 16 years or older with severe influenza admitted to 97 hospitals from 26 countries. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1 stratified by symptom onset ≤ 4 days or 5–6 days) to receive 300 mg or 600 mg intravenous zanamivir, or standard-of-care (75 mg oral oseltamivir) twice a day for 5–10 days; patients were followed up for 28 days. The randomisation schedule, including stratification, was generated using GlaxoSmithKline's RandAll software. Patients, site study staff, and sponsor were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was time to clinical response — a composite of vital sign stabilisation and hospital discharge — in the influenza-positive population. The trial was powered to show an improvement of 1.5 days or greater with 600 mg intravenous zanamivir. Pharmacokinetic, safety, and virology endpoints were also assessed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01231620.

- **Findings**: Between Jan 15, 2011, and Feb 12, 2015, 626 patients were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg intravenous zanamivir (n = 201), 600 mg intravenous zanamivir (n = 209), or 75 mg oral oseltamivir (n = 205) twice a day; 11 patients discontinued the study before receiving any treatment.

Among the 454 participants in the Efficacy Population, the median duration of symptoms was 4.5 days in the combination arm versus 4.0 days in the oseltamivir arm (p = 0.21). When evaluating all 626 participants in the ITT population, the results are similar: 4.5 versus 4.0 days (p = 0.44). When restricting the ITT population to those with more severe symptoms (at least one grade 2 or 3 symptom at randomization), the medians remained unchanged: 4.5 (95% CI 4.0–5.0) versus 4.0 (95% CI 4.0–4.5), p = 0.18. In subgroup analyses for the ITT population, there was no significant difference in duration of symptoms based on sex (interaction p = 0.87), flu type (p = 0.53), or country and race (p = 0.55).

- **Efficacy outcomes**: Those treated with combination antivirals in the Efficacy Population took longer until they felt as good as before the onset of the influenza illness (median 7.5 versus 6.5 days, p = 0.009) or until the participant functioned as well as before the onset of influenza illness (7.0 versus 6.0 days, p = 0.019). There was no difference in the physical function score on the SF-36 between arms.

- **Complications and antibiotic use**: There were 74 complications noted among the 626 participants through Day 28: 28 participants had sinusitis (14 in the combination arm versus 14 in the oseltamivir arm), 4 had otitis media (1 versus 3), 29 had bronchitis (18 versus 11), and 13 had pneumonia (7 versus 6). Additionally, antibiotics were given for reasons other than the complications noted above in 56 participants (27 versus 29). The occurrence of complication or antibiotic use was noted.

### Remdesivir and three other drugs for hospitalised patients with COVID-19: final results of the WHO Solidarity randomized trial and updated meta-analyses [^117HfCRZ]. Lancet (2022). Low credibility.

Patients were subdivided by disease severity (defined by ventilation and supplemental oxygen use) at entry. The questions defining disease severity at entry did not separate high-flow from low-flow oxygen, or non-invasive from invasive ventilation.

The same cloud-based system was used to report death in hospital or discharge alive, the probable causes of any deaths, respiratory support usage, drug usage, and any suspected adverse reactions. National and global study monitors raised queries, resolved them, and checked study progress and data completeness.

The protocol for Solidarity has been published previously and was approved by the WHO ethics committee, with local protocols approved nationally. WHO and national governments were co-sponsors. Trial conduct accorded with the Helsinki Declaration and Good Clinical Practice principles. Trial governance was managed by the steering committee and its executive group. Data and safety monitoring committee analyses were unseen by the executive group or WHO, with two exceptions. After external evidence of futility emerged for hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir, the executive group reviewed analyses just of those two drugs and stopped assigning patients to them. After deciding blindly to report interim results, the executive group reviewed all analyses and stopped IFN for futility. Randomization between remdesivir and its control continued, but the executive group eventually ceased randomization into Solidarity because the donated supplies had run low.

- **Randomization and masking**: We used open-label, unstratified randomization. The study drugs were remdesivir.

### Oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin combination antiviral therapy versus oseltamivir monotherapy for the treatment of influenza: A multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 2 trial [^112JiAJi]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first large randomized controlled comparison of oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin versus oseltamivir alone for the treatment of influenza. The study, conducted in an ambulatory population with risk factors for complications from influenza, demonstrated a modest but statistically significant 10% absolute reduction from 50% to 40% in the proportion of participants shedding the virus on Day 3. Together with the quantitative reduction in viral load at Day 3, the combination of oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin does indeed appear to decrease viral shedding relative to conventional monotherapy. By Day 7, however, a similarly high proportion of participants in both arms (89% and 86%) had stopped shedding the influenza virus, and the difference between treatments was no longer significant.

This reduction in viral shedding by combination antivirals, however, did not translate into clinical benefit when evaluated across multiple different parameters. When assessed by symptoms, fever, the physical domain of SF-36, and the occurrence of complications, it also did not appear that participants "felt" better any more quickly after treatment with combination antivirals than with oseltamivir alone. Indeed, by some metrics, such as the global assessments, participants receiving the combination antivirals may have recovered somewhat slower.

### Efficacy of interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir compared with remdesivir alone in hospitalised adults with COVID-19: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^113qmybh]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Functional impairment of interferon, a natural antiviral component of the immune system, is associated with the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19. We aimed to compare the efficacy of interferon beta-1a in combination with remdesivir compared with remdesivir alone in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at 63 hospitals across five countries (Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States). Eligible patients were hospitalised adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test, who met one of the following criteria suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection: the presence of radiographic infiltrates on imaging, a peripheral oxygen saturation on room air of 94% or less, or requiring supplemental oxygen. Patients were excluded if they had either an alanine aminotransferase or an aspartate aminotransferase concentration more than five times the upper limit of normal; had impaired renal function; were allergic to the study product; were pregnant or breastfeeding; were already on mechanical ventilation; or were anticipating discharge from the hospital or transfer to another hospital within 72 hours of enrollment.

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous remdesivir as a 200 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose administered daily for up to 9 days and up to four doses of either 44 μg interferon beta-1a (interferon beta-1a group plus remdesivir group) or placebo (placebo plus remdesivir group) administered subcutaneously.

### Remdesivir for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) versus a cohort receiving standard of care [^111YKX9z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Endpoints and assessments - **Study 5773 individual study endpoints**: 5773 individual study endpoints and assessments have been reported. In study 5807, the coprimary endpoints are clinical status assessed by a 7-point ordinal scale on day 14 (1 = death, 7 = discharged alive; Table 1) and all-cause mortality at day 28, which were not assessed in this interim analysis. Other endpoints, assessments, and data abstraction/management are detailed in Supplementary Digital Content 2.

Interim data from study 5773 and study 5807, reported herein, were compared in a prespecified analysis, with a focus on efficacy alone. The primary endpoint in this planned interim analysis was recovery on day 14, based on the 7-point ordinal scale: improvement to a score of 5–7 for a baseline of 2–4, 6 or 7 for baseline score of 5, and 7 for baseline score of 6. Secondary endpoints of the interim analysis include death at day 14; clinical improvement on day 14 (2-point improvement in score or discharged alive); and 1-point or more improvement in clinical status on day 14. Safety analyses for study 5773 have been described. Safety data were not collected for study 5807.

Statistical analysis - **Sample size and data collection**: The planned sample size of study 5773 was 400 patients. As data for study 5807 were collected concurrently with study 5773 enrollment, and the remdesivir-cohort disease characteristics were unknown, we originally planned to identify up to 2000 eligible patients in study 5807 to have sufficient data for analysis.

### Rapivab [^115cXffh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The study, titled "Acute uncomplicated influenza in adults", was a randomized, multicenter, blinded trial conducted in Japan. This trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous administration of RAPIVAB at 300 mg, 600 mg, or placebo. The administration occurred over 30 minutes in subjects aged 20 to 65 years with acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligibility criteria included a fever equal to or greater than 38°C (axillary) and a positive rapid antigen test for influenza virus. Additionally, participants exhibited at least two symptoms, such as cough, nasal symptoms, sore throat, myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache. All subjects enrolled were permitted to take fever-reducing medications.

Study treatment commenced within 48 hours of symptom onset. Participants were required to self-assess their influenza symptoms as "none", "mild", "moderate", or "severe" twice daily. The primary endpoint was the time to alleviation of symptoms, defined as the number of hours from the initiation of the study drug until the start of the 24-hour period during which all seven influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, feverishness, myalgia, and fatigue) were either absent or present at a level no greater than mild for at least 21.5 hours.

The overall efficacy population consisted of 297 subjects with confirmed influenza who were administered the study drug. Among the 98 subjects enrolled in the RAPIVAB 600 mg dose group, the mean age was 34 years; 55% were male, 34% were smokers, 99% were infected with influenza A virus, and 1% were infected with influenza B virus.

### Relenza [^111edCvE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

There was no consistent difference in treatment effect in patients with influenza A compared with influenza B; however, these trials enrolled smaller numbers of patients with influenza B and thus provided less evidence in support of efficacy in influenza B. In general, patients with lower temperature (e.g. 38.2°C or less) or investigator-rated as having less severe symptoms at entry derived less benefit from therapy. No consistent treatment effect was demonstrated in patients with underlying chronic medical conditions, including respiratory or cardiovascular disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Additionally, no consistent differences in the rate of development of complications were observed between treatment groups. Some fluctuation of symptoms was observed after the primary study endpoint in both treatment groups.

- **Pediatric patients**: The efficacy of Relenza 10 mg inhaled twice daily for 5 days in the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients has been evaluated in a placebo-controlled study conducted in North America and Europe, enrolling 471 patients, ages 5 to 12 years (55% male, 90% Caucasian), within 36 hours of symptom onset. Of 346 patients with confirmed influenza, 65% had influenza A and 35% had influenza B. The definition of time to improvement included no fever and parental assessment of no or mild cough and absent/minimal muscle and joint aches or pains, sore throat, chills/feverishness, and headache. The median time to symptom improvement was 1 day shorter in patients receiving zanamivir compared with placebo.

### Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in adults and children [^115Y1Y7R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are stockpiled and recommended by public health agencies for treating and preventing seasonal and pandemic influenza; they are used clinically worldwide.

- **Objectives**: To describe the potential benefits and harms of NIs for influenza in all age groups by reviewing all clinical study reports of published and unpublished randomized, placebo-controlled trials and regulatory comments.

- **Search methods**: We searched trial registries, electronic databases (up to 22 July 2013), and regulatory archives, and corresponded with manufacturers to identify all trials. We also requested clinical study reports. We focused on the primary data sources of manufacturers but checked that there were no published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from non-manufacturer sources by running electronic searches in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, Embase.com, PubMed (not MEDLINE), the Database of Reviews of Effects, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and the Health Economic Evaluations Database.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, placebo-controlled trials on adults and children with confirmed or suspected exposure to naturally occurring influenza.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted clinical study reports and assessed risk of bias using purpose-built instruments. We analyzed the effects of zanamivir and oseltamivir on time to first alleviation of symptoms, influenza outcomes, complications, hospitalizations, and adverse events in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.

### Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 [^115W1TR5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to widespread implementation. However, the available evidence remains inconsistent. This update aims to fill knowledge gaps by identifying, describing, evaluating, and synthesizing all evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of remdesivir on clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of remdesivir and standard care compared to standard care with or without a placebo on clinical outcomes in patients treated for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register — comprising the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv — as well as the Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global Literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on May 31, 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We followed standard Cochrane methodology, including RCTs evaluating remdesivir and standard care for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to standard care with or without a placebo, irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting. We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases.

### Tocilizumab and remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: A randomized clinical trial [^116TZdax]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, REMDACTA is the first multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the inhibition of interleukin-6 signaling in patients with COVID-19, all of whom received remdesivir, and most of whom also received systemic corticosteroids. However, REMDACTA was not powered to detect the relatively small but clinically meaningful mortality benefit demonstrated in larger platform studies. REMDACTA was designed and initiated relatively early in the pandemic, before results from other randomized controlled trials of tocilizumab were available.

Thus, the primary outcome of the trial was changed from clinical status on the ordinal scale to time to discharge or "ready for discharge" when enrollment was approximately half-completed, based on the results from other trials, which suggested that time to discharge or "ready for discharge" is a more sensitive and clinically meaningful outcome in patients with severe COVID-19. REMDACTA eligibility criteria were also modified to allow enrollment of patients who had received up to two doses of remdesivir before randomization because remdesivir was increasingly administered as standard of care. These changes were implemented while patients were still enrolling in the trial, and the protocol and statistical analysis plan were finalized on February 22, 2021, before unblinding on March 1, 2021.

Despite randomization, there were some slight imbalances in baseline characteristics between the treatment arms, such as more patients aged 65 and older and more patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

### Efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a plant-derived, quadrivalent, virus-like particle influenza vaccine in adults (18–64 years) and older adults (≥ 65 years): two multicentre, randomised phase 3 trials [^113KT1pm]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza remains a substantial public health threat despite the availability of egg-derived and other vaccines. Plant-based manufacturing might address some of the limitations of vaccines. We describe two phase 3 efficacy studies of a recombinant quadrivalent virus-like particle (QVLP) influenza vaccine manufactured in plants, one in adults aged 18–64 years (the 18–64 study) and one in older people aged 65 years and older (the 65-plus study).

- **Methods**: We conducted two randomised, observer-blind, multinational studies in the northern hemisphere during the 2017–18 (the 18–64 study) and 2018–19 (the 65-plus study) influenza seasons. The 18–64 study took place at 73 sites and the 65-plus study at 104 sites across Asia, Europe, and North America. Inclusion criteria for the 18–64 study included a body-mass index less than 40 kg/m², age 18–64 years at screening visit, and good health. For the 65-plus study, inclusion criteria were a body-mass index of up to 35 kg/m², age 65 years or older at screening visit, not residing in a rehabilitation centre or care home, and absence of acute or evolving medical problems. Participants in the 18–64 study were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either QVLP vaccine (30 μg haemagglutinin per strain) or placebo. Participants in the 65-plus study were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive QVLP vaccine (30 μg haemagglutinin per strain) or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV; 15 μg haemagglutinin per strain). The primary outcome in the 18–64 study was absolute vaccine efficacy to prevent laboratory-confirmed respiratory illness.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^116FtjP8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The certainty of evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings table ranged from low to moderate. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to risk of bias arising from the use of an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis, which only included participants randomly assigned to the study intervention who took ≥ 1 dose of the intervention and had ≥ 1 post‐baseline visit through day 28. Additionally, the outcomes of 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered.

All‐cause mortality at 28 days and serious adverse events during the study period were further downgraded due to serious imprecision resulting from a low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness as the study only assessed COVID‐19 related hospitalizations.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new and most of the studies are still ongoing. We identified no study results reporting on the improvement of clinical status, quality of life, and viral clearance.

### Tamiflu [^114RAKxY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric subjects (1 year to 12 years of age)

One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had a fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when the influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.

Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Tamiflu treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of Tamiflu in male and female pediatric subjects.

Pediatric subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age)

Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post-conceptional age). Subjects received Tamiflu at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days, depending on their condition.

### Efficacy and safety of pimodivir combined with standard of care in hospitalized and nonhospitalized high-risk adolescents and adults with influenza A infection [^116nJGGh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

An unmet need exists for effective antivirals to treat patients hospitalized with influenza. The results of two phase 3 studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pimodivir in combination with investigator-chosen standard of care (SoC) treatment are presented.

- **Methods**: Hospitalized patients (hospital study; NCT03376321) and high-risk outpatients (outpatient study; NCT03381196) with laboratory-confirmed influenza A infection were randomized 1:1 to receive either 600 mg pimodivir twice daily plus SoC or placebo twice daily plus SoC for 5 days. For most patients, SoC included oseltamivir. The primary endpoints were the Hospital Recovery Scale (HRS) at day 6 for the hospital study and the median time to resolution (TTR) of influenza-related symptoms for the outpatient study.

- **Results**: Pimodivir plus SoC (oseltamivir) treatment showed no clinical benefit over placebo plus SoC on HRS at day 6 (common odds ratio, 0.943; 95% confidence interval, 0.609–1.462; P = 0.397; hospital study). A shorter median TTR of 7 symptoms was estimated with pimodivir plus SoC versus placebo (92.6 hours; 95% CI, 77.6–104.2 vs. 105.1 hours; 95% CI, 92.7–128.6; P = 0.0216; outpatient study).

- **Conclusions**: Pimodivir plus SoC showed no additional clinical benefit versus SoC treatment alone in hospitalized patients. Pimodivir plus SoC demonstrated a shorter TTR of influenza symptoms versus placebo plus SoC in high-risk outpatients.

- **Clinical trial registration**: NCT03376321 and NCT03381196.

### Xofluza [^111EAspA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical studies in adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older:

In adult and adolescent subjects with a confirmed influenza virus infection, the overall frequencies of treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir were 5% (6/134) for influenza A/H1N1, 11% (53/485) for A/H3N2, and 1% (2/224) for B virus infections, respectively. This data was pooled from Trials T0821, T0831, and T0832 [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In Trial T0834, among 303 subjects aged 12 years and older who received XOFLUZA as post-exposure prophylaxis, 32 were viral RNA-positive post-baseline. This group included 17 subjects evaluated for resistance. Influenza virus with substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir was identified in 4 out of 4 subjects who developed clinical influenza and in 6 out of 13 other subjects who did not meet the primary endpoint definition for clinical influenza [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Clinical studies in pediatric subjects aged 5 to less than 12 years:

The selection of influenza viruses with treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir occurred at higher frequencies in pediatric subjects aged 5 to less than 12 years compared to subjects aged 12 years and older. Such viruses were detected with overall frequencies of 17% (2/12) in influenza A/H1N1, 18% (17/93) in A/H3N2, and 0% (0/13) in B virus infections. This data was pooled from four pediatric treatment trials in subjects aged 5 to less than 12 years.

### Rapivab [^1112396N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Study 305 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of a single intravenous dose of Rapivab. This dose was administered for a minimum of 15 minutes to subjects aged 2 to 17 years with acute uncomplicated influenza. These subjects had a fever of at least 37.8°C (oral) and presented with at least one respiratory symptom, such as cough or rhinitis, or had a positive influenza rapid antigen test. **Study design**: Treatment commenced within 48 hours of symptom onset. Subjects were randomized to receive Rapivab 600 mg (ages 13 to 17), Rapivab 12 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 600 mg (ages 2 to 12), or oral oseltamivir twice a day for 5 days. Fever-reducing medications were allowed for all participants.

The overall efficacy population included 84 subjects with confirmed influenza who were administered the study drug. Among the 69 subjects treated with Rapivab, the median age was 7.9 years; 55% were male. Of these, 58% were infected with the influenza A virus, 36% with the influenza B virus, and 6% were co-infected with both influenza A and B viruses.

The primary endpoint was the safety of peramivir compared to oseltamivir, assessed through adverse events, laboratory analysis, vital signs, and physical exams. **Secondary endpoints** included efficacy outcomes such as the time to resolution of influenza symptoms and time to resolution of fever; however, the trial was not powered to detect statistically significant differences in these secondary endpoints.

### Xofluza [^114ubm9y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The primary endpoint of both trials, the time to alleviation of symptoms, was defined as the time when all seven symptoms — cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, feverishness, myalgia, and fatigue — had been assessed by the subject as none or mild for a duration of at least 21.5 hours. In both trials, XOFLUZA treatment at the recommended dose resulted in a statistically significant shorter time to alleviation of symptoms compared with placebo in the primary efficacy population.

In Trial T0831, there was no difference in the time to alleviation of symptoms between subjects (age ≥ 20 years) who received XOFLUZA (54 hours) and those who received oseltamivir (54 hours). For adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age) in Trial T0831, the median time to alleviation of symptoms for subjects infected with influenza who received XOFLUZA (N = 63) was 54 hours (95% CI of 43, 81) compared to 93 hours (95% CI of 64, 118) in the placebo arm (N = 27).

The number of subjects who received XOFLUZA at the recommended dose and who were infected with influenza type B virus was limited, including 24 subjects in Trial T0821 and 38 subjects in Trial T0831. In the influenza B subset in Trial T0821, the median time to alleviation of symptoms in subjects who received 40 mg XOFLUZA was 63 hours (95% CI of 43, 70) compared to 83 hours (95% CI of 58, 93) in subjects who received placebo. In the influenza B subset in Trial T0831, the median time to alleviation of symptoms in subjects who received 40 mg or 80 mg XOFLUZA was 93 hours (95% CI of 53, 135) compared to 77 hours (95% CI).

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: Systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^113oYPfX]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

The objective was to describe the potential benefits and harms of oseltamivir by reviewing all clinical study reports (or similar documents when no clinical study report exists) of randomized placebo-controlled trials and regulatory comments ("regulatory information").

- **Design**: Systematic review of regulatory information.

- **Data sources**: Clinical study reports, trial registries, electronic databases, regulatory archives, and correspondence with manufacturers.

- **Eligibility criteria for selecting studies**: Randomized placebo-controlled trials on adults and children who had confirmed or suspected exposure to natural influenza.

- **Main outcome measures**: Time to first alleviation of symptoms, influenza outcomes, complications, admissions to hospital, and adverse events in the intention-to-treat population.

Results from the European Medicines Agency and Roche provided clinical study reports for 83 trials. We included 23 trials in stage 1 (reliability and completeness screen) and 20 in stage 2 (formal analysis). In treatment trials on adults, oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 hours (95% confidence interval 8.4 to 25.1 hours, P < 0.001). There was no effect in children with asthma, but there was an effect in otherwise healthy children (mean difference 29 hours, 95% confidence interval 12 to 47 hours, P = 0.001). In treatment trials, there was no difference in admissions to hospital in adults (risk difference 0.15%, 95% confidence interval -0.91% to 0.78%, P = 0.84) and sparse data in children and for prophylaxis.

### Relenza [^116K9D3V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

In the second study, index cases were not treated. The incidence of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza was reduced from 19.0% (46 of 242 households) for the placebo group to 4.1% (10 of 245 households) for the group receiving Relenza.

- **Seasonal prophylaxis studies**: Two seasonal prophylaxis studies assessed Relenza 10 mg inhaled once daily versus placebo inhaled once daily for 28 days during community outbreaks.

	- The first study enrolled subjects 18 years of age or greater (mean age 29 years) from two university communities. The majority of subjects were unvaccinated (86%). In this study, the incidence of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza was reduced from 6.1% (34 of 554) for the placebo group to 2.0% (11 of 553) for the group receiving Relenza.

	- The second seasonal prophylaxis study enrolled subjects 12 to 94 years of age (mean age 60 years) with 56% of them older than 65 years of age. Sixty-seven percent of the subjects were vaccinated. In this study, the incidence of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza was reduced from 1.4% (23 of 1,685) for the placebo group to 0.2% (4 of 1,678) for the group receiving Relenza.

### Outpatient treatment of confirmed COVID-19: Living, rapid practice points from the American College of Physicians (version 1) [^117U1YnP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of COVID-19 infection, and more specifically concerning remdesivir, the ACP 2022 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of remdesivir for the treatment of ambulatory patients. This applies to those with confirmed mild-to-moderate COVID-19, who present within 7 days of the onset of symptoms and are at high risk for progressing to severe disease.

### Rapivab [^113o7cJF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The efficacy of Rapivab could not be established in patients with serious influenza requiring hospitalization [see Indications and Usage (1)].

A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 301) was conducted in 398 subjects with serious influenza requiring hospitalization. Subjects were randomized to receive Rapivab 600 mg daily for 5 days plus standard of care versus standard of care plus placebo within 72 hours of the start of symptoms. The primary endpoint was time to clinical resolution, defined as the time in hours from initiation of study treatment until resolution of at least 4 of 5 signs (temperature, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, heart rate, or systolic blood pressure), maintained for at least 24 hours. Rapivab plus standard of care did not improve the median time to clinical resolution compared with standard of care alone.

### Nirmatrelvir combined with ritonavir for preventing and treating COVID-19 [^112u5UrC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The certainty of the evidence for prioritized outcomes presented in the summary of findings tables ranged from low to moderate for outpatients and was very low for inpatients.

- **Outpatients**: We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table due to the risk of bias. This bias arose from using an inappropriate per‐protocol analysis, which only included participants randomly assigned to the study intervention who received one or more doses and had one or more postbaseline visits by day 28. Additionally, the outcomes 'treatment‐related adverse events during the study period' and 'discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events' were not prospectively registered. All‐cause mortality at 28 days and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study period were further downgraded for serious imprecision due to a low number of events. The outcome 'admission to hospital or death within 28 days' was additionally downgraded for serious indirectness, as the study only assessed COVID‐19‐related hospitalizations.

- **Inpatients**: We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes included in our summary of findings table for indirectness due to an atypical hospital population of mildly to moderately affected patients. Additionally, the certainty was downgraded twice for imprecision using the minimally contextualized approach.

We did not consider downgrading for publication bias because the intervention is new, and most of the studies are still ongoing. We identified no study results reporting on the improvement of clinical status or quality of life.

### A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of nitazoxanide for treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 [^114mYHeK]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

This trial was designed early in the pandemic when information to guide the selection of endpoints, patient populations, and access to reliable and timely diagnostic testing was limited. The endpoints and patient population were selected based on the design of historical clinical trials in outpatients with uncomplicated influenza. To ensure early treatment, participants were enrolled based on symptoms. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at the baseline visit to identify participants with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection for inclusion in the analyses of the modified intent-to-treat population.

In late 2020, weeks before the present study achieved full enrollment, exploratory analyses from early studies of the monoclonal antibodies bamlanivimab and casirivimab plus imdevimab for treating mild or moderate COVID-19 led to the adoption of an efficacy endpoint focused on the proportions of emergency room visits or hospitalizations within 28 days. The observed proportions experiencing hospitalization or death in those studies were 1/101 (1.0%) for bamlanivimab (700 mg)-treated participants compared to 9/156 (5.8%) for placebo-treated participants (p = 0.09), showing an 83% relative reduction. Similarly, for casirivimab/imdevimab (2400 mg)-treated participants, 4/215 (1.9%) compared to 10/231 (4.3%) for placebo-treated participants (p = 0.18), representing a 57% relative reduction. In November 2020, these products were made available under emergency use authorizations in the United States based on this data. Larger follow-on studies of these and other monoclonal antibodies have subsequently confirmed these findings.

### Rapivab [^1156WsSW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Rapivab is indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 2 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. It is an influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor intended for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza under these conditions.

- **Limitations of use**: Efficacy is based on clinical trials in which the predominant influenza virus type was influenza A; a limited number of subjects infected with influenza B virus were included. The efficacy of Rapivab could not be established in patients with serious influenza requiring hospitalization.

Influenza viruses can change over time, and the emergence of resistance substitutions could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors, such as changes in viral virulence, might also diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Therefore, prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use Rapivab.

### Corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza [^117NkXac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Specific treatments for influenza are limited to neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes. Corticosteroids show evidence of benefit in sepsis and related conditions, most likely due to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Although commonly prescribed for severe influenza, there is uncertainty over their potential benefits or harms. This is an update of a review first published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To systematically assess the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of influenza, taking into account differences in timing and doses of corticosteroids.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2018, Issue 9), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1946 to October week 1, 2018); Embase (1980 to 3 October 2018); CINAHL (1981 to 3 October 2018); LILACS (1982 to 3 October 2018); Web of Science (1985 to 3 October 2018); abstracts from the last three years of major infectious disease and microbiology conferences; and references of included articles. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry on 3 October 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and observational studies that compared corticosteroid treatment with no corticosteroid treatment for influenza or influenza-like illness. We did not restrict studies by language of publication, influenza subtypes, clinical setting, or age of participants.

### Remdesivir plus standard of care versus standard of care alone for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (DisCoVeRy): a phase 3, randomised, controlled, open-label trial [^114EbBsy]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

The antiviral efficacy of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of remdesivir plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, requiring oxygen or ventilator support.

- **Methods**: DisCoVeRy was a phase 3, open-label, adaptive, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial conducted at 48 sites in Europe (France, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Luxembourg). Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) admitted to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and illness of any duration were eligible if they had clinical evidence of hypoxaemic pneumonia or required oxygen supplementation.

	- Exclusion criteria included elevated liver enzymes, severe chronic kidney disease, any contraindication to one of the studied treatments or their use in the 29 days before random assignment, or use of ribavirin, as well as pregnancy or breastfeeding. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive standard of care alone or in combination with remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon beta-1a, or hydroxychloroquine.

	- Randomisation used computer-generated blocks of various sizes and was stratified by severity of disease at inclusion and by European administrative region. Remdesivir was administered as a 200 mg intravenous infusion on day 1, followed by once daily, 1-hour infusions of 100 mg for up to 9 days, for a total duration of 10 days. It could be stopped after 5 days if the participant was discharged. The primary outcome was the clinical…

### Efficacy of baloxavir treatment in preventing transmission of influenza [^116aKajH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The CENTERSTONE study, published by Arnold S. Monto and colleagues in 2025, focuses on influenza virus infection. The central question was the effect of baloxavir marboxil for preventing influenza virus transmission.

The design of the CENTERSTONE study included a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a population of 1,092 patients (578 female, 514 male). Inclusion criteria were influenza-positive index patients aged 5–64. Key exclusion criteria involved a high risk for influenza-related complications, severe influenza virus infections requiring inpatient treatment, pregnancy or breastfeeding, concurrent infections requiring systemic antimicrobial or antiviral therapy, receipt of investigational monoclonal antibodies for viral disease in the last year, and hypersensitivity to baloxavir marboxil.

The interventions in the CENTERSTONE study consisted of:

- **Baloxavir marboxil**: A single oral dose administered to 548 patients within 48 hours after symptom onset.
- **Placebo**: A matching placebo given to 544 patients within the same time frame.

The primary outcome was a significant decrease in the transmission rate of the influenza virus from an index patient to a household contact by day 5, observed as 9.5% in the baloxavir group compared to 13.4% in the placebo group (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.93).

Secondary outcomes indicated no significant difference in symptomatic transmission rates by day 5, recorded as 5.8% for baloxavir and 7.6% for the placebo group (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.12).

### Oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin combination antiviral therapy versus oseltamivir monotherapy for the treatment of influenza: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 2 trial [^117Wtmer]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Ninety-three percent of participants (583 of 626) reported taking all study drugs on all 5 days, and adherence was similar in both arms: 289 participants (92%) in the combination group and 294 participants (94%) in the oseltamivir group. Six percent (36 participants) partially completed the treatment course (1–4 days), and 1% (6 participants) were lost to follow-up before treatment compliance was assessed.

In the 454 participants in the Efficacy Population, 437 (96%) had a Day 3 virologic endpoint sample available for testing (9 missing in the combination arm and 8 in the oseltamivir arm). In the Efficacy Population, excluding participants from the pilot study, 80 (40.0%) of 200 participants had a detectable virus (i.e. above the PCR limit of detection, LOD) in the combination arm compared to the oseltamivir arm — a difference of 10.0% (95% CI 0.2–19.8, p = 0.046). Similar results were observed when including the participants from the pilot study: 87 of 221 (39.4%) in the combination arm versus 112 of 216 (51.9%) in the oseltamivir arm, a difference of 12.5% (95% CI 3.2–21.8, p = 0.009). This difference between the two arms did not appear to vary by sex (interaction p = 0.74, logistic regression), influenza type (interaction p = 0.23), or country and race (interaction p = 0.062).

At Day 3, the median (quartiles) viral shedding in the Efficacy Population was 3.4 (3.2, 4.2) log10 copies/mL in the combination arm compared to 3.9 (< 3.2, 4.95) log10 copies/mL in the oseltamivir arm (p = 0.004). By Day 7, 54 (13%) of all participants had a detectable virus: 23 (11%) in the combination arm compared to 31 (14%) in the oseltamivir arm (p = 0.24).

### Efficacy of a Russian-backbone live attenuated influenza vaccine among young children in Bangladesh: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111BGi8G]. The Lancet Global Health (2016). Low credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoint was symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection with vaccine-matched strains up to December 2013. The secondary efficacy endpoint was symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection with any influenza virus strain.

- **Safety endpoints**: Included immediate reactions occurring within 30 minutes of taking the vaccine, solicited reactions (nasal congestion, runny nose, ear pain, cough, sore throat, headache, fever, tachypnoea, muscle or joint pain, chills, irritability or decreased activity, and vomiting), and unsolicited adverse events occurring in the first four days after vaccination as assessed by daily home visits, and up to day seven as captured in the clinic. Severity of adverse events was graded as mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening.

- **PDWI definition and severity grading**: PDWI was defined as an illness meeting the physician assessment criteria and characterized by a long, high-pitched whistling or musical sound on expiration heard by auscultation over the lung fields. Severity of PDWI was graded by study physicians as mild (wheezing illness without other findings associated with moderate or greater severity disease), moderate (nasal flaring, chest in-drawing, or pulse oximetry ≥ 90% to < 95%), severe (dyspnoea at rest causing inability to perform usual activities or pulse oximetry < 90%), or life-threatening. This definition was designed to be similar to the definitions of medically important wheezing used in previous trials, and to exclude incidental wheezing illness without other clinically important signs or symptoms.

### Clinical antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019: An open-label, randomized controlled adaptive platform trial (PLATCOV) [^113YH1Yt]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

This study has several limitations. The relationship between the rate of viral clearance and therapeutic efficacy has not been well established, although across tested antiviral interventions, there is a general direct relationship between acceleration of viral clearance and prevention of disease progression, as there is for most acute infections. We intentionally evaluated the COVID-19 antiviral interventions in low-risk adults with high viral burdens in order to optimize the comparative assessment of the different drugs, and not in high-risk patients or the elderly, who are at greatest risk of disease progression. We assessed a 5-day course of remdesivir, although 3-day courses are also licensed in some countries. Another important limitation is that this is an open-label study, which may have led to more withdrawals in the control arm or bias in reporting adverse events or symptoms, although within this small study, there were no safety concerns and the remdesivir was well-tolerated. Time to symptom resolution and time to fever clearance are shown in the Supplementary Figures S4 and S5. The differences do not reach statistical significance.

Remdesivir continues to have a role in the treatment of COVID-19 for certain populations. The simple pharmacometric methodology presented demonstrates the in vivo antiviral efficacy of remdesivir and is readily performed anywhere where accurate qPCR viral quantitation can be performed. Duplicate daily oropharyngeal swabs are well-tolerated over 1 week, whereas daily nasopharyngeal swabbing is not, and they provide viral load measurements.

### Antivirals for treatment of severe influenza: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117KW853]. Lancet (2024). High credibility.

The optimal antiviral drug for the treatment of severe influenza remains unclear. To support updated WHO influenza clinical guidelines, this systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated antivirals for the treatment of patients with severe influenza.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Global Health, Epistemonikos, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials published up to September 20, 2023, that enrolled hospitalised patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed influenza and compared direct-acting influenza antivirals against placebo, standard care, or another antiviral. Pairs of coauthors independently extracted data on study characteristics, patient characteristics, antiviral characteristics, and outcomes, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or by a third coauthor. Key outcomes of interest were time to alleviation of symptoms, duration of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit, progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, hospital discharge destination, emergence of antiviral resistance, adverse events, adverse events related to treatments, and serious adverse events. We conducted frequentist network meta-analyses to summarise the evidence and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

### Relenza [^116eKueX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). High credibility.

The treatment of influenza with Relenza, administered as 10 mg inhaled twice daily for 5 days, has been evaluated in placebo-controlled studies conducted across North America, the Southern Hemisphere, and Europe during their respective influenza seasons. The efficacy varied between studies, possibly due to population-related factors, including the amount of symptomatic relief medication used.

Populations studied consisted of principal Phase III studies that enrolled 1,588 patients aged 12 years and older (median age 34 years, 49% male, 91% Caucasian) with uncomplicated influenza-like illness within 2 days of symptom onset. Influenza was confirmed by culture, hemagglutination inhibition antibodies, or investigational direct tests. Among the 1,164 patients with confirmed influenza, 89% had influenza A, and 11% had influenza B. These studies served as the principal basis for efficacy evaluation, with additional support from more limited Phase II studies where necessary. All patients were randomized to receive either zanamivir or a placebo (inhaled lactose vehicle) and were instructed and supervised by a healthcare professional for the initial dose.

The principal results defined the time to improvement in major symptoms of influenza as the duration until no fever and a self-assessment of "none" or "mild" for headache, myalgia, cough, and sore throat. A Phase II and a Phase III study conducted in North America, encompassing over 600 influenza-positive patients, suggested up to 1 day of shortening of median time to this defined improvement.
