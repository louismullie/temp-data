## Question

Would you add an ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection for a 47-year-old recreational runner with Achilles tendinopathy who is already on a structured exercise program? Why or why not, based on this trial?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to add an ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection for a 47-year-old recreational runner with Achilles tendinopathy who is already on a structured exercise program, and what the evidence shows to support that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether it matches the trial population and intervention. Then, I should verify the trial design, blinding, and outcomes to assess internal validity. Next, I will examine the magnitude and durability of benefit, safety, and how this fits with broader evidence and guidelines. Finally, I will weigh patient-specific factors and outline a practical, risk-mitigated recommendation with shared decision-making points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical match. The patient is a 47-year-old recreational runner with midportion Achilles tendinopathy confirmed on ultrasound and symptoms persisting beyond 3 months, which aligns with the JAMA RCT's inclusion criteria of adults 18–65 with ultrasound-verified midportion tendinopathy and symptoms > 3 months, and a mean age around 46–47 years, so external validity looks reasonable for this case [^117KfNzY] [^113bQn17].

> Wait, let me verify the trial design before trusting the results. The study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial with patient-, physician-, and assessor-blinding, using identical-appearing injections and intention-to-treat analysis, which substantially reduces performance and detection bias. The primary outcome was the VISA-A at 6 months, powered to detect a 10-point between-group difference, which is methodologically sound and strengthens inference [^117KfNzY] [^112zVHZm] [^112u5ugk].

> I will now examine the magnitude and durability of benefit. At 6 months, the corticosteroid plus exercise group improved by a mean 17.7 points more on VISA-A than the placebo plus exercise group (95% CI 8.4–27.0; P < .001), which exceeds the prespecified clinically important difference and persisted at 12 and 24 months, indicating both statistical and clinical significance and sustained benefit over 2 years. Importantly, there was no deterioration at long-term follow-up, which addresses a common concern about steroid-related delayed harm [^113U12mt] [^114xJg9f] [^111oonWW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I need to check adverse events and tendon structure changes. No severe adverse events were observed in either group, including no infections, ruptures, or skin changes, and injection pain was similar between groups. Tendon thickness decreased more in the steroid group at 1–6 months, consistent with structural remodeling rather than atrophy, and the long-term follow-up did not show increased rupture risk, which reassures me about safety under the study's protocolized load management [^11692jCx] [^113U12mt] [^115QgHpU].

> Next, I should review how this fits with the broader evidence base. Historically, corticosteroid monotherapy has shown short-term benefit but poor intermediate/long-term outcomes, whereas this RCT adds steroid to a structured exercise program with strict activity restriction for 3 months, which may explain the sustained gains. By contrast, high-volume injection without steroid added no benefit over placebo when combined with exercise, and PRP has repeatedly failed to outperform placebo in AT, so the positive signal here appears specific to steroid plus exercise under controlled loading, not a generic injection effect [^114q76Ks] [^112QCUnL] [^1165kxZ6] [^116R7dx1].

> But wait, what do guidelines say right now. Contemporary guidelines emphasize exercise as first-line and advise caution with corticosteroids, reflecting older evidence and the historical rupture risk signal with aggressive rehab. However, this RCT is high-quality and guideline-changing in context, so a cautious, protocolized use of ultrasound-guided steroid as an adjunct to exercise — with load control — is reasonable to discuss when symptoms persist despite quality rehabilitation, especially in motivated patients who can adhere to activity restrictions [^115zv7uu] [^114mNGfG] [^112ZAULM].

> I should double-check patient-specific modifiers. The trial excluded BMI > 30, systemic inflammatory disease, prior rupture, and recent prior steroid injection, and it enforced a 3-month moratorium on running and jumping with progressive reloading thereafter. Given this patient's recreational status and presumed ability to comply with load management, the benefit-risk balance is favorable, but I need to ensure we replicate the protocol: ultrasound guidance for accuracy, 1–3 injections as needed over 3 months, and strict adherence to the staged exercise and return-to-run plan to mitigate rupture risk [^117KfNzY] [^112u5ugk] [^115QgHpU].

> Let me consider alternatives and sequencing. If the patient is already improving meaningfully on exercise alone, I would continue without injection. If progress plateaus or pain limits loading, adding a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection with enforced load control is reasonable, and I would avoid exceeding two injections given the absence of added benefit beyond that in the trial and the potential for diminishing returns. I would also avoid injections in patients with high BMI, systemic steroids, or inability to restrict load, and I would counsel that high-volume injection without steroid has not shown added benefit in RCTs [^115QgHpU] [^112QCUnL].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis and adherence to exercise, then, if symptoms persist and the patient understands the need for 3 months of no running/jumping plus progressive reloading, I would offer a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection as an adjunct to the structured program, given the 17.7-point VISA-A advantage at 6 months, sustained benefit to 24 months, and no excess severe adverse events in the RCT. I would document shared decision-making and plan close follow-up to titrate load and monitor for response [^111oonWW] [^113U12mt] [^115QgHpU].

Based on the JAMA RCT [^115QgHpU], **adding an ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection to a structured exercise program** yields a **clinically meaningful 17.7-point improvement** in VISA-A at 6 months [^111oonWW] versus exercise alone, with benefits persisting up to 24 months and no increase in adverse events [^113U12mt]. Given the patient's age and activity level, this adjunct is reasonable if symptoms persist despite optimized loading, with counseling on transient pain flare and the need for strict load management to mitigate rupture risk [^114q76Ks].

---

## Summary of the RCT findings

- **Design**: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 100 adults with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy [^117KfNzY]; all received structured exercise, with half receiving ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection and half placebo [^115QgHpU].

- **Primary outcome**: At 6 months, the steroid group had a 17.7-point greater VISA-A improvement than placebo (95% CI 8.4–27.0; P < .001) [^111oonWW].

- **Durability**: Benefits persisted at 12 and 24 months, with no between-group difference in rupture or other serious adverse events [^113U12mt].

- **Safety**: No significant difference in injection pain or severe adverse events; tendon thickness decreased more in the steroid group without atrophy [^11692jCx].

---

## Clinical relevance for a 47-year-old recreational runner

- **Age and activity**: The trial's mean age was 47, matching this patient; recreational runners are a core population with tendinopathy [^116hC2yE].

- **Symptom duration**: The trial enrolled patients with symptoms > 3 months, aligning with chronic tendinopathy in runners [^117KfNzY].

- **Exercise adherence**: The structured program mirrors best practice, and the steroid was an adjunct, not a substitute, for loading therapy [^112ZAULM].

---

## Potential benefits and risks

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function at 6 months [^111oonWW] | Transient injection pain or flare (managed conservatively) [^11692jCx] |
| Sustained benefits up to 24 months [^113U12mt] | Rare tendon rupture (not increased in this RCT with load control) [^115QgHpU] |
| Reduced tendon thickness without atrophy [^11692jCx] | Need for strict load management and activity modification [^112u5ugk] |

---

## Comparison with other injection therapies

High-volume injection without corticosteroid showed **no added benefit** over placebo when combined with exercise [^112QCUnL], whereas **platelet-rich plasma** has repeatedly failed to outperform placebo in RCTs [^1165kxZ6] [^116R7dx1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines prioritize exercise as first-line; injections are reserved for refractory cases, with **cautious use** of corticosteroids. This RCT supports considering a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection when symptoms persist despite optimized loading, with counseling on risks and load control [^115zv7uu] [^114mNGfG].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Candidate selection**: Persistent symptoms after 3 months of structured loading; no history of Achilles rupture or systemic corticosteroid use [^117KfNzY].

- **Injection technique**: Ultrasound guidance to target the peritendinous space, avoiding intratendinous injection [^111ZsEt6].

- **Post-injection management**: Strict load control (no running/jumping) for 3 months, then gradual, pain-guided progression [^112u5ugk].

- **Follow-up**: Reassess at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months; consider a second injection only if partial response and adherence is confirmed.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The RCT provides **moderate-certainty evidence** that a single ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection added to structured exercise improves pain and function by about 18 points on VISA-A at 6 months, with sustained benefits to 24 months and no excess ruptures under controlled loading. For a 47-year-old recreational runner with persistent symptoms, this adjunct is reasonable after discussing benefits, risks, and the need for strict load management [^115QgHpU] [^113U12mt].

Results

Participants were recruited from April 21, 2016, to September 13, 2018. A total of 100 patients were enrolled and randomized, 52 to exercise therapy and placebo injection (mean age, 46 years [95% CI, 44–48 years]; 32 men [62%]) and 48 to exercise therapy and corticosteroid injection (mean age, 47 years [95% CI, 45–49 years] years; 28 men [58%]). The 2 treatment groups had similar height (mean [SD], 177 [8] cm), weight (mean [SD], 79 [12] kg), and VISA-A score (mean [SD], 46 [18]) at baseline. The baseline characteristics of the 100 patients are presented in Table 1. In the corticosteroid group, 12 patients received 3 injections, 18 patients received 2 injections, and 15 patients received 1 injection, excluding 3 dropouts. In the placebo group, 35 patients received 3 injections, 10 patients received 2 injections, and 3 patients received 1 injection. All but 1 patient complied with the recommendation to refrain from running and jumping in the intervention period.

There were no between-group differences in the dropout rate. Ten patients (10%) dropped out before the 6-month primary end point. Four patients did not start treatment after randomization, 1 patient changed residence, and 5 patients were unable to train. Furthermore, 11 patients (6 in the placebo group and 5 in the corticosteroid group) dropped out (total, 21%) at 12 months, mainly because they were seeking other treatments. The planned 2-year follow-up was performed at 24.7 months after entry for the placebo group and at 24.8 months after entry for the corticosteroid group (range, 22–32 months).

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and often persistent overuse injury, especially in a sports-active population. It is characterized by local tenderness and swelling at the Achilles tendon, which affect an individual's ability to participate in sport and leisure time activities. The prevalence and incidence rate have been reported to be 2.35 and 2.16 cases per 1000 person-years, respectively, in general practice. The lifetime incidence is 50% among elite endurance runners and 6% among sedentary people. Many patients with AT will seek health care, and it is one of the most common tendinopathies in the primary care sector.

The most recent systematic review and network meta-analysissupports the use of exercise therapy in the management of chronic AT, and the effect is superior compared with wait-and-see or passive treatment modalities. Exercise therapy often includes 12 weeks of exercises performed 3 to 4 times per week. The clinical outcomes on pain and function take considerable time to manifest, with a gradual improvement over several weeks to months; however, not all patients recover fully, and residual symptoms often persist. Another treatment option is corticosteroid injection, which as a monotherapy has a documented good short-term clinical outcome in ATbut not in the long term. A reviewfrom 2015 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the routine use of injection therapy in AT and recommended that placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials be conducted.

Preliminary evidence from a single cohort studyindicates that exercise therapy may be combined with corticosteroid injections to achieve both good short-term and long-term outcomes. The data from the cohort, which included 93 consecutive patients, showed that at 6 months 42 patients were symptom free, 29 patients reported good results, and 16 were slightly improved. Overall, 94% of patients improved, highlighting the potential of this combination. The aim of the present randomized clinical trial was to compare exercise therapy and corticosteroid injections with exercise therapy and placebo injections in patients with AT as measured by the patient-reported outcome Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment–Achilles (VISA-A) score after 6 months. We hypothesized that exercise therapy and corticosteroid injections would be associated with larger improvements on the VISA-A compared with exercise therapy and placebo injections.

Key Points

Question

Compared with placebo injections, do ultrasonography-guided corticosteroid injections improve outcomes in adults with Achilles tendinopathy managed with exercise therapy?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 100 patients, statistically and clinically relevant improvement was found in the group receiving exercise therapy combined with corticosteroid injections.

Meaning

In this study, a combination of exercise therapy and corticosteroid injection was more effective than exercise therapy and a placebo injection in the treatment of patients with long-standing Achilles tendinopathy.

Importance

Corticosteroid injections and exercise therapy are commonly used to treat chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy, but the evidence for this combination is limited.

Objective

To investigate the effect of corticosteroid injection and exercise therapy compared with placebo injection and exercise therapy for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a participant-blinded, physician-blinded, and assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial of patients with Achilles tendinopathy verified by ultrasonography. Assessment of pain and function were conducted at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients were recruited from a university medical clinic and a private rheumatology clinic in Denmark between April 2016 and September 2018. Data analysis was performed from June to September 2021.

Interventions

Corticosteroid injection and placebo injection were performed with ultrasonography guidance. Exercise therapy was based on previous trials and consisted of 3 exercises done every second day.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score (range, 1–100, with 100 representing no symptoms) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included pain measured using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale for morning pain and pain during exercise (with higher scores indicating worse pain), global assessment (Likert scale), and tendon thickness.

Results

A total of 100 patients were included, with 52 randomized to placebo (mean age, 46 years [95% CI, 44–48 years]; 32 men [62%]) and 48 randomized to corticosteroid injection (mean age, 47 years [95% CI, 45–49 years]; 28 men [58%]). Patients in the 2 groups had similar height (mean [SD], 177 [8] cm), weight (mean [SD], 79 [12] kg), and VISA-A score (mean [SD], 46 [18]) at baseline. The group receiving exercise therapy combined with corticosteroid injections had a 17.7-point (95% CI, 8.4–27.0 points; P < .001) larger improvement in VISA-A score compared with patients receiving exercise therapy combined with placebo injections at 6 months. No severe adverse events were observed in either group, and there was no deterioration in the long term (2-year follow-up).

Conclusions and Relevance

Corticosteroid injections combined with exercise therapy were associated with better outcomes in the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy compared with placebo injections and exercise therapy. A combination of exercise therapy and corticosteroid injection should be considered in the management of long-standing Achilles tendinopathy.

Statistical Analysis

Data analysis was performed from June to September 2021. There is no established minimal clinically important difference for the VISA-A score for midportion AT, but the minimal clinically important difference for insertion AT is 6 points. This study was powered to detect a between-group difference in the VISA-A score of 10 points at the primary end point at 6 months. On the basis of scores in a previous study, a type I error of 5%, and a type II error of 20% (80% power), it was calculated that 47 patients were needed in each study group. To allow for a 5% potential dropout and a potentially larger SD than previous trials, we increased the sample size to 50 patients per group and included a total of 100 patients. The intention-to-treat principle was used for all analyses.

Analyses were conducted on all outcome measures at entry and at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. A 2-year follow up was planned, but was extended for practical reasons mainly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between-group comparisons of treatment effect for all primary and secondary outcomes were performed with a mixed-effects model with patient as a random effect, and time of assessment, study group, and baseline values of the outcome as fixed effects. To assess for superiority, mean between-group differences in changes from baseline and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated. Q-Q plots were visually examined to ensure that the assumption of normal distribution was not violated prior to conducting the mixed model analysis. Doppler score was analyzed with nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests. Significance was set at 2-sided P < .05. Data were analyzed with GraphPad statistical software version 9.3.1 (Prism).

Primary Outcome: VISA-A Score

The primary analysis showed that the group randomized to corticosteroid injection and exercise therapy had a 17.7-point (95% CI, 8.4–27.0 points; P < .001) larger improvement in VISA-A score from baseline to 6 months follow-up compared with the placebo group (Figure 2). The group receiving corticosteroid injection had a significantly larger improvement across all time points except the 12-month follow-up. Both groups improved over time. Table 2 depicts the exact scores at any time point.

Figure 2.
Primary Outcome

The figure illustrates the primary outcome, improvement in Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles (VISA-A) score from baseline to 6 months and the secondary outcomes of the VISA-A score at other time points (1, 2, 3, 12, and 24 months). Error bars indicate the 95% CIs. Compared with the placebo group, the group randomized to corticosteroid injection and exercise therapy had a 17.7-point (95% CI, 8.4–27.0 points; P < .001) larger improvement in VISA-A score from baseline to 6-month follow-up. The group receiving corticosteroid injection had a significantly larger improvement vs the placebo group across all time points except the 12-month follow-up (all P < .001).

Figure 3.
Tendon Thickness

The figure illustrates the ultrasonography-measured thickness of the Achilles tendon. Error bars indicate the 95% CI. Thickness of the Achilles tendon improved significantly more in the corticosteroid group compared with the placebo group at 1 month (mean difference, 1.9 mm; 95% CI, 1.1–2.6 mm; P < .001), at 2 months (mean difference, 2.2 mm; 95% CI, 1.4–3.0 mm; P < .001), at 3 months (mean difference, 2.2 mm; 95% CI, 1.5–3.0 mm; P < .001), and at 6 months (mean difference, 1.0 mm; 95% CI, 0.1–1.9 mm; P = 0.02).

Adverse Events

A total of 215 injections were administered (87 corticosteroid and 128 placebo). Injection pain was indicated in the patients' diaries, with a mean (SD) pain score of 12 (14) of 100 in the corticosteroid group and 14 (17) of 100 in the placebo group, with no significant differences between groups. No severe adverse events (eg, infection, tendon rupture, subcutaneous depigmentation, or atrophy) were recorded in either of the groups.

### Effectiveness of a high volume injection as treatment for chronic achilles tendinopathy: randomised controlled trial [^117CYXAe]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In our patient and assessor blinded, placebo controlled randomised clinical trial we found that a high volume injection without corticosteroids has no added value to an exercise programme in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. We found no differences in patient reported outcomes between the high volume injection and a placebo injection. Also, no between group differences were found in any of the secondary outcome measures, indicating that a high volume injection does not have mechanistic effects.

The study Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy was published by Finn Johannsen and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Achilles tendinopathy. In the Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy study, the trial question was: what is the role of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection in patients with Achilles tendinopathy? In the Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy study, the population was: 100 patients (40 female, 60 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with ultrasound-verified Achilles tendinopathy for ≥ 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were Achilles tendon rupture or surgery in the symptomatic lower limb; known medical diseases; corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendon pain within the past 6 months; BMI > 30. In the Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy study, the interventions were: n = 48 ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection (1–3 injections of 1 mL methylprednisolone acetate 40 mg/mL and 1 mL lidocaine 10 mg/mL over 3 months plus exercise therapy) n = 52 ultrasound-guided placebo injection (1–3 injections of 1 mL intralipid and 1 mL lidocaine 10 mg/mL over 3 months plus exercise therapy). In the Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in improvement in Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles score at 6 months (39 points vs. 22 points; AD 17.7 points, 95% CI 8.4 to 27). In the Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in improvement in the ultrasound-measured thickness of Achilles tendon at 3 months (2.6 vs. 0.6; AD 2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3) Significant increase in improvement in morning pain on VAS at 2 months (34 points vs. 18 points; AD 15.6 points, 95% CI 2.6 to 28.6). In the Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in injection pain. In the Corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendinopathy study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with ultrasound-verified Achilles tendinopathy for ≥ 3 months, ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection was superior to ultrasound-guided placebo injection with respect to improvement in Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles score at 6 months.

Comparison With Previous Findings

Previous trials have investigated different types of injections for AT, including monotherapy and when combined with, for example, exercise therapy. A recent network meta-analysison all trials investigating injection therapy for AT combined many types of injections (platelet-rich plasma, corticosteroid, high-volume injections, and autologous blood) found that exercise therapy was comparable to injection therapy for midportion tendinopathy. It has also been shown that platelet-rich plasma is not effective compared with placebo injection. This finding suggests that some types of injections (eg, platelet-rich plasma) are unlikely to be effective treatment options for AT, whereas our study suggests that corticosteroid injection is effective when combined with exercise therapy.

In a systematic reviewof corticosteroid injections as treatment for tendinopathy, good short-term (4–8 weeks) but poor intermediate (13–26 weeks) and long-term (≥ 52 weeks) outcomes were reported. However, most of the included studies were of patients with lateral epicondylitis (ie, a non–weight-bearing tendon). Only 1 studyincluded patients with AT treated with 3 corticosteroid injections as monotherapy followed by unrestricted rehabilitation. Importantly, in the present study, all patients were recommended to refrain from all running and jumping activities in the first 3 months (99% complied), and all patients followed a progressive exercise therapy. This could explain the superior effect of corticosteroid injections in both the short and intermediate term (1–6 months), as well as the continued good results in the long term (≥ 1 year) in our study. However, these findings may not necessarily apply to all tendons since corticosteroid injection has not provided an additive effect to exercises for shoulder painor lateral epicondylitis, whereas it has been suggested to have an additive effect in plantar fasciitis. In our study, no severe adverse events associated with the corticosteroid were registered, and the injections were almost pain free. Tendon ruptures after corticosteroid injections are often described in case studies, but in controlled studies only 1 Achilles tendon rupture has previously been reported after 3 corticosteroid injections in patients with AT who underwent aggressive rehabilitation that included running after only a few days. It should be noted that the reduction in tendon size with corticosteroid injection represented a normalization upon a tendinopathy-enlarged tendon, not tendon atrophy. In our study, the patients refrained from running and jumping activities during the first 3 months, but started exercise therapy a few days after the injection.

Mid-substance tendinopathy and enthesopathy can be treated with the same treatment protocol with equal effect.
Ultrasound scanning cannot predict long-term outcome in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
Present heterogeneity or increased flow correlate with present pain in Achilles tendinopathy.

Introduction

Chronic disorders of the Achilles tendon (tendinopathy) are a common overuse injury seen in general practice, with an incidence rate of 2–3 per 1000 registered adult patients. Most (74%) of these patients have midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Runners are most at risk of developing symptoms, with a lifetime risk of 52%. The initial treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is exercise combined with load management. Despite initiation of treatments, two thirds of patients continue to have symptoms at one year follow-up. At 10 years follow-up, about a quarter of patients still have symptoms. About one third of these non-responders eventually require surgery. Therefore, effective conservative treatment options are necessary to improve the outcome of patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy who fail to respond to initial exercise treatment.

The formation of blood vessels (neovascularisation) around and within the tendon is one of the features of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Neovascularisation can be identified in 50–100% of patients with tendon symptoms using Doppler ultrasonography, compared with 0–30% in asymptomatic patients. The infiltration of nerve structures alongside this neovascularisation has been suggested to play a role in the chronicity of pain from Achilles tendinopathy. A large study showed an association between the degree of ultrasonographic Doppler flow and patient reported severity of symptoms.

Consequently, treatments have been developed to target neovascularisation. A novel technique is high volume injection, in which a large amount of fluid is injected into the area surrounding the tendon with the aim of obliterating peritendinous and intratendinous neovascularisation from high mechanical pressure. Current debate is on the addition of corticosteroids to the injection mixture. Recent evidence shows that a high volume injection with corticosteroids is associated with superior short term improvement at 6–12 weeks compared with a high volume injection without corticosteroids, but intermediate term effects are similar. Several cohort studies and one small randomised controlled trial found that a high volume injection (both with and without corticosteroids) resulted in decreased pain and improved function in the short term (6–12 weeks). As a consequence, this treatment is increasingly being used in the clinical setting although its effectiveness has not been tested in a large well designed study. In this study, we compared the effect of a high volume injection without corticosteroids with a placebo injection (both combined with an exercise programme) on pain and functional outcome at 24 weeks in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

Trial governance

A trial management group (TMG) will be convened and meet up to quarterly. In addition to this, a data safety management board (DSMB) and a trial steering committee (TSC) will also be convened. The TMG is composed of the research team and will meet quarterly to oversee trial management. The DSMB will include an independent multidisciplinary group consisting of two biostatisticians and clinical experts (injection and exercise), who will monitor the safety and compliance issues related to the trial. The TSC will include a core member of the TMG, expert clinicians (injections and exercise), and at least one lay representative and will be responsible for issues such as recruitment, trial management and safety concerns. The TSC and DSMB will meet once to twice a year. The first review of safety (undertaken by the full TMG) will occur when 20 participants have completed the 12-week assessment and then every 6 months until the conclusion of the trial.

Patient and public involvement

Patients will be involved in the trial TSC from inception and will have a role in developing the research design, outcome measures and recruitment strategy.

Limitations

The radiologist is not blind to the sham interventions, but we will implement measures including a standardised script to ensure that all participants have comparable interventions with this caregiver. It is possible that people who have had a corticosteroid injection close to 3 months ago and up to a year prior may still have long-term adverse events from this injection that influences our findings. These effects are likely to be equal across groups given the randomisation process. A potential limitation to external validity is the single-centre design; however, this is appropriate for the efficacy paradigm adopted in this trial.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and disabling musculoskeletal condition. First-line management involving Achilles tendon loading exercise with, or without, other modalities may not resolve the problem in up to 44% of cases. Many people receive injections. Yet there are no injection treatments with demonstrated long-term efficacy. The aim of the trial is to examine the 12-month efficacy of high-volume injection (HVI) with corticosteroid and HVI without corticosteroid versus sham injection among individuals with AT.

Methods and analysis

The trial is a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind, superiority randomised controlled trial that will assess the efficacy of HVI with and without corticosteroid versus sham up to 12 months. We will block-randomise 192 participants to one of the three groups with a 1:1:1 ratio, and both participants and outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation. All participants will receive an identical evidence-based education and exercise intervention. The primary outcome measure will be the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment – Achilles (VISA-A) at 12 months post-randomisation, a validated, reliable and disease-specific measure of pain and function. Choice of secondary outcomes was informed by core outcome domains for tendinopathy. Data will be analysed using the intention-to-treat principle.

Ethics and dissemination

Ethics approval was obtained via the Monash University Human Ethics Committee (no: 13138). The study is expected to be completed in 2024 and disseminated via peer review publication and conference presentations.

Methods

Study Design

This was a 2-group, 2-site trial and a patient-blinded, investigator-blinded, and assessor-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled randomized superiority trial (see study protocol in Supplement 1). It was approved by the Greater Copenhagen Ethical Committee. Patients were included from a university clinic (Institute of Sports Medicine, University of Copenhagen) and from a local private rheumatology clinic between April 2016 and September 2018. The reporting of the study complies with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Patients

All consecutive patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria were offered participation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patient-reported insidious onset of pain in the Achilles tendon region that was aggravated by weight-bearing activities and was worse in the morning and/or during the initial phases of weight-bearing activities; (2) pain and swelling located 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion; (3) musculoskeletal ultrasonography imaging of the Achilles tendon showing local thickening (anterior-posterior) of more than 7 mm or more than 20% larger compared with the asymptomatic side; (4) Achilles tendon pain for more than 3 months; (5) and age between 18 and 65 years.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) previous Achilles tendon surgery in the symptomatic lower limb; (2) known medical diseases (eg, diabetes or inflammatory rheumatic diseases); (3) previous corticosteroid injection for Achilles tendon pain within the past 6 months; (4) previous Achilles tendon rupture in the symptomatic lower limb; (5) body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) greater than 30; (6) pregnant or planning pregnancy; and (7) injury or abnormality of the foot, knee, hip, and/or back or any condition that may interfere with participation in the study. We examined 317 patients, and 153 did not fulfill the inclusion criteria, mainly because of other diagnoses (involvement of other tendons, heel fat pad, plantar fascia, or neuropathic pain), especially enthesopathy-bursitis (63 patients). An additional 64 patients were excluded for other reasons mainly related to other abnormalities or medical diseases that interfered with the treatment protocol. Details are depicted in Figure 1.

### Efficacy of high-volume injections with and without corticosteroid compared with sham for achilles tendinopathy: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^112xcQWN]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Methods and analysis

Study design

This is is a three-arm, parallel group, double-blind, superiority randomised controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up. Participants will be block-randomised into sham injection, HVI with corticosteroid or HVI without corticosteroid groups with a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants and outcome assessors will be blinded to treatment allocation. All participants will receive an identical evidence-based education and exercise intervention, which removes ethical concerns of withholding treatment. This protocol is reported in accordance with the 2013 SPIRIT guidelines.

Setting

The trial is based in a large radiology clinic in central Melbourne, Australia (Imaging at Olympic Park (IOP)). This setting in a central location allows implementation of a previously successful strategy to recruit people with AT from throughout metropolitan Melbourne, and there is a large network of physiotherapists, sports physicians and surgeons who usually refer people with AT to IOP.

Sample size

The sample size was determined based on our primary endpoint, the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment – Achilles (VISA-A) scale (0–100 points). Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) has not been determined for midportion AT, but prior trials have estimated MCID to be 10 points. Based on our preliminary data, we assume a 10-point benefit of HVI compared with sham at 12 months. Assuming a SD from our preliminary trial of 15.6,51 participants per group will provide 80% power to detect a 10-point difference between any of the three trial arms (type I error rate split to 1.67% for each of the three comparisons). We will recruit 64 participants per trial arm to allow for attrition of up to 20% at 12 months.

Eligibility criteria

Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in table 1.

Table 1
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Recruitment and retention

Recruitment channels include an advertising campaign in local newspapers, flyers advertising the trial placed at local community and sporting clubs, retirement villages and senior citizen centres, via a large network of clinical partners who refer people with AT to IOP, and via a paid social media campaign, including Facebook and Twitter. To improve retention, participants receive a $A100 shopping voucher on completion of 26-week and 52-week outcomes to reimburse them for costs incurred (time and travel).

### Terminating corticosteroid injection in tendinopathy? Hasta la vista, baby [^113LjquT]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Two recent randomized-controlled trials showed promising results of local corticosteroid injections combined with exercise therapy for Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciopathy. Should clinicians go back to using corticosteroid injections to treat tendinopathy? Are corticosteroids back (baby)? In this viewpoint we critically appraise the new evidence and humbly share our clinical reasoning when advising athletes about corticosteroid injections in practice. Our goal is to help clinicians decide what to do and what to recommend to patients. We prioritize the risk for higher recurrence rates and tendon rupture when weighing the reasonable treatment options for tendinopathy, and recommend against using corticosteroid injections. The best systematic review evidence shows that local corticosteroid injections are not effective for tendinopathies after the first few weeks, and produce worse long-term outcomes compared to other treatments. For now, we consider corticosteroid injections remain terminated. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(11):1–4. Epub: 28 July 2023. doi:10.2519/jospt.2023.11875.

Randomization and Masking

After providing written informed consent, the patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups with a 1:1 allocation as per a computer-generated randomization schedule (MinimPy version 2010; M. Saghaei) using permuted blocks of random sizes (2 to 6). The primary investigator (F.J.), assessors (F.J. J.L.O. and T.F.O.), and administrator (not a coauthor of this article) of the randomization procedure were blinded to block sizes to ensure allocation concealment. After recruitment and baseline measurements, an independent office employee at the department (not a coauthor of this article) administered the allocation procedure and gave all patients consecutive research numbers. The allocation sequence was stored on a computer drive with exclusive access only for the responsible office employee. Only this employee and the pharmacist (not a coauthor of this article) who prepared the solution for injection were aware of the allocation group but did not have any contact with the patient during treatment and assessments.

Three medical practitioners (F.J. J.L.O. and T.F.O.) with a specialization in rheumatology performed the baseline and follow-up assessments. They were blinded to the content of the injection because the 2 types of injections were visually identical and had similar viscosity and the placebo injection was added with lipid emulsion for intravenous nutrition. Furthermore, the syringe was enclosed by nontransparent tape only showing the patient's research number. The blinding was maintained until the last patient completed the last follow-up assessment, and the statistical calculation was performed. Data entry and the statistical analysis were performed blinded by independent investigators (A.S.J. M.S.R. and P.S.M.) not involved in the patient treatment and without knowledge of the treatment groups.

Procedures

Patients in both groups had appointments with a physician (F.J. J.L.O. or T.F.O.) at study entry and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The first 3 months were defined as the intervention period, when exercise therapy and the injections (both corticosteroid and placebo) took place. The patients were asked to refrain from jumping activity and running for the first 3 months. After the 3 months, they were encouraged to slowly return to their normal sports participation with Achilles tendon pain guiding their progression.

### Efficacy of high-volume injections with and without corticosteroid compared with sham for achilles tendinopathy: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^114adwST]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Achilles tendon loading exercise is recommended as a first-line treatment for Achilles tendinopathy in clinical practice guidelines and expert narratives. However, up to 44% of people may not respond to exercise treatments for AT. Up to 60% of people with AT have continued pain and disability after 5 years despite exercise interventions, and 48% will seek additional treatment including injections and surgery.

There are currently no injection treatments with demonstrated long-term efficacy. Corticosteroid injections demonstrate short-term efficacy in improving tendinopathy pain and function, but there is well-documented symptom recurrence in the longer term. Other injections in clinical use for AT, including polidocanol, aprotinin and platelet-rich plasma injections, have been shown to be no more effective than placebo or sham, although a network meta-analysis found benefits compared with wait-and-see. An injection option that demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo or sham is likely to reduce the substantial and long-standing pain and disability, as well as costs associated with managing AT.

Abstract

Objective

To study whether a high volume injection without corticosteroids improves clinical outcome in addition to usual care for adults with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

Patient and assessor blinded, placebo controlled randomised clinical trial.

Setting

Sports medicine department of a large district general hospital, the Netherlands.

Participants

80 adults (aged 18–70 years) with clinically diagnosed chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy and neovascularisation on ultrasonography. 39 were randomised to a high volume injection without corticosteroids and 41 to placebo.

Interventions

Participants were instructed to perform an exercise programme for 24 weeks (usual care) combined with one 50 mL high volume injection of saline and lidocaine (intervention group) or one 2 mL placebo injection of saline and lidocaine (placebo group) at baseline.

Main outcome measures

Primary outcome was pain and function assessed using the validated Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire at 24 weeks (analysed using a generalised estimation equations model). Secondary outcomes were patient satisfaction, return to sport, degree of ultrasonographic Doppler flow, visual analogue scale on 10 hop test, power and flexibility of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, pain detect questionnaire for neuropathic pain, and pain coping inventory. Participants were evaluated at baseline and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks.

Results

Only one participant (1%) was lost to follow-up. The estimated mean VISA-A score improved significantly, from 40.4 (95% confidence interval 32.0 to 48.7) at baseline to 59.1 (50.4 to 67.8) at 24 weeks in the high volume injection group and from 36.9 (27.1 to 46.8) to 58.5 (47.9 to 69.1) in the placebo group. The VISA-A score over time did not differ between the groups (adjusted between group difference at 24 weeks 0.5 points, 95% confidence interval −17.8 to 18.8). No significant between group differences were found for patient satisfaction (21/37 (57%) v 19/39 (49%) patients, P = 0.50) and return to desired sport (15/29 (52%) v 19/31 (61%) patients active in sports, P = 0.65) at 24 weeks. None of the other secondary outcomes differed between the two groups.

Conclusions

A high volume injection without corticosteroids in addition to usual care is not effective for symptom reduction in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. On the basis of our findings, we cannot recommend the use of a high volume injection in this patient group.

Strengths and limitations of this study

The strength of our study is that we performed this randomised clinical trial according to the current consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) guideline. The patients, outcome assessor, and statistician were all blinded to the intervention, and only one participant was lost to follow-up. Despite our robust research design, our study also has some methodological limitations. Firstly, it was not feasible to blind the doctor who performed the injection procedure at baseline. As this doctor was not involved in the treatment allocation (randomisation), follow-up of participants, or data analysis, this probably did not influence study outcomes. Secondly, the lack of a group that only performed an exercise programme (without injection) might be regarded as limitation. We do not know whether the improvement of symptoms over time in both groups is a consequence of the exercise programme, a promoted healing response after the injection procedure, a placebo effect from the injection procedure, or represents the clinical course of Achilles tendinopathy. Thirdly, a high volume injection is a technically demanding and specific procedure. A single sports medicine doctor with extensive experience in injection procedures performed the interventions. Test sessions were carried out before the start of the study according to instructions provided by experts in high volume injections. Intratendinous Doppler flow disappeared in 79% of the patients in the high volume injection group compared with 30% in the placebo group, indicating success with the high volume injection.

Conclusion

In patients with a chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy, a high volume injection without corticosteroids did not result in a beneficial effect in addition to an exercise programme. On the basis of these findings, we cannot recommend the use of a high volume injection in this patient group.

Outcome measures

Outcomes are either self-report or performed by appropriately trained researchers or ultrasonographer blinded to the treatment allocation. Outcome assessment will occur at baseline, 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks (see figure 3). All follow-ups will occur at the same imaging facility as baseline assessment. All data collected will be pseudoanonymised (retaining code file) and stored on a secure cloud-based server. Participants will complete self-report outcomes in relation to their most symptomatic Achilles tendon if they have bilateral AT.

Primary outcome: Pain and function will be assessed with the VISA-A, a well-validated, reliable and disease-specific tool. This outcome includes pain, function and activity domains that are clinically relevant to patients with AT. Scores range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no symptoms or function/activity limitations. The final two question of the VISA-A were designed for sporting populations and will be modified in our study to relate to our mixed sporting and non-sporting population. Question 7 will be modified from "Are you currently undertaking sport or other physical activity?" to "Are you currently undertaking sport or other physical activity, including walking?". Question 8 asks about pain and disability during Achilles tendon loading sport. 'Achilles tendon loading sport' will be changed to 'weight-bearing activity'. Both versions of question 8 will be included so that responsiveness of both versions of the VISA-A can be evaluated.
Secondary outcomes: Achilles tendon thickness and Doppler signal: assessed with ultrasound imaging using reliable methods. Doppler signal will be assessed by quantifying pixel count. This outcome is important to assess whether tendon adaptation and change in Doppler signal is a potential mechanism of the HVI. The Global Rating of Change Scale: an 11-point scale in which the participant is asked to rate their perceived overall change in their AT condition from the time that they began the study until the present, as Worse, No Change or Better. If they indicate worse, the patient will then be asked how much worse on a 5-point scale from Very Much Worse to Slightly Worse, and if they are better, they will be asked how much better on a 5-point scale from Slightly Better to Very Much Better. Overall pain intensity: measured using the 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), participants will rate the worst pain during the last week (zero = no pain; 100 = worst pain possible). Health-related quality of life: measured with the EQ-5D-5L, a validated and reliable tool, including five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), and a rating of overall health state from 0 (worst health state imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable health state) using a VAS. The level of physical activity in the previous week: evaluated using the 7-day Recall Physical Activity Questionnaire, a valid and reliable tool. Participants will be asked to recall time spent sleeping and doing physical activity (work, leisure, household activities) over the past 7 days. Fear avoidance and catastrophising: the Tampa Kinesiophobia Scaleand Pain Catastrophising Scalesare validated questionnaires used to measure fear avoidance and pain catastrophising, respectively. Pain self-efficacy: assessed with the pain self-efficacy questionnaire (PSEQ). The PSEQ measures how confident a patient is in undertaking a range of activities despite their pain. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and rate of force development (RFD): seated calf raise RFD and MVIC. Standard strength (MVIC and RFD) tests will be performed on a custom chair equipped with a force plate that measures plantarflexor force. Participants will have an adequate warm-up (10 repetitions of calf raises with the knee bent and knee straight) and then perform 4 practice and 2 recorded trials. The instructions will be "push as hard and fast as possible".
Other secondary outcomes: selected outcomes will be assessed at every 6 weeks from weeks 6 to 52 via online questionnaire (if not coinciding with an assessment visit time).

Post-injection treatment

Immediately after the injection, an appropriately trained researcher (figure 1) who is blind to treatment allocation will deliver identical education and a 12-week exercise programme to all participants (see table 2 Figure 3), based on prior HVI work. This includes an evidence-based and progressively loaded exercise protocol for AT, education about physical activity modification and resumption, and advice about progressing and regressing exercise load, based on a pain monitoring model. The researcher will also provide education about AT (pathology, pain, risk factors, prognosis, treatments, recovery times) and post-injection advice. The information provided to patients (in printed form) at baseline is shown in online supplemental file 1 and the exercise videos provided are shown in online supplemental file 2. Participants will be reviewed by the researcher on four follow-up occasions — 1 week (brief phone call to check post-injection response and whether exercise was commenced), 2 weeks via teleconference and 6 weeks in person (modify the exercise as required, eg, progress load, modify technique), and at 12 weeks — to provide evidence-based advice about continuing exercise beyond the intervention period.

To ensure participants are supported and to optimise uptake of the 12-week exercise programme, they will be able to email or call the researchers with questions and will be provided with custom-produced basic online exercise videos and education. Participants will be advised to refrain from using other physical therapy interventions and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications but will be allowed to take paracetamol (up to 4 g/day) for pain relief as required.

Intervention fidelity

The fidelity of each intervention (injections, education and exercise) will be monitored at regular intervals (at least every 8 to 10 injections (minimum of 19 assessments throughout the trial)) by a member of the trial management group who is not involved in data collection or analysis. Radiologists and physiotherapists delivering the treatment will be provided with feedback and strategies to improve fidelity as appropriate.

### 10-year follow-up after standardised treatment for achilles tendinopathy [^112FZiZP]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common and often long-lasting injury. We present a 10-year follow-up on a pragmatic study on Achilles tendinopathy treated with controlled exercises supplemented with corticosteroid injections if necessary in order to continue training.

Methods

All patients who completed the original study (n = 93) were invited for a 10-year follow-up. 83% participated. Patients were evaluated with ultrasound scanning (n = 58) and with a questionnaire (n = 77) using the same outcome measures as in the primary study. The 10-year overall outcome on a 4-point scale (excellent, good, fair, poor), other treatments and adverse event and present activity level were recorded.

Results

Excellent outcome was reported in 63% and good outcome in 27%. 76% reported an activity level at 75%–100% of preinjury level. The average Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles score for all patients was 84 (SD 19). 16% had surgery. Three ruptures occurred 5–8 years after the primary study. The improvement from entry to 6 months in the primary study was maintained until 10-year follow-up. Insertional tendinopathy did not differ from mid-substance tendinopathy in any outcome measure (short term and long term). We encountered no prognostic markers on ultrasound for the long-term outcome; however, present heterogeneity and increased flow resemble present pain. Thickened tendons seem to maintain their thickness despite improvement of symptoms.

Conclusion

One to two corticosteroid injections are a safe and effective supplement to controlled exercises in the treatment of Achilles tendon pain with no signs of deterioration in the very long term. Mid-substance and insertional tendinopathies benefit equally from this treatment.

Adverse event: an adverse event is defined as any unfavourable or unintended diagnosis, sign, symptom, or disease associated with the study which may or may not be related to the intervention (eg, tendon rupture, fall, injury or change in medical status) and prevents participation in the intervention for at least seven consecutive days. Participants will record what each adverse event was (eg, tendon rupture), impact on their ability to undertake the intervention and for how long.

Serious adverse events: defined as an event related or not related to the intervention that results in death, life-threatening complication, hospitalisation, surgery, permanent or temporary physical disability, congenital abnormalities, or any findings the CI and/or research team feel can lead to significant health hazards. Examples of serious adverse events include but are not limited to surgery for tendon rupture and heart attack requiring overnight hospitalisation.

Reporting of adverse events

If the adverse event is not defined as serious, the adverse event is recorded in the trial file and the participant is followed up by the research team. All serious adverse events will be recorded in the participant's trial file and reported to the chief investigator immediately. The chief investigator will let the trial sponsor know within 24 hours, as well as data monitoring, trial management and steering committees (described later).

Action plan for addressing adverse events

If the adverse event occurs at the trial setting (IOP, Melbourne), then the centre policy for adverse events will be followed. If the adverse event occurs outside the trial setting, then the participants will be advised to see their GP or go to the emergency department for appropriate management. All the treatment costs will be covered by the sponsor's insurance.

b. Exercise adherence: participants will record the number of exercise sessions completed each week over the previous 4 weeks (adherence is the percentage of prescribed sessions that are completed). Adherence will be categorised as (i) poor, < 25%; (ii) moderate, 25% to 50%; (iii) good, > 50% to 75%; or (iv) excellent, > 75%. Exercise adherence will be measured at 6 and 12 weeks.
c. Healthcare use: Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule data will be extracted to measure use of subsidised healthcare services. The use of other health service and co-interventions will be measured by asking for a yes/no response followed by a phone call.

### 10-year follow-up after standardised treatment for achilles tendinopathy [^115dcztn]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and often long-lasting injury. There are many recommended conservative treatment modalities for AT, meaning no one is really excellent. Eccentric exercises are often recommended, with reported improvement in 60%to 90%. Malliaras et al found that there was no clear evidence that favoured eccentric exercises over eccentric/concentric exercises. Beyer et al found that heavy slow resistance exercise three times a week was as good as daily eccentric exercises. Other studies have shown the effect of stretching exercises. Fredberg et al found good short-term effect of peritendinous injection of corticosteroid (CS), but an aggressive rehabilitation resulted in a relapse after 6 months. These randomised clinical efficacy trials have been performed by highly motivated physiotherapists and investigators seeking high compliance on selected motivated patients agreeing in supervised training, and it is doubtful that the same success rate can be achieved on all patients.

Some studies have looked at the very long-term follow-up (5–8 years). At 5 years Silbernagel et al reported 65% were symptom-free, whereas van der Plas et al found only 39.7% without symptoms, and Paavola et al reported 59% symptom-free after 8 years.

In 2004/2005 we performed a pragmatic study on all consecutive patients with AT being referred to one of two outpatient rheumatology clinics in Copenhagen, Denmark during a 10-month period. All patients were treated with the same treatment regimen regardless of the location of tendinopathy: reduced running and jumping activities, concentric/eccentric exercises, calf stretching, and if training was impossible due to too severe pain supplemented with one to three ultrasound-guided CS injections (1 mL Lidocaine 10 mg/mL and 1 mL methylprednisolone acetate 40 mg/mL) in order to continue the training. Twenty-four succeeded with training alone, 54 had one CS injection, 13 had two CS injections and 2 had three CS injections. At follow-up after 6 months, 94% had improved and 76% were symptom-free or had only slight symptoms. Bakkegaard et al have described the ultrasound scanning (US) findings in that study and found that heterogeneity, defined as clearly demarcated hypoechoic or hyperechoic areas within the tendon at the initial examination, was found to be a prognostic marker for poor clinical outcome at 6 months.

Statistical methods

Data will be double entered to minimise errors and coded to ensure blinding of the statistician undertaking the analyses. In participants with bilateral symptoms, the most symptomatic side (or the right side if they cannot define the more symptomatic side) will be analysed to maintain independence of data. Statistical tests will be two-tailed with statistical significance level set at 0.0167 for each of the three pairs of comparisons of trial arms. We will also analyse the primary outcome with alpha set at 0.05 and provide this as a supplemental file for future systematic reviewers. All randomised patients will be included in the analysis (ie, intention-to-treat) for primary and secondary outcomes (except for safety outcomes). We will also undertake secondary per-protocol analyses. Demographic characteristics (eg, age, gender) and other baseline measurements (eg, duration of symptoms) will be reported by treatment arm. Between-group differences in the primary and secondary outcomes measures will be compared at 12, 26 and 52 weeks, with the primary outcome being at 52 weeks. Continuously scored outcome measures will be analysed using linear mixed models with adjustments for baseline scores and variables that are found to influence the outcome. Ordinal scaled data will be analysed using non-parametric tests and modelled with proportional odds regression adjusted for repeated assessment of subjects. Dichotomous outcome measures will be compared using relative risk, risk difference and number needed to treat using generalised estimating equations. Sensitivity to missing data will be assessed using multiple imputation models incorporating predictive baseline and post-baseline variables.

Economic analysis

Alongside the main trial, there will be a parallel, trial-based cost-utility analysis. This economic analysis will consider the incremental cost of each of the intervention conditions compared with the sham for gaining one quality-adjusted life year. Quality-adjusted life years will be calculated using an area under the curve approach on EQ-5D-5L utility scores collected at each assessment. These scores will be generated using the Dolan cross-walk approach. A societal perspective will be taken by calculating healthcare and productivity costs incurred by participants. Valuation of health services costs will be based on standard rates published by the Australian government (National Weighted Activity Unit costs for hospitalisations (The Independent Hospital Pricing Authority website,), Medical Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule prices for other subsidised health costs, market prices for other costs). Bootstrap resampling will be used to generate CIs for cost-utility estimates and for construction of acceptability curves. One-way sensitivity analyses will also be conducted to examine the impact of variation in key analysis inputs.

Exercise programme

The blinded outcome assessor (AV) instructed all the participants to perform a daily calf muscle exercise programme using detailed written information and videos. The exercise programme was based on an existing protocol, consisting of three consecutive phases: isometric exercises, concentric exercises, and eccentric exercises. The participants were asked to start the next phase if exercises could be performed for one week with acceptable symptoms (visual analogue scale score of ≤ 3/10 in activities and in daily life). If eccentric exercises could be performed without problems for at least one week, the participants continued with the return to sports module. This module consisted of four phases: simple plyometric exercises, fast plyometric exercises, a gradual increase in running, and interval training (if necessary for the type of sports). Web appendix 1 provides detailed information on the exercise programme and return to sport module.

All the participants were advised to refrain from weightbearing sporting activities for at least five weeks. The exercises and activities should be performed with only mild pain (maximum score of 3 on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 maximum pain), and the participants were advised to decrease the activity level when the pain increased to more than 3 points during or after the activity or when morning stiffness increased one day after the activity compared with the previous days. The participants were then instructed to decrease their activity until symptoms had returned to an acceptable level. They were discouraged from using other treatments for their Achilles tendinopathy.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was the Dutch version of the VISA-A questionnaire. This validated and disease specific questionnaire quantifies pain and activity levels, with scores ranging from 0 to 100: 100 indicates no pain with full activity level, with the score decreasing with increasing severity of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were patient satisfaction, return to sport, degree of ultrasonographic Doppler flow, visual analogue scale on 10 hop test, power and flexibility of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, pain detect questionnaire, and pain coping inventory. Patient satisfaction was scored as moderate or poor or as excellent or good. Return to sport was scored as no return to the desired sport or return to the desired sport (regardless of reaching pre-injury level). All outcome measures were assessed at baseline (before intervention) and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks.

### Efficacy of high-volume injections with and without corticosteroid compared with sham for achilles tendinopathy: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^116knrNr]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

AT is common and disabling. As many as up to 44% of people with AT fail to recover with conservative first-line treatmentand are offered other treatments including injections. Despite the common use of injections, there are currently no injection treatments for AT with demonstrated efficacy. Although corticosteroid injections have demonstrated short-term efficacy, there may be recurrence of symptoms for some people in the longer term. The lack of an efficacious injection for AT may prolong disability for many people who are affected and significantly increase healthcare use and costs. HVI may be an effective treatment for AT but has not been adequately tested. The proposed trial will address this knowledge gap by evaluating the efficacy of the HVI with and without corticosteroid versus sham for AT over 12 months. This research has the potential to enhance recovery of patients thereby improving clinical outcomes and reduce societal costs by reducing failed injection treatments and ongoing disability.

### 10-year follow-up after standardised treatment for achilles tendinopathy [^113LzoCA]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Corticosteroid in AT

We have described the long-term effect of a treatment regimen for AT consisting of reduced loading, slowly progressive concentric and eccentric strengthening exercises, stretching exercises, supplemented with one to three CS injections if patients were unable to commence or progress in exercise. We have previously described the short-medium term (6 months) effectiveness of this treatment and found that 94% improved, and 77% with good or excellent effect. In the present study 90% reported excellent or good results after 10 years. This is in contrast to a study by Fredberg et al, who describe a poor outcome after CS injection after 6 months. A meta-analysis on CS injections for tendinopathy in general also confirms poor outcome in the long term. This could be due to the fact that most randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies on CS injections mainly use a single CS injection as monotherapy, whereas we used one to three CS injections as a supplement and only if necessary in order to proceed with a cautious and slowly progressive training protocol. Therefore it seems that CS might reduce warning signals and lead to too quick training progression, if training is not controlled by a cautious protocol.

Our very long-term results are comparable with other long-term follow-up studies. Paavola et al described an observational 8-year follow-up study on patients treated for AT with many different kinds of treatments including one to three CS injections and found 94% had good or excellent results. Silbernagel et al did a 5-year follow-up on an efficacy RCT including specific eccentric training for AT and reported 65% were symptom-free, whereas van der Plas et al on a similar study group found only 39.7% without symptoms at 5-year follow-up. In the present study 63% were symptom-free.

All outcome measures in our primary study were significantly improved, and this was maintained at 10-year follow-up. However the group of patients receiving two CS injections had significantly poorer outcome at 10 years in morning pain and pain during function, although not in VISA-A score compared with the other groups. Also we found that only this group showed a significant increase in tendon thickness from 6 months to 10 years. A higher proportion of patients receiving CS underwent surgery compared with the group without an injection.

This might be due to a deleterious effect of CS reducing collagen synthesis, but can most probably be explained by the fact that patients who were offered CS injections in our study had more severe AT.

### Management of chronic tendon injuries [^116g6go7]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic tendon injuries present unique management challenges. The assumption that these injuries result from ongoing inflammation has caused physicians to rely on treatments demonstrated to be ineffective in the long term. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be limited in the treatment of these injuries. Corticosteroid injections should be considered for temporizing pain relief only for rotator cuff tendinopathy. For chronic Achilles tendinopathy (symptoms lasting longer than six weeks), an intense eccentric strengthening program of the gastrocnemius/ soleus complex improved pain and function between 60 and 90 percent in randomized trials. Evidence also supports eccentric exercise as a first-line option for chronic patellar tendon injuries. Other modalities such as prolotherapy, topical nitroglycerin, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, therapeutic ultrasound, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and low-level laser therapy have less evidence of effectiveness but are reasonable second-line alternatives to surgery for patients who have persistent pain despite appropriate rehabilitative exercise.

### The achilles tendon: imaging diagnoses and image-guided interventions-expert panel narrative review [^1162boti]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Achilles tendon is commonly affected by both chronic repetitive overuse and traumatic injuries. Achilles tendon injuries can potentially affect any individual but have a particularly high incidence in professional athletes. Appropriate imaging evaluation and diagnosis are paramount to guiding appropriate management. In this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review, we discuss the role of various imaging modalities (particularly ultrasound and MRI) in the assessment of Achilles tendon pathology, focusing on the modalities' relative advantages and technical considerations. We describe the most common diagnoses affecting the Achilles tendon and adjacent structures, highlighting key imaging findings and providing representative examples. Various image-guided interventions that may be used in the management of Achilles tendon pathology are also reviewed, including high-volume injection, tendon fenestration, prolotherapy, and corticosteroid injection. The limited evidence supporting such interventions are summarized, noting an overall paucity of large-scale studies showing benefit. Finally, a series of consensus statements by the panel on imaging and image-guided intervention for Achilles tendon pathology are provided.

Patient satisfaction — No significant difference was found in patient satisfaction between the treatment groups at 24 weeks (P = 0.50). In the high volume injection group, 21/37 patients (57%) reported an excellent or good outcome compared with 19/39 (49%) in the placebo group.

Return to desired sport — No significant difference was found for return to the desired sport at 24 weeks (P = 0.65). In the high volume injection group, 15/29 (52%) patients returned to their desired sport compared with 19/31 (61%) in the placebo group. Of these participants, only 4/29 (14%) returned to their pre-injury level in the high volume injection group and 5/31 (16%) in the placebo group.

Web appendix 2 shows the results of the other secondary outcome measures. No significant between group differences were found for any of these outcome measures.

Clinical implications

These findings are important and clinically relevant, as high volume injections have become increasingly popular after several non-blinded case series and one cohort study showed an improvement in pain during activities at intermediate term follow-up (30–52 weeks). These findings exceeded the improvement known from eccentric exercises. As previous high volume injection studies were only performed in non-responders to eccentric training, this treatment gained even more attention. Surprisingly, large improvements (38 points on the VISA-A score) after a high volume injection were already seen in the short term (three weeks). This indicates a rapid decrease in symptoms of Achilles tendinopathy when a high volume injection is given. A recent blinded randomised controlled trial with a small sample size (n = 19 in each treatment group) confirmed these findings, in which patient reported outcomes improved significantly more in the high volume injection group at the six week follow-up compared with the placebo group. This improvement had slightly decreased at the 24 week follow-up. Improvement in VISA-A score was lower than expected in the placebo group at 24 weeks, thereby raising the possibility of unsuccessful blinding of the participants. In our large study, we did not find any beneficial effect of the high volume injection in either the short term (2 or 6 weeks) or the intermediate term (12 or 24 weeks). An important difference between our study and previous studies investigating high volume injections, is that we did not use corticosteroids in the injection mixture. The hypothesis is that the saline solution in the injection mechanically damages the neovascularisation and its adjacent nerves. Corticosteroids are discouraged as treatment for tendinopathies owing to detrimental long term effects and the risk of ruptures to the Achilles tendon. Therefore, we decided not to include corticosteroids in the injection mixture. This could explain the difference in outcomes between our study and previous studies. We hypothesise that a high volume injection does not have a mechanical pain reducing effect but that the short term improvement as seen in previous studies might have been related to the corticosteroids. The previous randomised controlled trial evaluating the high volume injection supports this hypothesis, since short term outcome exceeded the long term outcome. This is a typical course after treatment with a corticosteroid injection. In studies that did not use corticosteroids in the injection mixture, comparable results to ours were seen at 12–24 weeks. The clinical improvement in symptoms of Achilles tendinopathy for both treatment arms in our study is similar to that reported in a recent meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of treatment using heavy load eccentric calf muscle exercise, and in a comparable population included at our research centre in which standalone exercise treatment was provided. The difference in the form of exercise programmes is not likely to have influenced the results, because no evidence suggests that one form of exercise training is superior to another. Improvement could additionally be explained by the placebo effect, patient education, load management, and the clinical course of the disorder. Our findings indicate that an exercise programme, patient education, and load management are still beneficial in patients with no previous improvement during calf muscle exercise training. We would therefore advice all patients to continue an exercise programme as the basis of their treatment.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Advise active treatment.

Treatment should be provided by a healthcare provider who is sufficiently qualified (medical or paramedical healthcare provider).

Discuss the initial active treatment options together with the patient. Start treatment of midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy with:

Patient education: Explanation about the condition. Explanation about the prognosis. Pain education and addressing psychological factors.
Loading advice: Temporary cessation of pain provoking (sports) activities. Temporary replacement of provocative (sports) activities with non-provocative (sports) activities. Gradual increase of the load of (sports) activities. Use a pain scale to monitor the level of complaints related to (sports) activities and adjust these activities based on the pain scale.

Progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises for at least 12 weeks (figure 3). The form of exercise therapy should be suitable for the individual patient. Consider the role of: motivation, time constraints, pain monitoring and availability of facilities and resources. For insertional Achilles tendinopathy, consider initially performing exercises on a flat surface.

After 3 months of patient education, structural exercise therapy and following loading advice, if there is still no improvement discuss additional treatment options. Discuss the uncertainty surrounding of the additional effect and the advantages and disadvantages of any additional treatment. The best treatment option can then be decided together with the patient.

The following additional treatment options can be considered in case of insufficient effectiveness of patient education and loading advice in combination with continued exercise therapy:

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy.
Other passive modalities (the use of a night splint, inlays, use of collagen supplements, application of ultrasound and friction massages, laser therapy and light therapy).
Injection therapies (injections with polidocanol, lidocaine, autologous blood, platelet-rich plasma, stromal vascular fraction, hyaluronic acid, prolotherapy or high-volume injection) and acupuncture (or intratendinous needling).

Be cautious with the following additional treatment options:

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Corticosteroid injections.

Figure 3
Proposed flow chart for designing the progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises (gastrocnemius and soleus muscles) and plyometric exercises. The degree of pain (measured by a Visual Analogue Scale or Numeric Rating Scale) during and after the exercises and the muscle fatigue are leading for the speed of the progression. Note that for insertional Achilles tendinopathy, exercises are initially advised on a flat surface.

Procedure

Respondents to newspaper, flyer and social media advertising, and potential participants alerted to the trial via clinical partners, will initially be screened via telephone (when they call the researchers, or receive a call back to social media, email or text contact). Potentially eligible participants will be provided with electronic study information and given at least 24 hours to determine whether they would like to proceed. Those who contact the researchers interested in participating will be booked into a baseline session at IOP. A researcher and ultrasonographer blinded to treatment allocation will assess eligibility (figure 1). Eligible participants will be asked to provide written consent and complete the baseline assessment prior to randomisation.

Figure 1
Participant flow through the trial.

Baseline assessment

Standard demographic characteristics (age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, ethnicity), healthcare history (medical history, surgical history, current medications) and specific AT history (site, duration, previous treatment) will be recorded at baseline. The following measures will also be assessed at baseline: (1) Achilles tendon pain map: via a computer application; (2) Pain Detect: a validated questionnaire used to detect people who have neuropathic pain; (3) pressure pain thresholds: assessing local (Achilles tendon) and diffuse (lateral elbow) hyperalgesia; (4) expectancy/credibility: participants will be asked about how logical and successful they feel the treatment they have received will be, as well as their confidence in the treatment.

Randomisation

Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms with a 1:1:1 ratio using computer-generated permuted blocks of variable size (4, 8 and 12). This process will be undertaken remotely using third-party web-based randomisation (Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia) to ensure allocation concealment. For eligible participants, a radiology nurse will use the web-based service to determine treatment allocation. Only the nurse who prepares the injection (figure 1) will be aware of treatment allocation and they will be instructed to minimise interaction with the participants.

### Effect of high-volume injection, platelet-rich plasma, and sham treatment in chronic midportion achilles tendinopathy: a randomized double-blinded prospective study [^115WghbB]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Injection therapies are often considered alongside exercise for chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy (AT), although evidence of their efficacy is sparse.

Purpose

To determine whether eccentric training in combination with high-volume injection (HVI) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections improves outcomes in AT.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A total of 60 men (age, 18–59 years) with chronic (> 3 months) AT were included and followed for 6 months (n = 57). All participants performed eccentric training combined with either (1) one HVI (steroid, saline, and local anesthetic), (2) four PRP injections each 14 days apart, or (3) placebo (a few drops of saline under the skin). Randomization was stratified for age, function, and symptom severity (Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles [VISA-A]). Outcomes included function and symptoms (VISA-A), self-reported tendon pain during activity (visual analog pain scale [VAS]), tendon thickness and intratendinous vascularity (ultrasonographic imaging and Doppler signal), and muscle function (heel-rise test). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks of follow-up.

Results

VISA-A scores improved in all groups at all time points (P < .05), with greater improvement in the HVI group (mean ± SEM, 6 weeks = 27 ± 3 points; 12 weeks = 29 ± 4 points) versus PRP (6 weeks = 14 ± 4; 12 weeks = 15 ± 3) and placebo (6 weeks = 10 ± 3; 12 weeks = 11 ± 3) at 6 and 12 weeks (P < .01) and in the HVI (22 ± 5) and PRP (20 ± 5) groups versus placebo (9 ± 3) at 24 weeks (P < .01). VAS scores improved in all groups at all time points (P < .05), with greater decrease in HVI (6 weeks = 49 ± 4 mm; 12 weeks = 45 ± 6 mm; 24 weeks = 34 ± 6 mm) and PRP (6 weeks = 37 ± 7 mm; 12 weeks = 41 ± 7 mm; 24 weeks = 37 ± 6 mm) versus placebo (6 weeks = 23 ± 6 mm; 12 weeks = 30 ± 5 mm; 24 weeks = 18 ± 6 mm) at all time points (P < .05) and in HVI versus PRP at 6 weeks (P < .05). Tendon thickness showed a significant decrease only in HVI and PRP groups during the intervention, and this was greater in the HVI versus PRP and placebo groups at 6 and 12 weeks (P < .05) and in the HVI and PRP groups versus the placebo group at 24 weeks (P < .05). Muscle function improved in the entire cohort with no difference between the groups.

Conclusion

Treatment with HVI or PRP in combination with eccentric training in chronic AT seems more effective in reducing pain, improving activity level, and reducing tendon thickness and intratendinous vascularity than eccentric training alone. HVI may be more effective in improving outcomes of chronic AT than PRP in the short term. Registration: NCT02417987 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^111hPN8V]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide a consistently updated overview of the comparative effectiveness of treatments for Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

Living systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Multiple databases including grey literature sources were searched up to February 2019.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of any treatment in patients with both insertional and/or midportion Achilles tendinopathy. We excluded trials with 10 or fewer participants per treatment arm or trials investigating tendon ruptures.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise the certainty of evidence.

Primary Outcome Measure

The validated patient-reported Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire.

Results

29 trials investigating 42 different treatments were included. 22 trials (76%) were at high risk of bias and 7 (24%) had some concerns. Most trials included patients with midportion tendinopathy (86%). Any treatment class seemed superior to wait-and-see for midportion Achilles tendinopathy at 3 months (very low to low certainty of evidence). At 12 months, exercise therapy, exercise+injection therapy and exercise+night splint therapy were all comparable with injection therapy for midportion tendinopathy (very low to low certainty). No network meta-analysis could be performed for insertional Achilles tendinopathy.

Summary/Conclusion

In our living network meta-analysis no trials were at low risk of bias and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments seemed superior at 3-month follow-up. There seems to be no clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at either 3-month or 12-month follow-up. As exercise therapy is easy to prescribe, can be of low cost and has few harms, clinicians could consider starting treatment with a calf-muscle exercise programme.

What this study adds

This trial shows that treatment benefits from ultrasound guided lavage with a steroid injection or from a steroid injection alone are not superior to those from sham treatment
This questions their use as treatment measures for patients with calcific tendinopathy and should lead to a critical reconsideration of the role of these methods in treatment algorithms

### Injection therapies for achilles tendinopathy [^11423KVP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition, often with significant functional consequences. As a wide range of injection treatments are available, a review of randomised trials evaluating injection therapies to help inform treatment decisions is warranted.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injection therapies for people with Achilles tendinopathy.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 20 April 2015: the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus. We also searched trial registers (29 May 2014) and reference lists of articles to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating injection therapies in adults with an investigator-reported diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy. We accepted comparison arms of placebo (sham) or no injection control, or other active treatment (such as physiotherapy, pharmaceuticals or surgery). Our primary outcomes were function, using measures such as the VISA-A (Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire), and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We assessed treatment effects using mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous variables and risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for dichotomous variables. For follow-up data, we defined short-term as up to six weeks, medium-term as up to three months and longer-term as data beyond three months. We performed meta-analysis where appropriate.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (732 participants). Seven trials exclusively studied athletic populations. The mean ages of the participants in the individual trials ranged from 20 years to 50 years. Fifteen trials compared an injection therapy with a placebo injection or no injection control, four trials compared an injection therapy with active treatment, and one compared two different concentrations of the same injection. Thus no trials compared different injection therapies. Two studies had three trial arms and we included them twice in two different categories. Within these categories, we further subdivided injection therapies by mode of action (injury-causing versus direct repair agents). The risk of bias was unclear (due to poor reporting) or high in six trials published between 1987 and 1994. Improved methodology and reporting for the subsequent trials published between 2004 and 2013 meant that these were at less risk of bias. Given the very low quality evidence available from each of four small trials comparing different combinations of injection therapy versus active treatment and the single trial comparing two doses of one injection therapy, only the results of the first comparison (injection therapy versus control) are presented. There is low quality evidence of a lack of significant or clinically important differences in VISA-A scores (0 to 100: best function) between injection therapy and control groups at six weeks (MD 0.79, 95% CI -4.56 to 6.14; 200 participants, five trials), three months (MD -0.94, 95% CI -6.34 to 4.46; 189 participants, five trials) or between six and 12 months (MD 0.14, 95% CI -6.54 to 6.82; 132 participants, three trials). Very low quality evidence from 13 trials showed little difference between the two groups in adverse events (14/243 versus 12/206; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.89), most of which were minor and short-lasting. The only major adverse event in the injection therapy group was an Achilles tendon rupture, which happened in a trial testing corticosteroid injections. There was very low quality evidence in favour of the injection therapy group in short-term (under three months) pain (219 participants, seven trials) and in the return to sports (335 participants, seven trials). There was very low quality evidence indicating little difference between groups in patient satisfaction with treatment (152 participants, four trials). There was insufficient evidence to conclude on subgroup differences based on mode of action given that only two trials tested injury-causing agents and the clear heterogeneity of the other 13 trials, which tested seven different therapies that act directly on the repair pathway.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions on the use, or to support the routine use, of injection therapies for treating Achilles tendinopathy. This review has highlighted a need for definitive research in the area of injection therapies for Achilles tendinopathy, including in older non-athletic populations. This review has shown that there is a consensus in the literature that placebo-controlled trials are considered the most appropriate trial design.

Achilles tendinopathy — prevalence and demographics — disorders of the Achilles tendon rank among the most frequently reported overuse injuries, with most affected individuals engaged in activity at a recreational or competitive level; in runners the annual incidence has been reported to be between 7% and 9%, though a minority of cases occur in sedentary groups; prevalence increases with age, and the mean age of those affected has been reported to be between 30 and 50 years; although not well studied by sex, multiple sources suggest males are affected to a greater extent than females.

### Impact of autologous blood injections in treatment of mid-portion achilles tendinopathy: double blind randomised controlled trial [^117Ai7HD]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy causes chronic localised pain and stiffness. It affects over half of middle distance runnersand is responsible for up to 16% of affected people having to stop participating in their sport. It is also a problem among non-athletes, with 31% of cases occurring in sedentary individuals. The mid-portion is the most commonly affected part of the tendon. It is now recognised that the histopathological changes of tendinopathy are consistent with mucoid degeneration and poor tissue healing, rather than inflammation. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been proposed, but the aetiology of this condition remains unclear. Recent studies indicate that a person's genetic makeup might predispose them to Achilles tendinopathy.

Numerous different methods have been proposed to treat tendinopathy, such as eccentric training, the injection of corticosteroids and sclerosants, prolotherapy, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, and glyceryl trinitrate patches. Unfortunately, few of these treatments have shown consistent effectiveness and the evidence for most treatment options is sparse. The lack of prospective or randomised studies comparing treatment options makes evaluating their effectiveness difficult. Currently, eccentric training is the first choice of treatment of most practitioners, although the methodological quality of the studies suggesting efficacy has recently been questioned.

Autologous blood injections involve the reinjection of a patient's own whole blood and are a relatively novel and increasingly popular option for the treatment of tendinopathy. The proposed mechanism of action is that the cytokines and growth factors within the injected blood help to stimulate tissue healing and production of type 1 collagen. A few recent papers have suggested that such injections are a useful management option in the treatment of tendinopathy, but only one study, which has limitations, examined their use in the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy. We investigated the efficacy of autologous blood injections as a treatment option in addition to an eccentric training programme in improving pain and function in those with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods

Study design and participants

This study was conducted as a stratified, patient and assessor blinded, placebo controlled randomised clinical trial, with 1:1 allocation ratio, at the sports medicine department of a large district general hospital (Haaglanden Medical Centre, The Hague, Netherlands). The study was announced through letters to healthcare professionals, presentations at national conferences, and information on a national sports medicine platform. Potentially eligible participants were identified from referrals by healthcare providers and self-referrals, thereby comprising a mix of patients with and without primary care from healthcare providers. The coordinating researcher (AvdV) provided participants with detailed information on the study. Participants were screened for eligibility by telephone and online (using a pain map). A sports medicine physician (RvO) evaluated potentially eligible participants for inclusion at a booked appointment. Participants provided written informed consent before inclusion.

We included patients if they were aged 18–70 years, had a painful swelling of the Achilles tendon 2–7 cm proximal to the insertion on the calcaneus, had had symptoms for at least two months, had an unsatisfactory outcome after a six week exercise programme, and had detectable Doppler flow. When symptoms were bilateral, participants selected the most severely affected tendon for treatment. All the participants performed a minimum of six weeks of exercise treatment before inclusion.

Patients were excluded if they had a history of an Achilles tendon rupture or surgery; were unable to perform the exercise programme, were engaged in concomitant treatment programmes, had sural nerve disease, had recent drug use (within two years) with putative effect on symptoms and tendon healing (quinolone antibiotics, corticosteroids), were suspected of having other musculoskeletal disorders clinically (insertional Achilles tendinopathy, plantar flexor tenosynovitis, peroneal subluxation, inflammatory internal disorders, or quinolone, corticosteroid, or statin induced tendinopathy), had a medical condition that would affect the safety of the participant when using the injection (eg, peripheral vascular disease, use of anticoagulant drugs, allergy for lidocaine), or were pregnant.

Multimodal interventions — combined treatments with exercise for midportion Achilles tendinopathy are summarized from network meta-analyses reporting a total of 29 RCTs with 65 treatment arms, of which 40 included exercises; at 3 months, exercise combined with another treatment ranked above exercise alone (rank 2 = exercise + ESWT, rank 3 = exercise + mucopolysaccharides, rank 4 = exercise + injections, rank 8 = exercise + placebo injection versus rank 7 for exercise alone), and at 12 months, exercise combined with another treatment (rank 2 = exercise + injection OR exercise + night splint) ranked above exercise alone (rank 4); another review comparing exercise interventions with or without adjuncts to other treatments or no treatment included 31 RCTs (N = 1792, mean age = 46 years) and similarly noted that adjunct treatments (night splints, low-level laser therapy, orthoses) were all ranked higher than eccentric exercise alone on VISA-A at short-term follow-up; across these analyses it is difficult to assess an optimal set of treatments, there was considerable uncertainty due to limited data and risk of bias, and findings should be interpreted as having a low strength of evidence, with a stated need for more high-quality RCTs assessing specific combinations; 2018 Recommendation is None, and the 2024 Recommendation states, "Clinicians may include multimodal treatment, including a variety of interventions, to enhance the benefits of exercise for those with midportion Achilles tendinopathy".

### Injection treatment for chronic midportion achilles tendinopathy: do we need that many alternatives? [^112tPYSN]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

A minimally invasive technique such as high-volume injection has been successfully performed to produce local mechanical effects in order to release the adhesions formed between peritendineum and tendon proper, thereby obliterating neovascularisation and accompanying neonerves. Brisement, first described in 1997, was initially meant to interrupt the degenerative cycle of the tendon proper by initiating a healing cascade, but in essence seems equivalent to current high-volume injections. Now, could not a combination of these two theories, old and new, be the result of all injections? Meaning that no matter what we introduce, an inflammatory response will be generated? This can be illustrated by a randomized study by De Vos et al. where injection of PRP was compared with saline, producing an equivalent outcome. Corticosteroid injections for lateral epicondylitis did not provide any long-term benefit compared with placebo. Brown et al. performed a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with Achilles tendinopathy, where aprotinin was compared with placebo, showing no statistically significant benefit.

Until now, an evidence based algorithm for the (conservative) management of midportion Achilles tendinopathy is unknown. Research on Achilles tendon-related problems is ongoing. Further research should focus on the cause of pain in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Recognising the cause of pain will help to further define therapeutic strategies.

### Injection treatment for chronic midportion achilles tendinopathy: do we need that many alternatives? [^113VSc5Q]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

An abundant amount of different treatment modalities has been developed for treatment of chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy. Amongst them are injection treatments with as corticosteroids, Polidocanol, autologous blood, platelet-rich plasma, high-volume injections, hyperosmolar dextrose, brisement, aprotinin and low-dose heparin. The rationale behind these treatments is not always clear. The goal of treatment in general is to relieve symptoms. The main symptom is pain. Up to date, the cause of pain in chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy has not been elucidated however. So what is the rationale behind these treatments?

Corticosteroid injection has become obsolete in the treatment of midportion Achilles tendinopathy, as tendon rupture has been reported in various cases. The role of chemical inflammation in this pathology is also a matter of debate, and therefore there is no rationale for anti-inflammatory treatment. Ultrasound-guided treatment with Polidocanol (Ethoxysclerol) was first described in 2002 as an effective and promising method to obliterate neovessels in and around the tendon, which were hypothesized to be a possible cause of pain. Studies on patellar tendinopathy, lateral epicondylitis, supraspinatus tendinitis, and the effectiveness of larger doses in Achilles tendons followed. However, not all authors have been able to reproduce a good outcome. The blood vessels are unlikely to be the cause of pain. So what is the rationale behind this treatment?

Materials and methods

In the original study 113 consecutive patients were clinically diagnosed with AT. US confirmed the diagnosis. Eight juvenile and two pre-existing ruptures were excluded. Ten patients dropped out for various reasons, resulting in 93 patients completing the study. Sixty-eight were active in sports preinjury with a mean of 5.3 hours of activity per week, but the activity level did not influence the outcome. Seventy-five with mid-substance tendinopathy and 18 with insertional tendinopathy improved equally from the treatment.

All patients who completed the original study (n = 93) were invited 10 years after the last person finished the primary study, meaning that patients were invited 10 years and 0 month to 10 years and 10 months after finishing the primary study. Patients were invited to a physical examination including US and/or a questionnaire.

Patient involvement

Patients were not involved in setting the research agenda.

All patients were invited by phone or letter to participate in this follow-up. Seventy-seven (83%) participated, 19 answered our questionnaire by phone (n = 14) or letter (n = 5), and 58 showed up for examination including US (figure 1).

Figure 1
Patients' flow chart. CS, corticosteroid; US, ultrasound scanning.

An independent investigator (SJ) evaluated the patients' symptoms and function. We registered the weight, activity level in per cent compared with before the injury, change of sport and the reason, and global assessment of function over the past 10 years on a 4-grade scale — 1: excellent, no physical limitations; 2: good, slight physical limitation; 3: fair, considerable physical limitations; and 4: poor, severe physical limitation, and whether the Achilles tendon was the reason for these limitations. They were also asked if they had experienced Achilles tendon rupture and if they had sought other treatment and received any CS injections after our study ended.

Randomisation and masking

We used stratification for pre-injury activity level, since this could be a confounder for the primary outcome of pain and functional activity level using the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire. Stratification was conducted using the ankle activity score, which quantifies ankle related activity based on type and level of activities. Participants with an ankle activity score of 4 points or more were considered to be active and those with a score of 3 points or less were considered to be sedentary. Participants were randomised using a computer generated randomisation list (Microsoft Access; Redmond, WA). To ensure a balance between the number of participants in each treatment group, we performed block randomisation, with a variable block size of 4–10. To ensure blinding of the outcome assessor (AV), a secretary performed the randomisation who was independent of the researchers responsible for enrolment or the assessment of outcome measures. After randomisation, an unblinded sports medicine physician (RvO) who was not involved in the assessment of outcome measures carried out the allocated injection treatment. The participants were blinded to their assigned treatment, as they could not see the injection procedure. All the participants completed a short questionnaire immediately after the injection to check whether the blinding procedure was successful (which type of injection do you think you have received (high volume injection or placebo)?) and to assess the amount of pain (visual analogue scale 0–100, using a 100 mm line) during the procedure.

Statistical analysis

Our sample size calculation showed that 40 participants were required in each group to detect a difference of 12 points on the VISA-A score (power 0.80, two sided significance level of 0.05, SD 18, and accounting for a 10% loss to follow-up). A researcher (AvdV) performed the statistical analyses under the supervision of a biomedical statistician (JW); both were blinded to the allocated treatment. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using SPSS 25.0.0.1 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Normality of the data was checked visually with Q-Q plots and statistically using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Between group differences for the primary outcome were analysed using a generalised estimation equations model. To test whether the time course of the VISA-A score was different between groups we added the interaction term of treatment group×time point. Adjustments were made for the four predefined baseline variables of age, sex, body mass index, and duration of symptoms. Additionally, we adjusted for the stratification factor (ankle activity score). Outcomes of the generalised estimation equations model are presented as estimated means, unless otherwise stated. The same method was used to evaluate most of the secondary outcomes (see web appendix 2). A Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate only patient satisfaction, return to sport, and the patient acceptable symptom scale. The outcomes to evaluate the success of the procedures were analysed using a Fisher's exact test or χ² test (categorical outcomes) or unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney U test (continuous outcomes). We considered differences of P < 0.05 to be statistically significant. Missing data were not imputed, but we would have carried out sensitivity analyses if missing data exceeded 5%.

Patient and public involvement

Patients were not involved in defining the research question. Two patients participated in a pilot test round to evaluate the impact of the placebo and high volume injection procedure. Patients were not involved in other aspects of the study design. After completion of the trial, all trial participants were contacted to evaluate relevant outcome measures and the burden of participation to improve future trials. Five participants took part in a patient meeting to discuss these items. Study results will be disseminated to the trial participants by email or letter.

Study Question

Do peritendinous autologous blood injections improve pain and function in people with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy?

Summary Answer

The administration of two unguided peritendinous autologous blood injections one month apart, in addition to a standardised eccentric training programme, provides no additional benefit in the treatment of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

What Is Known and What This Paper Adds

Several studies have suggested that injection of autologous blood can help in the treatment of various tendinopathies. There is a lack of high quality evidence showing relevant benefit for autologous blood injections, particularly in the management of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. We found no additional reduction in pain or improvement in function when these injections were combined with an eccentric calf training programme.

### Sports and exercise-related tendinopathies: a review of selected topical issues by participants of the second international scientific tendinopathy symposium (ISTS) vancouver 2012 [^111tF1ir]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The role of glucocorticoid injection therapy has long been debated with the balance of benefit versus harm of such treatment a potentially serious concern for clinicians. Potential mechanisms of action in tendinopathy include a reduction of extrinsic or intrinsic inflammation, reduction of tenocyte proliferation or cellular activity, antiangiogenic activity, inhibition of scarring/adhesion, antinociceptive action or some combination thereof. The efficacy of glucocorticoid injections for rotator cuff tendinopathy, Achilles tendinopathy, patellar tendinopathy and tennis elbow has been investigated at length, with the sum of evidence suggesting that the majority of patients may experience short-term improvement in pain and/or function, but experience a higher risk of relapse in the medium to long term. Clinical trials have been limited by the heterogeneity of the patient cohorts under investigation and the timing and type of outcome measures used in the studies. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated worse results from glucocorticoid use when compared with other treatments and placebo in the intermediate and long-term follow-up of treatment for tennis elbow.

Prolotherapy and sclerotherapy represent treatments quite opposed in their proposed mechanisms of action. The original aim of prolotherapy was to promote a local inflammation-repair response. Conversely, sclerotherapy employs colour Doppler US to target peritendinous areas of increased signal which have been shown to be richly vascularised and innervated. There is also some suggestion that agents used for prolotherapy may themselves have vascular sclerosing properties. A systematic review by Coombes et al concluded that "ultrasonography-guided injection of lauromacrogol (polidocanol) and prolotherapy injection of hypertonic glucose and local anaesthetic are potential therapeutic techniques, based on moderate evidence of improvements in the intermediate term for patellar tendinopathy and lateral epicondylalgia, respectively".

For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, the US-guided injection of polidocanol into peritendinous regions with high blood flow and nerves has also been reported, in a small randomised controlled trial, to lead to pain relief and improved patient satisfaction. At 2-year follow-up after successful polidocanol injections, the Achilles tendon demonstrated a decreased thickness and improved tendon structure, demonstrating the potential influence of these soft tissues on the tendon tissue proper. Further prospective clinical trials may determine whether there are subgroups of Achilles midportion tendinopathy patients (sedentary/active, male/female) that may respond differently to polidocanol injection.

### Ultrasonography as a prognostic and objective parameter in achilles tendinopathy: a prospective observational study [^113fRiRm]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study prospectively whether structural changes determined by ultrasound scanning (US) can be used as prognostic markers for outcome in patients with symptomatic Achilles tendinopathy (AT) and to investigate whether there exists an association between US findings and pain measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and a general assessment score (GA).

Methods

92 consecutive patients with AT symptoms were recruited from two outpatient clinics in rheumatology. The patients underwent a conservative treatment protocol consisting of reduced activities, controlled rehabilitation including eccentric exercises of the calf muscles and if needed supplemented with corticosteroid injections. The patients were examined clinically and by US (tendon thickness, hyper- and hypoechogenicity, calcification, bursitis, calcaneusspure, tenosynovitis, gray scale and color Doppler focusing on increased flow intra- or peritendinous). The clinical and US examination were performed at entry, 1, 2, 3 and at 6 month.

Results

42 women and 50 men were included (mean age of 47 years). They had symptoms for more than 13 months and a symptomatic Achilles tendon mean thickness of 7.4 ± 2.3mm. Heterogeneity at the initial examination was found to be a prognostic marker for the clinical outcome. Tendon thickness, hypoechogenicity and increased flow at any time point were significantly correlated to pain at function, palpatory pain and morning pain at the same time points. A reduction in tendon thickness was statistically associated with a decrease in palpatory pain.

Conclusion

Heterogeneity is a prognostic marker in AT. Tendon thickness, hypoechogenicity and increased Doppler activity can be used as objective outcome parameters for the treatment effect of AT.

Three injection groups

In participants with bilateral symptoms, the most symptomatic side (volunteered by the patient on questioning, or the right side if they cannot define the more symptomatic side) will be injected. All participants will receive a single injection (see figure 3) that will be delivered by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist while participants are lying prone. Immediately post-injection, participants will be asked which injection they believe they received (they are able to answer whether they think it is intervention, sham or that they do not know) to assess the success of participant blinding.

Figure 3
Schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments.

High-volume injection with corticosteroid: The HVI will be injected into the interface between Kager's fat and the Achilles tendon. The local anaesthetic and the corticosteroid is injected followed by the four saline syringes by using a connecting tube (allows consecutive syringes to be attached). The position of the needle will be monitored continuously by ultrasound and the needle will be moved gently across the anterior aspect of the tendon to ensure uniform effect over the pathological area.
Tendon sheath injection without corticosteroid: This injection is identical to the HVI with corticosteroid, but the first syringe will only contain exactly 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride (no corticosteroid).
Sham injection: The sham injection consists 2–3 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride and will be injected under image guidance by the same expert radiologist, deep to the tendon and away from the interface between Kager's fat and the Achilles tendon (at last 10 mm away). The sham injection will result in a numbing effect, like the HVI.

### Ultrasound-guided injection therapy of achilles tendinopathy with platelet-rich plasma or saline: a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^1165kxZ6]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and difficult to treat musculoskeletal disorder.

Purpose

To examine whether 1 injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) would improve outcomes more effectively than placebo (saline) after 3 months in patients with AT.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A total of 24 patients with chronic AT (median disease duration, 33 months) were randomized (1:1) to receive either a blinded injection of PRP (n = 12) or saline (n = 12). The primary endpoint was improvement in Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were pain at rest, pain while walking, pain when tendon was squeezed, ultrasonographic changes in tendon thickness, and color Doppler activity. Patients were informed that they could drop out after 3 months if they were dissatisfied with the treatment.

Results

After 3 months, all 24 patients were reassessed (no dropouts). No difference between the PRP and the saline group could be observed with regard to the primary outcome (VISA-A score: mean difference [MD], -1.3; 95% CI, -17.8 to 15.2; P = 0.868). Secondary outcomes were pain at rest (MD, 1.6; 95% CI, -0.5 to 3.7; P = 0.137), pain while walking (MD, 0.8; 95% CI, -1.8 to 3.3; P = 0.544), pain when tendon was squeezed (MD, 0.3; 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.9; P = 0.208), color Doppler activity (MD, 0.3; 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.8; P = 0.260), and tendon thickness (MD, 0.8 mm; 95% CI, 0.1 to 1.6 mm; P = 0.030). After the 3-month follow-up, a large dropout was observed: 75% of patients in the PRP group and 33% in the saline group.

Conclusion

PRP injection did not result in an improved VISA-A score over a 3-month period in patients with chronic AT compared with placebo. The only secondary outcome demonstrating a statistically significant difference between the groups was change in tendon thickness; this difference indicates that a PRP injection could increase tendon thickness compared with saline injection. The conclusions are limited to the 3 months after treatment owing to the large dropout rate.

Rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — corticosteroid injections: Corticosteroid injections may significantly reduce pain and disability in the short term (up to 8 weeks) when compared to a placebo or oral NSAIDs, and ultrasound-guided injections appear to offer greater reduction in pain and disability and may be preferred, if available. Recommendations #19 state that clinicians may recommend or perform corticosteroid injections to reduce pain and short-term disability in adults with RC tendinopathy, and clinicians should not recommend or perform corticosteroid injections as a first-line treatment to reduce pain and disability in adults with RC tendinopathy.

### One-year follow-up of platelet-rich plasma treatment in chronic achilles tendinopathy: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial [^116R7dx1]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinopathy is a common disease among both athletes and in the general population in which the use of platelet-rich plasma has recently been increasing. Good evidence for the use of this autologous product in tendinopathy is limited, and data on longer-term results are lacking.

Purpose

To study the effects of a platelet-rich plasma injection in patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy at 1-year follow-up.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

Fifty-four patients, aged 18 to 70 years, with chronic tendinopathy 2 to 7 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion were randomized to receive either a blinded injection containing platelet-rich plasma or saline (placebo group) in addition to an eccentric training program. The main outcome was the validated Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles score. Patient satisfaction was recorded and ultrasound examination performed at baseline and follow-up.

Results

The mean Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles score improved in both the platelet-rich plasma group and the placebo group after 1 year. There was no significant difference in increase between both groups (adjusted between-group difference, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, -4.9 to 15.8, P = 0.292). In both groups, 59% of the patients were satisfied with the received treatment. Ultrasonographic tendon structure improved significantly in both groups but was not significantly different between groups (adjusted between-group difference, 1.2%; 95% confidence interval, -4.1 to 6.6, P = 0.647).

Conclusion

This randomized controlled trial showed no clinical and ultrasonographic superiority of platelet-rich plasma injection over a placebo injection in chronic Achilles tendinopathy at 1 year combined with an eccentric training program.

Materials and Methods

Study Design

This cross‐sectional study was conducted as a part of an ongoing double‐blind, placebo‐controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT). The aim of this RCT was to evaluate the effect of a high‐volume injection in patients with chronic midportion AT (identifier NCT02996409). Written informed consent was obtained before participation for all patients and also for the cross‐sectional part of this study. The protocol of the study was approved by the regional Medical Ethical Committee (registration number 14‐100).

Setting and Participants

This cross‐sectional study was performed at the Department of Sports Medicine in a large district general hospital (The Hague Medical Center). The first 32 consecutive included patients who participated in the RCT were asked to take part in this cross‐sectional study from April 2017 to November 2017. Inclusion criteria were the presence of a chronic midportion AT for at least 2 months, the completion of an exercise training program for at least 6 weeks with an unsatisfactory outcome, age between 18 and 70 years, and the presence of Doppler flow on PDUS imaging. The diagnosis was established on the basis of a clinical examination (local tendon pain, swelling of the Achilles tendon 2–7 cm proximal to its calcaneal insertion, and an impaired load‐bearing capacity) by a physician with experience in sports medicine (15–20 years). As AT is considered a clinical diagnosis in principle, grayscale US was not used to verify the diagnosis. 3 Main exclusion criteria were a clinical suspicion of other musculoskeletal disorders (insertional AT, inflammatory systemic disorders, and quinolone‐, corticosteroid‐ or statin‐induced tendinopathy), a previous Achilles tendon rupture or surgery, the inability to perform an exercise program, and a medical condition that would affect the safety of the injection (eg, peripheral vascular disease or the use of anticoagulant medication). Detailed information regarding all exclusion criteria is provided in the trial registration. In cases of bilateral symptoms, only the most affected tendon was included in the study.

Achilles tendinopathy clinical practice guidelines — individual clinical research articles will be graded according to criteria described by the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom, and grades of recommendation and levels of evidence are defined as follows. Grades of recommendation are A Strong evidence — A preponderance of level I and/or level II studies support the recommendation. This must include at least 1 level I study; B Moderate evidence — A single high-quality randomized controlled trial or a preponderance of level II studies support the recommendation; C Weak evidence — A single level II study or a preponderance of level III and IV studies including statements of consensus by content experts support the recommendation; D Conflicting evidence — Higher-quality studies conducted on this topic disagree with respect to their conclusions. The recommendation is based on these conflicting studies; E Theoretical/ foundational evidence — A preponderance of evidence from animal or cadaver studies, from conceptual models/principles, or from basic sciences/bench research support this conclusion; and F Expert opinion — Best practice based on the clinical experience of the guidelines development team. Levels of evidence are I Evidence obtained from high-quality diagnostic studies, prospective studies, or randomized controlled trials; II Evidence obtained from lesser-quality diagnostic studies, prospective studies, or randomized controlled trials (eg, weaker diagnostic criteria and reference standards, improper randomization, no blinding, < 80% follow-up); III Case-controlled studies or retrospective studies; IV Case series; and V Expert opinion.

### Does shockwave therapy lead to better pain and function than sham over 12 weeks in people with insertional achilles tendinopathy? A randomised controlled trial [^113S7iM9]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Two other studies have investigated radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy with placebo comparators among people with insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Mansur et al.investigated the efficacy of adding radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy or sham to exercise for insertional Achilles tendinopathy. They prescribed an eccentric training program modified so that it is performed on flat ground (avoiding full dorsiflexion). The isolated eccentric training program aims to reproduce moderate to severe pain during the exercise; otherwise, more load is added and it is performed twice per day, 7 days per week. Mansur et al.also advised people to stop all sport activity for 8 weeks regardless of their symptoms, which is not recommended based on current evidence. In this trial, participants were allowed to maintain and even progress with running and sporting activity depending on pain levels. However, similar to the study by Mansur et al. we found no between-group differences in primary pain and function outcomes at any time point (2, 4, 6, 12, 24 weeks for Mansur and 6 and 12 weeks in our study). The mean age (53 years old in Mansur et al.and 50 years old in our study) and sex (48% females in Mansur et al.and 53% females in our study) were similar between the studies. It is also interesting to note that within-group improvements in our study (mean Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment – Achilles questionnaire baseline = 47; mean Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment – Achilles questionnaire 12 weeks = 61) and Mansur et al.(mean Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment – Achilles questionnaire baseline = 42; mean Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment – Achilles questionnaire 12 weeks = 58) indicate similar benefits from different exercise programs, although this may be explained by non-specific effects, such as natural history or regression to the mean. Pinitkwamdee et al. investigated conventional treatment (rest, medication, activity modification, stretching exercise, and heel lift orthosis) with the addition of radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy or sham. The stretching exercise was not well defined, and the study was underpowered (a total of 31 people randomised to the two groups). There were no between-group differences in self-reported pain (composite pain and function were not reported) at any timepoint. Overall, there is no current evidence to support the use of radial extracorporeal shockwave therapy when compared with sham for insertional Achilles tendinopathy, regardless of adjunct therapies or exercise programs.

### Treatment of tendinopathy: what works, what does not, and what is on the horizon [^114CSPfF]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Tendinopathy is a broad term encompassing painful conditions occurring in and around tendons in response to overuse. Recent basic science research suggests little or no inflammation is present in these conditions. Thus, traditional treatment modalities aimed at controlling inflammation such as corticosteroid injections and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDS) may not be the most effective options. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the best treatment options for tendinopathy. We evaluated the effectiveness of NSAIDS, corticosteroid injections, exercise-based physical therapy, physical therapy modalities, shock wave therapy, sclerotherapy, nitric oxide patches, surgery, growth factors, and stem cell treatment. NSAIDS and corticosteroids appear to provide pain relief in the short term, but their effectiveness in the long term has not been demonstrated. We identified inconsistent results with shock wave therapy and physical therapy modalities such as ultrasound, iontophoresis and low-level laser therapy. Current data support the use of eccentric strengthening protocols, sclerotherapy, and nitric oxide patches, but larger, multicenter trials are needed to confirm the early results with these treatments. Preliminary work with growth factors and stem cells is promising, but further study is required in these fields. Surgery remains the last option due to the morbidity and inconsistent outcomes. The ideal treatment for tendinopathy remains unclear.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy — dry needling: Clinicians may use combined therapy of dry needling with injection under ultrasound guidance and eccentric exercise to decrease pain for individuals with symptoms greater than 3 months and increased tendon thickness, and clinicians may use intramuscular dry needling to treat calf-related muscle pain and stiffness, particularly in those with more acute symptoms and/or in those who do not tolerate a progressive loading program. In an RCT, individuals were assigned to either intramuscular stimulation (n = 25), sham intramuscular stimulation (n = 19), or exercise only (n = 8); all groups received a standardized 12-week progressive eccentric exercise program, and there were no differences in improvement in the VISA-A between any of the groups at weeks 6, 12, 26, or 52. One small RCT found that there was no additional benefit of adding intramuscular dry needling, with or without stimulation, to tendon loading exercise; no severe harms were reported, most participants experienced a deep ache and/or muscle contraction with needle insertion, and occasionally minor bruising was associated with dry needling. There is a need to determine the efficacy of dry needling in conjunction with other modalities or as a stand-alone treatment, and dry needling may have a place in improving pain and range of motion, particularly in those with more acute symptoms, myofascial trigger points in the calf, and/or those who do not tolerate a progressive loading program.

### Achilles tendinopathy… [^113Xb2qG]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

During running, it is subjected to increased loads of up to 12 times body weight. It is named after the Greek mythical hero Achilles, who was invulnerable everywhere except his heel and was eventually fatally wounded in the heel by an arrow. Since then, the term "Achilles' heel" has come to mean a person's principal weakness. Achilles tendinopathy is a common overuse injury, accounting for 11% of all running injuries. The January 13, 2010, issue of JAMA includes a study reporting that injections of platelet-rich plasma were not effective for treating chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Rapid increase in running distance or speed Adding uphill running or stair climbing to an exercise routine Starting up too quickly after not exercising Change of footwear or training surface Weak calf muscles Overpronation of feet when running Wearing high heels, which shorten the tendon and calf muscles Symptoms. Pain is typically felt in the middle of the tendon.

Initially, pain and stiffness are present only in the morning, during warming up, or after activity. Rest may decrease symptoms, but they often return with increased activity. In a later stage the tendon pain is more constant. Treatment and prevention. Chronic tendinopathy is difficult to treat. Nonsurgical management is the most conservative approach. Switching to another sport allows the tendon time to rest. Eccentric exercise therapy is increasingly prescribed for patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Although scientific evidence does not support many traditional treatments, they are still often used and include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, orthoses, stretching, massage, ultrasound, taping the back of the leg, and plaster casting.

Steroid injection directly into the tendon is sometimes used but not generally recommended because some specialists believe this increases the risk of tendon rupture. Surgery is often a last resort because recovery is slow. Although not proven, preventive measures often include choosing running shoes that provide sufficient cushion for heel strike, using a prescribed orthotic, walking and stretching to warm up calf muscles before running, gradually increasing running distance and speed by not greater than 10% per week, avoiding unaccustomed sprinting and hill running, and cooling down properly after exercise.

### 10-year follow-up after standardised treatment for achilles tendinopathy [^11611NQG]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The very long-term follow-up of patients with AT shows that 90% report good or excellent results, although many patients (37%) still have some degree of pain and reduced function after 10 years. We did not find that one to two CS injections increased the risk of tendon rupture, and with the good or excellent very long-term results CS injections do not seem to have a deleterious effect per se. Patients with insertional tendinopathy were operated more often than mid-substance tendinopathy, but otherwise we found no differences in the long-term outcome between these two groups. We found no prognostic parameters at entry for poor outcome, and it seems that an increased tendon thickness is more or less permanent. Higher grades of flow and heterogeneity seem to correspond with poor function and pain.

Patients

Between November 2022 and December 2023, athletic participants were recruited through advertisements placed on hospital/university facilities and social media platforms. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they met the following inclusion criteria: age 18–60 years old, diagnosis of chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy, with symptoms for more than 3 months but less than 3 years, a VISA-A score < 80 points, performing running-based sports at least 2 times a week and being able to comply with an exercise programme. Diagnosis of insertional Achilles tendinopathy was confirmed if: (1) pain at the insertional region (ie, within 2 cm of the insertion on the calcaneus) could be reproduced on palpation and during a single leg-hop test and (2) ultrasonography showed the presence of intratendinous hypoechoic changes and/or tendon thickening and/or the presence of intratendinous power Doppler flow. Additionally, lateral weight-bearing radiographs were performed to detect a Haglund's deformity and/or intratendinous calcifications. However, since focal calcifications, a Haglund's deformity and an enlarged retrocalcaneal or subcutaneous bursa often coexist in patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy and may also be present in asymptomatic individuals, participants were not excluded if these ultrasonographic or radiographic features were present. Participants were excluded in case of a history of Achilles tendon rupture or surgery, coexisting midportion Achilles tendinopathy or ankle pathology (eg, arthritis), treatment with physiotherapy, local injection(s), extracorporeal shockwave therapy or orthotics in the past 3 months, presence of metabolic, endocrine or rheumatological disorders, use of fluoroquinolone therapy in the preceding 2 years and pregnancy.
