## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical impression for a patient presenting with dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, and other symptoms, and wants an explanation for each basis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the diagnostic framework and pretest probabilities. Then, I should verify which clinical signs most strongly support heart failure versus pulmonary disease. Next, I will review red flags and exclude life-threatening mimics. After that, I should confirm the diagnostic workup sequence, including natriuretic peptides, chest radiography, ECG, and echocardiography. Finally, I will consider severity classification, contributory etiologies, and immediate management priorities with monitoring targets and escalation criteria, while continuously checking each assertion against guideline-backed sources.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. The cardinal symptom cluster of dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention points toward heart failure as the leading diagnosis, and orthopnea plus bilateral edema are classic features of decompensated heart failure, particularly left-sided disease with systemic congestion; COPD and interstitial lung disease can mimic this but usually lack the fluid-retention signs, so I need to ensure I weight congestion features heavily in the pretest probability calculation [^111UGYQs] [^1133Anfg]. Wait, let me verify the orthopnea mechanism before I anchor on it; lying flat increases venous return and pulmonary capillary pressure, and when left ventricular compliance is reduced, that precipitates pulmonary congestion and dyspnea, which fits the pathophysiology here and strengthens HF as the working diagnosis.

> Next, I should review which bedside signs carry the most weight. Elevated jugular venous pressure is among the most reliable markers of volume overload and correlates with elevated filling pressures. A displaced apical impulse and pulmonary crackles, together with peripheral edema, substantially increase the likelihood of heart failure and, when combined, outperform single findings, so I need to integrate them rather than interpret them in isolation [^113VbQJu]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; rales can be subtle or absent in chronic HF, and their presence is not perfectly sensitive, so the absence of rales would not exclude HF, but the convergence of JVP, crackles, and edema here is compelling [^113VbQJu] [^116kKPT5].

> I will now examine vital signs for hemodynamic context. The blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg suggests hypertensive heart disease as a likely contributor, and sinus tachycardia at 102 bpm supports compensatory mechanisms in decompensated HF. Tachypnea at 30 cpm aligns with pulmonary congestion and increased work of breathing, reinforcing the clinical picture of acute decompensation rather than stable chronic HF. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "hypertensive emergency", but that would require severe hypertension with acute organ injury; here, the blood pressure is elevated but not in the severe range and the end-organ injury appears limited to pulmonary congestion, so I should correct that and frame this as decompensated HF with hypertension rather than a hypertensive emergency.

> But wait, what if this is a pulmonary mimic rather than HF? COPD can cause exertional dyspnea and wheeze, but prominent orthopnea, JVP elevation, and peripheral edema are atypical for isolated COPD; conversely, fine basilar crackles, JVP elevation, and edema strongly favor HF and can coexist with COPD, which is common, so I need to ensure I do not over-attribute symptoms to airflow limitation alone [^114FBcnb] [^117YL4cT]. I should double-check for COPD features like chronic cough and sputum and airflow limitation on spirometry if needed, but the dominant phenotype here remains congestive HF [^114FBcnb].

> Next, I should review life-threatening mimics and exclude them early. Acute pulmonary embolism can present with dyspnea and tachycardia, but bilateral edema and JVP elevation without pleuritic pain or unilateral leg findings make PE less likely; nevertheless, if the story changes or risk is high, D-dimer and CT pulmonary angiography would be indicated, so I need to keep a low threshold if pretest probability rises [^113qXGEN]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is noncardiogenic and typically lacks volume overload signs, which are present here, making ARDS unlikely; likewise, pericardial tamponade or tension pneumothorax would have different exam findings and hemodynamic signatures, which are not seen here, so these are low on the list today [^111VWk4M].

> I need to ensure I consider secondary contributors. Chronic heavy alcohol use can precipitate alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and uncontrolled hypertension accelerates LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. The patient's smoking history supports COPD as a comorbidity and may exacerbate HF symptoms through gas-exchange abnormalities and dynamic hyperinflation, so I should document these modifiable risk factors explicitly in the etiologic workup [^114FBcnb]. Hold on, I should verify that these are framed as contributors rather than primary diagnoses. The current clinical syndrome is most consistent with HF exacerbation on a background of hypertension and lifestyle risks [^notfound].

> Now, I should confirm the initial diagnostic testing sequence. Natriuretic peptides will help corroborate HF; an NT-proBNP above about 300 pg/mL in the acute setting supports HF, while values below about 100 pg/mL make HF unlikely, though obesity and renal function can confound interpretation, so I need to integrate results with the clinical picture rather than use a single cutoff [^116kKPT5] [^113qXGEN]. Chest radiography should be obtained to assess cardiomegaly, pulmonary venous congestion, interstitial edema, and pleural effusions; even though sensitivity is imperfect, a compatible radiograph meaningfully increases the likelihood of HF in this presentation [^116ucaUt] [^116kKPT5]. Electrocardiography will screen for ischemia, LV hypertrophy, arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, and conduction disease, all of which can contribute to HF phenotypes and guide therapy, so I should not skip it [^1172j4p3]. Finally, transthoracic echocardiography is essential to determine LVEF, assess diastolic function, and evaluate valves and right ventricle, and it will distinguish HFrEF from HFpEF, which will shape disease-directed therapy [^116FSMAH] [^1172j4p3].

> Let me think about how to classify severity and trajectory. Using the INTERMACS profiles, the combination of dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, and refractory congestion despite minimal activity places this patient at least in Profile 4, "resting symptoms on oral therapy", and possibly worse if inotrope dependence or hypotension emerges. I should confirm hemodynamics and end-organ perfusion to assign the appropriate profile accurately [^116FSMAH]. I should also apply the NYHA functional class framework. Exertional dyspnea progressing to orthopnea with minimal activity is consistent with Class III–IV, but I will avoid overcommitting until I quantify objective activity tolerance and signs of congestion more precisely [^11241FzD].

> I should confirm the immediate management priorities. Start guideline-directed medical therapy for HF, initiate loop diuretics for decongestion with close monitoring of weight, urine output, and renal function, and continue or optimize renin–angiotensin system blockade while avoiding hypotension. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can be considered if respiratory distress and hypoxemia persist despite oxygen, and blood pressure control should be titrated cautiously to avoid compromising perfusion during decongestion [^116FSMAH] [^111RHt9D]. Hold on, I should verify diuretic strategy; continuous infusion versus bolus dosing can be individualized, but early intravenous loop diuretics with careful electrolyte and creatinine monitoring are standard in acute decompensation, with dose adjusted to diuretic response and congestion markers [^1178zu3L].

> Next, I should review monitoring and reassessment targets. Serial weights, strict intake and output, daily labs including electrolytes and creatinine, and frequent clinical checks for JVP, rales, edema, and blood pressure are essential. I should define success as achieving approximately 2–3 liters of negative fluid balance early if tolerated, resolution of orthopnea, reduction of JVP to 6–8 cm H2O or less, and transition to oral diuretics with stable renal function before discharge [^1159bmgM] [^113VbQJu]. I need to ensure that persistent congestion is not overlooked; if dyspnea, edema, or elevated JVP persist despite diuretics, I should reassess for right heart failure, kidney disease, or adherence barriers and escalate therapy accordingly [^1159bmgM].

> Finally, I should consider disposition and follow-up. Given resting dyspnea, tachypnea, and objective congestion, hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure is indicated to safely achieve decongestion, initiate and titrate therapy, and address precipitating factors. Outpatient management would be unsafe at this stage, and I should document the rationale clearly for billing and quality metrics [^notfound]. After stabilization, I will arrange close cardiology follow-up, reinforce medication adherence, smoking cessation, and alcohol counseling, and plan echocardiographic reassessment to refine phenotype and guide long-term disease-modifying therapy, ensuring the care plan aligns with contemporary HF guidelines [^116FSMAH] [^1172j4p3].

The most likely clinical impression is **decompensated heart failure** (likely HFrEF) due to longstanding, uncontrolled hypertension, with superimposed COPD and possible renal dysfunction. The key supporting features are **exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, JVD, bilateral pitting edema, pulmonary crackles, and displaced apex beat**, all consistent with volume overload and reduced cardiac output [^113Cwe3a] [^111UGYQs]. Contributing factors include **nonadherence to antihypertensives, smoking, and alcohol use**; the tea-colored urine suggests renal involvement from cardiorenal syndrome or rhabdomyolysis. Immediate priorities are to confirm the diagnosis and guide therapy with **BNP/NT-proBNP, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography, and renal function tests**, and to initiate IV diuretics, oxygen, and strict fluid/sodium restriction [^116ucaUt] [^116FSMAH].

---

## Clinical impression and differential diagnosis

### Primary diagnosis: decompensated heart failure (HFrEF)

- **Dyspnea and orthopnea**: Classic for elevated left-sided filling pressures and pulmonary congestion [^113oYJMf].
- **JVD and peripheral edema**: Indicate elevated right-sided pressures and systemic congestion [^113VbQJu].
- **Pulmonary crackles and displaced apex beat**: Suggest cardiomegaly and LV dysfunction [^notfound].
- **Hypertension and smoking**: Major risk factors for HFrEF [^notfound].

---

### Secondary diagnosis: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

The patient's smoking history and exertional dyspnea are consistent with COPD, and **coexisting COPD is common in heart failure** and can worsen symptoms and outcomes [^114FBcnb] [^115AHYBD].

---

### Differential diagnosis

- **Pulmonary embolism**: Unlikely without pleuritic pain or risk factors, but consider if symptoms persist [^notfound].
- **Renal failure**: Tea-colored urine suggests possible renal dysfunction or rhabdomyolysis [^notfound].
- **Liver disease**: Jaundice and hyperpigmentation raise concern for hepatic congestion or chronic liver disease [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

Long-standing hypertension causes **LV hypertrophy and remodeling**, reducing compliance and increasing filling pressures. This leads to pulmonary congestion and orthopnea, while RV overload from pulmonary hypertension produces JVD and peripheral edema. Neurohormonal activation (RAAS, SNS) drives fluid retention and vasoconstriction, worsening congestion [^115a5Zyv] [^1148KFCJ].

---

## Diagnostic workup

| **Test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| BNP/NT-proBNP | Confirm/exclude HF; guide severity [^116kKPT5] |
| ECG | Ischemia, arrhythmias, LVH [^1172j4p3] |
| Chest X-ray | Cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion [^116ucaUt] |
| Echocardiography | EF, wall motion, valves, RV function [^notfound] |
| Renal function tests | Assess cardiorenal syndrome [^notfound] |
| Liver function tests | Evaluate hepatic congestion [^1177e4iz] |
| Urinalysis | Hematuria/proteinuria suggesting renal disease [^notfound] |

---

## Immediate management

- **Oxygen therapy**: Target SpO₂ ≥ 95% [^notfound].
- **IV loop diuretics**: Reduce congestion (e.g. furosemide) [^113oYJMf].
- **Strict fluid and sodium restriction**: Limit retention [^notfound].
- **Monitor**: Daily weights, strict I&O, electrolytes, renal function [^1136cDWr].
- **Treat hypertension**: Start/increase ACEi/ARB, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist as tolerated [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is guarded given decompensated HF, uncontrolled hypertension, and COPD; **1-year mortality is ~20–30%** [^115a5Zyv]. Potential complications include recurrent decompensation, arrhythmias, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and thromboembolism [^1148KFCJ].

---

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **decompensated HFrEF** from longstanding hypertension, with COPD and possible renal dysfunction as contributors. Prompt diagnostic testing and aggressive decongestion are critical to stabilize and guide disease-directed therapy.

Outcome measures for atrial fibrillation registries — heart failure and major complication definitions: Heart failure is defined as physician documentation or report of unusual dyspnea on light exertion, recurrent dyspnea in the supine position, fluid retention, or examination findings such as rales, jugular venous distention, or pulmonary edema; a low ejection fraction without clinical presentation does not qualify as heart failure, and studies wishing to classify heart failure should use the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification. A major complication is one that results in permanent injury or death, requires intervention for treatment, or prolongs or requires hospitalization for more than 48 hours or results in re-hospitalization within 30 days.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.

Heart failure (HF) definition and diagnostic features in thalassemia major (TM) specify that, for the purposes of these guidelines, HF is defined clinically as a syndrome with typical symptoms (eg, breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (eg, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and displaced apex beat) resulting from an abnormality of cardiac structure or function. In TM, many symptoms typically present in HF are common in anemia, so more reliable clinical markers for developing HF are changes in symptoms such as increased exertional dyspnea; additional symptoms prevalent in TM relate to liver congestion (abdominal or back pain and nausea) and dizziness/presyncope (arrhythmias), with other symptoms including failure to tolerate standard transfusions and orthopnea and peripheral edema as late symptoms. The absence of clinical features such as hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, raised jugular venous pressure, and lung crackles does not exclude severe cardiac impairment, classic signs may appear late and delay diagnosis, and blood tests are frequently abnormal with liver function tests and serum ferritin possibly raised because of congestion and elevated BNP expected but as a late sign.

### Identification of volume overload hospitalizations among hemodialysis patients using administrative claims: a validation study [^117B8KHw]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical adjudication of volume overload hospital admissions

For each sampled hospitalization, we conducted detailed clinical chart reviews to adjudicate the presence or absence of volume overload at the time of admission. We sought to identify hospitalizations of patients admitted with volume overload. Unlike other cardiovascular conditions, such as myocardial infarction, there is no established, objective definition for the clinical diagnosis of volume overload. Volume overloaded hemodialysis patients often present with a constellation of signs and symptoms indicative of fluid retention (e.g. shortness of breath, rales on lung auscultation, pulmonary edema on chest imaging, etc.) that may vary from individual to individual. Thus, an in-depth review of the medical record was necessary to capture all volume-related clinical findings associated with each sampled hospitalization. Medical chart notes (e.g. emergency department, admitting team and consult notes), chest and abdominal imaging reports, and cardiac procedure reports occurring within 24 h of admission were evaluated. Abstractors utilized a standardized data collection form (Additional file 1) to record symptoms, physical exam findings, imaging results, and clinical impressions. Each medical record was independently abstracted by two clinical reviewers who were blinded to the hospitalization's billed diagnosis and procedure codes and to the abstraction results of the other reviewer. Inter-abstractor discrepancies in individual data elements were resolved by a board-certified nephrologist (J.E.F) Initial agreement between abstractors was high across all data elements, ranging 98.1% (κ = 0.91) for subjective dyspnea to 100% (κ = 1.00) for central venous pressure. After review and error resolution, consensus was reached on all abstracted charts.

### Pulmonary edema… [^1117ZamQ]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary edema, also known as pulmonary congestion, is excessive fluid accumulation in the tissue or air spaces of the lungs. This leads to impaired gas exchange, most often leading to shortness of breath which can progress to hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Pulmonary edema has multiple causes and is traditionally classified as cardiogenic or noncardiogenic. Various laboratory tests and imaging studies are often used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. Treatment is focused on three aspects:

- improving respiratory function,
- treating the underlying cause, and
- preventing further damage and allow full recovery to the lung. Due to the complication rate associated with pulmonary artery catheterization, other imaging modalities and diagnostic methods have become more popular.

Imbalance in any of these forces can cause fluid movement causing a buildup of fluid where it should not normally be. Although rarely clinically measured, these forces allow physicians to classify and subsequently treat the underlying cause of pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema vs Congestive Heart Failure The term pulmonary edema literally means wet lungs. This term actually refers to a pathological condition of the lungs, frequently demonstrated by chest X-ray. Edema of the lungs should be thought of as the result of a disease such as congestive heart failure and not a disease in and of itself. In this case it would be a cardiac disease and not a pulmonary disease. The initiating acute event often a vascular event such as intense vasoconstriction and not a cardiac event such as myocardial infarction. The most noticeable abnormality is edema of the lungs. Nevertheless it is a cardiovascular disease not a pulmonary disease.

It is also known by other appellations including sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema. It is often associated with severe hypertension Typically, patients with the syndrome of flash pulmonary edema do not have chest pain are often not recognized as having a cardiovascular disease. Treatment of FPE should include reducing systemic vascular resistance with nitroglycerin, providing supplemental oxygenation, and decreasing left ventricular filling pressure. Effective treatment is evident by a decrease in dyspnea and normalization of vital signs. Important targets of therapy such as reduced systemic vascular resistance and reduced left atrial pressure are difficult if not impossible to monitor. Recurrence of FPE is thought to be associated with hypertension and may signify renal artery stenosis. Prevention of recurrence is based on managing or preventing hypertension, coronary artery disease, renovascular hypertension, and heart failure.

Direct lung injury Acute lung injury may cause pulmonary edema directly through injury to the vasculature and parenchyma of the lung, causes include:

- Inhalation of hot or toxic gases
- Pulmonary contusion, i.e., high-energy trauma
- Aspiration, e.g., gastric fluid
- Reexpansion, i.e. post large volume thoracocentesis, resolution of pneumothorax, post decortication, removal of endobronchial obstruction, effectively a form of negative pressure pulmonary oedema. Indirect lung injury
- Neurogenic causes.
- Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload occurs when multiple blood transfusions or blood-products are transfused over a short period of time.
- It includes acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Lack of durable natriuresis and objective decongestion following SGLT2 inhibition in randomized controlled trials of patients with heart failure [^113oYJMf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with acutely decompensated or chronic heart failure experience dyspnea at rest or exertion, which is typically accompanied by increased cardiac filling pressures and circulating levels of natriuretic peptides as well as physical signs of fluid retention (i.e. edema, ascites, pulmonary rales or pleural effusion). Many of these clinical and physiological abnormalities are related to the retention of sodium and water by the kidneys, and accordingly, treatment with loop diuretics or aquaretics are accompanied by symptomatic improvement, a reduction in cardiac filling pressures and natriuretic peptides, and alleviation of physical signs of congestion. Increases in right and left ventricular filling pressures can be substantially reduced by loop diuretic therapy (typically by > 10 mm Hg) in patients with or without overt physical signs of fluid retention (i.e. jugular venous distension, ascites or peripheral edema).

### Cardio-respiratory failure secondary to ectopic Cushing's syndrome as the index presentation of small-cell lung cancer [^114cuWSk]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 79-year-old woman, a smoker, presented to the emergency department with a 2-week history of progressive dyspnoea and peripheral oedema, preceded by flu-like symptoms that had failed to improve despite antibiotics. Examination identified severe hypertension and signs consistent with severe fluid overload. Baseline chest X ray showed a right-sided abnormality. In the context of an extensive smoking history CT thorax was indicated which demonstrated a right-sided hilar mass and lymphadenopathy. Blood tests showed an unexplained metabolic alkalosis with partial respiratory compensation and hypokalaemia prompting endocrinological tests investigating Cushing's syndrome. Urinary cortisol was measured at 3174 nmol/L/24 h (normal < 560), serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of 215 ng/L (normal < 46). Pleural fluid cytology confirmed a diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The patient's condition deteriorated despite intravenous diuretics and nitrates, metyrapone and non-invasive ventilation. Treatment was withdrawn 1 week after admission. The clinical course in the presence of biochemical derangement and SCLC is highly suggestive of paraneoplastic ectopic ACTH secretion.

### Heart failure and patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease from 15 countries [^111WUTnx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Variables and Measurement

Background characteristics pertained to sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral variables. Age, sex, and patient‐reported New York Heart Association functional class assessment were based on self‐report. Complexity of heart defect (ie, simple, moderate, complex), history of arrhythmias, cardiac device implantation, physical and mental comorbidities, and cardiac admissions were obtained by medical chart review. Behavioral variables, more specifically smoking status, substance use, and sports participation, were evaluated using the Health Behavior Scale‐CHD.

The diagnosis of HF was determined by a review of medical records. It was based on the evaluation from available clinical information including history (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue and/or history of weight gain), current and past treatments (diuretics, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers), physical examination (neck vein distention, pulmonary rales, ascites or pedal edema), hemodynamic assessment (imaging studies or cardiac catheterization), and other diagnostic tests (radiographic pulmonary congestion, signs of impaired end‐organ perfusion, and natriuretic peptide levels greater that the upper limit of normal). Patients were categorized into 3 groups: never HF; past but not current HF; or current HF.

Each participant completed a set of questionnaires to assess PROs. The following PROs were measured: (1) perceived health status using the 12‐item Short Form Health Survey version 2, and further divided into physical and mental component scores; (2) QoL using a Linear Analog Scale and the Satisfaction With Life Scale; (3) sense of coherence assessed by Orientation to Life Questionnaire; (4) psychological distress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; (5) illness perceptions assessed by Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire. The measurements, description, scale, interpretation, and references of PROs in APPROACH‐IS are detailed in Table S1.

Diversity Information

The present study is conducted and authored by researchers from 15 countries in 5 continents. Furthermore, 13 of the authors of the present study (43%) are women. In addition, both established and junior researchers are involved and represented as co‐authors. This study also included patients from low‐ and middle‐income countries (376/3959, 9.5%, defined according to the report from the World Bank Group in 2014). Patients from such countries are seldomly included in studies on PROs. Altogether, diversity received substantial attention in the set‐up of the present study.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure patient assessment — current symptoms and signs (clinical symptoms) defines standardized data elements and operational definitions for patient-reported symptoms: dyspnea at rest (patient "describes frequent uncomfortable awareness of breathing while resting in a sitting position"), dyspnea on exertion ("uncomfortable awareness of breathing while exerting him/herself") with the activity threshold specified ("Indicate degree of activity required to elicit dyspnea symp- tom") using options such as "Difficulty breathing while recumbent", "Running or other sport (specify sport)", "Walking up an incline (specify distance)", "Walking on a flat surface (specify distance)", "Stopping to rest while dressing", "Standing (specify length of time)", or "Other activity (eg, shopping or housework; specify)". Orthopnea is "Difficulty breathing while recumbent" with supine discomfort usually requiring "positioning with 2–3 pillows or in a chair or recliner to maintain comfortable breathing during sleep", and "Recurrent supine cough with other known cause may be an orthopnea equivalent". Bendopnea is "shortness of breath while bending over". Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is "awakening suddenly from sleep with uncomfortable awareness of breathing, or with general distress relieved by the upright position", with "Any report of this symptom lasting > 5 min is considered positive". Weight change records patient-reported gain or loss ("weight gain (+ value) or loss (− value)") with units "Numeric, kg". Fatigue is "Unusual tiredness and inability to perform usual activities".

### Causes and treatment of oedema in patients with heart failure [^113ZkXkp]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Oedema is one of the fundamental features of heart failure, but the pathophysiology of oedema varies. Patients present along a spectrum ranging from acute pulmonary oedema to gross fluid retention and peripheral oedema (anasarca). In patients with pure pulmonary oedema, the problem is one of acute haemodynamic derangement; the patient does not have excess fluid, but pulmonary venous pressure rises such that the rate of fluid transudation into the interstitium of the lung exceeds the capacity of the pulmonary lymphatics to drain away the fluid. Conversely, in patients with peripheral oedema, the problem is one of fluid retention. Understanding the causes of oedema will enable straightforward, correct management of the condition. For patients with acute pulmonary oedema, vasodilatation is important to reduce cardiac filling pressures. For patients with fluid retention, removing the fluid, using either diuretics or mechanical means, is the most important consideration.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: diagnosis and management [^112QDMNb]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome manifests as rapidly progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Diagnostic criteria include acute onset, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and the absence of left atrial hypertension. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is believed to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting neutrophil accumulation in the microcirculation of the lung. Neutrophils damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and difficult air exchange. Most cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. It is estimated that 7.1 percent of all patients admitted to an intensive care unit and 16.1 percent of all patients on mechanical ventilation develop acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. In-hospital mortality related to these conditions is between 34 and 55 percent, and most deaths are due to multiorgan failure. Acute respiratory distress syndrome often has to be differentiated from congestive heart failure, which usually has signs of fluid overload, and from pneumonia. Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume, high positive end-expiratory pressure, and conservative fluid therapy may improve outcomes. A spontaneous breathing trial is indicated as the patient improves and the underlying illness resolves. Patients who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients.

### Modern management of cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^111RHt9D]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) is a life-threatening condition that is frequently encountered in standard emergency medicine practice. Traditionally, diagnosis was based on physical assessment and chest radiography and treatment focused on the use of morphine sulfate and diuretics. Numerous advances in diagnosis and treatment have been made, however. Serum testing for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has improved the accuracy of diagnoses in these patients. Treatment should focus on fluid redistribution with aggressive preload and afterload reduction rather than simply on diuresis. Some specific medications and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have been shown to be safe and rapidly effective in improving patients' symptoms and improve outcomes.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure data standards — cardiovascular history (heart failure) define HF as a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood, with cardinal manifestations of dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and cause or lead to fluid retention with pulmonary and/or splanchnic congestion and/or peripheral edema; some patients have exercise intolerance but little evidence of fluid retention, whereas others complain primarily of edema, dyspnea, or fatigue; because some patients present without signs or symptoms of volume overload, the term HF is preferred over congestive HF; provider documentation or report of a former diagnosis of HF before a care encounter, or a previous hospital admission with a diagnosis of HF, is considered evidence of HF history. Permissible values for HF history are Yes, No, or Unknown. Additional notes specify there is no single diagnostic test for HF because it is largely a clinical diagnosis based on a careful history and physical examination, that a low EF alone, without clinical evidence of HF does not qualify as HF, and that HF subtypes are specified in Appendix 6.

Case Presentation

A 60-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the pulmonology clinic with 2 years of progressive weakness and shortness of breath. Showering and other activities of daily living caused him significant fatigue and dyspnea. He had a 20-pack-year smoking history, but no significant history of alcohol or illicit drug use. He did not take any prescribed or over-the-counter medications for chronic medical conditions and had never been on statin therapy. Vital signs were significant for an oxygen saturation of 91% on 4-L nasal cannula. He required up to 6 L of oxygen during a walk test. Physical examination showed mild inspiratory crackles in the lung bases, loud splitting of the second pulmonic valve (P2) with a right parasternal heave, and 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. There was muscle weakness, pain, and wasting of the proximal upper and lower extremities, particularly in his legs. He denied any joint pain, and there was no evidence of rash or dysphagia.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: diagnosis and management [^111VWk4M]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that manifests as rapidly progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Diagnostic criteria include onset within one week of a known insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary opacities on radiography, and inability to explain respiratory failure by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is thought to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting inflammatory cell accumulation in the alveoli and microcirculation of the lung. Inflammatory cells damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and decreased gas exchange. Most cases are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. ARDS is responsible for one in 10 admissions to intensive care units and one in four mechanical ventilations. In-hospital mortality for patients with severe ARDS ranges from 46% to 60%. ARDS often must be differentiated from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, which typically has signs of fluid overload. Treatment of ARDS is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure improve outcomes. Prone positioning is recommended for some moderate and all severe cases. As patients with ARDS improve and the underlying illness resolves, a spontaneous breathing trial is indicated to assess eligibility for ventilator weaning. Patients who survive ARDS are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients.

Patients on diuretics should regularly monitor body weight and seek medical advice in case of weight gain; kidney function and serum electrolytes should be regularly monitored, and intravascular volume depletion must be avoided due to risks of reduced cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. Clinicians should also recognize that fluid retention and oedema may be a side effect of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy.

### Epidemiology and aetiology of heart failure [^115a5Zyv]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on heart failure:

- **Definition**: HF is a clinical syndrome that results from structural or functional impairment of filling or ejection of blood from the heart. HF can be associated with either reduced ejection fraction (≤ 40%), preserved ejection fraction (≥ 50%), or borderline ejection fraction (41–50%).
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common causes of HF include ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, valvular and rheumatic heart disease, genetic cardiomyopathies, and congenital heart disease.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the age and sex-adjusted incidence of HF is estimated at 219.3 cases per 100,000 person-years. Its prevalence is estimated at 1915 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations relate to pulmonary edema (dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), peripheral edema (ankle swelling, abdominal bloating), and activation of inflammatory pathways (early satiety, cachexia). Severe HF leads to manifestations related to hypoperfusion, spanning from mild fatigue and exertional intolerance to cardiogenic shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year and 5-year mortality associated with HF are estimated at 20.2% and 56.2%, respectively. Death is due to non-cardiovascular events in over 50% of patients.

Case Presentation

A 59-year-old woman sought treatment for 5 weeks of progressive exercise intolerance. At the time of presentation, dyspnea limited her ability to speak in complete sentences. She also reported new orthopnea. Her respiratory symptoms improved with rest and while standing. She endorsed associated intermittent low-grade fevers, cough productive of scant clear sputum, lower extremity swelling, bloating, weight loss, and reduced appetite. She had undergone two recent admissions with similar symptoms to other hospitals, during which she was treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia and discharged after workups for infectious disease were unrevealing. She had a history notable for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed in 2006, complicated by lupus nephritis in 2009. Most recently, her SLE had been quiescent while she was taking hydroxychloroquine (400 mg daily) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 1 g twice daily). She reported baseline mild dyspnea with exertion since she received a diagnosis of SLE, but her symptoms had not previously affected her activities of daily living.

### Evaluation and management of dyspnea as the dominant presenting feature in neuromuscular disorders [^115G9eh7]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is a common symptom in neuromuscular disorders and, although multifactorial, it is usually due to respiratory muscle involvement, associated musculoskeletal changes such as scoliosis or, in certain neuromuscular conditions, cardiomyopathy. Clinical history can elicit symptoms such as orthopnea, trepopnea, sleep disruption, dysphagia, weak cough, and difficulty with secretion clearance. The examination is essential to assist with the diagnosis of an underlying neurologic disorder and determine whether dyspnea is from a cardiac or pulmonary origin. Specific attention should be given to possible muscle loss, use of accessory muscles of breathing, difficulty with neck flexion/extension, presence of thoraco-abdominal paradox, conversational dyspnea, cardiac examination, and should include a detailed neurological examination directed at the suspected differential diagnosis. Pulmonary function testing including sitting and supine spirometry, measures of inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, cough peak flow, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, pulse oximetry, transcutaneous CO 2, and arterial blood gases will help determine the extent of the respiratory muscle involvement, assess for hypercapnic or hypoxemic respiratory failure, and qualify the patient for noninvasive ventilation when appropriate. Additional testing includes dynamic imaging with sniff fluoroscopy or diaphragm ultrasound, and diaphragm electromyography. Polysomnography is indicated for sleep related symptoms that are not otherwise explained. Noninvasive ventilation alleviates dyspnea and nocturnal symptoms, improves quality of life, and prolongs survival. Therapy targeted at neuromuscular disorders may help control the disease or favorably modify its course. For patients who have difficulty with secretion clearance, support of expiratory function with mechanical insufflation-exsufflation, oscillatory devices can reduce the aspiration risk.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fluid retention and worsening HF indicates initiation of treatment has produced 4 types of adverse reactions, and initiation of therapy with a beta-blocker can cause fluid retention that is usually asymptomatic and is detected primarily by an increase in body weight but may become sufficiently marked to cause worsening symptoms of HF; physicians should ensure that patients are not volume overloaded before a beta-blocker is initiated, should monitor patients closely for increases in weight and for worsening signs and symptoms of HF, and should augment the dose of diuretic if weight increases whether or not other signs or symptoms of worsening HF are present; the occurrence of fluid retention or worsening HF is not generally a reason for the permanent withdrawal of treatment, as such patients generally respond favorably to intensification of conventional therapy and once treated remain excellent candidates for long-term treatment with a beta-blocker.

### Shortness of breath… [^116RLdaD]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Distinct sensations include effort/work to breathe, chest tightness or pain, and "air hunger". The tripod position is often assumed to be a sign. Dyspnea is a normal symptom of heavy physical exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations, when resting or during light exertion. In 85% of cases it is due to asthma, pneumonia, reflux/LPR, cardiac ischemia, COVID-19, interstitial lung disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or psychogenic causes, such as panic disorder and anxiety. The best treatment to relieve or even remove shortness of breath typically depends on the underlying cause. The tempo of onset and the duration of dyspnea are useful in knowing the etiology of dyspnea. Acute shortness of breath is usually connected with sudden physiological changes, such as laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax.

Patients with COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a mild onset and gradual progression of dyspnea on exertion, punctuated by acute exacerbations of shortness of breath. In contrast, most asthmatics do not have daily symptoms, but have intermittent episodes of dyspnea, cough, and chest tightness that are usually associated with specific triggers, such as an upper respiratory tract infection or exposure to allergens. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, most commonly emphysema or chronic bronchitis, frequently have chronic shortness of breath and a chronic productive cough. An acute exacerbation presents with increased shortness of breath and sputum production. COPD is a risk factor for pneumonia; thus this condition should be ruled out. In an acute exacerbation treatment is with a combination of anticholinergics, β₂-adrenoceptor agonists, steroids and possibly positive pressure ventilation.

Pneumothorax Pneumothorax presents typically with pleuritic chest pain of acute onset and shortness of breath not improved with oxygen. Physical findings may include absent breath sounds on one side of the chest, jugular venous distension, and tracheal deviation. Pneumonia The symptoms of pneumonia are fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. Inspiratory crackles may be heard on exam. A chest x-ray can be useful to differentiate pneumonia from congestive heart failure. As the cause is usually a bacterial infection, antibiotics are typically used for treatment. Diagnosis, however, may be difficult and Wells Score is often used to assess the clinical probability. Treatment, depending on the severity of symptoms, typically starts with anticoagulants; the presence of ominous signs may warrant the use of thrombolytic drugs.

Some patients report a numb sensation in their head, and others have reported blurred vision caused by hypotension behind the eye due to a lack of oxygen and pressure; these patients have reported severe head pains, which can lead to permanent brain damage. Symptoms can include loss of concentration, focus, fatigue, language faculty impairment, and memory loss. Cancer Shortness of breath is common in people with cancer and may be caused by numerous different factors. In people with advanced cancer, periods with severe shortness of breath may occur, along with a more continuous feeling of breathlessness. Treatments for breathlessness include both nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Nonpharmacological interventions that have shown to improve breathlessness include the use of fans, exercise, and pulmonary rehabilitation.

There is a wide variation in the clinical presentation of patients with shunting-related thrombosis, ranging from asymptomatic to a life-threatening condition. Patients primarily complain of shunt malfunction, followed by SVC syndrome, and cardiopulmonary symptoms.

Shunt malfunction

The most common clinical feature is subacute or chronic-onset shunt malfunction caused by a distal catheter thrombus. Some pathological situations can increase right atrial pressure, frequently as a consequence of PH, and lead to the recurrence of intracranial hypertension characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting, etc. Patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus may present with the "classic" triad of symptoms of hydrocephalus including psychomotor retardation, gait unsteadiness, and urinary incontinence associated with ventricular dilation.

SVC syndrome

SVC syndrome is a well-known complication to VAS. The basis for this is acute or subacute occlusion of the SVC caused by shunting-related thrombosis. Symptoms of this syndrome vary mainly according to the speed of onset of the obstruction. When obstruction develops slowly and progressively, a collateral circulation develops and symptoms are mild or absent. However, rapid obstruction can lead to significant edema and color changes on the upper extremity, neck, and face, with or without dysphagia, pain, and dyspnea. If the thrombus is located in jugular vein and large enough, it may appear as a neck mass lesion, which may be the only clue of thrombosis.

Cardiopulmonary symptoms

The most lethal complication of VAS is PE and subsequent PH. Detecting a patient with progressing PH is difficult because early clinical findings may be subtle and often be neglected. When the condition is advanced, the patient usually presents with a history of fatigue, coughing (sometimes haemoptysis), chest pain, dyspnea, and febrile episodes. Once symptomatic, PH tends to be relentlessly progressive, developing cor pulmonale and leading to death. Therefore, it has been suggested that regular monitoring for symptoms and signs of cardiopulmonary disease is mandatory, including shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, failure to thrive, jugular venous distension, cyanosis, precordial heaves, cardiomegaly, and peripheral edema. Physical examination may show a raised jugular venous pressure with enlargement of the liver and pitting edema of ankles and feet. Auscultation of the heart may reveal a diastolic murmur due to pulmonary valve insufficiency and a systolic murmur due to tricuspid insufficiency. Lack of awareness of an association between progressive respiratory symptom in a VAS and PH may result in delayed diagnosis.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^111TYrv1]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

NASEMSO model clinical guideline — prehospital airway management assessment outlines history elements to assess for time of onset, severity of shortness of breath and sensation of dyspnea, pace of symptoms (gradual, progressive, paroxysmal, persistent or intermittent), palliating or provoking factors, associated symptoms and triggers for dyspnea (e.g., exertion, exercise, lying flat, environmental factors), history of asthma or other respiratory disorders, recent infection/other exposures/cough (presence, productive), patient medications, history of trauma or overdose/intoxication, prior similar episodes (e.g., intubation, ICU stay, anaphylaxis, angioedema, airway surgery, tracheostomy), what has helped in the past, and home interventions (e.g., increased home oxygen, nebulizer). Physical examination — assess for initial impression of severity and patient status, skin color, cyanosis, pallor, diaphoresis, evidence of upper airway obstruction (including choking), abnormal respiratory pattern, rate and/or effort, use of accessory muscles, jugular venous distention (JVD), quality of voice and number of words/sentences spoken, and auscultate for quality of air exchange including depth of respiration and equality of breath sounds and abnormal breath sounds (e.g., wheezing, rhonchi, rales, or stridor). Additional assessments include skin color and diaphoresis, mental status including anxiety, stupor, obtundation, airway obstruction with foreign body or swelling (e.g., angioedema, posterior pharyngeal, and laryngeal infections), signs of a difficult airway, signs of fluid overload (e.g. JVD, ascites, peripheral edema), traumatic injuries impairing upper and lower airway anatomy and physiology, and pediatric assessment using the Pediatric Assessment Triangle for initial impression of severity with appearance descriptors (awake, alert, sitting upright, confused, sleepy, unresponsive).

An 80-year-old woman from Iran presented to our institution for evaluation of insidious onset of dyspnea and progressive hypoxemia. She had a history of hypertension, COPD attributed to secondhand smoke, and an unprovoked pulmonary embolus that was treated with lifelong anticoagulation. In addition, she had a history of latent TB status posttreatment with isoniazid 10 years prior. One year ago, home oxygen therapy was started at 4 L/min via nasal cannula, and because of her decline, her son had brought her to the United States 3 months earlier for medical help. After a contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan followed by a nondiagnostic thoracentesis, another hospital informed her that she likely had inoperable lung cancer. She presented to our institution for a second opinion.

### Causes and evaluation of chronic dyspnea [^113qXGEN]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea is shortness of breath that lasts more than one month. The perception of dyspnea varies based on behavioral and physiologic responses. Dyspnea that is greater than expected with the degree of exertion is a symptom of disease. Most cases of dyspnea result from asthma, heart failure and myocardial ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, or psychogenic disorders. The etiology of dyspnea is multifactorial in about one-third of patients. The clinical presentation alone is adequate to make a diagnosis in 66 percent of patients with dyspnea. Patients' descriptions of the sensation of dyspnea may be helpful, but associated symptoms and risk factors, such as smoking, chemical exposures, and medication use, should also be considered. Examination findings (e.g., jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds or wheezing, pleural rub, clubbing) may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Initial testing in patients with chronic dyspnea includes chest radiography, electrocardiography, spirometry, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel. Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide levels may help exclude heart failure, and D-dimer testing may help rule out pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary function studies can be used to identify emphysema and interstitial lung diseases. Computed tomography of the chest is the most appropriate imaging study for diagnosing suspected pulmonary causes of chronic dyspnea. To diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension or certain interstitial lung diseases, right heart catheterization or bronchoscopy may be needed.

### Heart failure events in randomized controlled trials for adults receiving maintenance dialysis: a meta-epidemiologic study [^115Prvs3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 3:
Characteristics of included studies with heart failure event definitions (10 studies).

The diagnostic criteria for heart failure events in the 10 RCTs that included heart failure diagnostic criteria are shown in Table 4. Heart failure events with definitions included heart failure (three, 30%), heart failure hospitalization (five, 50%) and a composite of heart failure hospitalization and death due to heart failure/pump failure (two, 20%). Heart failure diagnostic criteria differed across RCTs with regards symptoms, signs, laboratory tests, imaging, healthcare utilization, and interventions (Table 5). Across the 10 RCTs with heart failure diagnostic criteria, symptoms were required in five RCTs (50%) including at least one of dyspnoea (five, 50%), orthopnoea (one, 10%), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (one, 10%), or fatigue (two, 20%), and signs were required in five RCTs (50%) including peripheral oedema (two, 20%), rales/crackles (four, 40%), an S3 (two, 20%), or elevated JVP (four, 40%). Two RCTs (20%) required an increase in interdialytic weight gain and one (10%) required an elevated brain natriuretic peptide as part of diagnostic criteria. Imaging showing pulmonary venous congestion was required in diagnostic criteria including interstitial oedema (four, 40%) and vascular redistribution (four, 40%) or an elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure/pulmonary wedge capillary pressure (three, 30%) or other findings on echocardiography (two, 20%). For 6 of the 10 RCTs (60%) the heart failure outcome required presentation to acute care setting (e.g. dialysis unit, emergency room, hospitalization) of which three out of six (50%) of these specified that it had to be unplanned and three out of six (50%) the primary reason for hospitalization. Intensification of medical therapy was defined as one or more of the following in these RCTs: 4 out of 10 (40%) RCTs required ultrafiltration or dialysis, 1 out of 10 (10%) RCTs required intravenous diuretics, and 1 out of 10 (10%) RCTs required a mechanical or surgical intervention. No trial distinguished heart failure from volume overload (e.g. from non-adherence with dietary sodium/fluid restriction or dialysis) and only one trial permitted heart failure to occur during an ongoing hospitalization for another condition in which heart failure became a major component of the hospitalization.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^116kKPT5]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Fluid status assessment

Accurate volume status evaluation is essential for appropriate therapy as inadequate assessment of volume status can result in not providing necessary treatment or in the administration of unneeded therapy, both associated with increased mortality. There are several methods to evaluate fluid status; however, most of the tests currently used are fairly inaccurate. We will describe some of these methods.
History and physical examination: The usefulness of medical history, symptoms, and signs along with routine diagnostic studies (chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)) that differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department were evaluated in a meta-analysis. Many features increased the probability of heart failure, with the best feature for each category being the presence of past history of heart failure (positive LR = 5.8; 95% CI, 4.1–8.0); paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (positive LR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–4.5); third heart sound gallop (positive LR = 11; 95% CI, 4.9–25.0); chest radiograph showing pulmonary venous congestion (positive LR = 12.0; 95% CI, 6.8–21.0); and electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation (positive LR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7–8.8). A low serum BNP proved to be the most useful test (serum BNP < 100 pg/mL; negative LR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07–0.16). Importantly, signs like pulmonary rales, lower extremity edema, and jugular venous distention have significant limits for assessing fluid overload. There are some studies that have correlated these sings during physical examination and invasive measures (e.g. pulmonary catheter wedge pressure (PCWP)). Butman et al. found that the presence of jugular venous distension, at rest or inducible, had a sensitivity (81%), and a specificity (80%) for elevation of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (≥ 18 mmHg). Using hepato-jugular reflux and Valsalva maneuvers, Marantz et al. showed that these maneuvers were valid in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure in acutely dyspneic patients, with low a sensitivity (24%) and a high specificity (94%). On the other hand, in a prospective study, physical signs of fluid overload were compared with hemodynamic measurements in 50 patients with known chronic heart failure. Sings like rales, edema, and elevated mean jugular venous pressures were absent in 18 of 43 patients with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures ≥ 22 mmHg. The combination of these signs had a sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 100%.
Chest radiography Chest x-ray has been one of the most used tests to evaluate for hypervolemia. Radiographic sings of volume overload include dilated upper lobe vessels, cardiomegaly, interstitial edema, enlarged pulmonary artery, pleural effusion, alveolar edema, prominent superior vena cava, and Kerley lines. However, up to 20% of patients diagnosed with heart failure had negative chest radiographs at initial emergency department evaluation. Additionally, these radiographic sings can be minimal in patients with late-stage heart failure. In patients with congestive heart failure, radiographic signs had poor predictive value for identifying patients with PCWP values ≥ 30 mmHg where radiographic pulmonary congestion was absent in 39% of patients. The X-ray technique and the clinical status of patient impact radiographic performance for detecting volume overload. Portably chest X-ray, reduce the sensitivity of findings of volume overload, and pleural effusions can be missed if the film is performed supine. With intubated patients and patients with pleural effusions, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of supine chest X-ray was reported to be as low as 60%, 70%, and 67% respectively. Conversely, the frequency of volume overload findings in the chest X-ray increased with the severity of fluid overload such as severe heart failure.
Natriuretic peptides High levels of BNP can be found with volume overload; however, some conditions like myocardial infraction and pulmonary embolism can cause elevated levels of BNP. Other conditions that have to be taken into account when evaluating BNP levels are obesity, associated with lower BNP levels and renal failure, associated with high BNP levels. Patients with heart failure who have elevated base-line levels of BNP. The greatest utility of BNP levels is in the absence of elevation, since low BNP levels have a high negative predictive value for excluding heart failure diagnosis. On the other hand, high BNP levels can be non-specific for volume overload.
Bioimpedance vector analysis Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a commonly used method for estimating body composition, specifically detecting soft tissue hydration with a 2–3% measurement error. It is a noninvasive, inexpensive and highly versatile test that transforms electrical properties of tissues into clinical information. Bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) measures whole body fluid volume and is based on patterns of the resistance-reactance graph, relating body impedance to body hydration. Clinical information on hydration is obtained through patterns of vector distribution with respect to the healthy population of the same race, sex, class of body mass index, and age. Changes in tissue hydration status below 500 mL are detected and ranked. BIVA was examined as an indicator of fluid status compared to central venous pressure (CVP) in 121 critically ill patients. In this study patients were classified in three groups according to their CVP value: low (0 to 3 mmHg); medium (4 to 12 mmHg); and high (13 to 20 mmHg). The agreement between BIVA and central venous pressure indications was good in the high CVP group, moderate in the medium CVP group, and poor in low CVP group. The combined evaluation of peripheral tissue hydration (BIVA) and central filling pressure (CVP) could provide a useful clinical assessment instrument in the planning of fluid therapy in critically ill patients, particularly in those with low CVP.
Thoracic ultrasound Sonographic artifacts known as B-lines that suggest thickened interstitial or fluid-filled alveoli can be detected using thoracic ultrasound (Fig. 1). PCWP and fluid accumulation in lungs have been correlated with the presence of B-lines ("comet-tail images") in patients with congestive heart failure. Agricola et al. used thoracic ultrasound to detect "comet-tail images" and obtained an individual patient comet-tail image score by summing the number of B-lines in each of the scanned spaces assessed (right and left hemi thorax, from second to fourth intercostals' space, from para-sternal to mid-axillary line); authors found significant positive linear correlations between comet-tail images score and extra-vascular lung water determined by the PiCCO System, between comet score and PCWP, and between comet-tail images score and radiologic sings of fluid overload in the lungs. Fig. 1 Lung comet tail image. 'B lines' also known as comet-tail images are a marker of pulmonary edema. In the presence of extravascular lung water the reflection of the ultrasound beam on the sub-pleural interlobular septa thickened by edema creates comet-tail reverberation artifacts. The ultrasound appearance is of a vertical, discrete, hyperechogenic image that arises from the pleural line and extends to the bottom of the screen moving synchronously with the respiration (white arrows)
Vena cava diameter ultrasound The measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter can also be use to assess volume status. Normal diameter of IVC is 1.5 to 2.5 cm (measured 3 cm from the right atrium); volume depletion is considered with an IVC diameter < 1.5 cm while an IVC diameter > 2.5 cm suggests volume overload. In an observational study on blood donors, Lyon et al. evaluated the inferior vena cava diameter (IVCd) during inspiration (IVCd i) and during expiration (IVCd e), before and after blood donation of 450 mL. Significant differences were found between the IVCd e before and after blood donation and between IVCd i before and after donation (5.5 mm and 5.16 mm, respectively). In patients treated for hypovolemia, Zengin et al. evaluated the IVC and right ventricle (RVd) diameters and diameter changes with the diameters and diameter changes of healthy volunteers. The IVCd was measured ultrasonographically by M-mode in the subxiphoid area and the RVd was measured in the third and fourth intercostals spaces before and after fluid resuscitation. As compare with healthy volunteers average diameters in hypovolemic patients of the IVC during inspiration and expiration, and right ventricule diameter were significantly lower. After fluid resuscitation, there was a significant increase in mean IVC diameters during inspiration and expiration as well as in the right ventricule diameter. Bedside inferior vena cava diameter and right ventricule diameter evaluation could be a practical noninvasive instrument for fluid status estimation and for evaluating the response to fluid therapy in critically ill patients.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study population

This multicenter, prospective registry study enrolled participants from 12 clinical sites in the United States and Australia. All adult patients aged ≥ 21 years admitted with a primary diagnosis of ADHF, regardless of LVEF, were screened. Informed consent was obtained from participants who met enrollment criteria and agreed to participate. Participants were categorized into one of three groups, ADHF alone, ADHF + WRF, and ADHF + WRF + persistent congestion at 96‐h post‐admission. Data collection varied by group, with the ADHF + WRF + persistent congestion group having the most extensive data collection. Due to the observational nature of this study, informed consent requirements were based on the local requirements of each participating institution and varied in level. For example, some sites require that all participants provide written informed consent before any screening took place, while others only required participants to provide written informed consent if they were assigned to the full data collection group (ADHF + WRF + persistent congestion). The institutional review boards at each of the 12 study sites approved the protocol and consent forms. Participants were enrolled from April 2019 to March 2020.

An increase in creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL from baseline was used to define WRF, consistent with prior studies. The baseline creatinine and WRF were determined by site investigators from data obtained during the hospitalization or in the 90 days before hospital admission. The presence of persistent congestion at 96‐h post‐admission was defined by signs, symptoms, or objective findings of HF. If hemodynamic measurements were obtained, persistent congestion was defined as PCWP > 22 mmHg or CVP > 10 mmHg. In the absence of hemodynamic measurements, physical exam findings (e.g. lower extremity edema, ascites, elevated jugular venous pressure, or pulmonary rales), clinical symptoms (e.g. dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea), and confirmatory tests (e.g. chest x‐ray or echocardiography) were used.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the acute care setting: best practice [^114FBcnb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular Morbidities

Cardiovascular morbidities are frequently present in patients experiencing ECOPDs, and thus a patient history is important to assess their presence or impact. Chest pain/discomfort, fluid retention, or irregular pulse suggest a cardiovascular cause as an alternative or contributing diagnosis to an ECOPD.

Acute HF

Acute HF is defined by worsening of dyspnea at rest (particularly while supine) or during exertion and/or fatigue, together with signs of fluid retention such as pulmonary congestion, increased jugular vein distension, or ankle swelling, with objective evidence of an abnormality of the structure or function of the heart. Some of these clinical findings can make distinguishing ECOPD from acute HF difficult. In addition, COPD is present in up to 50% of patients with HF, and HF occurs in roughly 20% of individuals with COPD because of overlapping risk factors (aging and smoking) and underlying mechanisms (systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and muscular atrophy). Furthermore, an HF diagnosis is often difficult to confirm in patients with preserved ejection fraction, which is common in patients with COPD. Hypoxemia and tachycardia in ECOPD can promote decompensation in HF, whereas pulmonary fluid retention in HF can worsen airway obstruction. In addition, wheezing is common in acute HF (approximately 30%), whereas COPD can mask the presence of basilar crackles. However, their presence, coupled with evidence of leg edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and a third heart sound increases the likelihood of HF being the cause of, or a contributor to, the acute event.

### Continuous versus bolus intermittent loop diuretic infusion in acutely decompensated heart failure: a prospective randomized trial [^1178zu3L]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Supplementary treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physician. All patients took angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and nitrates. No thiazide diuretics, nesiritide, or arginine vasopressin antagonists were administered during the hospitalization period. Hypertonic saline solution was administered to the patients who developed hyponatremia (serum Na values < 128 mEq/L) during treatment with the goal of restoring plasma sodium values up to 134 mEq/L. For this reason Na concentration was monitored each day during the infusion period. The hypertonic saline solution consisted of 20 mEq of NaCl in 500 mL saline solutions (0.9% of NaCl). Infusion was administered at 80 cc/h once or twice a day, depending on the Na value. Dopamine infusions were administered to patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg with the goal of restoring systolic values up to 100 mmHg maintaining diuretic infusion. Inotrope therapy was stopped when blood pressure values were sustained at approximately 105 mmHg during 12 sequential hours for four consecutive measurements.

The frequency of laboratory tests to evaluate electrolyte balance and renal function during hospitalization was at the discretion of the attending physician but was guided by a dose-escalation algorithm. This trial was approved by our hospital's Institutional Review Board of Siena and all patients gave their signed informed consent. This trial was registered and regularly updated in ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier number: NCT01441245.

Inclusion criteria

Patients over age 18 years of age were screened if they met diagnostic criteria for ADHF due to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% by exhibiting at least one of the following symptoms at rest: dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema or major fatigue and at least two clinical signs including rales, pulmonary congestion on chest radiography, jugular vein dilatation, or a third heart sound. Elevations in blood BNP > 400 pg/mL were considered supportive for a diagnosis of ADHF.

Exclusion criteria

Patients were excluded if they had received more than two IV doses of furosemide or any continuous infusion of furosemide one month before randomization, if they had end-stage renal disease or the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or ultrafiltration), isolated diastolic dysfunction with LVEF > 45% or recent myocardial infarction within thirty days of screening. Patients with a systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg or with serum creatinine levels > 4.0 mg/dL were also excluded, as well as patients who received recent intravenous iodinated contrast.

### Fluid volume homeostasis in heart failure: a tale of 2 circulations [^117RdkLY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

"CONGESTION" — THE FAILURE IN HEART FAILURE

The development of symptomatic clinical congestion, interpreted often as fluid volume overload, is the most common basis for hospitalization in patients with chronic HF. The relief of congestion, therefore, is a central goal of intervention, and diuretic therapy is often the mainstay to achieve that goal. In this context "congestion" most often refers to "clinical congestion" with signs and symptoms (dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulmonary rales, and interstitial‐alveolar edema, and peripheral edema, ascites) reflecting the patient's decompensation from a previous stable state. Such findings do not necessarily reflect isolated pathophysiologic responses of hemodynamic, intravascular volume, or myocardial function therefore, making it important to recognize that "congestion" is not a single defining element of decompensation, but the result of multiple mechanisms producing different manifestations and degrees of volume exacerbation, some of which evolve to a symptomatic state while others do not. Thus, there can exist a full spectrum of volume expansion and fluid redistribution with hemodynamic congestion associated with elevation in central filling pressures without symptoms and then progress to a state of symptomatic clinical congestion — therefore, not all "congestion" behaves the same. Further, congestion in HF is not solely attributable to central venous volume and hemodynamic changes as the interstitial‐lymphatic system also has an integral role.

INTRODUCTION

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome with symptoms and/or signs caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality corroborated by objective evidence of congestion and/or elevated ventricular filling pressures. Heart failure is a common comorbidity in patients with kidney failure receiving dialysis and is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality. While cardiovascular (CV) events are clearly recognized as important to patients with kidney disease, there is uncertainty as to whether CV events, including heart failure, are defined adequately in patients with kidney failure. Heart failure events are particularly problematic because they share many features of pure volume overload due to dietary sodium and fluid non-adherence or underdialysis that can make the entities frequently clinically indistinguishable in clinical and research settings.

In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), outcome events are ideally important to both patients and clinicians by virtue of their prognostic relevance (e.g. impact on survival, function, or quality of life). Outcome events should also be easily differentiated from other events that are dissimilar in their importance and pathophysiology. We make a distinction between a diagnostic definition, which provides the concept of a diagnosis (e.g. elevated cardiac filling pressures due to cardiac dysfunction), and diagnostic criteria, which provide explicit criteria that clinicians can use to establish a diagnosis (e.g. diagnostic criteria for heart failure requires dyspnoea and at least one of the of the following signs [i.e. elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), respiratory crackles, S3] and either radiographic findings [i.e. vascular redistribution, interstitial pulmonary oedema] with implementation of heart failure treatments such as diuretics or ultrafiltration and documented clinical improvement). When diagnostic criteria are poorly specified, they introduce 'noise', which quickly diminishes statistical power and makes the interpretation of treatment effects challenging. In heart failure populations without concomitant kidney failure, standardized consensus diagnostic criteria for heart failure events exist and these diagnostic criteria help ensure events are of similar meaning to stakeholders (i.e. patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, researchers, industry, regulators), are prognostically relevant, comparable across clinical studies, and ideally have shared pathophysiology to facilitate the identification of effective therapies.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure (HF) clinical syndrome and etiologies — The cardinal manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and fluid retention leading to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema, and the term heart failure is preferred over congestive heart failure because not all patients have volume overload at evaluation. The syndrome may result from pericardial, myocardial, endocardial, or great vessel disorders, with most symptoms due to impairment of left ventricular (LV) myocardial function, and HF may range from normal LV size with preserved ejection fraction (EF) to severe dilatation and/or markedly reduced EF. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease are substantial causes, and as many as 30% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may have a genetic cause. HF is not equivalent to cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction; it is defined as a clinical syndrome with specific symptoms and signs, and there is no single diagnostic test because diagnosis is based on careful history and physical examination.

### Evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension-consensus statement from the ISHLT [^116DHDtr]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) — maintaining a high index of suspicion is essential in patients with risk factors in the context of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients with a new diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and in patients with unexplained dyspnea. Risk factors include CT findings suggestive of CTEPH, evidence of PH on echocardiogram, large clot burden, recurrent or unprovoked PE, history of splenectomy, infected pacemaker leads, chronic inflammatory disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, hypothyroidism, ventriculo-atrial shunt, and persistent symptoms despite anticoagulation. There is no indication to administer thrombolytic therapy to prevent CTEPH, and if CTEPH is suspected, screening investigations should be performed after 3 months of anticoagulation with echocardiogram and VQ scan, with earlier assessment if worrisome signs or symptoms of heart failure are present.

### We should avoid the term "fluid overload" [^115MKcBB]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Using the right word or phrase to describe a specific pathologic process/patient diagnosis and/or status is important, not only within the intensive care unit team, but also when we communicate with external consultants. This is not just a question of semantics. Using incorrect terms can lead to misunderstanding and even to incorrect therapeutic decisions. For example, it is not uncommon to see clinicians examining an edematous patient, saying that the patient has "fluid overload" or "hypervolemia" or both and proposing fluid restriction and/or diuretics as the logical strategy, when often during the acute phases of resuscitation from circulatory shock this approach may be inappropriate.

A fundamental determinant of cardiac output and its ability to vary in response to changing metabolic demands is the body's effective circulating blood volume. Total circulating blood volume is distributed throughout the circulatory system into vessels that can initially be filled without changing their distending pressures because they merely alter their conformation rather than stretch, rather like a large empty balloon that will not have any measurable distending pressure when air is initially blown into it. Once filled beyond this volume, however, wherein conformational changes alone cannot accept more air without requiring the balloon's walls to stretch, the distending pressure will start to increase. The volume in the balloon below this point is called its unstressed volume. In the body, this unstressed volume accounts for between 60 and 70% of the total circulating blood volume. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the amount of unstressed volume can be rapidly and dynamically changed by changing blood flow distribution, increasing surrounding tissue pressure, or increasing venomotor tone. The effective circulating blood volume reflects the proportion of blood volume above the unstressed volume and is essentially independent of arterial pressure, because arterial pressure is dissipated across the high resistance arterioles, analogous to a "vascular waterfall". The stressed blood volume relative to the venous compliance defines the mean circulatory filling pressure, which is the back pressure to venous flow from the body back to the right ventricle. The primary reason for giving fluids during resuscitation is to increase the stressed circulatory blood volume, thus causing mean circulatory filling pressure to rise. If the heart can handle this increased driving pressure, then venous return increases causing cardiac output to rise. If the effective circulating blood volume is low, then mean circulatory filling pressure is also low, and if the effective circulating blood volume is high, then mean circulatory filling pressure is also high.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Assessment of volume status in heart failure (HF) is described as critically important at the initial and each follow-up visit; at each visit clinicians should record body weight and sitting and standing blood pressures and determine jugular venous distension, organ congestion, and peripheral edema. The most reliable sign of volume overload is jugular venous distension, and right-sided filling pressures are elevated in the basal state or with abdominal compression in many patients with chronically elevated left-sided filling pressures. Most patients with peripheral edema should be considered to have volume overload, whereas most patients with chronic HF do not have rales; studies using 131I-tagged albumin showed plasma volume expansion in more than 50% of patients in whom clinical volume overload was not recognized. Short-term changes in fluid status are best assessed by measuring changes in body weight. The majority with clinical evidence of volume overload do not exhibit hypoperfusion, but when cardiac output declines markedly or abruptly, clues include narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, altered mentation, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, resting tachycardia, and disproportionate elevation of blood urea nitrogen relative to serum creatinine.

Heart failure versus volume overload

Volume overload and neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms involved in kidney failure can overlap with the symptoms, signs, haemodynamics, and cardiac biomarker profiles of heart failure making the distinction between the two challenging if not impossible. In these cases, the cause of the symptoms and signs of volume overload is a distinct entity to which treatment is often primarily directed, in addition to heart failure if is clinically apparent. Whether or not heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction is present may help guide clinical decision making including additional investigation (e.g. imaging, angiography) and goal directed medical therapy. These events are often relevant to clinical events adjudication committees of RCTs, where events may be considered as an 'events with heart failure' rather than a 'primary heart failure event'. An important concept that supports the differentiation of these competing diagnoses are that the symptoms and signs of heart failure may disappear once the underlying primary cause is treated, for example, symptoms and signs that mimic heart failure may resolve with dialysis if a patient may have missed one or more dialysis treatments or was non-adherent with salt/water restriction, which may also be the case in patients with heart failure without kidney disease. Unfortunately, rigorously distinguishing the two entities is complicated by the high prevalence of abnormal cardiac structure and function in patients with kidney failure. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed that attempt to distinguish those with heart failure that is or is not responsive to ultrafiltration but most patients with CKD, and presumably kidney failure, would meet echocardiographic criteria proposed by Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative resulting in an overdiagnosis of heart failure without providing substantial additional prognostic information or change in clinical management. Nevertheless, clinicians frequently make distinctions between heart failure and volume overload, and administrative data suggest that patients receiving dialysis with a hospitalization diagnosis of heart failure have substantially worse prognosis that those diagnosed with only fluid overload or pulmonary oedema. This implies that valuable clinical distinctions are being made, although the clinical reasoning underlying this is yet to be formalized into a data driven definition with validated diagnostic criteria that can be practically implemented in clinical trial settings.

Clinical Characteristics

Prevalence of HF in the ARIC study at visit 5 was based on physician committee–adjudicated HF hospitalizations occurring since 2005 (as previously published); International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 428 for hospitalizations prior to 2005; or HF self-report at visits 3 through 5 or on annual follow-up telephone calls. For adjudicated hospitalizations, centrally trained and certified physicians adjudicated the HF diagnosis as definite, possible, or chronic HF. History of COPD was ascertained based on participants responding affirmatively to either of the following standardized questions: "Has a doctor ever told you that you had emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (also called COPD)?" or "Has a doctor ever told you that you had chronic bronchitis?" Questions were administered at study visits and annual follow-up telephone calls.

Hypertension, diabetes, and smoking status were defined as previously described. Coronary disease (ie, myocardial infarction or coronary intervention) and stroke were ascertained through ongoing ARIC study surveillance of deaths and hospitalizations and through annual telephone interviews and were centrally adjudicated as previously described. Edema was defined as the presence of bilateral pitting leg edema when the participant was lying flat. Body mass index was calculated from measured weight and standing height, with obesity defined as BMI of 30 or more. Participants who reported dyspnea were classified as potentially having HFpEF based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelinesif the following were present: (1) a sign of HF (ie, edema); (2) N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) higher than 125 pg/mL; and (3) an abnormal echocardiographic marker of structure (ie, LV hypertrophy or left atrial [LA] enlargement) or function (ie, abnormal Doppler diastolic function indices of early diastolic myocardial velocity [e′] or ratio of early mitral inflow velocity [E] to e′).

INTERMACS profiles — advanced heart failure severity classification (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) defines seven clinical profiles with characteristic features: Critical cardiogenic shock is characterized by life-threatening hypotension with rapidly escalating inotropic/pressor support and critical organ hypoperfusion often confirmed by worsening acidosis and lactate; progressive decline describes patients "dependent" on inotropes with continuing deterioration or refractory volume overload when inotropes cannot be maintained because of tachyarrhythmias, clinical ischemia, or other intolerance; stable but inotrope dependent indicates clinical stability on mild–moderate intravenous inotropes or temporary circulatory support with repeated failure to wean; resting symptoms on oral therapy at home includes frequent congestion at rest or with activities of daily living with possible orthopnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, disabling ascites, or severe lower extremity edema; exertion intolerant patients are comfortable at rest but unable to engage in any activity and are housebound; exertion limited patients are comfortable at rest without fluid overload and can perform minor activities outside the home but develop fatigue within a few minutes or with any meaningful physical exertion; advanced NYHA class III patients are clinically stable with a reasonable level of comfortable activity, usually able to walk more than a block, but any decompensation requiring intravenous diuretics or hospitalization within the previous month should be classified lower. Modifier options include recurrent decompensations for Profiles 3 to 6 defined by frequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations (generally at least 2 in past 3 mo or 3 in past 6 mo) for intravenous diuresis, ultrafiltration, or brief inotropic therapy; if a Profile 7 patient meets these criteria, the patient should be moved to Profile 6 or worse; additional modifiers include recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias (eg, frequent ICD shocks or external defibrillation, usually more than twice weekly) or temporary circulatory support for hospitalized patients Profiles 1 to 3.

### Acute dyspnea in the office [^116DHAUM]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory difficulty is a common presenting complaint in the outpatient primary care setting. Because patients may first seek care by calling their physician's office, telephone triage plays a role in the early management of dyspnea. Once the patient is in the office, the initial goal of assessment is to determine the severity of the dyspnea with respect to the need for oxygenation and intubation. Unstable patients typically present with abnormal vital signs, altered mental status, hypoxia, or unstable arrhythmia, and require supplemental oxygen, intravenous access and, possibly, intubation. Subsequent management depends on the differential diagnosis established by a proper history, physical examination, and ancillary studies. Dyspnea is most commonly caused by respiratory and cardiac disorders. Other causes may be upper airway obstruction, metabolic acidosis, a psychogenic disorder, or a neuromuscular condition. Differential diagnoses in children include bronchiolitis, croup, epiglottitis, and foreign body aspiration. Pertinent history findings include cough, sore throat, chest pain, edema, and orthopnea. The physical examination should focus on vital signs and the heart, lungs, neck, and lower extremities. Significant physical signs are fever, rales, wheezing, cyanosis, stridor, or absent breath sounds. Diagnostic work-up includes pulse oximetry, complete blood count, electrocardiography, and chest radiography. If the patient is admitted to the emergency department or hospital, blood gases, ventilation-perfusion scan, D-dimer tests, and spiral computed tomography can help clarify the diagnosis. In a stable patient, management depends on the underlying etiology of the dyspnea.

### Rituximab induced lung injury [^115N2a5G]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 73-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of DLBCL presented to the emergency department with a four-day history of worsening shortness of breath and hypoxemia 88% on room air requiring 2–3 L supplemental oxygen. Her social history includes a 25-pack year of tobacco smoking which she quit 33 years before her diagnosis. Pertinent family history includes breast cancer in her mother and sister. The patient has received both sars-cov-2 and influenza vaccination for the year.

Two weeks prior to her current presentation, patient had received the first cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Her initial infusion was complicated by an episode of lacy, erythematous rash that was attributed to potential hypersensitivity reaction. A week after administration, she was noted to have persistent dyspnea associated with small pleural effusion and lower extremity edema. She was started on a diuretic for concern for possible volume overload with a close follow up in a week. No thoracentesis was done given small size and no safe window.

Upon presentation to the emergency department, she was visibly dyspneic at rest and with minimal exertion. Initial vitals showed a normal temperature of 36.9 °C, blood pressure, 124/75 and heart rate at 100 beats per minute. On physical examination, her pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse rhonchi with decreased breath sounds at the left lower lung base and 1 + putting edema in the lower extremity.

Initial work up in the emergency room included complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), Troponin, prothrombin (PT) and international normalized ration (INR), Urinalysis, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiography (chest x-ray), and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest. EKG showed premature atrial complexes, inferior infarct, and a shortened QT interval. Chest x-ray revealed a left perihilar opacity and a small left pleural effusion. Chest tomography angiogram of the chest revealed no pulmonary embolism, multifocal ground glass opacities (GGO) present in all five lobes, emphysema, and trace left pleural effusion with atelectasis (Fig. 1). Labs demonstrated mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count.

### Global, regional, and national burdens of heart failure in adolescents and young adults aged 10–24 years from 1990 to 2021: an analysis of data from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^114xgRT6]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome with symptoms and signs that result from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood.HF is a major global health and economic burden, affecting more than 60 million population worldwide. From a clinical viewpoint, HF is mainly characterized by symptoms such as breathlessness and fatigue, and physical signs, including ankle swelling, pulmonary crackles, and elevated jugular venous pressure. These clinical presentations are typically seen in HF patients aged 70 years and older, among whom ischemic heart disease (ICH) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common causes. By contrast, previous studies have indicated that congenital heart disease (CHD), cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis are common causes of HF in adolescents and young adults of 10–24 years old. The clinical presentation of HF in the population of 10–24 years old can vary markedly by age, underlying etiology, and disease severity. In addition to respiratory symptoms and peripheral edema signs, growth retardation, failure to thrive, peripheral cyanosis and pallor, chest pain, and syncope due to decreased cardiac output, intracardiac shunt, and arrhythmias may be observed. Therefore, the symptoms and signs of HF in young patients of 10–24 years old may be different from those in the elderly.

A 51-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and anemia sought treatment at the emergency room for a 2-month history of dry cough and shortness of breath and a 1-week history of substernal chest tightness. One month before her presentation, she was seen at a separate hospital for dyspnea and was found to be anemic. She underwent chest radiography and CT scanning of the chest that was unrevealing to the cause of dyspnea. She received a blood transfusion, although no cause of the anemia was found. One week before presentation, she started experiencing dyspnea on exertion with associated chest pressure, prompting her to seek treatment at the emergency room. On presentation, she reported no fevers, night sweats, joint pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope. She noted a 10- to 20-pound involuntary weight loss over 5 to 6 months. Of note, she had never undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy. Medications included an oral diabetic medication. She had no significant family history. She never smoked and had no history of illicit drug or alcohol use.

### Orthopnea… [^115QeZuF]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Orthopnea or orthopnoea is shortness of breath that occurs when lying flat, causing the person to have to sleep propped up in bed or sitting in a chair. It is commonly seen as a late manifestation of heart failure, resulting from fluid redistribution into the central circulation, causing an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and causing difficulty in breathing. It is also seen in cases of abdominal obesity or pulmonary disease. Orthopnea is the opposite of platypnea, shortness of breath that worsens when sitting or standing upright. Causes Orthopnea is often a symptom of left ventricular heart failure and/or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It can also occur in those with asthma and chronic bronchitis, as well as those with sleep apnea or panic disorder. It is also as associated with polycystic liver disease. From a neuromuscular perspective, orthopnea is potentially a sign of severe diaphragmatic weakness.

Under such circumstances, patients may describe shortness of breath when they bend over, called bendopnea. Mechanism Orthopnea is due to increased distribution of blood to the pulmonary circulation when a person lies flat or closer to a horizontal position. Lying flat decreases the inhibitory effect that the gravity usually has on the blood when coming back to the heart from the lower extremities of the body. This increases the right sided venous return. In a normal person, this redistribution of blood has little effect on respiratory function as the left ventricle has the adequate capacity to suddenly increase its stroke volume. In a person with heart failure, the left ventricle has an inadequate capacity to respond to increased arrival of blood from the pulmonary circulation. This leads to the pooling up of blood in the pulmonary circulation.

The increased intra-parenchymal pulmonary intravascular pressure can also result in hydrostatic pressure related fluid transudation into the alveoli, thus causing cardiogenic pulmonary edema and further worsening shortness of breath. Thus, shortness of breath is commonly experienced after a reasonably short time lying near to flat for a person with left ventricular failure. This is different from the dyspnea experienced by someone with lung parenchymal pathology when lying down, which is sudden and instead related to an acute change in diaphragmatic/accessory respiratory muscle mechanical advantage lost when moving the body into a more horizontal position. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based mostly on the clinical features and symptoms, as well as finding causes like heart failure. Treatment Based on the cause, orthopnea can be treated with respiratory support devices such as CPAP or biPAP while the disease causing it is addressed.

Etymology The word orthopnea uses combining forms of ortho- + -pnea, from Greek ortho, straight, regular, + pnoia, breath. See pronunciation information at dyspnea. See also

Case presentation

A case of C.X.Z, male aged 39-year old, and farmer by profession was wheeled into our department with severe symptoms of subacute RHF. His spouse narrated that in January,2018, he had experienced mild bilateral swelling of lower limbs (in form of stockings), and was managed on diuretics for about 7 days, after which symptoms disappeared completely. She denied him having had any cardiac surgery, chest radiation, tuberculosis or significant chest trauma. 8 months after initial symptoms, thus in October,2018, he suddenly developed chest pain, which he thought was due to long working hours in the field. On-counter remedies (pain killers) offered temporal relief. After 2-days of progressive chest pain, patient begun experiencing abdominal discomfort and observed swelling of feet after bed. On the 4th day in his illness, he developed shortness, a development that prompted him seek medical attention.

On presentation the patient through his spouse complained of breathing difficulties, abdominal fullness and swelling of lower limbs. She further narrated that, during bed time, shortness of breath worsened upon lying flat. During physical examination, patient exhibited incoherent talk, responded to various questions with same answer repeatedly. Both the neck veins (JVD > 15 mm H₂O) and abdomen were highly distended. Chest auscultation demonstrated a 'cardiac knock', and both S₁ and S₂ were muffled. Abdominal palpation revealed gross ascites. The lower extremities were cold to touch with bilateral pitting edema from knee and below. Prior and post procedure vitals are tabulated in Table. 1.

### Bioimpedance indices of fluid overload and cardiorenal outcomes in heart failure and chronic kidney disease: a systematic review [^116bMo25]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly coexist but are often considered separately in research and clinical practice. The burden of heart failure increases with advancing CKD; the estimated prevalence of clinical heart failure is around 40% in patients requiring dialysis. – Structural heart disease based on echocardiography is, perhaps, twice as common, with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) the more frequent phenotype in CKD than heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This interrelationship may be explained, in part, by shared risk factors but also by bidirectional etiological mechanisms. Heart failure increases the risk of CKD due to impaired perfusion of the kidneys and neurohormonal activation, and there are a number of pathophysiological changes associated with advancing CKD that contribute to heart failure. These include chronic hypertension and fluid overload as well as the possibility of direct uremia-related cardiotoxicity. Fluid overload is a common manifestation in both disease states and has clinical and prognostic implications. Treatment of both diseases has progressed with the advent of sodium-glucose cotrans-porter-2 inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists; both drug classes have diuretic mechanisms, and large trials have demonstrated benefits for cardiovascular risk and CKD progression. –

Fluid overload is traditionally assessed nonquantitatively by clinical examination. Bedside medical devices to standardize and more precisely quantify fluid status in both heart failure and CKD have been developed using ultrasound and bioimpedance technology. Both methods can be employed with relatively little training and allow rapid clinic-based measurements. Ultrasound modalities include lung ultrasonography – and, less commonly, vascular ultrasound of the inferior vena cava and internal jugular veins. Bioimpedance methods include both bioimpedance analysis (BIA) (single-, multifrequency and bioimpedance vector analysis [BIVA]) and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), both of which have been demonstrated to be highly reproducible and have been validated against gold-standard techniquesmore extensively than ultrasound approaches. Bioimpedance is a noninvasive measure of resistance and reactance of body tissues quantified by application of an electrical current via electrodes attached to the skin from which fluid compartment volumes and body composition can be estimated. Fig. 1 summarizes the 4 main bioimpedance approaches, including their analysis methods, commonly reported parameters and key advantages/disadvantages.

### Ultrasound imaging of congestion in heart failure: examinations beyond the heart [^116hg4FC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Congestion, related to pressure and/or fluid overload, plays a central role in the pathophysiology, presentation and prognosis of heart failure and is an important therapeutic target. While symptoms and physical signs of fluid overload are required to make a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, they lack both sensitivity and specificity, which might lead to diagnostic delay and uncertainty. Over the last decades, new ultrasound methods for the detection of elevated intracardiac pressures and/or fluid overload have been developed that are more sensitive and specific, thereby enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis and facilitating treatment strategies. Accordingly, we considered that a state-of-the-art review of ultrasound methods for the detection and quantification of congestion was timely, including imaging of the heart, lungs (B-lines), kidneys (intrarenal venous flow), and venous system (inferior vena cava and internal jugular vein diameter).

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112wLYM1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac mimics — diagnostic assessment in suspected heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is advised: Rather than presuming that all individuals with evidence of congestion and preserved EF have HFpEF, such individuals should undergo further diagnostic assessment, as dictated by the clinical presentation, to identify underlying causes for which there are disease-directed therapies. Consideration of two case examples shows identical symptoms and echocardiogram findings; by the Universal Definition of HF, both have HF and both have H2FPEF scores suggestive of HFpEF, yet the first individual likely has HFpEF with associated comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD), whereas the second individual has a high likelihood of HFpEF attributed to a specific source, transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, and the second individual likely has an HFpEF mimic attributable to a specific disease entity and requiring specific disease-directed therapy.

Methods

Study Population

Six groups of patients were prospectively recruited: (1) patients admitted to the hospital for treatment of decompensated HFrEF (n = 21), (2) patients admitted to the hospital for treatment of decompensated HFpEF (n = 16), (3) ambulatory patients with chronic stable HFrEF (n = 20), (4) ambulatory patients with chronic stable HFpEF (n = 18), (5) control patients without HF (n = 32), and (6) patients without HF but with moderate renal insufficiency due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 12). Patients were assigned to groups on the basis of a review of the medical record and a history and physical examination performed by one of the investigators. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Boston University Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment in the study.

Patients with decompensated HF were identified from patients admitted to the hospital for treatment of an episode of HF complicated by volume overload. The diagnosis of decompensated HF was defined clinically as the presence of worsening symptoms of dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea in conjunction with clinical signs of circulatory congestion (elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatojugular reflux, hepatomegaly, or peripheral edema). Patients with decompensated HF were enrolled into the study within 24 hours of admission. Patients with chronic stable HF were recruited from the Cardiomyopathy Clinic. These patients had symptoms that had been stable for at least 2 months, had not been hospitalized during the previous 2 months, were not volume overloaded by clinical examination, and did not require a change in diuretic therapy on that visit. HFrEF was defined as a previous diagnosis of HF and echocardiographic demonstration of left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45%, whereas HFpEF was defined as an LVEF ≥ 50%. Control patients without HF were recruited from the general cardiology ambulatory clinics or inpatient services. None of the control patients without HF had a history of HF or evidence of lung congestion or left ventricular dysfunction at the time of study. An additional 12 patients without HF but with moderate renal insufficiency due to CKD were recruited from an ambulatory nephrology clinic. All urine sediments were bland at the time of enrollment.

Excluded from enrollment were patients with concomitant acute coronary syndromes within the previous 3 months; primary infectious, inflammatory, or rheumatologic processes; hemodynamic instability requiring intravenous vasoactive drugs; aortic stenosis; malignancy; or hepatic dysfunction (cirrhosis or active hepatitis).

### A 35-year-old woman with progressive dyspnea and cough [^112iesdC]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 35-year-old woman with no known medical history presented to the ED with complaints of progressive dyspnea for several months. The patient also reported episodic cough with yellow to green sputum production. She denied fever, chills, weight loss, or hemoptysis. She also denied any history of previous lung diseases in her family. She denied any history of tobacco or recreational drug use or any exposures. She was originally from El Salvador and immigrated to the United States approximately 3 years earlier. She was evaluated in El Salvador at age 15 for "lung issues" but had never received a formal diagnosis.

### Orthopnea secondary to brachial plexitis with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis [^114LwGmJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 50-year-old male patient presented to the clinic complaining of shortness of breath for three months duration that started insidiously. It occurred only in a supine position, with the patient specifying: "I can't lay flat for a second". He has been having difficulties sleeping despite propping up two to three pillows. There was no dyspnea at rest, the patient could exercise three times a week without limitation, and there were no episodes of nocturnal dyspnea. There was no cough, postnasal drip, reflux symptoms, or chest pain. There was no recent upper respiratory illness, but the patient reported intermittent episodes of severe neck and left shoulder pain for the past three months that occurred without apparent trauma and did not improve with positional changes, muscle relaxants, and over-the-counter pain relievers. This pain had worsened gradually over time. There was no associated left upper extremity numbness, weakness, or atrophic changes. Family history was unknown because the patient was adopted. Past medical history was remarkable for primary hypertension and obesity class I with a body mass index of 32 and no surgery or trauma. The patient was a former smoker (8 pack-year) who quit… years ago.

The patient appeared well on examination, with a pulse of 85 beats/min, blood pressure of 179/105 mm Hg, temperature of 36.6 °C, and oxygen saturation of 98% while breathing ambient air. The patient had good bilateral breathing sounds without wheeze, rhonchi or, or crackle in a seated position. There was good expansion of the chest wall. The patient did not tolerate lying flat, immediately gasping for air, and sitting back up immediately. Abdomen was nondistended. There was mild bilateral pitting edema of the lower extremities. There was no limitation of motion or tenderness with passive and active neck and left shoulder movement. Peripheral pulses were all present and symmetrical. Neurological examination was normal that included motor, sensory, cranial nerves, coordination, and gait testing. Further neurological examination of the bilateral upper extremities revealed normal deep tendon reflexes with the absence of spasticity and weakness. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable.

### An 84-year-old man with progressive dyspnea and an abnormal chest CT scan [^11412bCh]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Case Presentation

An 84-year-old man without a history of smoking presented with progressive dyspnea of 6 months' duration accompanied by fatigue and unintentional weight loss. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, hemoptysis, rash, joint pains, or muscle aches. He had multiple hospitalizations for similar presentations that were diagnosed as pneumonia. History was significant for diastolic heart failure, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Why is your patient still short of breath? Understanding the complex pathophysiology of dyspnea in chronic kidney disease [^111XcXbQ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is one of the most common symptoms associated with CKD. It has a profound influence on the quality of life of CKD patients, and its underlying causes are often associated with a negative prognosis. However, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. While hemodialysis may address fluid overload, it often does not significantly improve breathlessness, suggesting multiple and co-existing alternative issues exist. The aim of this article is to discuss the main pathophysiologic mechanisms and the most important putative etiologies underlying dyspnea in CKD patients. Congestive heart failure, unrecognized chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, lung fibrosis, air microembolism, dialyzer bio-incompatibility, anemia, sodium, and fluid overload are potential frequent causes of breathing disorders in this population. However, the relative contributions in any one given patient are poorly understood. Systemic inflammation is a common theme and contributes to the development of endothelial dysfunction, lung fibrosis, anemia, malnutrition, and muscle wasting. The introduction of novel multimodal imaging techniques, including pulmonary functional magnetic resonance imaging with inhaled contrast agents, could provide new insights into the pathophysiology of dyspnea in CKD patients and ultimately contribute to improving our clinical management of this symptom.
