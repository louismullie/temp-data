## Question

Bumex overdose treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage bumetanide (Bumex) overdose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and airway, breathing, and circulation. Then, I should verify the pharmacology and expected toxicodynamic effects to anticipate complications. Next, I will review decontamination considerations, followed by targeted supportive therapy for fluid and electrolyte derangements. After that, I need to check monitoring cadence and special populations, and finally consider drug interactions and a concise algorithmic summary with safety caveats and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm the clinical priorities in the first hour. Airway protection, oxygenation, and hemodynamic stabilization come first, with early IV access and continuous cardiac monitoring given the risks of hypokalemia, arrhythmias, and circulatory collapse in loop diuretic overdose. I should also obtain a focused history on dose, timing, formulation, co-ingestants, and comorbidities while initiating supportive care in parallel [^112eYZgF] [^117B1Q8y] [^113bWA1D].

> I need to check the pharmacology to anticipate complications. Bumetanide potently inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb, producing rapid natriuresis and calciuresis with secondary kaliuresis and magnesiuresis; in overdose, this translates to acute profound water loss, volume depletion, circulatory collapse, and electrolyte disturbances including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia, with risk of vascular thrombosis and embolism in severe cases [^116ieMGH] [^117B1Q8y] [^114jhDLW] [^113bWA1D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about decontamination. For loop diuretics, activated charcoal has limited utility because absorption is typically rapid and complete within 1–2 hours; I initially thought charcoal might help if given early, but wait, I should verify the kinetics — given the rapid onset and short duration of bumetanide's action, gastric emptying or charcoal rarely changes outcomes, so I should prioritize supportive care and avoid delays from low-yield decontamination unless there are co-ingestants with delayed absorption or extended-release properties [^115gPph8] [^113dJC36].

> Next, I should review fluid and electrolyte management, which is the cornerstone of treatment. I will now examine the need for isotonic crystalloid resuscitation guided by blood pressure, urine output, and clinical perfusion, while concurrently correcting electrolytes: replace potassium (often 10–20 mEq IV, then oral), magnesium (2–4 g IV), and calcium (1–2 g IV) as indicated by serial labs; in cirrhotic patients, I need to ensure careful correction to avoid precipitating encephalopathy and consider spironolactone to mitigate hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, with close monitoring of mental status and ammonia if hepatic disease is suspected [^117B1Q8y] [^1123i26U] [^114jpGc3].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence. Frequent vital signs, strict intake and output, daily weights, and serial electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3, Mg, Ca) every 4–6 hours initially are prudent, with continuous ECG if hypokalemia is significant. Renal function (BUN/creatinine) should be trended given the risk of prerenal azotemia from volume depletion, and I should watch for thrombotic complications in those with marked volume loss [^117B1Q8y] [^1123i26U] [^111BKHyo].

> Let me consider special populations and high-risk scenarios. In hepatic cirrhosis, abrupt electrolyte shifts can precipitate encephalopathy, so I should correct slowly with small, closely monitored steps and avoid over-diuresis. In renal insufficiency, I need to balance diuretic-induced prerenal injury against ongoing fluid losses. In neonates and infants, ototoxicity risk is a concern with loop diuretics, so I should minimize exposure and monitor hearing if prolonged high-dose therapy is unavoidable. In older adults, orthostatic hypotension and falls are more likely, so I should replete volume cautiously and mobilize carefully [^1123i26U] [^113trqNc] [^115m86mh] [^112MzpkX].

> I need to ensure I address drug interactions that can worsen toxicity. Concurrent aminoglycosides increase ototoxic risk and should be avoided when possible. NSAIDs like indomethacin blunt natriuresis and may worsen fluid retention. Lithium clearance is reduced and toxicity risk rises with loop diuretics. Probenecid antagonizes bumetanide secretion and natriuresis and should be avoided. And coadministration with other antihypertensives can potentiate hypotension, so I should anticipate dose adjustments as volume status normalizes [^116cwAYh] [^1123i26U].

> But wait, what about enhancing elimination. Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are not routinely effective for bumetanide given high protein binding and predominant hepatic metabolism; I should confirm that supportive care remains the mainstay and reserve extracorporeal therapies only for life-threatening co-ingestants with established indications, rather than for bumetanide itself [^117B1Q8y] [^113bWA1D].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. Stabilize ABCs and obtain IV access with continuous monitoring. Draw electrolytes, renal function, and an ECG. If ingestion was recent and there are high-risk co-ingestants, consider activated charcoal per general toxicology principles, but do not delay supportive care. Initiate isotonic crystalloid resuscitation and begin electrolyte repletion (K, Mg, Ca) guided by serial labs. Continue frequent reassessment of vitals, urine output, daily weight, and electrolytes until stable. Address special populations with tailored caution. And arrange observation for at least 24–48 hours in moderate to severe cases, with discharge only after electrolytes normalize, volume status is restored, and the patient is clinically stable with reliable follow-up [^112eYZgF] [^117B1Q8y] [^1123i26U].

> I should confirm safety counseling and follow-up. Patients should be educated on early signs of hypokalemia (weakness, cramping, palpitations), dehydration, and orthostatic symptoms; arrange prompt primary care follow-up for electrolyte checks within 1 week; and reinforce medication safety to prevent recurrence, especially in older adults and those with polypharmacy or renal/hepatic disease [^1123i26U] [^111BKHyo].

> In summary, bumetanide overdose management is supportive and hinges on meticulous fluid and electrolyte replacement with close monitoring. There is no specific antidote, decontamination rarely changes outcomes, and complications are predictable based on NKCC2 inhibition — address these proactively and tailor care to comorbidities and high-risk populations to optimize recovery [^117B1Q8y] [^116ieMGH] [^1123i26U].

Bumex (bumetanide) overdose is managed with **supportive care** and **electrolyte correction** [^117B1Q8y]. There is **no specific antidote**; treatment focuses on stabilizing airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by careful replacement of fluids and electrolytes based on frequent monitoring of urine output, serum electrolytes, and clinical status [^117CG6Dh]. Hemodialysis is not effective due to high protein binding; **activated charcoal is not useful** unless ingestion is very recent. Monitor for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, dehydration, and arrhythmias, and treat complications as they arise [^1123i26U].

---

## Clinical presentation of bumetanide overdose

Bumetanide overdose causes **profound diuresis** with large fluid and electrolyte losses, leading to:

- **Dehydration**: reduced blood volume, dry mucosa, tachycardia, hypotension [^117B1Q8y].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia [^1123i26U].

- **Circulatory collapse**: shock, vascular thrombosis, embolism [^117CG6Dh].

- **Neurologic symptoms**: weakness, dizziness, confusion, lethargy, cramps [^117B1Q8y].

- **Metabolic alkalosis**: from chloride and potassium losses [^113cWwBW].

---

## Immediate management and supportive care

### Airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs)

Ensure a **patent airway** and provide oxygen; intubate if needed. Support circulation with **isotonic fluids** (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) to correct hypovolemia and prevent shock [^112eYZgF].

---

### Fluid and electrolyte replacement

- **Fluid replacement**: Use isotonic fluids to restore intravascular volume; adjust based on urine output, blood pressure, and clinical status [^112eYZgF].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Replace potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium as guided by frequent labs and clinical status [^114jhDLW].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum electrolytes, renal function, and acid-base status frequently; monitor urine output and clinical status closely [^111BKHyo].

---

### Specific considerations

- **Activated charcoal**: Not useful unless ingestion was very recent and the airway is protected [^113dJC36].

- **Hemodialysis**: Not effective due to high protein binding of bumetanide [^116VbKPR].

---

## Potential complications and their management

| **Complication** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Hypokalemia | Potassium chloride IV or oral; monitor ECG for arrhythmias [^117PpLfP] |
| Hyponatremia | - Correct slowly to avoid osmotic demyelination <br/> - Use hypertonic saline only if severe or symptomatic [^notfound] |
| Dehydration | - Isotonic fluids <br/> - Monitor urine output and clinical status [^117B1Q8y] |
| Circulatory collapse | - Aggressive fluid resuscitation <br/> - Vasopressors if refractory [^112eYZgF] |
| Metabolic alkalosis | - Potassium chloride <br/> - Consider acetazolamide if severe [^113cWwBW] |
| Arrhythmias | - Correct electrolytes <br/> - Antiarrhythmics per ACLS [^117PpLfP] |

---

## Long-term follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **cardiology and nephrology follow-up** to monitor for delayed complications. Educate patients on proper dosing, adherence, and recognition of overdose symptoms. Consider psychological evaluation if intentional overdose is suspected.

---

## Preventive measures and patient education

- **Patient education**: Teach correct dosing, adherence, and recognition of overdose symptoms.

- **Medication safety**: Use pill organizers and clear instructions to prevent errors.

- **Regular monitoring**: Track electrolytes and renal function in patients on chronic therapy [^111BKHyo].

---

Bumetanide overdose is managed with **supportive care** and **electrolyte correction**; there is no specific antidote. Focus on stabilizing ABCs, replacing fluids and electrolytes, and monitoring for complications, with long-term follow-up and patient education to prevent recurrence.

OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage can lead to acute profound water loss, volume and electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction of blood volume and circulatory collapse with a possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism. Electrolyte depletion may be manifested by weakness, dizziness, mental confusion, anorexia, lethargy, vomiting and cramps. Treatment consists of replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses by careful monitoring of the urine and electrolyte output and serum electrolyte levels.

### Bumetanide continuous infusions in critically ill pediatric patients [^114rFLJg]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Limited data exist for the use of bumetanide continuous infusions in children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of bumetanide continuous infusions in critically ill pediatric patients.

Design

This study was an institutional review board approved, single-center, retrospective chart review of 95 patients. Dosing practices were described by rate (μg/kg/hr), duration (days), and previous diuretic use. Efficacy, determined by ability to achieve negative fluid balance and time to reach negative fluid balance, was assessed at 12, 24, and 48 hours. Safety was evaluated based on prevalence of adverse drug reactions. Adverse drug reactions were predefined as serum potassium concentration less than 3 mEq/L, serum chloride concentration less than 90 mEq/L, serum carbon dioxide concentration greater than 35 mEq/L, and serum creatinine increased greater than 1.5 times baseline and above patient-specific normal range.

Setting

Le Bonheur Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN.

Patients

Critically ill patients who are 18 years old or younger and received bumetanide continuous infusions. A total of 95 patients were included.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The mean dose of bumetanide was 5.7 ± 2.2 μg/kg/hr (1–10 μg/kg/hr) with a median duration of 3.3 days (0.3–18.5). The total percentage of patients achieving negative fluid balance by 48 hours was 76% with 54% of patients reaching negative fluid balance within 12 hours.

Conclusions

This study showed that a bumetanide dose of 5.7 μg/kg/hr was effective in achieving negative fluid balance in the majority of critically ill pediatric patients. Additionally, bumetanide appears to be a safe loop diuretic for use as a continuous infusion at the doses described in critically ill pediatric patients.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113xjnfE]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Diuretic therapy for ascites — dosing and titration: Spironolactone may be increased up to 400 mg/day, the full effect of a dose change may not be seen for up to 3 days, and dose increases should be made with an interval of at least 72 hours; the dose of furosemide (initially 40 mg/day) may be progressively increased toward 160 mg/day, which is the generally accepted threshold to determine medical treatment refractoriness. Torsemide or bumetanide may improve natriuresis in patients with a suboptimal response to furosemide, and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in general are switched to high-dose loop diuretics and lower doses of aldosterone antagonists. Adverse effects of diuretic therapy may occur in 20% and 40% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and painful gynecomastia caused or exacerbated by spironolactone may respond to switching to amiloride or eplerenone.

### Don't get BUM' D out: bumetanide may yet prove beneficial for neonatal seizures [^115PxVsv]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

It is important to recognize that the notion that neonatal seizures can be ameliorated by blocking the Cl - importing action of NCKK1 has undergone considerable revision and experimental analysis. The relatively simple idea that GABA is depolarizing early in development and later becomes hyperpolarizing, due to the time-dependent expression of the various Cl - co-transporters, is just that–too simple, for many reasons. First, NKCC1 may actually rise until adulthood, rather than peak perinatally and then decline as the expression of the Cl - exporter, KCC2, increases. Second, these transporters may not be the sole or even primary determinants of intracellular chloride concentration; the distribution and localization of impermeant anions inside and outside the cell may play a critical role in setting Cl - homeostasis and thus the direction of the GABA response. Third, the expression of NKCC1 is widespread and off-target effects of BUM could be rampant.

The most important results of this pilot study are that PHB plus BUM had a significant benefit over PHB monotherapy for seizure burden reduction in newborns with quite varied seizure etiologies, and without significant adverse effects. Not surprisingly, many questions remain unanswered, requiring studies with a higher number of participants necessary to address these. Future studies will need to balance the severity of group randomization such that a similar seizure burden is present prior to drug exposure. It remains unclear whether BUM can be used as a first-line ASM for neonatal seizures based on the inconclusive (and overall, somewhat underwhelming) human and animal data, but this is unlikely. Seizure responsiveness to BUM (and other agents) may well depend on the seizure etiology, timing of administration, frequency and severity of prior seizures, and many other factors. Nevertheless, there remains theoretical support for BUM as a mechanistically appropriate medication for neonatal seizures. Clearly, there are many other specific physiological features of the neonatal brain that could also be targeted to decrease excitability and thus improve seizure burden. Such efforts are well worth the effort, as neonatal seizures are strongly correlated with future neurologic dysfunction and subsequent epilepsy.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^112TMH4G]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

AKI-D volume management and ultrafiltration — volume and BP assessments need to be conducted at every hemodialysis treatment to set fluid removal goals, and volume management may require a degree of permissive hypervolemia to minimize hypovolemia-induced hypotension; in patients with AKI-D, a more conservative ultrafiltration approach has been associated with lower intradialytic hypotension and we suggest that prescribed ultrafiltration should be < 10 ml/kg per hour. In nonoliguric patients, loop diuretics can help control fluid accumulation and reduce ultrafiltration needs, and we suggest a trial of furosemide 160 mg twice a day (or equivalent dose of torsemide or bumetanide) in all patients with AKI except those with already significant urine output and minimal interdialytic weight gain (< 1 kg); in patients who remain oligoanuric, diuretics can be held until there is a reported or documented increase in urine output. Cool dialysate reduces intradialytic hypotension in ESRD and has been found beneficial in the AKI-D setting and is therefore a reasonable tool for patients at higher risk of intradialytic hemodynamic instability.

WARNINGS

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

The dose of Bumex should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of Bumex administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.

Ototoxicity

In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.

Allergy to Sulfonamides

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to Bumex.

Thrombocytopenia

Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.

### Ammonia triggers neuronal disinhibition and seizures by impairing astrocyte potassium buffering [^114yMnd3]. Nature Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Ammonia is a ubiquitous waste product of protein metabolism that can accumulate in numerous metabolic disorders, causing neurological dysfunction ranging from cognitive impairment to tremor, ataxia, seizures, coma and death. The brain is especially vulnerable to ammonia as it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier in its gaseous form, NH3, and rapidly saturates its principal removal pathway located in astrocytes. Thus, we wanted to determine how astrocytes contribute to the initial deterioration of neurological functions characteristic of hyperammonemia in vivo. Using a combination of two-photon imaging and electrophysiology in awake head-restrained mice, we show that ammonia rapidly compromises astrocyte potassium buffering, increasing extracellular potassium concentration and overactivating the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) in neurons. The consequent depolarization of the neuronal GABA reversal potential (EGABA) selectively impairs cortical inhibitory networks. Genetic deletion of NKCC1 or inhibition of it with the clinically used diuretic bumetanide potently suppresses ammonia-induced neurological dysfunction. We did not observe astrocyte swelling or brain edema in the acute phase, calling into question current concepts regarding the neurotoxic effects of ammonia. Instead, our findings identify failure of potassium buffering in astrocytes as a crucial mechanism in ammonia neurotoxicity and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of blocking this pathway by inhibiting NKCC1.

### Pharmacoepidemiology evaluation of bumetanide as a potential candidate for drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease [^114ATvLf]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Our longitudinal analysis of Medicare claims data was unable to replicate prior findings from cross‐sectional analyses associating bumetanide with decreased risk of AD, regardless of whether the exposure was measured as ever use of the drug or as the number of years of drug use. Use of bumetanide as well as of other loop diuretics was associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia, which may be suggestive of confounding by indication. Pharmacoepidemiology evaluations of real‐world data may contribute to the identification of candidate compounds for repurposing; however, rigorous study designs are needed to account for survivor bias and confounding.

### Secobarbital sodium (Seconal sodium) [^111q28B1]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment — To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses, interaction among drugs, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.

Protect the patient's airway and support ventilation and perfusion. Meticulously monitor and maintain, within acceptable limits, the patient's vital signs, blood gases, serum electrolytes, etc. Absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may be decreased by giving activated charcoal, which, in many cases, is more effective than emesis or lavage; consider charcoal instead of or in addition to gastric emptying. Repeated doses of charcoal over time may hasten elimination of some drugs that have been absorbed. Safeguard the patient's airway when employing gastric emptying or charcoal.

Diuresis and peritoneal dialysis are of little value; hemodialysis and hemoperfusion enhance drug clearance and should be considered in serious poisoning. If the patient has chronically abused sedatives, withdrawal reactions may be manifest following acute overdose.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117JZ2ik]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 13 — FDA-approved drugs for treatment of hypertension — Loop diuretics (alternative agents) include bumetanide 0.5–2 mg/d (daily frequency 2), furosemide 20–80 mg/d (daily frequency 2), and torsemide 5–10 mg/d (daily frequency 1). These are preferred diuretics in patients with symptomatic HF. They are preferred over thiazide-type diuretics in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (eg, GFR < 30 mL/min). The longer-acting choice of torsemide is preferred for treatment of hypertension. A loop diuretic is an option for patients who develop thiazide-type diuretic associated hyponatremia.

### Bumetanide augments the neuroprotective efficacy of phenobarbital plus hypothermia in a neonatal hypoxia-ischemia model [^1168kgpp]. Pediatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The NaKCl cotransporter NKCC1 facilitates intraneuronal chloride accumulation in the developing brain. Bumetanide (BUM), a clinically available diuretic, inhibits this chloride transporter and augments the antiepileptic effects of phenobarbital (PB) in neonatal rodents. In a neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) model, elicited by right carotid ligation, followed by 90 min 8% O(2) exposure in 7-d-old (P7) rats, PB increases the neuroprotective efficacy of hypothermia (HT). We evaluated whether BUM influenced the neuroprotective efficacy of combination treatment with PB and HT.

Methods

P7 rats underwent HI lesioning; 15 min later, all received PB (30 mg/kg), and 10 min later, half received BUM (10 mg/kg, PB-HT+BUM) and half received saline (PB-HT+SAL). One hour after HI, all were cooled (30 °C, 3 h). Contralateral forepaw sensorimotor function and brain damage were evaluated 1–4 wk later.

Results

Forepaw functional measures were close to normal in the PB-HT+BUM group, whereas deficits persisted in PB-HT+SAL controls; there were corresponding reductions in right cerebral hemisphere damage (at P35, % damage: PB-HT+BUM, 21 ± 16 vs. 38 ± 20 in controls).

Discussion

These results provide evidence that NKCC1 inhibition amplifies PB bioactivity in the immature brain and suggest that coadministration of PB and BUM may represent a clinically feasible therapy to augment the neuroprotective efficacy of therapeutic HT in asphyxiated neonates.

Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver, at the initial VIVITROL injection and with each subsequent injection. Because of the risks for opioid overdose described above, discuss with the patient and caregiver the importance of having access to naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Inform patients and caregivers of the options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose.

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose and, if naloxone is prescribed, how to treat with naloxone. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Decreased seizure activity in a human neonate treated with bumetanide, an inhibitor of the Na (+)-K (+)-2Cl (-) cotransporter NKCC1 [^114T7v3X]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Neonatal seizures have devastating consequences for brain development and are inadequately treated by available antiepileptics. In neonates, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an excitatory neurotransmitter due to elevated levels of intraneuronal chloride achieved by robust activity of the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC1). This depolarizing action of GABA likely contributes to the lowered seizure threshold, increased seizure propensity, and poor efficacy of GABAergic anticonvulsants among infants. The diuretic bumetanide inhibits NKCC1 and silences seizure activity in rodent models of neonatal seizures, but its effect on seizures in human neonates is unknown. Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring was used to quantify the number, duration, and frequency of seizures 2 hours before and after the administration of bumetanide in a neonate with intractable multifocal seizures. Significant reductions in mean seizure duration and frequency were noted following treatment, with no associated clinical side effects or metabolic imbalances. These results suggest bumetanide may exert antiepileptic effects in human neonates.

General

Serum potassium should be measured periodically and potassium supplements or potassium sparing diuretics added if necessary. Periodic determinations of other electrolytes are advised in patients treated with high doses or for prolonged periods, particularly in those on low-salt diets.

Hyperuricemia may occur; it has been asymptomatic in cases reported to date. Reversible elevations of the BUN and creatinine may also occur, especially in association with dehydration and particularly in patients with renal insufficiency. Bumetanide may increase urinary calcium excretion with resultant hypocalcemia.

Diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Laboratory Tests

Studies in normal subjects receiving bumetanide revealed no adverse effects on glucose tolerance, plasma insulin, glucagon and growth hormone levels, but the possibility of an effect on glucose metabolism exists. Periodic determinations of blood sugar should be done, particularly in patients with diabetes or suspected latent diabetes.

Patients under treatment should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver damage or idiosyncratic reactions, which have been reported occasionally in foreign marketing experience. The relationship of these occurrences to bumetanide use is not certain.

### Theophylline anhydrous (Elixophyllin) [^117PpLfP]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Overdose Management:

General Recommendations for Patients with Symptoms of Theophylline Overdose or Serum Theophylline Concentrations > 30 mcg/mL (Note: Serum theophylline concentrations may continue to increase after presentation of the patient for medical care.)

While simultaneously instituting treatment, contact a regional poison center to obtain updated information and advice on individualizing the recommendations that follow.
Institute supportive care, including establishment of intravenous access, maintenance of the airway, and electrocardiographic monitoring.
Treatment of seizures Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with theophylline-induced seizures, treatment should be rapid and aggressive. Anticonvulsant therapy should be initiated with an intravenous benzodiazepine, e.g., diazepam, in increments of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg every 1–3 minutes until seizures are terminated. Repetitive seizures should be treated with a loading dose of phenobarbital (20 mg/kg infused over 30–60 minutes). Case reports of theophylline overdose in humans and animal studies suggest that phenytoin is ineffective in terminating theophylline-induced seizures. The doses of benzodiazepines and phenobarbital required to terminate theophylline-induced seizures are close to the doses that may cause severe respiratory depression or respiratory arrest; the clinician should therefore be prepared to provide assisted ventilation. Elderly patients and patients with COPD may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of anticonvulsants. Barbiturate-induced coma or administration of general anesthesia may be required to terminate repetitive seizures or status epilepticus. General anesthesia should be used with caution in patients with theophylline overdose because fluorinated volatile anesthetics may sensitize the myocardium to endogenous catecholamines released by theophylline. Enflurane appears to less likely to be associated with this effect than halothane and may, therefore, be safer. Neuromuscular blocking agents alone should not be used to terminate seizures since they abolish the musculoskeletal manifestations without terminating seizure activity in the brain.
Anticipate Need for Anticonvulsants In patients with theophylline overdose who are at high risk for theophylline induced seizures, e.g., patients with acute overdoses and serum theophylline concentrations > 100 mcg/mL chronic overdosage in patients > 60 years of age with serum theophylline concentrations > 30 mcg/mL, the need for anticonvulsant therapy should be anticipated. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam should be drawn into a syringe and kept at the patient's bedside and medical personnel qualified to treat seizures should be immediately available. In selected patients at high risk for theophylline-induced seizures, consideration should be given to the administration of prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy. Situations where prophylactic anticonvulsant therapy should be considered in high risk patients include anticipated delays in instituting methods for extracorporeal removal of theophylline (e.g., transfer of a high risk patient from one health care facility to another for extracorporeal removal) and clinical circumstances that significantly interfere with efforts to enhance theophylline clearance (e.g., a neonate where dialysis may not be technically feasible or a patient with vomiting unresponsive to antiemetics who is unable to tolerate multiple-dose oral activated charcoal). In animal studies, prophylactic administration of phenobarbital, but not phenytoin, has been shown to delay the onset of theophylline induced generalized seizures and to increase the dose of theophylline required to induce seizures (i.e., markedly increases the LD50). Although there are no controlled studies in humans, a loading dose of intravenous phenobarbital (20 mg/kg infused over 60 minutes) may delay or prevent life-threatening seizures in high risk patients while efforts to enhance theophylline clearance are continued. Phenobarbital may cause respiratory depression, particularly in elderly patients and patients with COPD.
Treatment of cardiac arrhythmias Sinus tachycardia and simple ventricular premature beats are not harbingers of life-threatening arrhythmias, they do not require treatment in the absence of hemodynamic compromise, and they resolve with declining serum theophylline concentrations. Other arrhythmias, especially those associated with hemodynamic compromise, should be treated with antiarrhythmic therapy appropriate for the type of arrhythmia.
Gastrointestinal decontamination Oral activated charcoal (0.5 g/kg up to 20 g and repeat at least once 1–2 hours after the first dose) is extremely effective in blocking the absorption of theophylline throughout the gastrointestinal tract, even when administered several hours after ingestion. If the patient is vomiting, the charcoal should be administered through a nasogastric tube or after administration of an antiemetic. Phenothiazine antiemetics such as prochlorperazine or perphenazine should be avoided since they can lower the seizure threshold and frequently cause dystonic reactions. A single dose of sorbitol may be used to promote stooling to facilitate removal of theophylline bound to charcoal from the gastrointestinal tract. Sorbitol, however, should be dosed with caution since it is a potent purgative which can cause profound fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, particularly after multiple doses. Commercially available fixed combinations of liquid charcoal and sorbitol should be avoided in young children and after the first dose in adolescents and adults since they do not allow for individualization of charcoal and sorbitol dosing. Ipecac syrup should be avoided in theophylline overdoses. Although ipecac induces emesis, it does not reduce the absorption of theophylline unless administered within 5 minutes of ingestion and even then is less effective than oral activated charcoal. Moreover, ipecac induced emesis may persist for several hours after a single dose and significantly decrease the retention and the effectiveness of oral activated charcoal.
Serum Theophylline Concentration Monitoring The serum theophylline concentration should be measured immediately upon presentation, 2–4 hours later, and then at sufficient intervals, e.g., every 4 hours, to guide treatment decisions and to assess the effectiveness of therapy. Serum theophylline concentrations may continue to increase after presentation of the patient for medical care as a result of continued absorption of theophylline from the gastrointestinal tract. Serial monitoring of serum theophylline serum concentrations should be continued until it is clear that the concentration is no longer rising and has returned to non-toxic levels.
General Monitoring Procedures Electrocardiographic monitoring should be initiated on presentation and continued until the serum theophylline level has returned to a non-toxic level. Serum electrolytes and glucose should be measured on presentation and at appropriate intervals indicated by clinical circumstances. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be promptly corrected. Monitoring and treatment should be continued until the serum concentration decreases below 20 mcg/mL.
Enhance clearance of theophylline Multiple-dose oral activated charcoal (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg up to 20 g, every two hours) increases the clearance of theophylline at least twofold by adsorption of theophylline secreted into gastrointestinal fluids. Charcoal must be retained in, and pass through, the gastrointestinal tract to be effective; emesis should therefore be controlled by administration of appropriate antiemetics. Alternatively, the charcoal can be administered continuously through a nasogastric tube in conjunction with appropriate antiemetics. A single dose of sorbitol may be administered with the activated charcoal to promote stooling to facilitate clearance of the adsorbed theophylline from the gastrointestinal tract. Sorbitol alone does not enhance clearance of theophylline and should be dosed with caution to prevent excessive stooling which can result in severe fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Commercially available fixed combinations of liquid charcoal and sorbitol should be avoided in young children and after the first dose in adolescents and adults since they do not allow for individualization of charcoal and sorbitol dosing. In patients with intractable vomiting, extracorporeal methods of theophylline removal should be instituted (see OVERDOSAGE, Extracorporeal Removal).

### Novel treatment targets for cerebral edema [^111WidRr]. Neurotherapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema is a common finding in a variety of neurological conditions, including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, ruptured cerebral aneurysm, and neoplasia. With the possible exception of neoplasia, most pathological processes leading to edema seem to share similar molecular mechanisms of edema formation. Challenges to brain-cell volume homeostasis can have dramatic consequences, given the fixed volume of the rigid skull and the effect of swelling on secondary neuronal injury. With even small changes in cellular and extracellular volume, cerebral edema can compromise regional or global cerebral blood flow and metabolism or result in compression of vital brain structures. Osmotherapy has been the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy and is typically administered as part of an escalating medical treatment algorithm that can include corticosteroids, diuretics, and pharmacological cerebral metabolic suppression. Novel treatment targets for cerebral edema include the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC1) and the SUR1-regulated NC(Ca-ATP) (SUR1/TRPM4) channel. These two ion channels have been demonstrated to be critical mediators of edema formation in brain-injured states. Their specific inhibitors, bumetanide and glibenclamide, respectively, are well-characterized Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs with excellent safety profiles. Directed inhibition of these ion transporters has the potential to reduce the development of cerebral edema and is currently being investigated in human clinical trials. Another class of treatment agents for cerebral edema is vasopressin receptor antagonists. Euvolemic hyponatremia is present in a myriad of neurological conditions resulting in cerebral edema. A specific antagonist of the vasopressin V1A- and V2-receptor, conivaptan, promotes water excretion while sparing electrolytes through a process known as aquaresis.

### Treatment during a vulnerable developmental period rescues a genetic epilepsy [^112gtJAX]. Nature Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The nervous system is vulnerable to perturbations during specific developmental periods. Insults during such susceptible time windows can have long-term consequences, including the development of neurological diseases such as epilepsy. Here we report that a pharmacological intervention timed during a vulnerable neonatal period of cortical development prevents pathology in a genetic epilepsy model. By using mice with dysfunctional Kv7 voltage-gated K(+) channels, which are mutated in human neonatal epilepsy syndromes, we demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter NKCC1 antagonist bumetanide, which was administered during the first two postnatal weeks. In Kv7 current-deficient mice, which normally display epilepsy, hyperactivity and stereotypies as adults, transient bumetanide treatment normalized neonatal in vivo cortical network and hippocampal neuronal activity, prevented structural damage in the hippocampus and restored wild-type adult behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, bumetanide treatment did not adversely affect control mice. These results suggest that in individuals with disease susceptibility, timing prophylactically safe interventions to specific windows during development may prevent or arrest disease progression.

### Structural basis for inhibition of the cation-chloride cotransporter NKCC1 by the diuretic drug bumetanide [^116ieMGH]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Loop diuretics such as bumetanide and furosemide, which are marketed as Bumex and Lasix, respectively, are cornerstones of clinical management of edema and hypertension –, with more than 30 million prescriptions each year in the United States. Bumetanide inhibits the renal-specific cation-chloride cotransporter (CCC) NKCC2, thereby reducing salt and water retention by the kidney to exert diuretic and anti-hypertensive effects. Bumetanide (and other existing loop diuretics) also antagonize a more widely distributed paralogous transporter NKCC1, which accounts for their side-effect of ototoxicity. This side effect is consistent with the genetic studies that NKCC1 −/− animals are profoundly deaf because NKCC1 contributes to maintenance of unusually high extracellular [K +] of endolymph in inner ear.

An antagonistic action of bumetanide on neuronal NKCC1 may also produce beneficial effects in the treatment of various brain disorders and psychiatric conditions as demonstrated in recent off-label studies –. NKCC1 may function as a major Cl − importer in neurons and thus contributes to maintenance of an outward-directed Cl − electrochemical gradient in immature neurons and some peripheral sensory neurons in adults –. Consequently, inhibitory neurotransmitters (e.g. γ -aminobutyric acid; GABA) stimulate Cl − efflux via pentameric ligand-gated Cl − channels, resulting in depolarization of these neurons. Bumetanide may restore GABA inhibition in patients with neurological disorders by blocking NKCC1-mediated Cl − accumulation in neurons. However, bumetanide barely crosses the blood brain barrier to reach neuronal NKCC1 target and has the diuretic liability associated with off-target inhibition of the closely related NKCC2 transporter.

### Interaction between the sodium-glucose-linked transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and the loop diuretic bumetanide in normal human subjects [^113byyQh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the combination of bumetanide and dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated, although dapagliflozin enhanced the hypokalemia with bumetanide. There was no apparent first‐dose additive natriuresis with dapagliflozin and bumetanide. However, 1 week of accommodation to dapagliflozin increased in Na + excretion with bumetanide, likely reflecting an adaptive increase in Na + /K + /2Cl after inhibition of Na + /glucose cotransport in the upstream proximal tubule. Moreover, 1 week of accommodation to bumetanide increased Na + excretion with dapagliflozin, likely reflecting enhanced proximal tubule Na + reabsorption after some volume depletion after 1 week of bumetanide administration. Further studies will be required to probe the clinical significance of these interactive effects in patients with CHF and T2DM.

Perspective

An SGLT2 inhibitor given to patients with T2DM reduces cardiovascular events 10 and BP, 23 which have been attributed to volume loss. 23 The positive natriuretic effect of bumetanide added to dapagliflozin in subjects adapted to a loop diuretic therefore may extend the volume‐depleting and antihypertensive actions of loop diuretics, which could be beneficial for patients with resistant CHF and hypertension, as shown recently for patients with nephrotic edema. 43 Dapagliflozin's uricosuric action more than compensated for the reduction in urate excretion with bumetanide when given in combination. Thus, dapagliflozin should address favorably both inadequate correction of blood volume and hypertension and 2 adverse metabolic consequences of loop diuretics: hyperglycemia and hyperuricemia.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^117RzUvk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

### Effects of bumetanide on neurobehavioral function in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^112nuDfm]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Safety outcomes

Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are described in Table 2. The most frequent TEAEs included hypokalemia, diuresis and loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia. They were all related to the inhibitory effects of bumetanide on NKCC2, the luminal Na-K-2Cl symporter, in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop which modulates water and electrolyte homeostasis. The frequency and incidence of TEAEs were directly correlated with the dose of bumetanide administered. The greatest frequency of TEAEs was in the 2.0 mg bumetanide group (121) followed by 1.0 mg (118), 0.5 mg (76) and placebo (39). The small difference between groups 2.0 and 1.0 mg was due to the larger number of dropouts in the 2.0 mg group. All TEAEs resolved on discontinuation of treatment.

Four TEAEs were classified as serious. Three were considered related to bumetanide: in the 0.5 mg b.i.d. group, one patient was overdosed due to parent's inattentiveness; and in the 1.0 and 2.0 mg b.i.d. bumetanide groups, one patient had a moderate hypokalemia. Ten patients, 7 in the 2.0 mg group and 3 in the 1.0 mg group were withdrawn from the study. The rate of withdrawal was 0%, 17% and 43%, respectively in the 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg b.i.d. bumetanide groups, as compared with 14% in the placebo group. The withdrawals from the study because of an adverse event were reported for three patients in the 1.0 mg b.i.d. group: anorexia and fatigue (n = 1), change in behavior (n = 1), moderate hypokalemia (n = 1); and for six patients in the 2.0 mg b.i.d. group: moderate hypokalemia (n = 3), anorexia and fatigue (n = 2) and polyuria (n = 1). Blood pressure and results of routine laboratory tests did not differ significantly between the bumetanide and placebo groups. No hearing loss was reported. Kidney ultrasound did not reveal any abnormalities due to the treatments. TEAEs were similar with earlier observations, in adults receiving loop diuretics.

### Novel intranasal loop Diuretic [^115gPph8]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Intranasal bumetanide was safe and generally well-tolerated with no overt signs of nasal irritation across the study population. Following intranasal or oral administrations, bumetanide was absorbed with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) ranging from 1.02 to 1.50 hours post dose. Plasma bumetanide concentration remained steady between 1.0 and 2.0 hours post dose, followed by a slow decline. Increases in bumetanide exposure seemed to be dose proportional over the 0.5- to 2.0-mg dose range after intranasal administration. Furthermore, bumetanide exposure after a 2.0-mg intranasal administration was similar to a 1.0-mg intravenous or a 2.0-mg oral dose. For intranasal vs oral administration, particularly in the 2.0 mg intranasal group, the intranasal t max did occur sooner compared to oral, although differences in t max were not statistically significant. There is no significant difference in the maximum concentration and area under the curve 0-last between the intranasal route and the oral route at the 2.0-mg dose level (Figure 1B). An exploratory observation of the study demonstrated similar urine output for the intranasal arms as compared with the oral and intravenous cohorts.

General

Serum potassium should be measured periodically and potassium supplements or potassium sparing diuretics added if necessary. Periodic determinations of other electrolytes are advised in patients treated with high doses or for prolonged periods, particularly in those on low-salt diets.

Hyperuricemia may occur; it has been asymptomatic in cases reported to date. Reversible elevations of the BUN and creatinine may also occur, especially in association with dehydration and particularly in patients with renal insufficiency. Bumex may increase urinary calcium excretion with resultant hypocalcemia.

Diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.

Laboratory Tests

Studies in normal subjects receiving Bumex revealed no adverse effects on glucose tolerance, plasma insulin, glucagon and growth hormone levels, but the possibility of an effect on glucose metabolism exists. Periodic determinations of blood sugar should be done, particularly in patients with diabetes or suspected latent diabetes.

Patients under treatment should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver damage or idiosyncratic reactions, which have been reported occasionally in foreign marketing experience. The relationship of these occurrences to Bumex use is not certain.

Discussion

Our first aim in this study was to determine the most favorable dose of bumetanide in the pediatric population. In keeping with earlier studies, our results showed that bumetanide is safe but is associated with adverse events related to diuresis and dehydration. The hypokalemia is clinically manageable with potassium supplementation, dose titration and careful hydration of the patient. This is in keeping with over a decade of experience with loop diuretic drugs. We implemented twice-daily treatment to increase patient exposure to bumetanide given its short lifetime. Results suggest that the frequency and severity of adverse events increased with the dose, whereas there was no clear dose–response relationship for efficacy. The results of this dose-ranging study demonstrated the highest efficacy of bumetanide 2 mg twice a day on both primary and secondary end points. Nevertheless, considering the rate of withdrawals (33.3%), the number (121 TEAEs) and severity of adverse events in dosage group, it will not be retained for further Phase III trials. The dose of 1 mg twice daily appears to be the best compromise between safety and efficacy.

Our observations provide important experience with the medication across the entire pediatric age range. Although the TEAEs are in accord with well-described earlier reports, they stress the need to control electrolytes and hydration. There was no simple relation between TEAEs and efficacy. Thus, none of the moderate hypokalemic patients (< 3 mL −1) were high responder patients with at least 6 points in CARS change from screening to day 90. In the FAS analysis, the highest CARS score decrease was in the 0.5 mg group, whereas the highest frequency in AEs was in the 2.0 mg group. Bumetanide acts on two target tissues (kidney and brain) and on two independent physiological functions. The lack of a direct relationship between efficacy and safety is illustrated by our findings; lack of dose response effect for efficacy but a dose-dependent increase in the frequency and severity of AEs.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114Ua7oU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — definitions relevant to overdose, patient terminology, physical dependence, and psychosocial care are provided. Overdose is the inadvertent or deliberate consumption of a dose much larger than that either habitually used by the individual or ordinarily used for treatment of an illness, that results in a serious toxic reaction or death. In this document, patient refers to an individual receiving substance use disorder treatment, with client and patient sometimes used interchangeably. Physical dependence is a state of physical adaptation manifested by a drug class-specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, and/or decreasing blood level of a substance and/or administration of an antagonist. Psychosocial interventions are nonpharmacological interventions that may include structured, professionally administered interventions (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy or insight-oriented psychotherapy) or nonprofessional interventions (e.g., self-help groups), while psychosocial treatment refers to professionally administered interventions carried out in a therapeutic context at an individual, family, or group level. Recovery is a process of sustained action that addresses the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual nature of the individual and his or her addiction, remission is a state associated with an abatement of signs and symptoms that characterize active addiction, and relapse is a process in which an individual who has established disease remission experiences recurrence of signs and symptoms of active addiction.

### Is it safe to use a diuretic to treat seizures early in development? [^114aUuaE]. Epilepsy Currents (2011). Low credibility.

There has been considerable interest in using bumetanide, a diuretic chloride importer NKCC1 antagonist, to reduce intracellular chloride ([Cl(-)](i)) in epileptic neurons, thereby shifting the polarity of GABA from excitatory to inhibitory and ameliorating the actions of GABA-acting antiepileptic drugs. However, a recent study raises the important issue of potential deleterious actions of bumetanide on immature neurons, because reduction of (Cl(-))(i) also alleviates a major source of excitation in developing neurons, upon which GABA exerts a trophic action. This review considers the importance of separating intrauterine from postnatal effects of bumetanide in normal versus pathologic neurons.

Loop diuretics in dialysis patients — Large doses of potent loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, or torsemide) can be administered to promote loss of sodium and water, but therapy is effective only when RKF is high enough to provide daily urine output of at least 100 mL and its effectiveness may not last long. Loop diuretics should be used with caution because of the possibility of ototoxicity, with the incidence appearing greater with furosemide and much less with bumetanide or torsemide.

### Paradoxical benzodiazepine response: a rationale for bumetanide in neurodevelopmental disorders? [^114JMqiE]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The diuretic agent bumetanide has recently been put forward as a novel, promising treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related conditions. Bumetanide can decrease neuronal chloride concentrations and may thereby reinstate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, strategies to select appropriate candidates for bumetanide treatment are lacking. We hypothesized that a paradoxical response to GABA-enforcing agents such as benzodiazepines may predict the efficacy of bumetanide treatment in neurodevelopmental disorders. We describe a case of a 10-year-old girl with ASD, epilepsy, cortical dysplasia, and a 15q11.2 duplication who had exhibited marked behavioral arousal after previous treatment with clobazam, a benzodiazepine. We hypothesized that this response indicated the presence of depolarizing excitatory GABA and started bumetanide treatment with monitoring of behavior, cognition, and EEG. The treatment resulted in a marked clinical improvement in sensory behaviors, rigidity, and memory performance, which was substantiated by questionnaires and cognitive assessments. At baseline, the girl's EEG showed a depression in absolute α power, an electrographic sign previously related to ASD, which was normalized with bumetanide treatment. The effects of bumetanide on cognition and EEG seemed to mirror the "nonparadoxical" responses to benzodiazepines in healthy subjects. In addition, temporal lobe epilepsy and cortical dysplasia have both been linked to disturbed chloride homeostasis and seem to support our assumption that the observed paradoxical response was due to GABA-mediated excitation. This case highlights that a paradoxical behavioral response to GABA-enforcing drugs may constitute a framework for targeted treatment with bumetanide.

OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage can lead to acute profound water loss, volume and electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction of blood volume and circulatory collapse with a possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism. Electrolyte depletion may be manifested by weakness, dizziness, mental confusion, anorexia, lethargy, vomiting and cramps. Treatment consists of replacement of fluid and electrolyte losses by careful monitoring of the urine and electrolyte output and serum electrolyte levels.

### Poisonings and overdoses in the intensive care unit: general and specific management issues [^113bWA1D]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide current information on general and specific interventions for overdoses likely to require intensive care.

Design

Review of literature relevant to selected interventions for general management of overdoses and specific poisons.

Results

The benefit of interventions to decrease absorption or enhance elimination of toxins is limited to a relatively small number of specific agents. Antidotes and certain interventions may be helpful in preventing or treating toxicity in specific poisonings when used appropriately. Intensive supportive care is also necessary to achieve good outcomes.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the indications and limitations of current interventions for poisonings and overdoses is important for care of the critically ill poisoned patient.

### Don't get BUM' D out: bumetanide may yet prove beneficial for neonatal seizures [^1159Rwhe]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Seizures are a common manifestation of injury or dysfunction in the neonatal brain and are associated with acute and chronic adverse neurological sequelae. Therefore, finding a safe, effective treatment for neonatal seizures continues to be a high priority. The availability of effective medications is limited by both the inherent physiology of neonatal brain as well as by the lack of adequately powered and designed clinical trials. We find ourselves in a situation not unlike that of several decades ago, with phenobarbital still considered to be the first and best - though not ideal - medicine choice for neonatal seizures.

Bumetanide (BUM) has been touted as a drug with antiseizure effects that might fill the role of a mechanism-based treatment for neonatal seizures.BUM is a loop diuretic, already being used in neonates, that also inhibits the chloride co-transporter NKCC1, present on many cells, including neurons. NKCC1 imports chloride ions (Cl -) into neonatal neurons, keeping the intracellular Cl - concentration high. This unique Cl - distribution accounts, at least in part, for the observation that at early stages of brain development (up to early post-term), GABA (γ-amino-butyric acid) exerts a depolarizing rather than hyperpolarizing effect on many neurons. Thus in the developing brain, when GABA-A receptors are activated, Cl - exits the neuron down its concentration gradient, depolarizing the neuron, favoring neuronal hyperexcitability and increased seizure propensity. As an NKCC1 antagonist, BUM has been hypothesized to counteract intracellular Cl - accumulation and thereby reduce cellular excitability. Some animal models attest to the age-related efficacy of BUM against neonatal seizures.

### Bumetanide (Bumex) [^114CNEF9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Individualize dosage with careful monitoring of patient response.

Oral Administration

The usual total daily dosage of Bumex tablets is 0.5 mg to 2 mg and in most patients is given as a single dose.

If the diuretic response to an initial dose of Bumex tablets is not adequate, in view of its rapid onset and short duration of action, a second or third dose may be given at 4- to 5-hour intervals up to a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. An intermittent dose schedule, whereby Bumex tablets are given on alternate days or for 3 to 4 days with rest periods of 1 to 2 days in between, is recommended as the safest and most effective method for the continued control of edema. In patients with hepatic failure, keep the dosage to a minimum.

Because cross-sensitivity with furosemide has rarely been observed, bumetanide can be substituted at approximately a 1:40 ratio of bumetanide in proportion to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide.

Parenteral Administration

Bumetanide injection may be administered parenterally (intravenously and intramuscularly) to patients in whom gastrointestinal absorption may be impaired or in whom oral administration is not practical.

Terminate parenteral treatment and institute oral treatment as soon as possible.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^113cWwBW]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Since common electrolyte disturbances could be encountered during diuretic therapy, it is important to monitor electrolytes levels and also to assess acid-based status. In order to avoid hypokalemia, administration of oral potassium it is easy. Measuring urinary potassium concentration and calculating the daily losses of potassium, which require replacement is a strategy that can be used to estimate daily potassium requirements. Another strategy is the use of potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone. Hypomagnesemia is frequently found during diuretic therapy, magnesium replacement can be achieved either intravenously or orally, typically with 20–30 mmoL per day. Finally in some patients, chloride losses exceed sodium losses and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis develops; this is usually corrected with the administration of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride.

A recent comprehensive review have shown that torsemide and bumetanide have more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles than furosemide, and in the case of torsemide it could be more efficacious than furosemide in patients with heart failure (decreased mortality, decrease hospitalizations, and improved New York Heart Association functional classification). In AKI patients, as compared with torsemide the use of furosemide was associated with a significant improvement in urine output. Moreover, two trials comparing bumetanide with furosemide showed conflicting results.

Finally, in patients with AKI the response to furosemide may be reduced due to multiple mechanisms including a reduced tubular secretion of furosemide and blunted response of Na-K-2Cl co-transporters at the loop of Henle. This reduced response to furosemide in AKI patients often requires the use of higher doses that may increase the risk of ototoxicity, especially as the clearance of furosemide is severely reduced in AKI. High doses of furosemide may also result in myocardial dysfunction secondary to furosemide induced vasoconstriction.

WARNINGS

Volume and Electrolyte Depletion

The dose of bumetanide should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients.

Hypokalemia

Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of bumetanide administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias.

In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients.

Ototoxicity

In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment. Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk.

Allergy to Sulfonamides

Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to bumetanide.

Thrombocytopenia

Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from postmarketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.

### Don't get BUM' D out: bumetanide may yet prove beneficial for neonatal seizures [^116roWKN]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

The study by Soul et aladds considerable important new information. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial was performed on neonates who already had established PHB-resistant electrographic seizures of any etiology. The infants were then randomized to additional PHB plus placebo (control group) vs additional PHB plus various doses of BUM (.1,.2, or.3 mg/kg). This add-on study design allowed comparison of PHB monotherapy (control group) directly with BUM exposure. Continuous electroencephalographic (cEEG) monitoring was used for seizure verification at baseline and during treatment. The investigators enrolled 16 neonates in the PHB plus placebo arm and 27 infants in the PHB plus BUM arm. The primary outcome measure was the pharmacokinetics and safety of BUM as add-on therapy to treat neonatal seizures, while the "exploratory endpoint" was the effect of dose and drug exposure on seizure burden. Seizure burden was defined as the minutes of seizure per hour of cEEG recording. Baseline cEEG was recorded for 2 hours prior to study dose administration, then for an additional 48 or more hours.

Study results are complicated, partly because BUM-randomized patients had a higher baseline seizure burden (by chance), prior to drug administration. On the other hand, this situation might be considered fortuitous, because any beneficial effect of BUM would then be even stronger evidence for its efficacy. Neonates in both arms of the study had similar demographics and side effect profiles, except that BUM-exposed babies had more diuresis, as expected. Though seizure burden was quite variable in both arms, the seizure burden both 0 to 4 hours after BUM exposure and 2 to 4 hours after BUM exposure, was decreased significantly in BUM-exposed babies, and the reduction of seizure burden was dose related. In regard to safety and pharmacokinetic issues, the primary endpoint, there was no excess hearing impairment attributed to BUM (only 2/26 survivors developed hearing loss and both received concurrent aminoglycosides).

Drug Interactions

Drugs with Ototoxic Potential (see WARNINGS)

Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered bumetanide in patients to whom aminoglycoside antibiotics are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.

Drugs with Nephrotoxic Potential

There has been no experience with the concurrent use of Bumex with drugs known to have a nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, the simultaneous administration of these drugs should be avoided.

Lithium

Lithium should generally not be given with diuretics (such as Bumex) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.

Probenecid

Pretreatment with probenecid reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by Bumex. This antagonistic effect of probenecid on Bumex natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide. Thus, probenecid should not be administered concurrently with Bumex.

Indomethacin

Indomethacin blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during Bumex treatment and inhibits the bumetanide-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Concurrent therapy with Bumex is thus not recommended.

Antihypertensives

Bumex may potentiate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.

Digoxin

Interaction studies in humans have shown no effect on digoxin blood levels.

Anticoagulants

Interaction studies in humans have shown Bumex to have no effect on warfarin metabolism or on plasma prothrombin activity.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility

Bumex was devoid of mutagenic activity in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium when tested in the presence or absence of an in vitro metabolic activation system. An 18-month study showed an increase in mammary adenomas of questionable significance in female rats receiving oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (2000 times a 2-mg human dose). A repeat study at the same doses failed to duplicate this finding.

Reproduction studies were performed to evaluate general reproductive performance and fertility in rats at oral dose levels of 10, 30, 60 or 100 mg/kg/day. The pregnancy rate was slightly decreased in the treated animals; however, the differences were small and not statistically significant.

### Effects of bumetanide on neurobehavioral function in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^1169xri1]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

In animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the NKCC1 chloride-importer inhibitor bumetanide restores physiological (Cl -) i levels, enhances GABAergic inhibition and attenuates electrical and behavioral symptoms of ASD. In an earlier phase 2 trial; bumetanide reduced the severity of ASD in children and adolescents (3–11 years old). Here we report the results of a multicenter phase 2B study primarily to assess dose/response and safety effects of bumetanide. Efficacy outcome measures included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), the Social Responsive Scale (SRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement scale (CGI-I). Eighty-eight patients with ASD spanning across the entire pediatric population (2–18 years old) were subdivided in four age groups and randomized to receive bumetanide (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months. The mean CARS value was significantly improved in the completers group (P: 0.015). Also, 23 treated children had more than a six-point improvement in the CARS compared with only one placebo-treated individual. Bumetanide significantly improved CGI (P: 0.0043) and the SRS score by more than 10 points (P: 0.02). The most frequent adverse events were hypokalemia, increased urine elimination, loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia. Hypokalemia occurred mainly at the beginning of the treatment at 1.0 and 2.0mg twice-daily doses and improved gradually with oral potassium supplements. The frequency and incidence of adverse event were directly correlated with the dose of bumetanide. Therefore, bumetanide improves the core symptoms of ASD and presents a favorable benefit/risk ratio particularly at 1.0mg twice daily.

### Mechanism-based treatment for neonatal seizures: still on the horizon [^111aTCYr]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Commentary on: Stafstrom CE. Neonatal Seizures: Is a Novel, Mechanism-Based Treatment Finally on the Horizon? Epilepsy Curr. 2006;6:130–132. doi:

In 2006, when my accompanying commentary was first published, there was considerable optimism that a blocker of the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), such as the loop diuretic bumetanide, would provide the first mechanism-based treatment for neonatal seizures. It made sense, in that bumetanide suppressed seizures in animal models and epileptic activity in brain slices, via the plausible physiological mechanism of shifting the chloride equilibrium potential (E Cl) in the negative direction in neonatal neurons. By blocking NKCC1 and reducing Cl − influx, bumetanide could convert the depolarizing action of gamma-amino butyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor activation in neonatal neurons into a hyperpolarizing action, as seen in mature neurons. Shortly after the commentary appeared, a proof-of-principle case report was published of an infant with neonatal seizures successfully treated with bumetanide. This experimental and anecdotal clinical evidence led to 2 clinical trials using bumetanide for neonatal seizures in human infants.

One trial was a dose-finding open-label phase 1/2 trial (NCT01434225, called "NEonatal seizures with Medication Off-patent) conducted in 8 European hospitals on neonates with seizures in the setting of hypoxia–ischemia who did not respond to a loading dose of phenobarbital (PHB). The aim of this pharmacokinetic trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 4 doses of bumetanide using a bivariate Bayesian sequential dose-escalation design (each child received active drug, no control group). The primary end point was 80% reduction in electrographic seizure burden in at least half of infants, without use of rescue medications — these comprise very stringent criteria. However, the study was stopped after 14 babies were enrolled, due to documented hearing loss in 3 of 11 survivors. In addition, it was concluded that bumetanide was not affording significant seizure reduction, though more than one-third of infants did not have seizures during the baseline period. When neonates with seizures during the baseline period were considered separately, bumetanide did appear to reduce the seizure burden, though the benefit was temporary.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) — volume overload and diuretic management — states that approximately 70% of patients with ADHF have signs and symptoms of elevated ventricular filling pressures, and that loop diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are the mainstay of treatment for volume overload; HF specialists should select the most appropriate agent, dose, and route, recognize the deleterious effects of excessive diuretic use and select the lowest effective dose, and when resistance occurs must reassess the plan, adjust dose, use synergistic diuretics, and initiate therapies that augment cardiac output and renal blood flow, while balancing chronic neurohumoral blockade against hemodynamic derangements during ADHF.

### Risk of fatal overdose during and after specialist drug treatment: the VEdeTTE study, a national multi-site prospective cohort study [^111eAwA1]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Specialist drug treatment is critical to overdose prevention; methadone maintenance is effective, but we lack evidence for other modalities. We evaluate the impact of a range of treatments for opiate dependence on overdose mortality.

Methods

Prospective cohort study of 10,454 heroin users entering treatment 1998–2001 in Italy followed-up for 10,208 person-years in treatment and 2,914 person-years out of treatment. Standardized overall mortality ratios (SMR) estimate excess mortality risk for heroin users in and out of treatment compared to the general population. Cox models compare the hazard ratio (HR) of overdose between heroin users in treatment and out of treatment.

Results

There were 41 overdose deaths, 10 during treatment and 31 out of treatment, generating annual mortality rates of 0.1% and 1.1% and SMRs of 3.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8–5.4] and 21.4 (16.7–27.4), respectively. Retention in any treatment was protective against overdose mortality (HR 0.09 95% CI 0.04–0.19) compared to the risk of mortality out of treatment, independent of treatment type and potential confounders. The risk of a fatal overdose was 2.3% in the month immediately after treatment and 0.77% in the subsequent period; compared to the risk of overdose during treatment the HR was 26.6 (95% CI 11.6–61.1) in the month immediately following treatment and 7.3 (3.3–16.2) in the subsequent period.

Conclusions

We demonstrate that a range of treatments for heroin dependence reduces overdose mortality risk. However, the considerable excess mortality risk in the month following treatment indicates the need for greater health education of drug users and implementation of relapse and overdose death prevention programmes. Further investigation is needed to measure and weigh the potential benefits and harms of short-term therapies for opiate use.

### A pilot randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of bumetanide to treat neonatal seizures [^114XVq9H]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the absence of controlled trials, treatment of neonatal seizures has changed minimally despite poor drug efficacy. We tested bumetanide added to phenobarbital to treat neonatal seizures in the first trial to include a standard-therapy control group.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation design was employed. Neonates with postmenstrual age 33 to 44weeks at risk of or with seizures were eligible. Subjects with electroencephalography (EEG)-confirmed seizures after ≥ 20 and < 40mg/kg phenobarbital were randomized to receive additional phenobarbital with either placebo (control) or 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3mg/kg bumetanide (treatment). Continuous EEG monitoring data from ≥ 2hours before to ≥ 48hours after study drug administration (SDA) were analyzed for seizures.

Results

Subjects were randomized to treatment (n = 27) and control (n = 16) groups. Pharmacokinetics were highly variable among subjects and altered by hypothermia. The only statistically significant adverse event was diuresis in treated subjects (48% vs 13%, p = 0.02). One treated (4%) and 3 control subjects died (19%, p = 0.14). Among survivors, 2 of 26 treated subjects (8%) and 0 of 13 control subjects had hearing impairment, as did 1 nonrandomized subject. Total seizure burden varied widely, with much higher seizure burden in treatment versus control groups (median = 3.1 vs 1.2min/h, p = 0.006). There was significantly greater reduction in seizure burden 0 to 4hours and 2 to 4hours post-SDA (both p < 0.01) compared with 2-hour baseline in treatment versus control groups with adjustment for seizure burden.

Interpretation

Although definitive proof of efficacy awaits an appropriately powered phase 3 trial, this randomized, controlled, multicenter trial demonstrated an additional reduction in seizure burden attributable to bumetanide over phenobarbital without increased serious adverse effects. Future trials of bumetanide and other drugs should include a control group and balance seizure severity. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:327–340.

### Effects of bumetanide on neurobehavioral function in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^1148SegK]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

There are several important limitations to the present study. The small size of the population and the short observation period limit the determination of the best responders in terms of age, severity and clinical characteristics. It is also not possible at present to claim that bumetanide will act on the entire population of ASD pediatric population as children and adolescents taking other medications and/or having other comorbidities as these were excluded. In spite of the compelling data on high intracellular chloride in animal models, it is impossible to determine these levels in patients with autism and therefore we must rely on the assumptions that this is indeed the mechanism in humans. Nevertheless, the high specificity of bumetanide to brain NKCC1 and kidney NKCC2 chloride importers strongly argues in favor of this assumption. Our small subpopulations excluded an analysis of comorbidity like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or depression and its links with efficacy. An additional important limitation concerns the lack of information on treatment response predictors including intelligence quotient, schooling and comorbidity. This hampers the conclusions because of the extreme heterogeneity of ASD, and our future clinical trials will have to incorporate these measures. Finally, the diuretic actions of bumetanide also impact the blinding procedure. To reduce this impact, the psychiatrist was separated from the pediatrician who treated the children and was thus blinded to the treatment. In addition, the convergence of results based on scores made by caregivers and psychiatrists reduces the impact of the diuretic on blinding. Clearly this trial must be viewed as a source of data on the safety and dose-ranging usage of bumetanide and it provides further support to justify a large multisite European Phase III trial.

Dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy — Moderate dietary sodium restriction (2 g or 90 mmol/day) should be prescribed to achieve a negative sodium balance and net fluid loss, and fluid restriction is not indicated unless hyponatremia is present; a formal consultation with a dietician should be considered. In most patients with cirrhosis presenting with ascites, dietary sodium restriction alone is insufficient and diuretic therapy is necessary. Aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone) and loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide, torsemide, bumetanide) are the mainstay of diuretic treatment of cirrhotic ascites, and the recommended initial dose of spironolactone is 100 mg/day. Two studies addressing the best way to use these diuretics showed that for the first episode of ascites, treatment with aldosterone antagonists alone generated an adequate response with fewer side effects, whereas those with long-standing ascites responded better to a combined diuretic treatment.

Safety and tolerability of the treatment

The only child that was removed from the trial because of eczema was on placebo (Supplementary Table 4). Two children were removed from the trial on parental decision because of bed-wetting and identified at the end of the trial to have been treated with placebo (one) and bumetanide (one). Two children were removed from the trial consequently to hyperactivity due to withdrawal from their medication (methylphenidate and risperidone); although that was stopped 3 weeks before the trial (Figure 1). One child treated with bumetanide was removed because of hypokalemia (n = 1) (Supplementary Table 4). When the levels of K + were ≤ 3,5 mM l −1, we supplemented with potassium-gluconate syrup. This was necessary in six of the bumetanide-treated children that had a mild hypokalemia (3.5, 3.4, 3.1, 3.5, 3.5 and 3.4 m l −1). Clinical and Biological surveillance revealed no alterations in all the parameters that were checked (see Treatment). There was no dehydration, as confirmed by normal sodiums and maintenance of weight (Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, in keeping with the extensive use of bumetanide in babies and children for several decades, the side effects in the present trial were limited.

### Accidental protonitazene intoxication: clinical management and detection of a novel opioid [^115WQfxY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Drug overdoses are a major public health issue. The emergence of new synthetic drugs is making their management more complex, combining difficulties in clinical diagnosis, in identifying the substance and in treatment. Protonitazene, an emerging synthetic drug, combines these three difficulties, even though an effective antidote exists.

### Effect of the combination of bumetanide plus chlorthalidone on hypertension and volume overload in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4–5 KDIGO without renal replacement therapy: a double-blind randomized HEBE-CKD trial [^117PPy8z]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Study design

Randomized groups were assigned to receive initial treatment with either 3 mg bumetanide + 50 mg chlorthalidone or 3 mg bumetanide + placebo. Bumetanide was administered on the following schedule: 2 mg at 10 am and 1 mg at 4 pm. This bumetanide dose schedule was defined according to the experience in the use of bumetanide from our department and based on pharmacokinetic studies. Chlorthalidone was administered on the following schedule: 50 mg at 12 pm. The second assessment was performed 7 days after the start of the clinical trial and included new blood tests, blood pressure measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and questionnaires for possible adverse effects. If no contraindication was noted [symptomatic hypotension secondary to clinical evidence of dehydration; severe hyponatremia (sodium < 128 mEq/L); or severe hypokalemia (potassium < 3.5 mEq/L)], the treatment dosage was escalated to 4 mg bumetanide + 100 mg chlorthalidone (intervention group) or bumetanide 4 mg + placebo (control group). The placebo consisted of starch capsules, which had the same appearance and weight as the chlorthalidone capsules. Twenty-eight days after the start of the initial evaluation, patients were subjected to the final assessment, which consisted of blood testing, bioelectrical impedance analysis, blood pressure measurements, and a questionnaire.

### The immuno-behavioural covariation associated with the treatment response to bumetanide in young children with autism spectrum disorder [^114gWh6h]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects about 1% children around the world and can cause lifelong disability and elevate premature mortality. Currently, no medication that can cure ASD or all of its core symptoms is available. The recent success of repurposing drugs for novel treatments in psychiatry has been highlighted, with one of the examples given being the use of bumetanide to improve the core symptoms in ASD. The most frequent adverse events were hypokalemia, increased urine elimination, loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia. The heterogeneity in the treatment effect of bumetanide among ASD patients was significant, ranging from 37.3% to 47.62% in the randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in China and 51.80% or from 26.3% to 45.2% in the RCTs in France. Besides, there were also studies reported nonsignificant treatment effect of bumetanide for patients with ASD. Understanding this heterogeneity is essential for its clinical applicability and requires further investigation of its underlying mechanism of action to achieve precision medicine for ASD children.

### A novel prodrug-based strategy to increase effects of bumetanide in epilepsy [^116VbKPR]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

There is considerable interest in using bumetanide, a chloride importer Na-K-Cl cotransporter antagonist, for treatment of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy or ischemic and traumatic brain injury, that may involve deranged cellular chloride homeostasis. However, bumetanide is heavily bound to plasma proteins (~98%) and highly ionized at physiological pH, so that it only poorly penetrates into the brain, and chronic treatment with bumetanide is compromised by its potent diuretic effect.

Methods

To overcome these problems, we designed lipophilic and uncharged prodrugs of bumetanide that should penetrate the blood-brain barrier more easily than the parent drug and are converted into bumetanide in the brain. The feasibility of this strategy was evaluated in mice and rats.

Results

Analysis of bumetanide levels in plasma and brain showed that administration of 2 ester prodrugs of bumetanide, the pivaloyloxymethyl (BUM1) and N, N-dimethylaminoethylester (BUM5), resulted in significantly higher brain levels of bumetanide than administration of the parent drug. BUM5, but not BUM1, was less diuretic than bumetanide, so that BUM5 was further evaluated in chronic models of epilepsy in mice and rats. In the pilocarpine model in mice, BUM5, but not bumetanide, counteracted the alteration in seizure threshold during the latent period. In the kindling model in rats, BUM5 was more efficacious than bumetanide in potentiating the anticonvulsant effect of phenobarbital.

Interpretation

Our data demonstrate that the goal of designing bumetanide prodrugs that specifically target the brain is feasible and that such drugs may resolve the problems associated with using bumetanide for treatment of neurological disorders.

### Bumetanide (Bumex) [^112r3S1P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Bumex tablets are indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome.

Almost equal diuretic response occurs after oral and parenteral administration of bumetanide. Therefore, if impaired gastrointestinal absorption is suspected or oral administration is not practical, bumetanide should be given by the intramuscular or intravenous route.

Successful treatment with Bumex tablets following instances of allergic reactions to furosemide suggests a lack of cross-sensitivity.

### Effects of bumetanide on neurobehavioral function in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^114Cgyi1]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

In animal models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the NKCC1 chloride-importer inhibitor bumetanide restores physiological (Cl −) i levels, enhances GABAergic inhibition and attenuates electrical and behavioral symptoms of ASD. In an earlier phase 2 trial; bumetanide reduced the severity of ASD in children and adolescents (3–11 years old). Here we report the results of a multicenter phase 2B study primarily to assess dose/response and safety effects of bumetanide. Efficacy outcome measures included the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), the Social Responsive Scale (SRS) and the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Improvement scale (CGI-I). Eighty-eight patients with ASD spanning across the entire pediatric population (2–18 years old) were subdivided in four age groups and randomized to receive bumetanide (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg twice daily) or placebo for 3 months. The mean CARS value was significantly improved in the completers group (P: 0.015). Also, 23 treated children had more than a six-point improvement in the CARS compared with only one placebo-treated individual. Bumetanide significantly improved CGI (P: 0.0043) and the SRS score by more than 10 points (P: 0.02). The most frequent adverse events were hypokalemia, increased urine elimination, loss of appetite, dehydration and asthenia. Hypokalemia occurred mainly at the beginning of the treatment at 1.0 and 2.0 mg twice-daily doses and improved gradually with oral potassium supplements. The frequency and incidence of adverse event were directly correlated with the dose of bumetanide. Therefore, bumetanide improves the core symptoms of ASD and presents a favorable benefit/risk ratio particularly at 1.0 mg twice daily.

### Structural basis for inhibition of the cation-chloride cotransporter NKCC1 by the diuretic drug bumetanide [^1172BShK]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Here we reveal the mechanism of action of bumetanide on NKCC1, five decades after it was first developed for the clinical management of fluid overload and hypertension. Inhibition of NKCC1 by bumetanide and other loop diuretics is a double-edged sword in clinical medicine. On the one hand, antagonizing neuronal NKCC1 represents an emerging attractive strategy for the treatment of a wide range of brain disorders such as seizure and autism. On the other hand, inhibition of NKCC1 also causes side effect of ototoxicity in the treatment of edema/hypertension. We now show that bumetanide targets the extracellular ion translocation path that constitutes a set of residues almost invariant in human NKCC1 and NKCC2, explaining why bumetanide (and other loop diuretics) cannot discriminate these two closely related paralogues (Supplementary Fig. 22). Our studies suggest that isoform-specific inhibitors of NKCCs could be better crafted by interfering with their respective regulatory mechanisms which must have adapted to fulfill their divergent roles. One such enticing strategy would be to develop small molecules (or biologics) that can modulate the strength of association between their N-terminal phosphoregulatory segment and C-terminal domain.

3.6 Sensitivity analyses

Findings of sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the primary results. In brief, after constraining sampling to individuals with heart failure, the association between bumetanide use and AD remained non‐significant, regardless of whether bumetanide use was measured as ever use (Table S2 in supporting information) or as number of years of use (Table S3 in supporting information). Ever use of bumetanide, however, remained associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia (Table S4 in supporting information).

When constraining the sample to individuals ≤ 70 years of age at baseline, ever use of bumetanide was associated with a slightly increased risk of AD; however, the number of years of bumetanide use was not significantly associated with AD (Tables S2 and S3). Bumetanide use, like furosemide and torsemide use, was associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia, regardless of the functional form of the variable (Tables S4 and S5 in supporting information).

When constraining the sample to individuals with an index date before January 2010, which extended the average follow‐up period available in the sample, the association between bumetanide use and AD remained non‐significant, regardless of whether bumetanide use was measured as ever use (Table S2) or as number of years of use (Table S3). Use of bumetanide, furosemide, or torsemide was associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia (Tables S4 and S5).

When reproducing the base case analyses on the overall sample with the addition of a history of traumatic brain injury and the number of other CMS chronic conditions as covariates, the association between bumetanide use and AD remained non‐significant, regardless of whether bumetanide use was measured as ever use (Table S2) or as number of years of use (Table S3). Use of bumetanide, furosemide, or torsemide was associated with increased risk of all‐cause dementia (Tables S4 and S5).

### Effects of bumetanide on neurobehavioral function in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^114zyAHn]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

As expected, the most frequent TEAE observed in bumetanide-treated groups was hypokalemia: either mild (between 3.0 and 3.5 m) or moderate (between 2.0 and 3.0 m). Hypokalemia occurred shortly after the start of the trial and were detected at the first visit after the beginning of the treatment on day 7 in the 1.0 and 2.0 mg b.i.d. groups. All the patients experiencing hypokalemia were administered gradual potassium supplements and were advised to eat potassium-rich foods. These procedures permitted a progressive return to normal (Supplementary Figure 2). In addition, the hypokalemia occurred most frequently during the first week of treatment and was dose dependent occurring more frequently with the 1 or 2 mg dose than the 0.5 mg bumetanide dose (Supplementary Figure 3). There was no straightforward relationship between age and TEAEs. Frequency of moderate hypokalemia was comparable when patients are split into two age subgroups 2–18 and 9–18 years old (Supplementary Table 2). No patients with mild or moderate hypokalemia developed cardiac arrhythmia or neuromuscular complications. Hypokalemia was accompanied by hypochloremia but not by hyponatremia and rapidly improved with high-potassium food and oral potassium supplementation. Interestingly, in 19 patients who participated in the 6-month extension and who received bumetanide at 0.5 mg b.i.d. for the first week and then shifted to 1.0 mg b.i.d. moderate hypokalemia (2.9 m) was observed in only one patient (5%) on day 180, suggesting that a gradual dose increase might reduce hypokalemia. Therefore, bumetanide-induced TEAEs in children and adolescents are consistent with earlier adults studies, and the medication is safe provided that electrolytic balance is monitored and controlled.

Primary outcomes

The synopsis of the trial aimed primarily at determining the most efficient doses in the entire pediatric population resulted in small subpopulations thereby precluding detailed analysis of the outcomes on a subpopulation basis. All efficacy data are summarized in Table 2.

### Optimal initial intravenous loop Diuretic Dosing in acute decompensated heart Failure [^112d2Nyr]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Although there may not be differences in clinical outcomes associated with different loop diuretic medications, there are relevant and important pharmacokinetic differences in relative potencies and bioavailability. These differences dictate relative conversions between loop diuretics and as shown in the current analysis, as the magnitude of dose increases, the likelihood of receiving optimal initial IV dosing decreases. This finding may reflect either a discomfort in practice when selecting an initial dose that surpasses a particular threshold or inadequate pharmacokinetic equipotent conversions between loop diuretics. Both potential mechanisms are further supported in our study by the 20 to 25% lower probability of optimal dosing with the use of bumetanide as a home oral diuretic or as an initial IV diuretic. This may indicate a misinterpretation of pharmacokinetic equivalences between bumetanide and furosemide. Furthermore, results remained consistent in our sensitivity analysis with an alternative diuretic dosing conversion. While these mechanisms may be driven by the goal of minimizing medication-related side effects, there are limited reports of adverse events from exceeding dosing thresholds for IV loop diuretics in patients with ADHF. Hearing loss or tinnitus, rare side effects of loop diuretics, are only notable in rapid IV bolus doses exceeding 500 mg of FEs, which is rarely seen within current HF management. Furthermore, acute kidney injury in the setting of volume overload and diuresis is not associated with long-term worsening renal function, which diverges from the pedagogical "nephrotoxicity" side effect of loop diuretics during initial ADHF volume management. In fact, a retrospective analysis of the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure trail demonstrated that worsening acute kidney injury biomarkers among those with ADHF were associated with an improvement in survival vs those without acute kidney injury biomarker changes.

### Bumetanide for the treatment of seizures in newborn babies with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (NEMO): an open-label, dose finding, and feasibility phase 1 / 2 trial [^115m86mh]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Preclinical data suggest that the loop-diuretic bumetanide might be an effective treatment for neonatal seizures. We aimed to assess dose and feasibility of intravenous bumetanide as an add-on to phenobarbital for treatment of neonatal seizures.

Methods

In this open-label, dose finding, and feasibility phase 1/2 trial, we recruited full-term infants younger than 48 h who had hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and electrographic seizures not responding to a loading-dose of phenobarbital from eight neonatal intensive care units across Europe. Newborn babies were allocated to receive an additional dose of phenobarbital and one of four bumetanide dose levels by use of a bivariate Bayesian sequential dose-escalation design to assess safety and efficacy. We assessed adverse events, pharmacokinetics, and seizure burden during 48 h continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. The primary efficacy endpoint was a reduction in electrographic seizure burden of more than 80% without the need for rescue antiepileptic drugs in more than 50% of infants. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01434225.

Findings

Between Sept 1, 2011, and Sept 28, 2013, we screened 30 infants who had electrographic seizures due to hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. 14 of these infants (10 boys) were included in the study (dose allocation: 0.05 mg/kg, n = 4; 0.1 mg/kg, n = 3; 0.2 mg/kg, n = 6; 0.3 mg/kg, n = 1). All babies received at least one dose of bumetanide with the second dose of phenobarbital; three were withdrawn for reasons unrelated to bumetanide, and one because of dehydration. All but one infant also received aminoglycosides. Five infants met EEG criteria for seizure reduction (one on 0.05 mg/kg, one on 0.1 mg/kg and three on 0.2 mg/kg), and only two did not need rescue antiepileptic drugs (ie, met rescue criteria; one on 0.05 mg/kg and one on 0.3 mg/kg). We recorded no short-term dose-limiting toxic effects, but three of 11 surviving infants had hearing impairment confirmed on auditory testing between 17 and 108 days of age. The most common non-serious adverse reactions were moderate dehydration in one, mild hypotension in seven, and mild to moderate electrolyte disturbances in 12 infants. The trial was stopped early because of serious adverse reactions and limited evidence for seizure reduction.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that bumetanide as an add-on to phenobarbital does not improve seizure control in newborn infants who have hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and might increase the risk of hearing loss, highlighting the risks associated with the off-label use of drugs in newborn infants before safety assessment in controlled trials.
