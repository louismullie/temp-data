## Question

what is geometric mean leagth of stay

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the geometric mean length of stay is and why it is used in hospital length-of-stay analyses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and formula for the geometric mean. Then, I should verify why length-of-stay data are typically right-skewed and why that matters. Next, I will compare the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean and median in this context. After that, I should review how studies actually report and interpret geometric means, including ratios of geometric means. Finally, I will consider limitations and when the geometric mean might not be appropriate, and then synthesize a concise, clinically grounded answer.

> Let me first confirm the definition. The geometric mean length of stay is the nth root of the product of n individual length-of-stay values, or equivalently, the exponential of the mean of the log-transformed lengths of stay. Mathematically, GM = exp(mean(ln(LOS))), which is the standard approach when LOS is right-skewed and log-normal or approximately so [^112VHAKZ] [^112znDLj].

> Wait, let me verify why we prefer this metric for LOS. Hospital length of stay is commonly right-skewed with a long tail of prolonged stays. The geometric mean is less influenced by extreme values than the arithmetic mean, so it better reflects the central tendency in skewed distributions and is often used alongside log-transformation in regression models to meet distributional assumptions [^112VHAKZ] [^112znDLj].

> I will now examine how this differs from the arithmetic mean and median. The arithmetic mean is sensitive to outliers, so a few very long stays can inflate it; the median is robust but ignores the magnitude of the tail, whereas the geometric mean strikes a balance by down-weighting extreme values while still incorporating all data, which is why many studies report geometric means or back-transformed estimates from log-scale analyses [^112VHAKZ] [^112znDLj].

> Next, I should review concrete examples to ensure this is not just theoretical. In a randomized trial of high-flow nasal oxygen after cardiac surgery, the geometric mean hospital LOS was 29% lower in the intervention group, reported as a ratio of geometric means with 95% CI, which is a common and interpretable way to express proportional differences in LOS studies [^116PP4KH]. Similarly, a multicenter RCT in adhesive small-bowel obstruction reported postoperative LOS as geometric means of 4.2 days versus 5.5 days with a ratio of geometric means of 1.31, again reflecting proportional differences and the skewed nature of LOS data [^116j8Nkf]. Hold on, I should verify that these are indeed geometric means; yes, both trials explicitly used geometric means or log-scale analyses to handle skewness and report proportional effects [^116PP4KH] [^116j8Nkf].

> Let me consider how meta-analyses handle this. Systematic reviews often pool LOS using log-transformed data and report the pooled effect as a ratio of geometric means, which preserves the proportional interpretation across heterogeneous studies. For example, a Cochrane review of weaning protocols reported a 10% reduction in ICU LOS corresponding to a mean log difference, interpreted as a geometric mean ratio of 0.90, illustrating the standard approach to heterogeneous, right-skewed LOS outcomes [^114CKSpT]. I should double-check that this is consistent with broader practice. Yes, multiple methodological sources emphasize modeling LOS on the log scale and reporting geometric mean ratios for comparability [^112znDLj] [^112jx42z].

> But wait, what if the distribution is not log-normal or has zeros. I need to ensure we acknowledge limitations. The geometric mean cannot be computed with zero values, so studies typically add a small constant or exclude zero-day stays; also, if the distribution deviates markedly from log-normality, alternative models or robust measures may be preferable, and some analyses explicitly test distributional assumptions before choosing the geometric mean approach [^114wYUx6] [^111SJMUG].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing is missing. Geometric mean length of stay is a measure of central tendency for right-skewed hospital stay data, calculated as the exponential of the mean log-LOS, which dampens the influence of long stays and enables proportional comparisons via ratios of geometric means; it is widely used in trials and observational studies, and in benchmarking against DRG-based geometric mean benchmarks, providing a more stable and interpretable estimate of typical LOS than the arithmetic mean in skewed distributions [^112VHAKZ] [^112znDLj] [^111cfHzi].

---

The geometric mean length of stay (GMLOS) is the **antilog of the mean of log-transformed hospital stays**, which reduces the influence of extreme outliers in right-skewed LOS data [^112VHAKZ]. It is the **preferred metric for LOS** because it better represents typical stays and supports ratio-based comparisons (e.g. 20% reduction) [^112Za4No]. GMLOS is widely used in clinical research, quality benchmarking, and hospital operations to enable fair comparisons across patient groups, interventions, or institutions [^111cfHzi] [^111EvPWt].

---

## Definition and calculation

The geometric mean is the **nth root of the product of n values**; for LOS, it is typically computed as the antilog of the mean of log-transformed stays:

- **Formula**: GMLOS = exp(mean(ln(LOS)))
- **Rationale**: Log transformation converts right-skewed LOS data toward normality, reducing outlier influence and enabling valid statistical inference [^116DPaKr].

---

## Advantages over arithmetic mean

The geometric mean offers several advantages over the arithmetic mean for LOS analysis:

- **Robustness to outliers**: Extreme stays (e.g. months-long admissions) disproportionately inflate the arithmetic mean; the geometric mean dampens this effect [^116SwCkZ].
- **Proportional interpretation**: Ratios of geometric means (e.g. 0.8) correspond to relative changes (e.g. 20% reduction), which are clinically intuitive [^1126MsNd].
- **Statistical properties**: Log-transformation improves normality, enabling parametric tests and regression models [^116DPaKr].

---

## Clinical applications

GMLOS is **routinely used** in clinical research and quality assessment:

- **Comparative effectiveness**: Trials and observational studies use GMLOS to compare interventions or patient populations [^112Za4No] [^116j8Nkf].
- **Quality benchmarking**: Hospitals track GMLOS by DRG to assess performance and identify inefficiencies [^111cfHzi] [^111EvPWt].
- **Policy evaluation**: GMLOS helps evaluate system-level changes (e.g. payment models, care pathways) [^114Wythj].

---

## Example: interpreting geometric mean length of stay

Suppose a study reports a GMLOS of 5.2 days in the intervention group versus 6.5 days in the control group. The **ratio of geometric means** is 5.2 / 6.5 = 0.80, indicating a 20% reduction in LOS with the intervention — a clinically meaningful improvement [^114Y7aCe].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While GMLOS is useful, **key limitations** should be recognized:

- **Zero values**: LOS of 0 days cannot be log-transformed; a small constant (e.g. 0.5) is often added, which may bias estimates [^114wYUx6].
- **Non-lognormal distributions**: If LOS is not log-normal, geometric mean may misrepresent central tendency; alternative models (e.g. gamma, Weibull) may be preferable [^111SJMUG].
- **Clinical context**: GMLOS should be interpreted alongside medians, quartiles, and clinical factors to avoid misleading conclusions [^111hKe9U].

## Geometric mean vs. arithmetic mean

| **Metric** | **Geometric mean** | **Arithmetic mean** |
|-|-|-|
| Robustness to outliers | High | Low |
| Interpretation | Proportional | Absolute |
| Statistical properties | Log-normal | Normal |
| Clinical use | Preferred for LOS | Less suitable for skewed LOS |

---

The geometric mean length of stay is a **statistically robust measure** that reduces outlier influence and enables proportional comparisons in right-skewed LOS data. It is widely used in clinical research, quality benchmarking, and policy evaluation, but should be interpreted with attention to distributional assumptions and clinical context [^112VHAKZ] [^112znDLj].

### Emergency department resource use by supervised residents vs attending physicians alone [^1133ZSPy]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Few studies have evaluated the common assumption that graduate medical education is associated with increased resource use.

Objective

To compare resources used in supervised vs attending-only visits in a nationally representative sample of patient visits to US emergency departments (EDs).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2010), a probability sample of US EDs and ED visits.

Exposures

Supervised visits, defined as visits involving both resident and attending physicians. Three ED teaching types were defined by the proportion of sampled visits that were supervised visits: nonteaching ED, minor teaching ED (half or fewer supervised visits), and major teaching ED (more than half supervised visits).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Association of supervised visits with hospital admission, advanced imaging (computed tomography, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging), any blood test, and ED length of stay, adjusted for visit acuity, demographic characteristics, payer type, and geographic region.

Results

Of 29,182 ED visits to the 336 nonpediatric EDs in the sample, 3374 visits were supervised visits. Compared with the 25,808 attending-only visits, supervised visits were significantly associated with more frequent hospital admission (21% vs 14%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09–1.85), advanced imaging (28% vs 21%; aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06–1.51), and a longer median ED stay (226 vs 153 minutes; adjusted geometric mean ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19–1.45), but not with blood testing (53% vs 45%; aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.96–1.46). Of visits to the sample of 121 minor teaching EDs, a weighted estimate of 9% were supervised visits, compared with 82% of visits to the 34 major teaching EDs. Supervised visits in major teaching EDs compared with attending-only visits were not associated with hospital admission (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.83–1.58), advanced imaging (aOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.96–1.53), or any blood test (aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.79–1.33), but had longer ED stays (adjusted geometric mean ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.14–1.53).

Conclusions and Relevance

In a sample of US EDs, supervised visits were associated with a greater likelihood of hospital admission and use of advanced imaging and with longer ED stays. Whether these associations are different in EDs in which more than half of visits are seen by residents requires further investigation.

### Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease in infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis [^115sNT9o]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of hospitalized infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is mainly supportive. Bronchodilators and systemic steroids are often used but do not reduce the length of hospital stay. Because hypoxia and airways obstruction develop secondary to viscous mucus in infants with RSV bronchiolitis, and because free DNA is present in RSV mucus, we tested the efficacy of the mucolytic drug recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase).

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 225 oxygen-dependent infants admitted to the hospital for RSV bronchiolitis were randomly assigned to receive 2.5 mg bid of nebulized rhDNase or placebo until discharge. The primary end point was length of hospital stay. Secondary end points were duration of supplemental oxygen, improvement in symptom score, and number of intensive care admissions.

Results

There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to the length of hospital stay (p = 0.19) or the duration of supplemental oxygen (p = 0.07). The ratio (rhDNase/placebo) of geometric means of length of stay was 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.33); for the duration of supplemental oxygen, the ratio was 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.68). There were no significant differences in the rate of improvement of the symptom score or in the number of intensive care admissions.

Conclusions

Administration of rhDNase did not reduce the length of hospital stay or the duration of supplemental oxygen in oxygen-dependent infants with RSV bronchiolitis.

Table 5
Outcomes by operative approach in minor resections

Only those patients with minor resections (N = 970) are included in the analysis. Data are reported as N (column %), with p -values from Fisher's exact tests, or as median (interquartile range), with p -values from Mann–Whitney U tests. Bold p -values are significant at p < 0.05. *Analysis of length of stay excluded those patients who died in hospital prior to discharge

Table 6
Interplay between operative approach and age/frailty in minor resections

Only those patients with minor resections (N = 970) are included in the analysis, with analysis of length of stay additionally excluding those patients who died in hospital prior to discharge. For the analysis by age, odds ratios are from binary logistic regression models within each age subgroup, with the operative approach (open vs. laparoscopic) as the independent variable. The p -values relate to the interaction terms of binary logistic regression models with age, operative approach and the age*operative approach interaction as independent variables, hence represent a comparison between the reported odds ratio for each subgroup. The analysis was repeated similarly for mFI. *Operative duration and length of stay followed skewed distributions, hence were log₁₀-transformed, and analysed using an ANOVA model, parameterised as previously described; averages are reported as geometric means (95% CI), and comparisons between groups are reported as percentage differences. Hazard ratios were not calculable, as there were no events in one of the subgroups

### Implementation of automated early warning decision support to detect acute decompensation in the emergency department improves hospital mortality [^114Wythj]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

The PHD is a national database of more than 2400 hospitals and is used as a quality benchmarking tool. Data from the PHD is used to calculate O/E values using a validated, proprietary formula which takes into account factors such as demographics, current illnesses, chronic comorbidities and laboratory values. Our O/E values were based on a comparison of the top 16th percentile of national hospital performers.

Data analyses

A series of Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U tests were used to examine differences in O/E mortality, arithmetic LOS and geometric LOS between control months and intervention months. Cohen's d was subsequently calculated for each outcome. Local Institutional Review Board approval (IRB) was obtained for this analysis; a patient consent waiver was provided by the IRB. Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research. Funding was provided by an internal Baylor College of Medicine Precision Medicine/Population Health Initiative Grant (no grant number).

### Use of weaning protocols for reducing duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill adult patients: cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CKSpT]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Weaning duration (hours)

In the random effects model for significant substantial heterogeneity (I² = 97%, P < 0.001), the pooled result for duration of weaning (six trials, n = 834)showed that weaning per protocol significantly reduced the mean log by an average of 1.52 (mean log −1.52, −2.66 to −0.37; P = 0.009), corresponding to a reduction of 78% (31% to 93%) in the geometric mean (fig 6).

Fig 6 Duration of weaning with and without weaning protocol. Mean difference calculated with fixed effects model

Length of stay in intensive care unit (hours)

Eight trials reported on length of stay in the intensive care unit (fig 7), and there was no statistical heterogeneity among studies (I² = 0%). Two trials showed a significant reduction in length of stay in the weaning protocol group, and six did not. The pooled estimate, however, was significant (mean log −0.11, −0.21 to −0.02; P = 0.02), corresponding to an average percentage difference in geometric mean of −10% (−19% to −2%).

Fig 7 Length of stay in intensive care unit with and without weaning protocol. Mean difference calculated with fixed effects model

Length of stay in hospital (days)

Weaning per protocol produced no significant reduction in mean hospital length of stay in four trials (fig 8). There was minimal heterogeneity (I² = 11%) (mean log −0.01, −0.11 to 0.1; P = 0.9, corresponding to an average percentage difference in geometric mean of −1%, −11% to 10%).

Economic costs

Three trials from the US evaluated economic costs. There were no significant differences between groups for intensive care unit costs(mean difference $3600 (£2300, €2700), −$1228 to $1948; P = 0.66) or hospital costs($−590, −$467 to $349; P = 0.78).

### What factors correlate with length of stay and readmission after limb lengthening procedures? A large-database study [^116A57zM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Indications and techniques for limb lengthening procedures have evolved over the past two decades. Although there are several case series reporting on the complications and efficacy of these techniques, limited data are available on length of stay and hospital readmission rates after these procedures.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What is the median length of stay after lower limb lengthening procedures, and is variability in patient demographics, preoperative diagnosis, and surgical technique associated with length of stay? (2) What is the 1-year readmission rate after lower limb lengthening procedures? (3) Is variability in patient demographics, preoperative diagnosis, and surgical technique associated with varying rates of hospital readmission?

Methods

Patients who underwent femoral or tibial lengthening from 2005 to 2015 in seven states were identified using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases. These databases include a large, diverse group of patients across a wide range of hospitals and socioeconomic backgrounds with inclusion of patients regardless of payer. Between 2005 and 2015, there were 3979 inpatient admissions that were identified as involving femoral and/or tibial lengthening procedures based on ICD-9 procedure codes; of those, 2% (97 of 3979) of the inpatient admissions were excluded from analysis because they had ICD-9 procedure codes for primary or revision hip or knee arthroplasty, and 10% (394 of 3979) of the inpatient admissions were excluded because they involved repeated admissions of patients with previous hospitalization data within the database. This yielded 3488 patients for analysis. The median (interquartile range) age of patients was 18 years (12 to 41), and 42% (1481 of 3488) of patients were women. A total of 49% (1705 of 3469) of patients were children (younger than 18 years), 19% (675 of 3469) were young adults (18 to 34 years), 24% (817 of 3469) were adults (35 to 59 years), and 8% (272 of 3469) were seniors (60 years and older). Length of stay and rates of readmission at 1 year after the lengthening procedure were calculated. Univariate analysis was performed to examine associations between age, race, payment method, underlying diagnosis, bone lengthened, and lengthening technique with length of stay and readmission rate. Factors found to be significantly associated with the outcome variables (p < 0.05) were further examined with a multivariate analyses.

Results

Included patients had a median (IQR) length of hospital stay of 3 days (2 to 4). Given the poor explanatory power of the multivariate model for length of stay (R² = 0.03), no meaningful correlations could be drawn between age, race, underlying diagnosis, lengthening technique, and length of stay. The overall 1-year readmission rate was 35% (1237 of 3488). There were higher readmission rates among adult patients compared with pediatric patients (odds ratio 1.78 [95% confidence interval 1.46 to 2.18]; p < 0.001), patients with government insurance compared with commercial insurance (OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.54]; p = 0.01), and patients undergoing lengthening via external fixation (OR 1.61 [95% CI 1.29 to 2.02]; p < 0.001) or hybrid fixation (OR 1.81 [95% CI 1.38 to 2.37]; p < 0.001) compared with lengthening with internal fixation only.

Conclusion

When counseling patients who may be candidates for limb lengthening, providers should inform individual patients and their caretakers on the anticipated length of hospital stay and likelihood of hospital readmission based on our findings. Adult patients, those with government insurance, and patients undergoing hybrid or external fixator limb lengthening procedures should be advised that they are at greater risk for hospital readmission. The relationship of specific patient-related factors (such as severity of deformity or associated comorbidities) and treatment-related variables (such as amount of lengthening, compliance with physical therapy, or surgeon's experience) with clinical outcomes after lower limb lengthening and the burden of care associated with hospital readmission needs further study.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, therapeutic study.

### Inpatient burden of juvenile dermatomyositis among children in the United States [^11148hLT]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Length of stay

Patients with JDM spent a weighted total of 19,159 days and 18,218 days in the hospital for their JDM or other reasons, respectively. LOS in the hospital was 39% longer for hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis (geometric mean [95% CI]: 3.75 [3.27–4.30] days) (p < 0.0001) compared with hospitalizations without a diagnosis of JDM while hospitalizations were not prolonged for a primary diagnosis (2.50 [2.27–2.76]) when compared with hospitalizations without a diagnosis of JDM (2.70 [2.66–2.75]). This pattern of prolonged LOS for hospitalizations with a secondary diagnosis of JDM was consistent across all years (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Length of stay and costs of hospitalization with primary/secondary diagnoses for juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). (a) Total and (b) geometric mean length of hospital stay and (c) total and (d) geometric mean inflation-adjusted cost of inpatient care are presented for 2002–2003, 2004–2005, 2006–2007, 2008–2009, 2010–2011 and 2012. jdm 0: no JDM. jdm 1: primary dx of JDM. jdm 2: secondary dx of JDM

In multivariate weighted linear regression models of log-transformed LOS, increased LOS in patients with a primary diagnosis of JDM was associated with race/ethnicity (beta coefficient [95% CI]) (Hispanic: 0.28 [0.14–0.41]; Other: 0.59 [0.31–0.86]), type of insurance (Medicaid: 0.16 [0.01–0.31]), multiple chronic conditions (2–5: 0.41 [0.29–0.52]; 6+: 0.94 [0.63–1.26]), micropolitan location (0.59 [0.27–0.90]), and South region (0.34 [0.12–0.56]) (Table 4). Note that since LOS was log transformed, coefficients from regression models of log-transformed LOS are not the same scale as raw LOS.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^115hjGuA]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Hospital length of stay, by discharge status. Medians (square) are presented with interquartile range (IQR). Where estimates were reported as mean and standard deviation, equivalent quantiles have been calculated assuming a Weibull distribution (triangle); if no measure of variation was reported, only the original mean is presented (circle). The grey dashed lines represent the mean value across all point estimates within that setting, weighted by sample size. The studies are ordered by the study start date, with most recent at the top. Two studies (Shi et al. (2020–02–02) and Shi et al. (2020–01–23)) have multiple estimates for the same outcome which represent multiple treatment and comorbidity subgroups, respectively. Details of these are included in Table 1

Estimates for LoS amongst patients who died in hospital were generally shorter than those for patients who were discharged alive, with medians between 4 and 21 days compared to 4 and 53 days, respectively. This difference is apparent in Fig. 2, where median LoS was lower for those discharged alive in 6 out of 8 studies that reported both outcomes. In studies that reported total hospital LoS by disease severity (11 studies, Supplementary Fig. A), there was a trend towards more severe cases having longer LoS. However, the definition of different levels of severity was inconsistent between studies so it is not possible to draw any confident conclusion.

Visual inspection of the study estimates suggested some evidence of a difference between total hospital LoS reported within and outside China, but studies outside China were too few (5/48) for a formal comparison. However, LoS reported within the ISARIC report in particular (which includes contributed data from 25 countries, but with the majority of patients from the UK) gave a median and IQR (4 days (1–9)) substantially lower than the weighted mean from the studies from China (15.3 days).

The patient populations observed in these studies covered a wide range of ages, including three paediatric studies. Amongst patients discharged alive, there appears to be little difference in average LoS between studies with the youngest and oldest patients, but the longest estimates came from studies with average age in the upper end of the range (Wang et al. and Shi et al. with average age of 68 and 69, respectively; Supplementary Fig. B). The LoS estimates which included non-survivors tended to come from studies with older populations, as is to be expected given the well-documented, age-dependent fatality rate.

### Trends in intravenous magnesium use and outcomes for status asthmaticus in children's hospitals from 2010 to 2017 [^112xNR5X]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) magnesium is used as an adjunct therapy in management of status asthmaticus with a goal of reducing intubation rate. A recent review suggests that IV magnesium use in status asthmaticus reduces admission rates. This is contrary to the observation of practicing emergency room physicians. The goal of this study was to assess trends in IV magnesium use for status asthmaticus in US children's hospitals over 8 years through a retrospective analysis of children younger than 18 years using the Pediatric Health Information System database. Outcomes were IV magnesium use, inpatient and intensive care unit admission rate, geometric mean length of stay, and 7-day all-cause readmission rate. IV magnesium use for asthma hospitalization more than doubled over 8 years (17% vs. 36%; P < .001). Yearly trends were not significantly associated with hospital or intensive care unit admission rate or 7-day all-cause readmissions, although length of stay was reduced (P < .001).

### Developing a novel artificial intelligence framework to measure the balance of clinical versus nonclinical influences on posthepatectomy length of stay [^1157usUd]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Performance metrics for predicting length of stay by surgical procedure type. Multivariable linear regression yielded R-squared (R²) values of 0.46 for minor resection and 0.43 for major resection on testing data. AI models accounting for nonlinear relationships markedly enhance R² for both minor and major resections; increase from 0.46 to 0.75 for minor resection and from 0.43 to 0.75 for major resection. The mean absolute error indicated an average unexplained length of stay of 1.15 to 1.54 days for minor resection and 1.38 to 1.86 days for major resection. Standard R² values are reported for random forest and extreme gradient boosting due to model complexity

Fig. 3
Clinical vs. nonclinical factors influence on LOS. Factors determined by R² from each model by surgical group. Random Forest maximized the clinical factor influence on LOS with an R² of 75% for both surgical cohorts, inferring a nonclinical influence of 25% by residual confounding analysis

We then calculated the mean absolute error (MAE), which represents the difference between actual and model-predicted LOS to determine the number of days that could not be explained by clinical factors alone and that are therefore due to the influence of nonclinical variables. Results from the MAE analysis showed that clinical factors could not explain 1.15 to 1.54 days of patients' LOS after minor resection, as well as 1.38 to 1.86 days after major resection. Residual plots showed the difference between model-predicted, and patients' actual LOS followed a normal distribution centered near zero, indicating that our models were unbiased, neither systematically overestimating nor underestimating LOS (Supplementary Fig. 1).

### Causal determinants of postoperative length of stay in cardiac surgery using causal graphical learning [^113caLaJ]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to learn the causal determinants of postoperative length of stay in cardiac surgery patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting or aortic valve replacement surgery.

Methods

For patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting or isolated aortic valve replacement surgeries between 2011 and 2016, we used causal graphical modeling on electronic health record data. The Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm from the Tetrad software was used on data to estimate a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) depicting direct and indirect causes of postoperative length of stay, given background clinical knowledge. Then, we used the latent variable intervention-calculus when the directed acyclic graph is absent (LV-IDA) algorithm to estimate strengths of causal effects of interest. Finally, we ran a linear regression for postoperative length of stay to contrast statistical associations with what was learned by our causal analysis.

Results

In our cohort of 2610 patients, the mean postoperative length of stay was 219 hours compared with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2016 national mean postoperative length of stay of approximately 168 hours. Most variables that clinicians believe to be predictors of postoperative length of stay were found to be causes, but some were direct (eg, age, diabetes, hematocrit, total operating time, and postoperative complications), and others were indirect (including gender, race, and operating surgeon). The strongest average causal effects on postoperative length of stay were exhibited by preoperative dialysis (209 hours); neuro-, pulmonary-, and infection-related postoperative complications (315 hours, 89 hours, and 131 hours, respectively); reintubation (61 hours); extubation in operating room (-47 hours); and total operating room duration (48 hours). Linear regression coefficients diverged from causal effects in magnitude (eg, dialysis) and direction (eg, crossclamp time).

Conclusions

By using retrospective electronic health record data and background clinical knowledge, causal graphical modeling retrieved direct and indirect causes of postoperative length of stay and their relative strengths. These insights will be useful in designing clinical protocols and targeting improvements in patient management.

### Rapid diagnostic tests and antimicrobial stewardship programs for the management of bloodstream infection: what is their relative contribution to improving clinical outcomes? A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112znDLj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction and Outcome Definitions

Once confirmed for inclusion, data were extracted from studies according to the 4 groups forming the network (RDT; RDT + ASP; BC; BC + ASP) (Figure 1). Data extracted included year of publication, the country where the study was performed, study design, patient population, type of RDT, and conventional tests used and outcomes.

Figure 1.
Network plot reporting the number of studies assessing each of the comparisons included in the NMA. It was expected that a paucity of studies would be found comparing BC + ASP to RDT alone as in the common context of a pre/postinterventional study, the implementation of RDT in a setting already using ASP with conventional BC would unlikely involve ceasing the use of ASP. Abbreviations: ASP, antimicrobial stewardship program; BC, blood culture; NMA, network meta-analysis; RDT, rapid diagnostic test.

TOT was defined as the time from either blood specimen collection or from positive Gram stain/BC positivity (in the case of studies evaluating RDT applied on positive BC broth) to initiation of the antimicrobial treatment targeted on the final isolate. LOS was defined as total hospital LOS or post-BSI LOS. For TOT, when means and standard deviation (SDs) were not available, but the quartiles were available, we estimated the mean by (q₁ + median + q₃)/3, and the SD by (q₃ − q₁)/1.35. For LOS, medians were used as an estimate of the geometric mean, and geometric SDs were estimated by GSD = exp[(ln(q₃) − ln(q₁))/1.35]. Otherwise, calculations assumed a lognormal distribution to convert arithmetic means and SDs to geometric means and GSDs. If different summary statistics were reported (eg, median 95% confidence interval [CI]) authors were contacted for further information. If available, infection related-mortality was extracted; otherwise, 30-day and in-hospital mortality were chosen next, respectively. If available, post-BSI LOS was extracted; otherwise, total LOS was used.

Quality Assessment

The latest Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in RCTs. The Risk of Bias in non-Randomized Studies of Interventions was used for quasi-experimental studies.

### The impact of hydroxyethyl starches in cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis [^1133wYkT]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Length of stay in ICU and hospital

Compared to albumin, there was a trend towards longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay for tetrastarches which was not statistically significant (ICU: SMD, 0.39; 95% CI, −0.04, 0.82; P = 0.08; hospital: SMD, 1.28; 95% CI −0.20, 2.76; P = 0.09). In contrast, tetrastarch seemed to have been associated with shorter ICU length of stay and similar hospital length of stay compared to gelatin (ICU: SMD, −0.10; 95% CI, −0.15, −0.05; P = 0.0002; hospital: SMD, −0.15; 95% CI, −0.87, 0.52; P = 0.69). Compared to crystalloids tetrastarches were associated with significantly shorter lengths of stay in the ICU (SMD, −0.06; 95% CI, −0.12, 0.00; P = 0.06) and in the hospital (SMD, −0.52; 95% CI, −0.90, −0.14; P = 0.007) (Figure 5). However, again, no definite conclusion is possible because of the low number of studies.

The standardised mean difference (Std. mean difference) of the mean for the hydroxyethyl starch groups minus the mean for the albumin (A), gelatin (B) and crystalloid (C) groups was used as effect size. A fixed-effects model was applied to calculate a common effect estimate using the inverse-variance method (IV). ICU, Intensive care unit; SD, Standard deviation; CI confidence interval.

Similarly, for penta- and hetastarches, the number of included studies is too low to allow definitive conclusions. These comparisons can be found in Additional files 5 and 6.

### The effect of high-flow nasal oxygen on hospital length of stay in cardiac surgical patients at high risk for respiratory complications: a randomised controlled trial [^115VNUJC]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

There has been increased interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic use of high-flow nasal oxygen in patients with, or at risk of, non-hypercapnic respiratory failure. There are no randomised trials examining the efficacy of high-flow nasal oxygen in high-risk cardiac surgical patients. We sought to determine whether routine administration of high-flow nasal oxygen, compared with standard oxygen therapy, leads to reduced hospital length of stay after cardiac surgery in patients with pre-existing respiratory disease at high risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. Adult patients with pre-existing respiratory disease undergoing elective cardiac surgery were randomly allocated to receive high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 51) or standard oxygen therapy (n = 49). The primary outcome was hospital length of stay and all analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Median (IQR [range]) hospital length of stay was 7 (6–9 [4–30]) days in the high-flow nasal oxygen group and 9 (7–16 [4–120]) days in the standard oxygen group (p = 0.012). Geometric mean hospital length of stay was 29% lower in the high-flow nasal group (95%CI 11–44%, p = 0.004). High-flow nasal oxygen was also associated with fewer intensive care unit re-admissions (1/49 vs. 7/45; p = 0.026). When compared with standard care, prophylactic postoperative high-flow nasal oxygen reduced hospital length of stay and intensive care unit re-admission. This is the first randomised controlled trial examining the effect of prophylactic high-flow nasal oxygen use on patient-centred outcomes in cardiac surgical patients at high risk for postoperative respiratory complications.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^112Tdg4V]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings provide both better estimates of the LoS distribution for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and a method for generating these important distributions going forward. Combined with predictions of disease incidence, models forecasting bed occupancy are used to plan required hospital capacity and hence are critical for outbreak preparations. The LoS estimate is a critical parameter within such a model, and as such, any predictions are sensitive to the value or distribution being assumed, with strong implications for policy and planning. In particular, the tail of the LoS distribution must not be ignored since these few patients can block beds for a long time and form a heavy burden on capacity. Our estimates, and the proposed method for distribution collation, allow for improved predictions of this aspect of burden prediction and hence could reduce uncertainty in capacity preparedness in healthcare settings going forward. This is of value to countries still experiencing growing epidemics and those turning attention to the planning for the possibility of a second wave whilst restarting non-COVID care.

It is preferable to use data from the setting for which you are trying to forecast bed occupancy (as was done by the IHME COVID-19 health service utilisation forecasting team); however, data on completed patient stays will often not be available until well after the onset of the epidemic. Furthermore, LMICs may have reduced capacity for surveillance and monitoring in order to obtain these data. In such cases, where countries are in the early stages of an outbreak, it would be better to use a conservative (i.e. broad) distribution of LoS from another setting. As the pandemic progresses and more countries observe patients completing their hospital episodes, it will be possible to add further setting-specific summaries and improve this distribution.

As far as the authors are aware, the approach demonstrated here to summarise median and IQRs across multiple studies has not been proposed before, although there are similarities with the approach taken by others in the CMMID Working Group to pool R₀ estimates. We present an intuitive method which exploits two optimisation methods to fit parametric distributions based on reported summary statistics rather than individual data, then samples across them. In this way, we capture the central tendency and overall variation between a set of quantiles from different study populations. This allows multiple sources of evidence to be consolidated into a single distribution which can be used in bed forecasting going forward. By providing both the code for this analysis and our summary distributions, better bed occupancy predictions can be made in the future.

### Automated versus non-automated weaning for reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation for critically ill adults and children: a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jx42z]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Duration of hospital and ICU stay

Pooled data from seven trials reporting hospital LOS found no evidence of effect comparing automated systems and non-automated weaning (mean log days −0.10, −0.21 to 0.02, P = 0.10; 6% (2% increase to 19% reduction) reduction in geometric mean) with no heterogeneity (I² = 0%, P = 0.52) (Figure 7). Pooled data from 13 trials reporting ICU LOS demonstrated a reduction favouring automated systems (mean log days −0.08, −0.16 to 0.00, P = 0.05; 8% (0% to 15%) reduction in geometric mean) with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 49%, P = 0.02). Pooled data from studies conducted in mixed/medical ICU populations demonstrated reduced ICU stay (mean log days −0.18, −0.32 to −0.04, P = 0.01; 15% (4% to 25%) reduction in geometric mean) but trials in surgical ICU populations did not (mean log days 0.02, − 0.02 to 0.06, P = 0.29; 2% (2% reduction to 6% increase) increase in geometric mean) (Figure 8). Pooled data from Smartcare/PS™ trials identified reduced ICU stay (mean log days −0.26, −0.43 to −0.09, P = 0.003; 23% (9% to 35%) reduction in geometric mean) whereas ASV trials did not (mean log days 0.02, −0.02 to 0.06, P = 0.39; 2% (2% reduction to 6% increase) increase in the geometric mean).

### Variation in length of stay and outcomes among hospitalized patients attributable to hospitals and hospitalists [^111cfHzi]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Outcomes

Hospital length of stay was obtained from MedPAR files. For each admission, we calculated a difference in length of stay by subtracting the geometric mean length of stay for that DRG obtained from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services from the actual length of stay. This measure intrinsically controls for case mix among hospitalists, because geometric mean length of stay differs for each DRG. We excluded outliers more than three standard deviations from the norm in order to approximate the normal distribution and analyze with a hierarchical general linear model, leaving 129,491 admissions, and 1,099 hospitalists.

Mortality within 30 days of admission was calculated from date of death in the Medicare beneficiary summary file. These analyses included all 131,710 admissions and 1,099 hospitalists in the cohort. We chose mortality within 30 days of admission rather than from discharge to avoid biases in different hospital length of stay among hospitalists. However, our analyses of 30-day post discharge mortality produced almost identical results.

We calculated the rate of admissions discharged home and the rate discharged to a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), obtained from MedPAR files. We excluded those who were discharged dead, transferred to another acute care hospital or had stayed in a nursing facility any time in the three months prior to the admission of interest, leaving 99,522 admissions and 990 hospitalists.

ER visits were identified by CPT E&M codes 99281–99285 and 99288 from Carrier files. To study readmissions and ER visits within 30 days of discharge, we excluded those who were discharged dead or transferred to another acute care hospital, or died in the 30 days post discharge without an event (readmission or ER visit), leaving 108,547 admissions and 1,019 hospitalists in the study cohort for 30-day readmission, and 108,226 admissions and 1,018 hospitalists for 30-day ER visits. Readmissions and ER visits were not mutually exclusive; i.e. most readmissions also had an ER visit.

### Effects of volatile anesthetic choice on hospital length-of-stay: a retrospective study and a prospective trial [^115pxgwQ]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Volatile anesthetic prices differ substantially. But differences in drug-acquisition cost would be inconsequential if hospitalization were prolonged by more soluble anesthetics. The authors tested the hypothesis that the duration of hospitalization is prolonged with isoflurane anesthesia.

Methods

Initially, the authors queried their electronic records and used propensity matching to generate homogeneous sets of adults having inpatient noncardiac surgery who were given desflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane. The authors then conducted a prospective alternating intervention trial in which adults (mostly having colorectal surgery) were assigned to isoflurane or sevoflurane, based on protocol.

Results

In the retrospective analysis, 2,898 matched triplets were identified among 43,352 adults, each containing one patient receiving isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane, respectively. The adjusted geometric mean (95% CI) hospital length-of-stay for the isoflurane cases was 2.85 days (2.78–2.93); this was longer than that observed for both desflurane (2.64 [2.57–2.72]; P < 0.001) and sevoflurane (2.55 [2.48–2.62]; P < 0.001). In the prospective trial (N = 1,584 operations), no difference was found; the adjusted ratio of means (95% CI) of hospital length-of-stay in patients receiving isoflurane versus sevoflurane was 0.98 (0.88–1.10), P = 0.77, with adjusted geometric means (95% CI) estimated at 4.1 (3.8–4.4) and 4.2 days (3.8–4.5), respectively.

Conclusions

Results of the propensity-matched retrospective analysis suggested that avoiding isoflurane significantly reduced the duration of hospitalization. In contrast, length-of-stay was comparable in our prospective trial. Volatile anesthetic choice should not be based on concerns about the duration of hospitalization. These studies illustrate the importance of following even the best retrospective analysis with a prospective trial.

### Length of stay and trauma center finances: a disparity of payer source at a level I trauma center [^111EvPWt]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In an effort to reduce costs, hospitals focus efforts on reducing length of stay (LOS) and often benchmark LOS against the geometric LOS (GMLOS) as predicted by the assigned diagnosis-related group (DRG) used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the impact of exceeding GMLOS on hospital profit/loss with respect to payer source.

Methods

Contribution margin for each insured patient admitted to a Level I trauma center between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019, was determined. Age, ethnicity, race, DRG weight, DRG version, injury severity, intensive care unit admission status, mechanical ventilation, payer, exceeding GMLOS, and the interaction between payer and exceeding the GMLOS were regressed on contribution margin to determine significant predictors of positive contribution margin.

Results

Among 2,449 insured trauma patients, the distribution of payers was Medicaid (54.6%), Medicare (24.0%), and commercial (21.4%). Thirty-five percent (n = 867) of patient LOS exceeded GMLOS. Exceeding GMLOS by 10 or more days was significantly more likely for Medicaid and Medicare patients in stepwise fashion (commercial, 2.7%; Medicaid, 4.5%; Medicare, 6.0%; p = 0.030). Median contribution margin was positive for commercially insured patients ($16,913) and negative for Medicaid (-$8,979) and Medicare (-$2,145) patients. Adjusted multivariate modeling demonstrated that when exceeding GMLOS, Medicare and Medicaid cases were less likely than commercial payers to have a positive contribution margin (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Government-insured patients, despite having a payer source, are a financial burden to a trauma center. Excess LOS among government insured patients, but not the commercially insured, exacerbates financial loss. A shift toward a greater proportion of government insured patients may result in a significant fiscal liability for a trauma center.

### Age-and sex-specific associations of frailty with mortality and healthcare utilization in community-dwelling adults from ontario, Canada [^112VHAKZ]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Participant characteristics were summarized as the mean and standard deviation and/or median and quantiles for continuous data and count and frequency for categorical data. Mortality and hospital admissions were summarized as the mean cumulative incidence and the total number observed, and length of stay as the mean and standard deviation of the within patient length of stay geometric mean; the geometric mean was used given that length of stay data is commonly right-skewed. The mean cumulative incidence of admissions was calculated using the R package 'reda'. This package facilitates the exploration and modeling of recurrent event data by employing the mean cumulative function. Face validity of the frailty index was assessed by comparing distribution characteristics (e.g. mean, variance, range) to that obtained for similar cohorts and by estimating associations to participant sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics that have been previously shown to correlate with frailty. This was done by way of a generalized linear model and expressed as the crude or adjusted coefficient and 95% confidence interval (CI); all participant characteristics were included in the adjusted model given our previous work showing that they are associated with frailty and other studies indicating their importance to health outcomes. Associations of the frailty index with mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models and presented as crude and adjusted hazards ratios (HR) and 95% CI. Associations with the total number of hospital admissions observed were estimated using Poisson regression and included a logged offset to account for differences in follow-up period; these were presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CI. For the length of stay of inpatient admissions, associations were estimated using generalized estimating equation-based negative binomial models with an exchangeable correlation structure and clustered according to participant. Performed using the R package "geeM", this was only conducted for those with inpatient records, and was presented as the IRR and 95% CI. For all outcome models, crude and adjusted estimates were calculated in the entire sample and within age- and sex-specific strata relative to a 0.1-increase in the frailty index. Covariates in adjusted models were determined empirically as those that improve the model fit (i.e. adjusted R-squared) in the entire sample when included alongside the frailty index.

All analyses were performed in R v4.2.2.

### Length of hospital and intensive care unit stay in patients with invasive candidiasis and / or candidemia treated with rezafungin: a pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^1126MsNd]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

a Generalised linear model, unadjusted or adjusted for mechanical ventilation status; c (C-R)/(C/R), where C is caspofungin and R is rezafungin. The data were log-transformed because of skewing. The estimate is the ratio of geometric means, with values > 1 indicating more time in the ICU in the caspofungin arm

Table 4
Length of ICU stay in pooled analysis in survivors (patients discharged from ICU, mITT population)

SD, standard deviation

Similarly, in the population of all patients with an ICU stay (Table 3), patients in the rezafungin group spent less time in the ICU, with a difference in mean ICU stay of 5.5 days. Adjustment for mechanical ventilation status resulted in an increase of 1.2 days in the mean ICU LoS in the rezafungin group, whereas ICU LoS with caspofungin was changed very little. After adjustment for mechanical ventilation status, the difference in ICU LoS was 4.1 days, a relative difference of 24% (95% CI -11%, 72%). The difference remained present in sensitivity analysis run in patients with infections caused by albicans vs. non-albicans species (respectively, 5.2 days and 4.8 days difference of in favour of rezafungin when adjusted for mechanical ventilation). Reported differences were Total length of hospital stay.

Patients treated with rezafungin had a numerically shorter LoS than the caspofungin group in both survivor and all-patient analyses, with and without adjustment for mechanical ventilation (Table 5). The difference in mean total LoS between treatments was similar in the all-patients and survivor-only populations, at 3.1 and 3.0 days, respectively. In the all-patients population, patients treated with rezafungin spent a mean of 25.2 days in the hospital, compared with 28.3 days in patients treated with caspofungin. After adjusting for mechanical ventilation status, mean LoS was 25.9 and 28.8 days in the rezafungin and caspofungin groups, respectively. This equates to a relative difference of 12% (95% CI -6%, 33%) in favour of rezafungin-treated patients having the shorter stay.

### Outcomes for very preterm infants across health systems [^116viaD7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

A 3-level hierarchical logistic model was estimated for mortality at the infant, hospital, and health system level, controlling for infant covariates. For length of stay among surviving infants, a 3-level hierarchical linear model of log length of stay was estimated, controlling for infant covariates. For systems with only 1 VON member hospital, the hospital effect was defined as 0.

Using variance estimates from the models, we calculated the variance partition coefficient (VPC) at each level for each outcome by dividing the estimated level-specific variance by the sum of variance at all 3 levels. The system-level effects in the models represented the correlation in outcomes between hospitals within a system. The system-level VPC measured the correlation between infants at different hospitals within the same system. Adding the hospital and system level VPCs yielded a measure of the correlation between 2 infants at the same hospital (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1). For the logistic regression model for mortality, infant-level variance was defined using the latent variable approach. We calculated system-level standardized mortality ratios from the hierarchical modeland multiplied the standardized mortality ratios by the overall mortality rate to estimate risk-adjusted mortality for each system. Similarly, for length of stay, we calculated a system-level ratio of observed to expected length of stay and multiplied these system-level ratios by the overall geometric mean length of stay to estimate risk-adjusted length of stay for each system. We divided systems into quartiles of performance for each outcome and estimated the mean risk-adjusted outcome for each quartile by taking an average of the system-level risk-adjusted outcomes, weighted by infant volume, across systems in each quartile. We used bayesian methods to calculate 95% credible intervals (CrIs).

As a sensitivity analysis, we restricted the sample to a subset of systems in which VON member hospitals comprised 80% of level 3 and level 4 NICU beds (196 systems with 550 hospitals) to ensure that the majority of very preterm infants in the system were in the VON database. All statistical analyses were performed using R, version 4.4.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### Mathematical modelling and simulation for planning critical care capacity [^116hK4vR]. Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Using average number of patients expected in a year, average length of stay and a target occupancy level to calculate the number of critical care beds needed is mathematically incorrect because of nonlinearity and variability in the factors that control length of stay. For a target occupancy in excess of 80%, this simple calculation will typically underestimate the number of beds required. More seriously, it provides no quantitative guidance information about other aspects of critical care demand such as the numbers of emergency patients transferred, deferral rates for elective patients and overall utilisation. The combination of appropriately analysing raw data and detailed mathematical modelling provides a much better method for estimating numbers of beds required. We describe this modelling approach together with evidence of its performance.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^112Asd4n]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We performed a systematic review to identify the current evidence on LoS for COVID-19 patients worldwide. We also present a method for generating LoS summary distributions by combining information from different summary statistics (mean and medians) reported in multiple studies, and accounting for differences in sample sizes. This aims to include all the variation between studies, to obtain a distribution that covers all plausible LoSs. Although similar in the sense of synthesising multiple sources, this is unlike a classic meta-analysis which aims to get a more precise estimate of a quantity assumed as being a fixed point value. In doing this work, we aim to inform the efforts of modellers and policy makers to better anticipate healthcare needs during the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.

### Length of stay in EDs: variation across classifications of clinical condition and patient discharge disposition [^111hKe9U]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Duration of a stay in an emergency department (ED) is considered a measure of quality, but current measures average lengths of stay across all conditions. Previous research on ED length of stay has been limited to a single condition or a few hospitals. We use a census of one state's data to measure length of ED stays by patients' conditions and dispositions and explore differences between means and medians as quality metrics.

Methods

The data source was the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2011 State Emergency Department Databases and State Inpatient Databases for Florida. Florida is unique in collecting ED length of stay for both released and admitted patients. Clinical Classifications Software was used to group visits based on first-listed International Classification of Disease, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification, diagnoses.

Results

For the 10 most common diagnoses, patients with relatively minor injuries typically required the shortest mean stay (3 hours or less); conditions resulting in admission or transfer tended to be more serious, resulting in longer stays. Patients requiring the longest stays, by disposition, had discharge diagnoses of nonspecific chest pain (mean 7.4 hours among discharged patients), urinary tract infections (4.8 hours among admissions), and schizophrenia (9.6 hours among transfers) among the top 10 diagnoses.

Conclusion

Emergency department length of stay as a measure of ED quality should take into account the considerable variation by condition and disposition of the patient. Emergency department length of stay measurement could be improved in the United States by standardizing its definition; distinguishing visits involving treatment, observation, and boarding; and incorporating more distributional information.

### Effects of seasonal and climate variations on in-hospital mortality and length of stay in patients with type A aortic dissection [^116DPaKr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgical procedure for AAD

The surgical procedure for AAD included the implantation of a modified triple-branched stent graft for the replacement of the descending aorta combined with aortic root reconstruction as described previously and illustrated in Fig. 1 (A-G).

Statistical analysis

Analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 software. Demographics of patients were described as percentages and means with standard deviations. A cross-sectional analysis was performed on variables associated with in-hospital mortality and LOS. The chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables, while the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for two or more grouped variables. To explore the association of continuous variables with in-hospital mortality and LOS, the Tukey's post hoc range test was used to compare the means of each group to arrive at a significant ANOVA. Non-normally distributed variables were analyzed with non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis H test). Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationship of seasonal and climatic variations with in-hospital mortality and demographic covariates of patients. A further multiple regression analysis was performed by using the same covariates that were used in the above multiple logistic regression analysis to explore the predictors of LOS in postoperative survivors. Data on LOS appeared positively skewed and kurtotic. Hence, logarithmic transformation of LOS data was performed to correct the non-normality, and the power was returned to the geometric mean with an appropriately reported 95% confidence interval (95% CI). A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Relative efficacy of prehabilitation interventions and their components: systematic review with network and component network meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^112Za4No]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sensitivity analyses using the ratio of geometric means effect measure resulted in only minor changes in clinical interpretations relative to the primary analysis (appendix 16). Other sensitivity analyses excluding outlier studies in the loop did not reduce heterogeneity. Meta-regression on surgery type did not significantly improve model fit, while meta-regression on the mean length of stay of the control group did significantly improve model fit (appendix 16). Adjustment mean length of stay of the for control group also strengthened effect estimates for all treatments compared with usual care (appendix 16). The effects of exercise, nutrition, plus psychosocial and exercise plus nutrition reached statistical significance; the effect of cognitive prehabilitation reversed direction to become beneficial; and treatment rankings shifted so that usual care became the lowest ranked treatment.

For the component network meta-analysis model, statistical evidence suggested that the additivity assumption did not hold (appendix 16). A model containing a two way interaction term between exercise and nutrition and a three way interaction term between exercise, nutrition, and psychosocial components improved model fit. Findings from the interaction model suggested that exercise and nutrition components significantly reduced length of stay (exercise: mean difference –0.96 days (95% CI –1.30 to –0.61); nutrition: –0.99 days (–1.49 to –0.48)). However, the interaction terms suggested that the incremental effects of the exercise and nutrition components were reduced in the other's presence (ie, the reduction in length of stay was not as large as their sum), and inclusion of a psychosocial component further reduced the expected effect of the intervention. The effects of psychosocial and cognitive components were imprecise (appendix 16). Heterogeneity was unchanged from the treatment level network meta-analysis (I² = 83.2%; τ² = 1.07).

Association ofon LOS, LOS, and Total Adjusted Cost of Hospitalization

Propensity scores were calculated for prespecified confounders and inverse probability weighting was carried out. There was no residual imbalance of confounders between the 2 cohorts after inverse probability weighting (Table 2). After adjustment, subjects in the DAS cohort had shorter ICU LOS (ratio of geometric means, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61–0.97]) and total hospital LOS (ratio of geometric mean, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.63–0.91]) than their counterparts in the BTTS cohort (Table 3). Estimated ICU stay for the DAS cohort was 18.8 days, and for the BTTS cohort it was 24.3 days. Estimated total hospital stay for the DAS cohort was 30.7 days, and for the BTTS cohort it was 40.4 days. The total estimated adjusted cost of hospitalization for the DAS cohort was less than for the BTTS cohort (ratio of geometric mean, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.56–0.87]). Estimated total adjusted cost of hospitalization was $192 642.23 for the DAS cohort and $276 042.47 for the BTTS cohort (Table 3).

### Contemporary trends and outcomes of percutaneous and surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with cancer [^114wYUx6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

NIS provided data on specific outcomes of interest, including hospitalization charges, length of stay, in‐hospital mortality, and discharge disposition, by cancer status. The actual cost of hospitalization was obtained by multiplying each hospital's charges with its cost/charge ratios 21 and wage index for a given year. The wage index helps correct for geographic variations in costs among hospitals. 21 Charges and costs were inflation adjusted to 2015. 22

Statistical Analysis

Survey‐specific statements (SURVEYMEANS and SURVEYFREQ) with hospital‐ and patient‐level weights were used to obtain national estimates. The Rao‐Scott χ² test was used to compare categorical variables, and a survey‐specific t test (SURVEYREG) was used for continuous variables. We used the Cochrane Armitage test of trend for categorical variables and survey‐specific linear regression for continuous variables. Hospital charges and length of stay were log transformed because they were not normally distributed, and the geometric mean was presented. 23, 24 For a length of stay of 0 days, a value of 0.0001 was imputed to avoid negative log values. Relative use rate was calculated by dividing the number of TAVRs estimated by total estimated AVR for cancer and noncancer, and the proportions were compared using Rao‐Scott χ² test.

Associations between age/mFI and the primary outcomes. Points represent the observed mortality/complication rates, or the geometric mean lengths of stay, with whiskers representing 95% confidence intervals. For age, each point corresponds to a quintile of the age distribution, and is plotted at the mean of the interval, whilst points for mFI correspond to values of 0, 1 and 2; mFI = 3 was not plotted, due to the small sample size (N = 5). Trend lines are from univariable binary logistic regression models for the dichotomous outcomes, with a univariable log-linear regression model used for length of stay, as per Table 4

Table 4
Associations between age/frailty and primary outcomes

Analyses of 90-day mortality and complications were performed using binary logistic regression models, with coefficients representing odds ratios. Analysis of length of stay was performed using general linear models, with the log₁₀(length of stay) as the dependent variable; coefficients represent percentage differences. For all outcomes, age and mFI were initially treated as continuous covariates in separate univariable models, with coefficients representing the change in the outcome per decade or per point, respectively. Multivariable models were then produced, which considered gender, BMI, ASA grade, indication for surgery, extent of resection, operative approach and duration of surgery for inclusion, with a backwards stepwise approach to variable selection. The full models are reported in Supplementary Table 1–3. Bold p -values are significant at p < 0.05. CI confidence interval; mFI modified frailty index; OR odds ratio

### The effect of high-flow nasal oxygen on hospital length of stay in cardiac surgical patients at high risk for respiratory complications: a randomised controlled trial [^116PP4KH]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

There has been increased interest in the prophylactic and therapeutic use of high‐flow nasal oxygen in patients with, or at risk of, non‐hypercapnic respiratory failure. There are no randomised trials examining the efficacy of high‐flow nasal oxygen in high‐risk cardiac surgical patients. We sought to determine whether routine administration of high‐flow nasal oxygen, compared with standard oxygen therapy, leads to reduced hospital length of stay after cardiac surgery in patients with pre‐existing respiratory disease at high risk for postoperative pulmonary complications. Adult patients with pre‐existing respiratory disease undergoing elective cardiac surgery were randomly allocated to receive high‐flow nasal oxygen (n = 51) or standard oxygen therapy (n = 49). The primary outcome was hospital length of stay and all analyses were carried out on an intention‐to‐treat basis. Median ([range]) hospital length of stay was 7 (6–9 [4–30]) days in the high‐flow nasal oxygen group and 9 (7–16 [4–120]) days in the standard oxygen group (p = 0.012). Geometric mean hospital length of stay was 29% lower in the high‐flow nasal group (95%CI 11–44%, p = 0.004). High‐flow nasal oxygen was also associated with fewer intensive care unit re‐admissions (1/49 vs. 7/45; p = 0.026). When compared with standard care, prophylactic postoperative high‐flow nasal oxygen reduced hospital length of stay and intensive care unit re‐admission. This is the first randomised controlled trial examining the effect of prophylactic high‐flow nasal oxygen use on patient‐centred outcomes in cardiac surgical patients at high risk for postoperative respiratory complications.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^1137qCj1]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of findings

Understanding how long patients hospitalised with COVID-19 remain in hospital is critical for planning and predicting bed occupancy as well as associated staff and equipment needs. This review found that hospital LoS observations for COVID-19 patients published in the literature to date varied from less than a week to nearly 2 months. Stay in intensive care was shorter and less variable, with studies reporting medians of 1 to 3 weeks. Where LoS was reported according to discharge status, stay was found to be shorter for those who died than for those discharged alive; however, this difference was only apparent in terms of total stay and not stay in ICU (no statistical comparison was made). With respect to practical implications, knowledge of a difference between survivors and non-survivors is of less use since the outcome will not be known in advance in order to influence decision-making. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first formal review that has been conducted on hospital LoS for COVID-19.

The included studies yield some evidence of a difference between total hospital LoS observed in China and outside of China, with shorter LoS reported in the latter group (14 days (10–19) vs 5 days (3–9), respectively). However, only five studies were identified which reported LoS outside of China; therefore, this comparison is somewhat inconclusive. It may be that LoS is longer in China compared with other settings due to different criteria for hospital admission and discharge. A consensus exists across guidelines, such as ensuring resolution of symptoms and evidence of two negative PCR samples at least 24 h apart before discharge; however, differences between settings may arise as a result of local capacity and strain on the health system. We attempted to capture this difference by recording time from onset of symptoms to admission; however, only one study outside of China reported this and a comparison was not possible. It is also possible that, with foresight from witnessing the Chinese epidemic, other countries set less strict criteria for discharge, in anticipation of stretched capacity. Other countries may also have used evidence from China to improve treatment methods and hence shorten LoS. However, this unfortunately appears unlikely as we did not observe a trend when looking at the reported LoS estimates over time.

### Goal-directed haemodynamic therapy during general anaesthesia for noncardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111wCyPe]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Hospital length of stay, primary result

Sixty-five (86%) of the included trials reported hospital length of stay, of which 40 had their medians and measures of variance converted to means and standard deviations. The definitions of hospital length of stay were homogeneous, and the meta-analysis thus included all 65 trials. GDHT resulted in overall shorter hospital length of stay (mean difference = –0.72 days; 95% CI, –1.10 to –0.35; eFig. 6). Results were similar when excluding trials with high risk of bias and when excluding trials with hospital length of stay > 20 days in the control group (eTable 6; eFigs 7 and 8).

Disease-related malnutrition — hospital length of stay is increased in malnourished inpatients. In hospitalized patients, the length of hospital stay for severely malnourished patients was significantly greater (10.8 ± 26.3 days) than the length of stay for moderately malnourished patients (5.4 ± 8.2 days) or well-nourished patients (3.9 ± 7.8 days). In a study of 709 patients from 25 hospitals, the median length of stay for malnourished patients (9 days) was longer than the median length of stay for well-nourished patients (6 days).

### Association of psychiatric diagnoses and medicaid coverage with length of stay among inpatients discharged to skilled nursing facilities [^116bMejV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inpatients with psychiatric diagnoses often require higher levels of care in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and are more likely to be covered by Medicaid, which reimburses SNFs at significantly lower rates than Medicare and commercial payors.

Objective

To characterize factors affecting length of stay in inpatients discharged to SNFs.

Design

A retrospective cross-sectional study design using 2016–2018 data from National Inpatient Sample.

Participants

Inpatients aged ≥ 40 who were discharged to SNFs.

Exposures

Primary discharge diagnosis (medical, psychiatric, or substance use) and primary payor.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Length of stay, categorized non-exclusively as > 3 days, > 7 days, or > 14 days.

Results

Among 9,821,155 inpatient discharges to SNFs between 2016 and 2018, 95.7% had medical primary discharge diagnoses, 3.3% psychiatric diagnoses, and 1.0% substance use diagnoses; Medicare was the most common primary payor (83.3%), followed by private insurance (7.9%), Medicaid (6.6%), and others (2.2%). Median length of stay for all patients was 5.0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3.0–8.0), 5.0 (IQR, 3.0–8.0) for those with medical diagnoses, 8.0 (IQR, 4.0–15.0) for psychiatric diagnoses, and 5.0 (IQR, 3.0–8.0) for substance use diagnoses. After multivariable adjustment, compared to patients with medical diagnoses, patients with psychiatric diagnoses were more likely to have hospital stays > 3, > 7, and > 14 days, respectively (p < 0.001). Compared to Medicare patients, Medicaid patients were more likely to have hospital stays > 3, > 7, and > 14 days, respectively (p < 0.001). Compared to patients with medical diagnoses, those with psychiatric diagnoses were also more likely to have lengths of stay 1 times, 1.5 times, and 2 times greater than the national geometric mean length of stay for that diagnosis-related group (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Patients discharged to SNFs after inpatient hospitalization for psychiatric diagnoses and with Medicaid coverage were more likely to have longer lengths of stay than patients with medical diagnoses and those with Medicare coverage, respectively.

### Optimal energy delivery and measured energy expenditure-impact of length of stay [^113BRzgZ]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Example of calories administered to a patient. The daily mean (DM) of calories is 74% if the patient leaves the ICU at day 5 but 88% if the patient leaves at day 11. The only way to make the mean unaffected by the length of stay is to calculate the mean only once the delivered calories have reached a plateau

Our suggestion would be to redo the outcome analysis while including only in their regression the "mean kcal value of stay" of the stable feeding days, and not feed progression days. Possibly the results would show the lowest mortality somewhere between 95 and 105% of measured EE.

### Hand-carried echocardiography by hospitalists: a randomized trial [^111rcoDf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalists can use hand-carried echocardiography for accurate point-of-care information, but patient outcome data for its application are sparse.

Methods

We performed an unblinded, parallel-group randomized trial between July 2008 and March 2009 at one teaching hospital in Chicago, Illinois. We randomly assigned adult general medicine inpatients referred for standard echocardiography with indications investigatable by hand-carried echocardiography to care guided by hand-carried echocardiography or usual care. The main outcome measure was length of stay on the referring hospitalist's service. Secondary outcomes included a before-after analysis of reported changes in management due to hand-carried echocardiography and the diagnostic accuracy of hand-carried echocardiography.

Results

The difference in length of stay between 226 participants randomized to care guided by hand-carried echocardiography (geometric mean 46.1 hours, interquartile range 29.0–70.9 hours) and 227 participants randomized to usual care (46.9 hours, interquartile range 34.1–68.3 hours) corresponded to a 1.7% reduction in length of stay that was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, -12.1 to 9.8%). In post hoc subgroup analyses, care guided by hand-carried echocardiography reduced length of stay in participants who were referred for heart failure (P = 0.0008). Among participants who underwent both hand-carried and standard echocardiography, hospitalists changed management due to hand-carried echocardiography in 37%. Despite the favorable diagnostic accuracy of hand-carried echocardiography, most changes to the timing of hospital discharge occurred after standard echocardiography.

Conclusion

Hospitalist care guided by hand-carried echocardiography for unselected general medicine patients does not meaningfully affect length of stay. Whether or not it affects care quality remains unstudied.

### Impact of surgeon and hospital volume on short-term outcomes and cost of laryngeal cancer surgical care [^113aNMpD]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of surgeon and hospital case volume and other related variables on short-term outcomes after surgery for laryngeal cancer.

Methods

The Maryland Health Service Cost Review Commission database was queried for laryngeal cancer surgical case volumes from 1990 to 2009. Multivariate logistic regression analyses and multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate for significant associations between surgeon and hospital case volume, as well as other independent variables and the risk of in-hospital death, postoperative wound complications, length of hospital stay, and hospital-related cost of care.

Results

Overall, 1,981 laryngeal cancer surgeries were performed with complete financial data available for 1,885 laryngeal cancer surgeries, performed by 284 surgeons at 37 hospitals. The only independently significant factor associated with the risk of in-hospital death was an APR-DRG mortality risk score of 4 (odds ratio [OR] = 10.7, P < .001). Postoperative wound fistula or dehiscence was associated with an increased mortality risk score (OR = 3.1, P < .001), total laryngectomy (OR = 12.4, P = 0.013), and flap reconstruction (OR = 3.8, P = 0.001). Increased mortality risk score, partial or total laryngectomy, flap reconstruction, and Black race were associated with an increased length of stay and hospital-related costs. After controlling for all other variables, a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between surgery at a high-volume hospital and both length of hospital stay (geometric mean = -1.5 days, P = 0.003). and hospital-related costs (geometric mean = -$6,061, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

After controlling for other factors, high-volume hospital care is associated with a shorter length of hospitalization and lower hospital-related cost of care for laryngeal cancer surgery.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^115H3qrM]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This review summarised the available literature to provide estimates of LoS for total hospital admission and ICU which can be applied for planning and preparedness for SARS-CoV-2. We found substantial differences between China and other settings in terms of total hospital stay, but little evidence for an impact on LoS of time of study, age, or disease severity. We present summary distributions which can be used within models making predictions about bed requirements, and suggest that this may be a more robust and realistic way to characterise LoS than relying on summary data from just one setting or hospital. The majority of the data presented in this review comes from China, and as more data become available, it will be important to update this with setting-specific LoS estimates. Understanding the duration of hospitalisation of COVID-19 patients is critical for providing insights as to when hospitals will reach capacity, as well predicting associated staff or equipment requirements.

### Assessment of intensive care unit laboratory values that differ from reference ranges and association with patient mortality and length of stay [^111Log51]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Laboratory data are frequently collected throughout the care of critically ill patients. Currently, these data are interpreted by comparison with values from healthy outpatient volunteers. Whether this is the most useful comparison has yet to be demonstrated.

Objectives

To understand how the distribution of intensive care unit (ICU) laboratory values differs from the reference range, and how these distributions are related to patient outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study of a large critical care database, the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care database, from January 1, 2001, to October 31, 2012. The database is collected from ICU data from a large tertiary medical center in Boston, Massachusetts. The data are collected from medical, cardiac, neurologic, and surgical ICUs. All patients in the database from all ICUs for 2001 to 2012 were included. Common laboratory measurements over the time window of interest were sampled. The analysis was conducted from March to June 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The overlapping coefficient and Cohen standardized mean difference between distributions were calculated, and kernel density estimate visualizations for the association between laboratory values and the probability of death or quartile of ICU length of stay were created.

Results

Among 38 605 patients in the ICU (21 852 [56.6%] male; mean [SD] age, 74.5 [55.1] years), 8878 (23%) had the best outcome (ICU survival, shortest quartile length of stay) and 3090 (8%) had the worst outcome (ICU nonsurvival). Distribution curves based on ICU data differed significantly from the hospital standard range (mean [SD] overlapping coefficient, 0.51 [0.32–0.69]). All laboratory values for the best outcome group differed significantly from those in the worst outcome group. Both the best and worst outcome group curves revealed little overlap with and marked divergence from the reference range.

Conclusions and Relevance

The standard reference ranges obtained from healthy volunteers differ from the analogous range generated from data from patients in intensive care. Laboratory data interpretation may benefit from greater consideration of clinically contextual and outcomes-related factors.

### Randomised trial of intrapleural urokinase in the treatment of childhood empyema [^114nwBsi]. Thorax (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The role of intrapleural fibrinolytic agents in the treatment of childhood empyema has not been established. A randomised double blind placebo controlled trial of intrapleural urokinase was performed in children with parapneumonic empyema.

Methods

Sixty children (median age 3.3 years) were recruited from 10 centres and randomised to receive either intrapleural urokinase 40 000 units in 40 mL or saline 12 hourly for 3 days. The primary outcome measure was length of hospital stay after entry to the trial.

Results

Treatment with urokinase resulted in a significantly shorter hospital stay (7.4 v 9.5 days; ratio of geometric means 1.28, CI 1.16 to 1.41 p = 0.027). A post hoc analysis showed that the use of small percutaneous drains was also associated with shorter hospital stay. Children treated with a combination of urokinase and a small drain had the shortest stay (6.0 days, CI 4.6 to 7.8).

Conclusion

Intrapleural urokinase is effective in treating empyema in children and significantly shortens hospital stay.

### Laparoscopic versus open adhesiolysis for adhesive small bowel obstruction (LASSO): an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label trial [^116j8Nkf]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Although laparoscopic adhesiolysis for adhesive small bowel obstruction is being done more frequently, it is not widely accepted due to the lack of supporting evidence of its superiority over an open approach and concerns regarding its benefits. We aimed to investigate whether laparoscopic adhesiolysis was a superior treatment for adhesive small bowel obstruction compared with an open approach in terms of length of postoperative hospital stay and morbidity.

Methods

In this international, multicentre, parallel, open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients (1:1) aged 18–95 years who had adhesive small bowel obstruction that had not resolved with conservative management to have either open or laparoscopic adhesiolysis. The study was done in five academic university hospitals and three community (central) hospitals in two countries (Finland [n = 3 academic university hospitals; n = 3 community hospitals] and Italy [n = 2 academic university hospitals]). We included only patients with high likelihood of a single adhesive band in the trial; additionally, patients who had an anaesthesiological contraindication, were pregnant, living in institutionalised care, or who had a hospital stay of more than 1 week before the surgical consultation were excluded from the trial. The randomisation sequence was generated using block randomisation, with randomly varied block sizes and stratified according to centre. The primary outcome was postoperative length of hospital stay assessed at time of discharge in the modified intention-to-treat population.

Findings

Between July 18, 2013, and April 9, 2018, 566 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 104 patients were randomly assigned to the open surgery group (n = 51) or to the laparoscopy group (n = 53). Of these patients, 100 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses (49 in the open surgery group; 51 in the laparoscopy group). The postoperative length of hospital stay for open surgery group was on average 1·3 days longer than that in the laparoscopy group (geometric mean 5·5 days [range 2–19] vs 4·2 days [range 1–20]; ratio of geometric means 1·31 [95% CI 1·06–1·61]; p = 0·013). 21 (43%) patients in the open surgery group and 16 (31%) patients in the laparoscopy group had postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo any grade) within 30 days (odds ratio 0·61 [95% CI 0·27–1·38]; p = 0·23). One patient died in each group within 30 days.

Interpretation

Laparoscopic adhesiolysis provides quicker recovery in selected patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction than open adhesiolysis.

### A consensus document on robotic surgery [^112tiZe6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Robotic surgery — length of stay considerations require procedure-by-procedure comparison because robotic surgery may be appropriately compared to minimally invasive techniques or to open techniques. Length of stay affects cost centers outside the operating room, and decreased length of stay will counterbalance some of the increased operating room expenses associated with all forms of minimally invasive surgery (MIS); length of stay may be affected by postoperative pain, intraoperative blood loss and complication rates, and the differences between robotic and conventional surgery in these categories has not yet been adequately studied.

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^111UxZbK]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — the abstract reports that advances in vascular access techniques, stent technology, and antiplatelet pharmacology have facilitated changes in discharge patterns after PCI, and additional studies have shown the safety of early and same day discharge for selected uncomplicated PCI, while reimbursement policies have discouraged unnecessary hospitalization. The consensus update clarifies clinical and reimbursement definitions of discharge strategies, reviews technological advances and literature supporting reduced hospitalization duration and risk assessment, and describes changes to consensus recommendations on PCI length of stay. The recommendations are intended to support reasonable clinical decision making on postprocedure length of stay for a broad spectrum of PCI patients rather than prescribing a specific observation period for individual patients.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^111SJMUG]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding and predicting hospital bed demand (as well as associated staff or equipment requirements) provide crucial evidence for decision-making and contingency planning (7, 8). Predicting demand for hospital services requires an estimate of the number of patients requiring hospitalisation and an estimate of how long each person will require hospital care. It is possible to model the rate of hospitalisation in many settings based on estimated epidemic curves. However, estimating length of stay (LoS) in hospitals requires observation of individual patient pathways.

COVID-19 presents at varying levels of severity. Hospital care can vary from general ward-based care to high dependency units with oxygen support to intensive care where patients may be intubated for mechanical ventilation. The LoS is likely to depend on the level of care required, as well as the geographic setting due to varying COVID-19 care guidelines. For example, some hospitals in China were initially used as isolation settings. As knowledge of effective treatments changes, the pathways, staff, beds, and equipment required are also likely to affect the duration and level of care needed. Moreover, patient characteristics — such as age and comorbidities — impact disease severity and are likely to influence LoS. If differences are significant, then capacity planning may need to account for these characteristics to provide accurate predictions of the number of beds required at each level of care. Modelling studies predicting bed occupancy published so far have broadly relied on very few sources of information for LoS estimates, which were often derived from very different settings. Estimates for LoS can be obtained from a variety of studies, but are often an incidental result rather than a study's primary outcome, and typically, only summary statistics are reported. In general, LoS distributions are right-skewed due to a minority of patients with long hospital stays and are often modelled using gamma, log-normal, or Weibull distributions (although log-normal is less preferred due to its heavier tails). A particular challenge is how to synthesise appropriate LoS distributions from a range of relevant sources in similar settings, capturing the variation both within and between them. Incorporating the uncertainty and stochasticity in parameters using a distribution, rather than fixed point estimates (such as the mean over all studies), allows for more realistic model predictions.

Median stay in ICU ranged from 5 (IQR 2–9) to 19 (no IQR reported) days. There appeared to be less of a difference according to discharge status (alive or dead) than there was for total LoS (Fig. 3). A total of 8 studies reported ICU LoS estimates, with the same number of studies reporting LoS estimates from China and outside of China, and the resulting overall estimates are very similar. There were too few studies to conduct any comparison by age or disease severity.

### Is length of stay in hospital a stable proxy for injury severity? [^112wWL2W]. Injury Prevention (2010). Low credibility.

Research Question

Is length of stay (LoS) in hospital a stable proxy for severity of injury when monitoring time trends in serious injury incidence?

Objective

To investigate whether LoS metrics (mean, median and proportion exceeding several LoS thresholds) have changed over time for injury diagnoses with known severity.

Design

Time series investigation.

Subjects and Setting

New Zealand population admitted to hospital for injury and discharged during the period 1989 to 1998.

Main Outcome Measures

Interpolated median and geometric mean lengths of stay, as well as the proportion of cases that have an LoS greater than or equal to 3, 4, 7 and 14 days in hospital.

Methods

ICD-9-CM diagnoses that are approximately homogeneous in regard to severity of injury (ICD-HS diagnoses) were identified. Trends were investigated in the LoS statistics for: injury and non-injury diagnoses combined; all injury diagnoses; major body sites of injury; severity strata; and ICD-HS diagnoses.

Results

Almost without exception, there was a decline in the LoS statistics over time for all diagnoses, all injury diagnoses, each body site of injury investigated, severity strata, and the ICD-HS diagnoses.

Conclusions

Reductions in median and geometric mean LoS over time, as well as reductions in the proportion exceeding selected LoS thresholds, were due to factors other than reductions in the incidence of serious injury; for example, changes in service delivery over time. An LoS threshold should not be used as a proxy for severity of injury if the goal is to monitor time trends in injury incidence.

### Randomized clinical trial of comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization in vascular surgery [^114Y7aCe]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing numbers of older patients are undergoing vascular surgery. Inadequate preoperative assessment and optimization may contribute to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Patients aged at least 65 years scheduled for elective aortic aneurysm repair or lower-limb arterial surgery were enrolled in an RCT of standard preoperative assessment or preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment and optimization. Randomization was stratified by sex and surgical site (aorta/lower limb). Primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcome measures included new medical co-morbidities, postoperative medical or surgical complications, discharge to a higher level of dependency and 30-day readmission rate.

Results

A total of 176 patients were included in the final analysis (control 91, intervention 85). Geometric mean length of stay was 5·53days in the control group and 3·32days in the intervention group (ratio of geometric means 0·60, 95 per cent c.i. 0·46 to 0·79; P < 0·001). There was a lower incidence of delirium (11 versus 24 per cent; P = 0·018), cardiac complications (8 versus 27 per cent; P = 0·001) and bladder/bowel complications (33 versus 55 per cent; P = 0·003) in the intervention group compared with the control group. Patients in the intervention group were less likely to require discharge to a higher level of dependency (4 of 85 versus 12 of 91; P = 0·051).

Conclusion

In this study of patients aged 65years or older undergoing vascular surgery, preoperative comprehensive geriatric assessment was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay. Patients undergoing assessment and optimization had a lower incidence of complications and were less likely to be discharged to a higher level of dependency. Registration number: ISRCTN23142588 (http://www.controlled-trials.com).

### Evaluation of early abdominopelvic computed tomography in patients with acute abdominal pain of unknown cause: prospective randomised study [^112jZLpm]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the impact of early abdominopelvic computed tomography in patients with acute abdominal pain of unknown cause on length of hospital stay and accuracy of diagnosis.

Design

Randomised, prospective controlled trial.

Setting

Teaching hospital in England.

Participants

120 patients admitted with acute abdominal pain for which no immediate surgical intervention or computed tomography was indicated.

Intervention

55 participants were prospectively randomised to early computed tomography (within 24 hours of admission) and 65 to standard practice (radiological investigations as indicated).

Main Outcome Measures

Length of hospital stay, accuracy of diagnosis, and, owing to a possible effect on inpatient mortality, deaths during the study.

Results

Early computed tomography reduced the length of hospital stay by 1.1 days (geometric mean 5.3 days (range 1 to 31) v 6.4 days (1 to 60)), but the difference was non-significant (95% confidence interval, 8% shorter stay to 56% longer stay, P = 0.17). Early computed tomography missed significantly fewer serious diagnoses. Seven inpatients in the standard practice arm died. Only 50% (59 of 118) of diagnoses on admission were correct at follow up at 6 months, but this improved to 76% (90) of diagnoses after 24 hours.

Conclusions

Early abdominopelvic computed tomography for acute abdominal pain may reduce mortality and length of hospital stay. It can also identify unforeseen conditions and potentially serious complications.

### Comparing the kids' inpatient database and national inpatient sample for pediatric research [^115UaW7f]. Academic Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pediatric researchers use Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to analyze the national resource use and outcomes of hospitalized children. Inherent KID-NIS sampling design differences may yield disparate findings. We compared discharge counts and length of stay (LOS) between KID and NIS for common and rare reasons for hospitalization.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of differences in discharges counts and geometric mean LOS for children ages 0–20 years from KID and NIS in 2019, measured for normal newborns and 331 additional reasons for admission, distinguished by All-Payer Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG) and categorized in deciles by annual discharge volume. We followed AHRQ instructions for data clustering, stratification, and weighting to accommodate the KID and NIS designs, including random samples of 80% and 20% of pediatric discharges, respectively, per hospital.

Results

KID-NIS differences in national estimates for total annual discharge counts differed by only 0.5% for normal newborns and 3.7% for all other admission reasons in children. KID-NIS differences remained small aside from reasons for admission in the two lowest volume deciles: 9.5% (SD 7.9%) for admission volumes 200–520; 41.1% (SD 64.2%) for volumes < 200. KID-NIS LOS differences for these two-lowest volume deciles were 7.9% (SD 7.1%) and 26.0% (SD 29.3%), respectively.

Conclusions

Although KID-NIS differences in discharge counts and LOS were small for high-volume admissions, the differences increased with reasons for admission that had annual discharge volumes approximately 500 or less. For study populations with discharge counts < 500, KID may be preferred, given its higher sampling of discharges per hospital.

### Impact of frailty on short-term outcomes after laparoscopic and open hepatectomy [^112Mwsgf]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Interplay between age and frailty

Comparisons of outcomes between frail and non-frail patients were then performed within the elderly and non-elderly patient subgroups. Analysis of mortality, complication rates and length of stay found the effect of frailty to be similar in non-elderly and elderly patients (Table 3). For example, for non-elderly patients, frailty (vs. non-frailty) was associated with odds ratio for 90-day mortality of 2.25 (5.7% vs. 2.6%), which was similar to the 2.19 (9.0% vs. 4.3%) observed in elderly patients (p = 0.961).

Table 3
Interplay between age and frailty

For binary outcomes, odds ratios are from binary logistic regression models within each age subgroup, with mFI (≥ 1 vs. 0) as the independent variable. The p -values relate to the interaction terms of binary logistic regression models with age, frailty and the age*frailty interaction as independent variables, hence represent a comparison between the reported odds ratio for each subgroup. *Analysis of length of stay excluded those patients who died in hospital prior to discharge. For the remainder, the average lengths of stay are reported as geometric mean (95% CI). Lengths of stay were then log₁₀-transformed, and analysed using an ANOVA model, parameterised as previously described, with the comparisons between groups reported as percentage differences. CI confidence interval; mFI modified frailty index

### Variations in the length of stay of intensive care unit nonsurvivors in three scandinavian countries [^112mLRvZ]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Statistics

LOS is presented as medians and quartiles (IQR) unless otherwise stated, as the distribution is highly skewed. Other continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations (SDs). Analyses of LOS were done with the Kruskal-Wallis, log-rank or Mann-Whitney U test, where appropriate. For continuous variables, the means were analyzed with the Student t test or one-way analysis of variance, where appropriate. Categoric variables were analyzed by using the χ² test. APACHE II and SAPS II, both without age points, were grouped into quartiles before univariate analysis. To examine the independent effect of several variables on LOS, we performed a multivariate Cox regression proportional-hazards analysis, which included age category, admission category, hospital type, country, and gender. The proportional-hazards assumption was assessed graphically with relevant covariates. We used SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).

### Denver ED trauma organ failure score predicts healthcare resource utilization in adult trauma patients [^111NdYEc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Early identification of trauma patients who need specialized healthcare resources may facilitate goal-directed resuscitation and effective secondary triage.

Objective

To estimate associations between Denver Emergency Department (ED) Trauma Organ Failure (TOF) Score and healthcare resource utilization.

Methods

Retrospective study of adult trauma patients at Denver Health Medical Center. The outcome was resource utilization including: intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, procedures, and costs. Multivariable regression analyses were used to estimate associations between moderate- or high-risk patients, as determined by the Denver ED TOF Score, and healthcare resource utilization.

Results

We included 3000 patients with a median age of 42 (IQR 27–56) years, 71% male, median injury severity score 9 (IQR 5–16), and 83% blunt mechanism. Among the cohort, 1379 patients (46%) were admitted to the ICU and 122 (4%) died. The adjusted relative risk for high- and moderate-risk as compared to low risk for number of procedures performed was 2.31 (95% CI 2.07–2.57) and 1.80 (95% CI 1.59–2.03) respectively; ICU LOS was 2.87 (95% CI 2.70–3.05) and 1.71 (95% CI 1.60–1.83) respectively; hospital LOS was 3.33 (95% CI 3.21–3.45) and 1.97 (95% CI 1.90–2.05) respectively. The adjusted geometric mean for high-, moderate-, and low-risk for costs was $48,881 (95% CI $43,799-$54,552), $27,890 (95% CI $25,460-$30,551), and $12,983 (95% CI $12,493-$13,492), respectively.

Conclusions

The Denver ED TOF Score predicts healthcare resource utilization, and is a useful bedside tool to identify patients early after injury that are likely to require significant healthcare resources and specialized trauma care.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^116AJw2k]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Estimating LoS distributions

Overall summary distributions were created for total hospitalisation LoS and for ICU LoS. Unlike a meta-analysis, the assumption here was not that each study had estimated an average LoS with some error, but that each study had captured a portion of the overall LoS distribution across a general population. Each of the studies provides us with a "sample" which we use to generate a better idea of the "true" underlying distribution. Our aim was to therefore incorporate all the variation across studies in order to obtain a distribution covering all plausible LoS values. We included studies in the estimation of these summary distributions if they reported both the sample size along with either the median and IQR or the mean and standard deviation. If no measure of variation was provided (either IQR or standard deviation), the point estimates were included in figures but excluded from these summary results.

Weibull distributions were fitted to the summary data from each study, using Nelder-Mead optimisation (implemented in the stats package in R) for those reporting medians and IQRs. Specifically, the shape and scale parameters were varied in order to minimise the squared distance between the distribution and study quantiles. Where estimates were presented as a mean, x, and standard deviation, s, the distribution was fitted by moment-matching using the mixdist package. The same approach was also tested using gamma distributions, but Weibull was marginally preferred with respect to total squared error in the fitted quantiles. These distributions were then discretised using the distcrete package in R. A total of 100,000 samples were then drawn from each of these distributions, with weighting according to their sample size. Specifically, the study distributions were first sampled according to a multinomial distribution defined by the studies' relative sample sizes, and LoS was then sampled from each of these sampled distributions. Due to potential important differences in the characteristics of each study population, it may not be appropriate to weight entirely on sample size without considering how representative the cohort is of the general population. Therefore, as a sensitivity analysis, we performed the same analysis without weighting in order to understand how much this influences the distribution. In some cases, studies reported LoS according to some stratification and not over the whole study population. Here, we applied the same method to summarise across the strata and obtain an estimated median and IQR across the whole population, validating the approach using examples where the overall summary statistics were also provided.

All analyses were performed using R version 3.6.3 (29 February 2020).

### Effect of dementia on the incidence, short-term outcomes, and resource utilization of invasive mechanical ventilation in the elderly: a nationwide population-based study [^116SwCkZ]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

We conducted a descriptive and comparative analysis of cases with and without dementia, including demographic and clinical information, comorbidity burden, and hospital mortality, stay, and costs. Charlson comorbidity scores are provided as a continuous variable and as categorical with 4 groups (0, 1–2, 3–4, > 4) of increasing severity and impact on outcomes. Categorical variables are expressed as absolute frequencies and percentages while continuous variables are given as geometric means and geometric standard deviation (SD), as geometric means are less influenced by extreme values than arithmetic ones. To test differences in categorical variables, we used Pearson's chi-square test.

In-hospital mortality was estimated as the number of deaths relative to the number of cases and expressed as a percentage, or case fatality rate (CFR). To examine the effect of dementia on mortality, stay, and costs, we conducted regression models (logistic regressions for mortality and linear regressions of log-transformed stay and costs) and adjusted them in two multivariable models. Model 1 was adjusted for baseline characteristics (age, sex, Charlson index) whereas model 2 also included the principal diagnosis at admission and MV duration. Results are expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (for mortality) and geometric means ratio with 95% confidence intervals (for stays and costs).

We examined temporal trends in MV incidence rate (per 100,000 people and per 10,000 hospital discharges), proportion of MV cases with dementia, prolonged MV (defined as a duration of ≥ 96 consecutive hours according to the ICD-9-CM codification system), and CFR. To this end, we used joinpoint regression models — generalized linear models that assume a Poisson distribution. In these models, any apparent trend can be statistically assessed through a Monte Carlo permutation method. Trends are presented as the average annual percentage change (AAPC), a summary measure of the overall trend over the study period. To compare the AAPC of both study groups, we examined whether their regression mean functions were parallel, allowing for different intercepts, using the Pairwise comparison parallel test. In addition, we analyzed trends in length of stay and costs using Cuzick's p -trend test.

All tests were performed using the packages STATA 15 (StataCorp. LP, College Station, TX, USA) and Joinpoint Regression 4.7.0.0. Significance was set at p < 0.05.

### Studying determinants of length of hospital stay [^115Bo534]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Clinicians are accustomed to focusing on individual patients. However, when studying how long their patients stay in the hospital, the focus must widen. Length of stay summarizes the performance of the entire, exceedingly complex, NICU system. Ordinary statistical methods for modeling patient outcomes assume that what happens to one patient is unrelated to what happens to another. However, patients in the same NICU are exposed to similar hospital practices, so patient outcomes may be correlated. Length of stay data must be analyzed by methods that account for possibly correlated outcomes. In addition, to improve patient care and outcomes, predictive models must include determinants clinicians can influence. Such variables describe care process exposures, available beds, demand for beds, and staffing levels.

### Telomerase variants in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation [^114xQ9fz]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Associations Between Variants and Clinical Values

Gene burden association tests were performed using regression models of categories of variants and various clinical values. Among all patients, we evaluated associations between baseline laboratory values and the presence of variants using natural log–transformed linear regression models. Thus, the exponentiated regression coefficients for laboratory values should be interpreted as the changes in the ratio of the expected geometric means of the original outcome variable. For presentation in outcome tables, results represent the percent change in estimated geometric mean. Follow‐up data on postoperative clinical outcomes (laboratory values, length of stay, number of readmissions within 1 year, and mortality) were available for transplant patients. Using a gene burden test, associations between the presence of variants and pretransplant/posttransplant change in laboratory values were analyzed using natural log–transformed linear regression models; associations with postoperative length of stay and readmissions were analyzed using negative binomial regression models; and associations with mortality were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression models. 14 All models were adjusted for age at sample, ethnicity/race (Hispanic/non‐Hispanic white/other), diagnosis (ETOH/HBV or HCV/other), and sex (female/male). A conservative Bonferroni adjustment was applied to each group of tests (all variant categories for each outcome) to account for multiple comparisons.

### A randomized controlled trial of high-flow nasal oxygen (optiflow) as part of an enhanced recovery program after lung resection surgery [^113KGRTY]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing thoracic surgery are at risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. High-flow nasal oxygen therapy delivers humidified, warmed positive airway pressure but has not been tested routinely after thoracic surgery.

Methods

We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded study. Patients undergoing elective lung resection were randomly assigned to either high-flow nasal oxygen or standard oxygen therapy. Patients were otherwise treated within an established enhanced recovery program. The primary outcome was the difference between the preoperative and postoperative 6-minute walk test. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, spirometry, and patient-reported outcomes measured using the Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale.

Results

Fifty-nine patients were randomly assigned to either high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 28) or standard oxygen (n = 31) therapy. We found no difference in the 6-minute walk test outcome or spirometry; however, length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the high-flow nasal oxygen group, median 2.5 days (range, 1 to 22), compared with the standard oxygen group, median 4.0 days (range, 2 to 18); geometric mean ratio was 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.48 to 0.86, p = 0.03). No significant differences in recovery domains were found, but patients in the high-flow nasal oxygen group reported significantly higher satisfaction (p = 0.046).

Conclusions

Prophylactic high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, when incorporated into an enhanced recovery program, did not improve 6-minute walk test results but was associated with reduced length of hospital stay and improved satisfaction after lung resection, compared with standard oxygen. This finding has implications for reduced costs and better service provision, and a multicenter trial powered for length of stay is required.

### Effect of dementia on the incidence, short-term outcomes, and resource utilization of invasive mechanical ventilation in the elderly: a nationwide population-based study [^112uJxPa]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Trends in in-hospital mortality in MV episodes of patients with and without dementia. The figure shows the changes observed over time in in-hospital mortality. Note that cases with dementia do not show the downward trend detected in the cases without dementia; rather, they feature a fluctuating trend over the period of study

Figure 3 illustrates that geometric mean hospital stay in the cohort with dementia has steadily declined over time, while it has been relatively stable in the cohort without dementia. Geometric mean hospital costs per case have risen markedly over the study period. This increase has been nevertheless lower among cases with dementia, and inter-cohort differences have persisted (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Trends in hospital resources in patients with and without dementia. a Over the period examined, geometric mean hospital stay has decreased significantly in cases with dementia passing from 12.12 days in the year 2000 to 9.47 days in 2013. In contrast, in cases without dementia, mean stay has remained stable passing from 13.63 to 13.26. b Over the period examined, geometric mean costs per case in the group with dementia have risen significantly from 6305€ in 2000 to 11,384€ in 2013 and in cases without dementia from 7485€ to 15,583€ (both p < 0.001)

### Timeliness of injury care and housing status [^112LfSkn]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Unhoused people have longer hospital lengths of stays than housed. This study examined if unhoused people have less timely injury care than housed.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult injury encounters from January 2015 - December 2022 at the only level 1 trauma center in an urban county. We merged the trauma registry with a county-wide integrated dataset to reliably identify our primary exposure: housing status in the fiscal year of injury. The primary outcome was time to the operating room in hours. Secondary outcomes were emergency department (ED) length of stay in minutes and additional timeliness measures. Multivariable linear regression models with clustered standard errors estimated the association of housing status with each log-transformed outcome, adjusting for clinical and demographic covariates.

Results

Among 21,264 trauma encounters, 18.8% (N = 4003) were in unhoused people. Unhoused and housed people had similar adjusted times to operating room (9.2 versus 9.9 h; adjusted geometric mean ratio 1.07 (95%CI 0.97–1.19; p = 0.19). ED length of stay was 17% longer for unhoused people compared to housed (381 versus 326 min); adjusted geometric mean ratio 1.17, 95%CI 1.13–1.21; p < 0.001). There were no clinically significant differences in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) transport time, EMS scene time, time to venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, nor time to angiography by housing status.

Conclusions

Timeliness of injury care is similar between unhoused and housed people.

### Real-time prediction for burn length of stay via median residual hospital length of stay methodology [^116gVgF4]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Hospital length of stay (LOS) after burn injury is commonly estimated as 1 day per percent burn, but LOS often exceeds that estimate. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel method for estimating burn hospital LOS at any time during hospitalization. The authors used the American Burn Association National Burn Repository from 2000 to 2009 to directly estimate the median residual LOS (MRLOS) of patients hospitalized for burn injuries and who survived to discharge. The MRLOS is the median of how many more days a burn patient will be hospitalized given that the person has been in hospital for a specified time period. The authors also estimated the 25th and 75th percentiles of residual life and quantified the relationship between MRLOS and LOS with ordinary least squares for all burn patients, by burn size and by presence of inhalation injury. MRLOS increased with increasing LOS, confirming that discharge estimates change over time. Patients with inhalation injury had longer MRLOS than patients without inhalation injury in the first 100 hospital days. Patients with large burns (> 25%) had large MRLOS consistent with prolonged hospitalization, but patients with small burns (< 25%) also had steadily increasing MRLOS during hospitalization (ie, the longer the patient was in the hospital, the longer the predicted LOS regardless of initial LOS estimate). Estimating remaining hospital LOS at any time during admission has been problematic; MRLOS can be used to provide an estimate of remaining hospital LOS and resource utilization to families, administrators, and other medical professionals.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^115jMzce]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Summarising length of stay

We found that LoS is often not the primary measure of interest in studies which report it; however, it is an important parameter when it comes to forecasting bed occupancy during an outbreak. By conducting this review, we have systematically gathered a range of published estimates, providing a source from which researchers and decision-makers can obtain estimates specific to their population of interest (e.g. with respect to comorbidities) and allowing comparison of LoS between several different populations and settings.

There have been numerous previous studies which have aimed to forecast the number of hospital beds required for COVID-19 patients. Many of these studies published so far have used point estimates, only originating from one study which often does not reflect the context of interest. In particular, many used estimates from Zhou et al. which reported a shorter total hospital LoS (median 11 ·0, IQR 7 ·0–14 ·0; Fig. 2), and a comparable ICU LoS (median 8 ·0, IQR 4 ·0–12 ·0; Fig. 3), compared with other studies from China. However, both of these were still longer than LoS estimates reported by studies outside of China. This means that the bed-forecasting studies relying on LoS estimates from Zhou et al. may be underestimating the number of beds required. This review has highlighted several potential sources of variation in LoS and identified common issues and biases which influence each individual estimate. This gives a motivation for considering a wider range of values than can be obtained in a single study, aiming instead to capture the overall distribution of LoS across a variety of possible patient trajectories.

### Hospital length of stay – does 1% TBSA really equal 1 day? [^113rt4Wu]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Length of stay (LOS) continues to be a standard variable when evaluating progress and outcomes in burn care. Common wisdom would dictate that this measure is linearly related to TBSA. Is this truly the case? A retrospective review of the National Burn Repository was conducted to evaluate factors that affect hospital LOS. The National Burn Repository data set was obtained from the American Burn Association. Data from the years 2002–2007 were extracted. Unique patients were identified by removing readmissions, outpatients, and patients not admitted. Patients whose "HOSPLOS" and/or "AREATOT" field was blank or 0 were excluded, as were nonthermally injured patients. Patients without an entry for age and dead patients were also excluded. This left a final data set of 52,712 patients for analysis. The data were then analyzed, with %TBSA burned as the independent variable. In patients who survived their entire LOS, the mean LOS increased linearly by decile. Females with a TBSA < 40% have a trend toward increased LOS relative to their male counterparts of the same TBSA; however, this trend reverses for TBSA ≥ 40%. Age alone is not a significant predictor of increasing LOS. The cause of burns was predominantly flame related across all deciles of TBSA, and most etiologies for burn demonstrate the predicted increase in LOS per %TBSA. LOS was not significantly affected by insurance type or whether the injury was work related or not. This analysis was confounded by the small numbers of patients with burns > 60% and age older than 70 years. Anticipating hospital LOS is not a simple task. Using complex statistical analysis, a linear trend associated with %TBSA can be seen; however, other variables do contribute. Until the precise role of these variables can be elucidated, anticipating patient LOS to be 1 day for every %TBSA is still a useful exercise.

### Monthly trend in mortality and length of stay among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients: analysis of a nationwide multihospital US database [^114KkMdD]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Patient Characteristics, Treatment, and Outcomes and Provider Characteristics Among COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients in April, May, June, or July

Note. COVID-19, the novel coronavirus 2; SD, standard deviation; LOS, length of stay; ICU, Intensive care unit.

The mortality rate among hospitalized COVID-19 patients declined from 20.9% in April to 7.7% in July (P trend < .0001). The LOS also declined during this period, from 9.4 days (± 10.1) in April to 5.3 days (± 4.3) in July (P trend < .0001). Results from GEE analysis after accounting for the differences in the patient population by admission months indicate that COVID-19 patients admitted in May had 43% lower odds of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.62), whereas those admitted in June had 56% lower odds of mortality (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.39–0.49), and those admitted in July had 57% lower odds of mortality (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.39–0.49) compared to patients admitted in April. Compared to the LOS among COVID-19 patients admitted in April, patients admitted in May had an average 4% shorter LOS (adjusted ratio of means, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94–0.98), whereas patients admitted in June and July had 26% (adjusted ratio of means, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72–0.76) and 46% (adjusted ratio of means, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.53–0.56) shorter LOS, respectively. The age-stratified GEE analysis revealed that the decrease in mortality was more pronounced in COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or older, and the decrease after June 2020 in LOS was consistent across all age groups. Among patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), the mortality rates were 40.8% in April, 32.9% in May, 27.3% in June, and 27.2% in July (P trend < .0001). The LOSs for COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were 16.6 days (± 14.2) in April, 15.5 days (± 12.8) in May, 12.3 days (± 9.3) in June, and 8.1 days (± 5.7) in July (P trend < .0001).

### Effect of opioid analgesics on emergency department length of stay among low back pain patients in the United States [^115gjVx3]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) between patients treated with opioid analgesia versus non-opioid analgesia for low back pain (LBP) in the ED.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) data (2014–2015). Adults (age ≥ 18 years) who presented to the ED with a reason for visit or primary diagnosis of LBP were included in the final study sample. Patient visits were categorized into two groups based on whether they received opioid analgesia (with or without non-opioid analgesia) or non-opioid analgesia only in the ED. The primary outcome measure was ED LOS, which was log-transformed (as ED LOS was not normally distributed) for analysis. A multivariable linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between opioid use and ED LOS.

Results

The study sample consisted of a national estimate of approximately 8.6 million ED visits for LBP (during 2014–2015), of which 60.1% received opioids and 39.9% received non-opioids only. The geometric mean ED LOS for patient visits who received opioids was longer than patient visits who received non-opioids (142 versus 92 min, respectively; p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders in the multivariable analysis, patient visits that received opioids had a significantly longer ED LOS (coefficient 0.25; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.38; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In a nationally representative sample of patient visits to ED due to LBP in the US, use of opioids in the ED was associated with an increased ED LOS.

### Evaluation of the learning curve for fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair [^116WNvQ8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the learning curve for fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (FEVAR).

Methods

Data were collected prospectively on all FEVAR procedures conducted by a single surgeon between June 2007 and January 2015. During the study period, 136 FEVARs were performed, and this experience was divided into four quartiles each consisting of 34 cases. Clinical outcomes evaluated included perioperative death and major complications. Process outcomes included length of procedure, fluoroscopy time, contrast material use, estimated blood loss, and intensive care unit length of stay.

Results

During the study period, there was a statistically significant increase in the complexity of cases as evidenced by an increase in the proportion of cases with two or more fenestrations from 52.9% in the first quartile to 88.2% in the fourth quartile (P = 0.001). Despite this, there was a steady decrease in the proportion of patients suffering perioperative death or major complications from 23.5% in the first quartile to 8.8% in the fourth quartile. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the odds of death or major complication were cut by 52.4% per quartile increase (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.8%-75.5%; p = 0.028). In addition, among cases with two or more fenestrations, geometric mean length of procedure was reduced from 223.8 minutes in the first quartile to 149.6 minutes in the fourth quartile, and geometric mean fluoroscopy time was reduced from 58.6 minutes in the first quartile to 31.5 minutes in the fourth quartile. After adjustment, there was an estimated 9.9% reduction in geometric mean procedure length per quartile increase (95% CI, 3.5%-15.9%; p = 0.003) and a 17.6% reduction in geometric mean fluoroscopy time per quartile increase (95% CI, 10.9%-23.8%; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Despite an increase in case complexity, there was evidence for significant improvement in important clinical and process outcomes during the study period. We believe that much of this improvement was attributable to several key advances in the FEVAR procedure that were instituted during the study period and are discussed herein.

### Demonstrating the relationships of length of stay, cost and clinical outcomes in a simulated NICU [^1112Ktiv]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Health-care leaders place significant focus on reducing the average length of stay (ALOS). We examined the relationships among ALOS, cost and clinical outcomes using a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) simulation model.

Study Design

A discrete-event NICU simulation model based on the Duke NICU was created. To identify the relationships among ALOS, cost and clinical outcomes, we replaced the standard probability distributions with composite distributions representing the best and worst outcomes published by the National Institutes of Health Neonatal Research Network.

Result

Both average cost per patient and average cost per ≤ 28 week patient were lower in the best NICU ($16,400 vs $19,700 and $56,800 vs $76,700, respectively), while LOS remained higher (27 vs 24 days).

Conclusion

Our model demonstrates that reducing LOS does not uniformly reduce hospital resource utilization. These results suggest that health-care leaders should not simply rely on initiatives to reduce LOS without clear line-of-sight on clinical outcomes as well.

### Trends in ductus arteriosus stent versus blalock-taussig-Thomas shunt use and comparison of cost, length of stay, and short-term outcomes in neonates with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow: an observational study using the pediatric health information systems database [^116WNRga]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The modified Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt is the gold standard palliation for securing pulmonary blood flow in infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow. Recently, the ductus arteriosus stent (DAS) has become a viable alternative.

Methods and Results

This was a retrospective multicenter study of neonates ≤ 30days undergoing DAS or Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt placement between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2020 at hospitals reporting to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. We performed generalized linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate trends in intervention and intercenter variation, propensity score adjustment and inverse probability weighting with linear mixed-effects modeling to analyze length of stay and cost of hospitalization, and generalized linear mixed modeling to analyze differences in 30-day outcomes. There were 1874 subjects (58% male, 61% White) from 45 centers (29% DAS). Odds of DAS increased with time (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, annually, P < 0.01 [95% CI, 1.10–1.38]) with significant intercenter variation (median OR, 3.81 [95% CI, 2.74–5.91]). DAS was associated with shorter hospital length of stay (ratio of geometric means, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.63–0.91]), shorter intensive care unit length of stay (ratio of geometric means, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61–0.97]), and less expensive hospitalization (ratio of geometric means, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.56–0.87]). Intervention was not significantly associated with odds of 30-day transplant-free survival (OR,1.18 [95% CI, 0.70–1.99]) or freedom from catheter reintervention (OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.65–1.58]), but DAS was associated with 30-day freedom from composite adverse outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.11–2.05]).

Conclusions

Use of DAS is increasing, but there is variability across centers. Though odds of transplant-free survival and reintervention were not significantly different after DAS, and DAS was associated with shorter length of stay and lower in-hospital costs.

### Measuring the burden of epilepsy hospitalizations in CDKL5 deficiency disorder [^1161ys1F]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Information on the hospital service use among individuals with CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder, an ultrarare developmental epileptic encephalopathy, is limited, evidence of which could assist with service planning. Therefore, using baseline and longitudinal data on 379 genetically verified individuals in the International CDKL5 Disorder Database, we aimed to investigate rates of seizure-related and other hospitalizations and associated length of stay in this cohort.

Methods

Outcome variables were lifetime count of family-reported hospitalizations and average length of stay both for seizure- (management and/or investigative) and non-seizure-related causes. These variables were examined according to gender, age group, genetic variant group, and lifetime number of antiseizure medications. Using negative binomial regression associations were expressed as incidence rate ratios and geometric mean ratios for hospitalization rates and length of stay, respectively.

Results

There were 2880 hospitalizations over 2728.4 person-years with two thirds seizure related. Infants were much more likely to be hospitalized than older individuals, with decreasing effect sizes with increasing age. Males had slightly higher rates of hospitalizations for seizure-related management and for non-seizure-related admissions. Lifetime use of six or more antiseizure medications was associated with a higher hospitalization rate for seizure management than use of three or fewer medications. The median length of stay was five days for seizure and nonseizure reasons.

Conclusion

There is an urgent need for much better seizure management in CDKL5 deficiency disorder given the hospitalization burden especially in the preschool age group and the multiplicity of antiseizure medications being used.

Data extraction and analysis

The data that was extracted from each study is presented in Supplementary Table A. Data extraction was performed by EMR, YJ, and ESN and then verified by a second member of the study team. Study characteristics (such as study dates, study population, and study design) were recorded from each study, including information on the LoS sample estimate for both total hospital LoS and intensive care unit (ICU) LoS, as well as sample size, discharge status, and completeness of follow-up. If multiple LoS estimates were reported for different study populations, these were all recorded (for example, LoS reported by disease severity, comorbidities, and treatment groups). One study specified non-ICU LoS, and this was grouped with total LoS estimates; ICU LoS was reported separately. Average patient age and sex distribution (% male) were summarised across all studies by weighted mean and standard deviation (mean (SD)), according to study sample size. Where possible, LoS estimates were recorded as median and interquartile range (IQR). Otherwise, mean and SD, or in some cases, only a point estimate was provided.

An assessment of bias was considered in these studies. Reported LoS in the majority of studies was not the primary outcome; therefore, a formal quality appraisal was not considered appropriate. Instead, we considered biases which may directly affect reported LoS. Studies were assessed as to whether follow-up had been completed for all included patients, such that an outcome of discharge or death had been observed for all and none remained in hospital at the end of the study. If this was not the case, the final summary of LoS may be biassed by including only shorter stays which were resolved within the time frame. As reported above, summaries of patient characteristics and comorbidities were recorded for each study where possible; this allowed later comparison of estimates based on features of the study population and provided some additional context with which to interpret the LoS estimates. Finally, the risk of bias related to potentially overlapping populations was also considered. Studies from the same hospital over the same time period were identified, and the study with largest sample size was selected from that group. A list of these studies is presented in Supplementary table B. LoS was then summarised including only these selected studies from the overlapping groups, along with the other non-overlapping studies. This estimate was then compared to the estimates based on all studies.

### Incidence, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics of severe coronavirus disease 2019 in California and Washington: prospective cohort study [^113XdsLd]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Duration of hospital stay

Accounting for censoring (see supplementary table S5), the estimated median length of stay for all patients admitted to hospital by 9 April 2020 was 10.1 days, with 50% of hospital stays lasting between 5.3 and 16.8 days and 95% lasting between 0.9 and 34.5 days (fig 3); similarly, the observed median duration of stay for patients admitted by 15 March 2020 was 11 days. Model estimated median durations of stay were 9.3 days for survivors and 12.7 days for non-survivors, with 95% of these patients staying 0.8 to 32.9 days and 1.6 to 37.7 days, respectively. The estimated median duration of ICU stay was 10.5 days among patients receiving intensive care, with 50% of ICU stays lasting between 6.0 and 16.4 days and 95% lasting between 1.3 and 30.7 days. These estimates did not differ in sensitivity analyses restricted to patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19 (see supplementary table S6).

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^112GxyVT]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Estimated distributions

Estimated summary hospital LoS distributions for studies from China and studies outside China are shown in Fig. 4. The median and IQR for total hospital was estimated to be 14 (10–19) for China and 5 (3–9) excluding China. This was also repeated for ICU LoS, with a median and IQR 8 (5–13) for China and 7 (4–11) outside China. Comparing patient outcomes for total LoS, patients who died had a shorter LoS distribution (median, 8; IQR, 4–12) compared with patients who were discharged (median, 14; IQR, 11–17; Supplementary Fig. C). Studies from China which had complete follow-up with respect to total hospital LoS were compared with studies with incomplete follow-up. A slight difference was observed, with shorter median LoS observed in studies with complete follow-up (median, 12; IQR, 8–17) compared with incomplete follow-up (median, 14; IQR, 10–19; Supplementary Fig. D). This was only performed for total hospital LoS in China, since no studies from outside China reported completed LoS for ICU. In addition, LoS estimates of all studies were compared with estimates where overlapping patient populations were removed (Supplementary Fig. E). A list of studies included in this analysis is presented in Supplementary table B. A small difference was observed, with longer LoS estimates observed in studies where overlapping populations had been removed (n = 17; median, 16; IQR, 11–22) compared with estimates across all studies (n = 19; median, 14; IQR, 10–19). Again, this sensitivity analysis was only performed for total hospital LoS in China, as it was the largest group.

Combined LOS distributions. Samples from the LoS distributions, split by location (China or rest of world) and type (ICU vs total LoS). For each subset, 100,000 draws were taken. The x -axis was cut at days = 60

For total hospital LoS in China, five studies were not included since they only provided point estimates for the LoS. The point estimates from four of these studies fell within the IQR of the estimated distribution; however, for, the point estimate was much longer. For total LoS outside of China, one study reported only a point estimate, and this also fell outside of the estimated IQR. Sensitivity analysis showed that weighting by sample size had minimal influence on the shape of these distributions (Supplementary Fig. F).

### Delirium is a common and early finding in patients in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit [^114eEm8K]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine incidence, associated risk factors, and characteristics of delirium in a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). Delirium is a frequent and serious complication in adults after cardiac surgery, but there is limited understanding of its impact in children with critical cardiac disease.

Study Design

Single-center prospective observational study of CICU patients ≤ 21 years old. All were screened for delirium using the Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium each 12-hour shift.

Results

Ninety-nine patients were included. Incidence of delirium was 57%. Median time to development of delirium was 1 day (95% CI 0, 1 days). Children with delirium were younger (geometric mean age 4 vs 46 months; P < .001), had longer periods of mechanical ventilation (mean 35.9 vs 8.8 hours; p = 0.002) and had longer cardiopulmonary bypass times (geometric mean 126 vs 81minutes; p = 0.001). Delirious patients had longer length of CICU stay than those without delirium (median 3 (IQR 2, 12.5) vs 1 (IQR1, 2) days; P < .0001). A multivariable generalized linear mixed model showed a significant association between delirium and younger age (OR 0.35 for each additional month, 95% CI 0.19, 0.64), need for mechanical ventilation (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.7, 9.89), and receipt of benzodiazepines (OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.46, 9.79).

Conclusions

Delirium is common in patients in the pediatric CICU and is associated with longer length of stay. There may be opportunities for prevention of delirium by targeting modifiable risk factors, such as use of benzodiazepines.

### Trends in ductus arteriosus stent versus blalock-taussig-Thomas shunt use and comparison of cost, length of stay, and short-term outcomes in neonates with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow: an observational study using the pediatric health information systems database [^1114CETs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The modified Blalock‐Taussig‐Thomas shunt is the gold standard palliation for securing pulmonary blood flow in infants with ductal‐dependent pulmonary blood flow. Recently, the ductus arteriosus stent (DAS) has become a viable alternative.

Methods and Results

This was a retrospective multicenter study of neonates ≤ 30 days undergoing DAS or Blalock‐Taussig‐Thomas shunt placement between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2020 at hospitals reporting to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. We performed generalized linear mixed‐effects modeling to evaluate trends in intervention and intercenter variation, propensity score adjustment and inverse probability weighting with linear mixed‐effects modeling to analyze length of stay and cost of hospitalization, and generalized linear mixed modeling to analyze differences in 30‐day outcomes. There were 1874 subjects (58% male, 61% White) from 45 centers (29% DAS). Odds of DAS increased with time (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, annually, P < 0.01 [95% CI, 1.10–1.38]) with significant intercenter variation (median OR, 3.81 [95% CI, 2.74–5.91]). DAS was associated with shorter hospital length of stay (ratio of geometric means, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.63–0.91]), shorter intensive care unit length of stay (ratio of geometric means, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.61–0.97]), and less expensive hospitalization (ratio of geometric means, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.56–0.87]). Intervention was not significantly associated with odds of 30‐day transplant‐free survival (OR,1.18 [95% CI, 0.70–1.99]) or freedom from catheter reintervention (OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.65–1.58]), but DAS was associated with 30‐day freedom from composite adverse outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.11–2.05]).

Conclusions

Use of DAS is increasing, but there is variability across centers. Though odds of transplant‐free survival and reintervention were not significantly different after DAS, and DAS was associated with shorter length of stay and lower in‐hospital costs.

### Estimated additional hospital length of stay caused by 40 individual complications in injured patients: an observational study of 204, 388 patients [^112Emn8G]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Complications are common in the care of trauma patients and increase hospital length of stay (LoS). Because many factors influence LoS and because patients may experience more than a single complication, it is difficult to estimate the effect of individual complications on LoS. We describe here a mathematically principled approach to estimating the additional LoS caused by complications and provide estimates for additional LoS caused by 40 common complications.

Methods

The Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation provided data on trauma patients hospitalized in one of 25 hospitals between 2002 and 2010. We estimated the attributable additional LoS in patients surviving to hospital discharge for 40 individual complications using a generalized linear model that controlled for anatomic injury and physiologic derangement at the time of admission, as well as patient factors (age, comorbidities, transfer status, type of insurance), discharge characteristics (day of week, destination), and year of admission. We also compared average risk-adjusted LoS among hospitals.

Results

Of 204,388 trauma patients surviving to discharge, 9.1% had one complication and 2.2% had multiple complications. Additional days LoS caused by individual complications ranged from less than 1 (bronchial intubation) to 16 days (wound dehiscence). Most complications added less than 1 week to LoS, but infectious complications added from 1 to 2 weeks; surgical complications added 2 to 3 weeks. If all complications could be eliminated, 24% of hospitalization days would be avoided. Individual hospitals' mean LoS differed from that predicted by our model by less than 1 day.

Conclusion

Complications are common in the care of trauma patients and add moderately to LoS. Among all complications, surgical complications are associated with the greatest increases.

### COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis [^1127ecuj]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of early evidence on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach, we provide distributions for total hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community.

Results

We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies — four each within and outside China — with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR 10–19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR 3–9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5–13) days for China and 7 (4–11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date.

Conclusion

Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.

### Modelling admission lengths within psychiatric intensive care units [^116HnHSk]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2023). High credibility.

Bayesian models were developed that examined LoS distribution. Using standards and clinical experience, a prior for the mean admission, length was deemed to be 6 weeks (42 days). So(admission length+1) = (43) = 3.76. This was decreased to 3.75 for a prior.

In a normal distribution, heuristically nearly all observations lie within three SDs of the mean. If the minimum value is zero and assuming normality with a mean 3.75, 3 σ = 3.75, thus σ = 1.25. The 0.95th quantile of admission length = e^(3.75 + (1.96 × 1.25)) = e^6.2 = 492 days. Patients rarely spend more than a year in a PICU (but it is not unheard of), so 1.25 seemed an acceptable value to use for the(admission length+1) SD weakly informative prior.

The first model allowed separate intercepts for each patient type (based on discharge destination):

Priors were:

Similar models were developed using diagnosis (ICD-10 chapters) and cluster instead of patient type.

When estimating prior distributions for variance in hierarchical models, if the number of groups is less than 5, the half-t family of prior distributions is recommended. Half-Cauchy priors were used for spread of variable means in this project. Based on initial data inspection, an appropriate prior (that allowed for flexibility) was decided to be a half-Cauchy with parameter 2 (a value slightly higher than expected for the SD of the underlying mean). Given uncertainty of what variables contributed most and in order to make priors extremely weak, it was decided to use this prior for an SD of all means in all proposed hierarchical models.

### The effect of high-flow nasal oxygen on hospital length of stay in cardiac surgical patients at high risk for respiratory complications: a randomised controlled trial [^117CwUZU]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

When planning our study, we analysed our hospital database for more than 2000 cardiac surgical procedures carried out in the year 2014, and found that mean (SD) hospital stay was 10 (3) days in patients with the same risk factors. We expected high‐flow nasal oxygen to reduce mean length of stay by 2 days (a 20% relative reduction) to 8 days; data from our trial in thoracic surgery patients showed a 35% reduction in length of stay, so we proposed that 20% was both feasible and clinically significant. Sample size calculation demonstrated that 92 patients (46 per group) would provide 90% power to detect a mean difference of 2 days in hospital length of stay. The required sample size was increased to 100 patients (50 per group) to allow for a 5% loss to follow‐up and drop‐outs. Baseline data were described using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and either mean and SD or median, IQR and range for continuous variables. Total hospital stay was calculated for all patients who were discharged alive. As total hopsital length of stay was positively skewed, comparisons between groups were made using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and the ratio of geometric means. A risk ratio (RR) was used to compare prolonged stay (defined as total hospital stay > 10 days) in the two groups. Intensive care re‐admission and death were compared using Fisher's exact test, and 6MWT and pulmonary function tests were compared using linear regression. Recovery profiles were compared using Chi‐squared tests and multi‐level mixed‐effect logistic regression. All analyses were by intention‐to‐treat and were performed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC) software and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Understanding length of stay after spinal cord injury: insights and limitations from the access to care and timing project [^112RjYqk]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

LOS is one of the primary drivers of hospital costs following traumatic SCI, and, as such, is an important measure of healthcare system performance and efficiency. Independent of patient demographics and injury characteristics, factors such as the organization of healthcare systems and accompanying processes contribute significantly to observed LOS. Identification of contributors will facilitate performance improvement within healthcare systems. Despite this importance, there is a relative dearth of research addressing the determinants of LOS. Efforts are further hampered by variability in defining and determining LOS, as well as the lack of a common terminology. Future research addressing LOS after traumatic SCI will be enhanced by the adoption of common terminology and definitions, as well as the use of simulations and modeling.

### Observed and expected outcomes in transfer and nontransfer patients with a hip fracture [^116uJ3np]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hospitals and providers that accept transfer patients risk lower ratings on publically reported quality measures that are inadequately adjusted for infirmity and complexity. We compared the outcomes of transferred patients and nontransferred patients after treatment of a hip fracture and sought to determine if expected outcomes based on an expansion of All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs) norms are accurately adjusted for transfer status.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary care referral center.

Patients

Four hundred six consecutive patients 65 years and older who received operative treatment of an acute hip fracture.

Intervention

Patients who were transferred from another acute care hospital or a skilled nursing facility before treatment were classified as transfer patients (n = 123), and all other patients were nontransfer patients (n = 283).

Main Outcome

Groups were compared with respect to in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), excess days over the geometric mean length of stay (GMLOS), and readmission rate as well as expected length of stay (Exp LOS) and expected mortality (Exp Mort) based on APR-DRG norms and additional adjustment for transfer status.

Results

Transfer patients had significantly greater LOS (10.2 vs 9.6 days; P < 0.05), Exp LOS (9.7 vs 7.7 days; P < 0.001), Exp Mort (0.07 vs 0.03; P = 0.004), and excess days over the GMLOS (4.1 vs 3.3 days; P = 0.025) than nontransfer patients, near-significant greater in-hospital mortality (9.8 vs 4.9%; P = 0.069), and similar readmission rates. The differences in LOS and Exp LOS were nonsignificant in both transfer (P = 0.49) and nontransfer patients (P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Patients 65 years and older transferred to a tertiary care facility for treatment of an acute hip fracture have worse outcome than nontransfer patients. Unadjusted data such as in-hospital mortality may be misleading, but risk adjustment using the APR-DRG methodology and additional correction for transfer status may provide meaningful benchmarks.

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^116Ai1dB]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) length of stay — definitions and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) status: Same day discharge (SDD) specifically refers to a patient who presents for elective PCI, undergoes the procedure, and after supervised recovery is sent home on the same calendar day. In the United States, inpatient and outpatient are the only CMS-recognized status determinations for reimbursement, and when a minor procedure is expected to keep a patient in the hospital for < 24 hr they are considered outpatients for coverage purposes regardless of bed use or midnight stay. Terms such as extended recovery or outpatient in a bed are not CMS terms. Outpatients may remain on observation status following PCI when appropriate, including for prolonged or adverse effects from sedation, fluid or electrolyte imbalance, or ongoing pain, bleeding, ischemia, or dysrhythmia after the procedure.

### Elliptical ejecta of asteroid dimorphos is due to its surface curvature [^116R3B29]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Figure 4 shows the distributions of the geometric factors of the samples. The geometric factor positively correlates with the target radius and strength (Fig. 4 a, b). Given a constant impact energy identical to the DART impact, higher strength, and a larger target radius make the transient crater radius small relative to the body, reducing the curvature effect and thus making the geometric factors higher. The transition zone from zero geometric factors (= 0%) to high geometric factors (> 70%) is narrow. This zone also overlaps the predicted catastrophic disruption threshold, which defines an impact condition when the final target mass is less than half the original (see "Methods", Subsection Catastrophic Disruption Threshold). However, this predicted range is generally broad, given the higher uncertainties of models and parameters. The standard deviation increases when the geometric factor decreases because the uncertainty is more sensitive to the variations in the empirical parameters when an impact affects a larger volume in a target.

Geometric factor distributions of 99 small NEOs measured by the MANOS project.

a and b Mean and standard deviation of the geometric factor for an impact along each target's semi-minor axis. c and d Mean and standard deviation of the relative geometric factor of an impact along the semi-major axis to one along the semi-minor axis. All panels give the geometric factor distributions in percentile as a function of diameter and minimum strength. All negative outcomes in Panels (a and b) are truncated and noted as zero geometric factors. The curves in different colors, calculated using Equation (23), show interpolations between the catastrophic disruption thresholds for a pumice-like target and a cohesionless target (red) and a basalt-like target and a cohesionless target (blue). For the cohesionless target, we assume a minimal strength of 0.01 Pa. The dashed, solid, and dotted lines give bulk densities of 1000 kg/m³, 2000 kg/m³, and 4000 kg/m³. If target asteroids stay on the right side of those thresholds, they do not experience catastrophic disruption. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
