## Question

What effects does an opioid have on the sympathetic nervous system?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what effects opioids have on the sympathetic nervous system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about central effects of opioids on sympathetic outflow. Then, I should examine peripheral vascular actions and histamine-mediated phenomena. Next, I will review stress-response modulation during noxious stimuli and anesthesia. After that, I need to consider endocrine interactions with the HPA axis and circadian coupling. I will then analyze the bidirectional interplay with adrenergic systems, including alpha-2 agonists and beta-blockers. Finally, I should synthesize acute versus chronic effects, withdrawal physiology, and practical clinical implications for anesthesia and withdrawal management.

> Let me first confirm how we measure sympathetic tone in humans, because I need to ensure we're drawing conclusions from appropriate endpoints; muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA) by microneurography and circulating catecholamines are standard and sensitive measures of sympathetic outflow, particularly relevant in anesthesia research and autonomic physiology, so using these endpoints to infer opioid effects is appropriate [^115nBVo2].

> Now, central effects: I will examine whether mu-opioid receptor activation tonically suppresses sympathetic outflow; in methadone-maintained individuals, resting MSA and venous norepinephrine are markedly suppressed despite preserved blood pressure and heart rate, and mu-receptor blockade with naloxone reverses this suppression with dramatic surges in MSA and catecholamines, indicating opioids exert a tonic central sympathoinhibitory effect, and clonidine can abolish the naloxone-evoked sympathetic activation, which reinforces the central coupling between mu-opioid and alpha-2 adrenergic systems [^115jduwa] [^115MXhhP].

> Wait, let me verify the antagonist physiology because I need to ensure this is not an off-target effect of naloxone; naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist with highest affinity at mu receptors and induces withdrawal in dependent states, so the sympathetic surge observed after naloxone in opioid-dependent patients is consistent with removal of mu-mediated central restraint on sympathetic outflow rather than an intrinsic sympathoexcitatory action of naloxone itself [^113Y4nfv] [^115MXhhP].

> Next, I will examine peripheral cardiovascular effects, and I should confirm whether vasodilation is consistent across opioids; fentanyl, oxycodone, and buprenorphine labeling consistently note peripheral vasodilation with risk of orthostatic hypotension or syncope, consistent with reduced systemic vascular resistance, and sufentanil produces dose-dependent forearm vasodilation with an intra-arterial infusion design that isolates a direct vascular smooth muscle effect independent of central neurogenic mechanisms, supporting a peripheral vasodilatory property of certain opioids [^113bdJcn] [^115rcTyK] [^113bdJcn] [^117EdUP8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought fentanyl-class drugs never trigger histamine; hold on, I should verify labeling versus classic pharmacology because I do not want to overstate the absence of histamine release; fentanyl labeling does list manifestations of histamine release and/or vasodilation such as flushing and pruritus, even though morphine-class agents are more prototypic histamine releasers, so the accurate statement is that fentanyl analogs are less prone than morphine to cause histamine release but are not immune to it, and peripheral vasodilation can occur irrespective of histamine, as shown with sufentanil [^115pofxs] [^111AdiJq] [^113xSnWr] [^117EdUP8].

> I will now examine modulation of the stress response, because I need to separate analgesia from sympatholysis; opioids blunt sympathetic responses to surgical stress and can improve intraoperative tissue oxygen tension, with continuous remifentanil infusion yielding higher subcutaneous oxygenation than bolus fentanyl, consistent with attenuation of adrenergic vasoconstriction during noxious stimulation, and neuraxial or systemic fentanyl suppresses autonomic reflexes to nociception beyond pure hemodynamic effects, reflecting both spinal and supraspinal modulation [^111aoweu] [^115pofxs] [^1118QkMx].

> But wait, what if endogenous opioids confound sympathoadaptation to repeated stressors like exercise or hypoglycemia; let me review naloxone-blockade paradigms to confirm directionality; opioid receptor blockade during antecedent exercise prevents the blunting of catecholamine responses to subsequent hypoglycemia, indicating that endogenous opioid tone contributes to downregulation of sympathetic counterregulation after repeated stress, and blockade restores appropriate epinephrine and norepinephrine responses as well as endogenous glucose production during hypoglycemia [^1133g5Vg] [^1153djSn] [^11743hqR] [^1122L3Np].

> Next, I should review endocrine-mediated effects because HPA axis changes can indirectly shape sympathetic tone; opioids suppress ACTH and cortisol and reduce LH, while increasing prolactin and growth hormone, and chronic exposure may perturb hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function, so by dampening glucocorticoid signaling that interacts with central noradrenergic systems, opioids may further influence autonomic balance, and circadian regulation of HPA and SCN–locus coeruleus coupling suggests time-of-day interactions with mu-opioid receptor function and sympathetic output that could modify clinical responses to opioids [^115rcTyK] [^111AdiJq] [^113bdJcn] [^1116gjpt].

> Hold on, I should verify the adrenergic–opioid interplay more broadly, because the bidirectional modulation might be clinically actionable; alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine reduce postoperative opioid requirements and pain scores, and are effective for mitigating the sympathetic hyperactivity of opioid withdrawal, while beta-adrenergic blockade modulates opioid-induced hyperalgesia with propranolol but does not produce primary analgesia in experimental pain models with esmolol, which clarifies that blunting sympathetic signs is not equivalent to antinociception [^115HGEKu] [^1138Czbm] [^114vX3iC] [^114Dqwhw] [^116xCebe].

> Let me think about special cases, because I need to ensure outliers are addressed; tramadol adds norepinephrine reuptake inhibition to weak mu agonism, which could theoretically counterbalance pure sympatholysis with increased synaptic NE depending on dose and context, and structural studies confirm tramadol's binding within catecholamine transporter domains relevant to NE reuptake inhibition, so not all opioids have identical autonomic signatures [^1176xLwB] [^1121GYVQ].

> I should double-check acute versus chronic states and withdrawal, since clinical patterns differ; acutely, opioids reduce sympathetic outflow and cause peripheral vasodilation with blunted hemodynamic responses to pain, whereas chronic exposure tonically suppresses baseline sympathetic activity with central adaptation such that abrupt antagonist exposure or cessation provokes marked sympathetic hyperactivity, which is why alpha-2 agonists like lofexidine are used to reduce withdrawal-related sympathetic symptoms and why naloxone in dependence rapidly unmasks a sympathetic surge [^115jduwa] [^115MXhhP] [^114QxsGp] [^113Y4nfv].

> Next, I should review anesthesia implications to ensure practice-level relevance; opioids remain central for suppressing sympathetic responses to surgical stimulation, yet opioid-reduced or opioid-free anesthesia strategies increasingly leverage alpha-2 agonists, NMDA antagonists, regional techniques, and multimodal analgesia to control sympathetic tone while minimizing opioid adverse effects, though hypotension and bradycardia with alpha-2 agents require vigilance and individualized hemodynamic management [^111i9EjT] [^111oK4sj] [^116188qq] [^115HGEKu].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety considerations are explicit; opioids can precipitate orthostatic hypotension via vasodilation, warranting caution in hypovolemia or shock where further vasodilation can worsen perfusion, and withdrawal syndromes should be proactively managed to avoid catecholamine surges that can destabilize cardiovascular status, with clonidine or lofexidine as adjuncts and ongoing agonist therapy (buprenorphine or methadone) often more effective for symptom control and retention than alpha-2 monotherapy [^117M7Eto] [^113bdJcn] [^113bdJcn] [^115oZ5dY] [^1138Czbm].

Opioids exert **sympatholytic effects** by centrally suppressing sympathetic outflow [^115jduwa], resulting in **peripheral vasodilation** [^115rcTyK] and orthostatic hypotension [^111AdiJq]. They **reduce heart rate and blood pressure** [^115pofxs] and blunt catecholamine responses to stress and hypoglycemia [^1133g5Vg]. Chronic opioid use further suppresses sympathetic tone [^115jduwa], whereas withdrawal causes **sympathetic overactivity** with hypertension, tachycardia, and diaphoresis [^115MXhhP] [^113Y4nfv]. These effects are clinically significant in perioperative care, critical illness, and chronic therapy and require careful monitoring and management [^111i9EjT].

---

## Central suppression of sympathetic outflow

- **Mechanism**: Opioids activate central mu-opioid receptors, inhibiting sympathetic outflow from the CNS [^115nBVo2] and reducing sympathetic tone.

- **Clinical evidence**: Chronic mu-opioid receptor stimulation (e.g. methadone) [^115jduwa] markedly decreases resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSA) and plasma norepinephrine levels.

- **Physiological consequences**: Reduced sympathetic tone leads to decreased heart rate, blood pressure, and peripheral vascular resistance [^115JHyJV].

---

## Peripheral vasodilation and hypotension

- **Mechanism**: Opioids cause peripheral vasodilation through direct effects on vascular smooth muscle [^117EdUP8] and histamine release [^111AdiJq].

- **Clinical evidence**: Fentanyl [^113Cwg5K] and oxycodone [^115rcTyK] produce peripheral vasodilation, resulting in orthostatic hypotension or syncope.

- **Physiological consequences**: Vasodilation and reduced sympathetic tone can lead to significant hypotension, particularly in patients with compromised cardiovascular function [^117M7Eto].

---

## Blunting of catecholamine responses

By suppressing sympathetic outflow, opioids **blunt catecholamine responses** to stress, pain, and hypoglycemia [^1133g5Vg] and reduce catecholamine release during surgical stress, reducing sympathetic activation and improving tissue oxygenation [^111aoweu]. Blunted catecholamine responses can impair the body's ability to respond to stressors, potentially leading to inadequate cardiovascular and metabolic responses [^11743hqR].

---

## Sympathetic overactivity during opioid withdrawal

- **Mechanism**: Abrupt cessation of opioids leads to rebound sympathetic hyperactivity, characterized by increased catecholamine release and sympathetic tone [^1138Czbm].

- **Clinical evidence**: Naloxone-induced opioid withdrawal [^113Y4nfv] markedly increases catecholamine plasma concentrations, muscle sympathetic activity, blood pressure, and heart rate [^115MXhhP].

- **Physiological consequences**: Sympathetic overactivity during withdrawal can cause hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and anxiety [^115oZ5dY].

---

## Clinical significance of sympathetic effects

In perioperative management, opioids are used to **suppress sympathetic responses** during surgery [^115pofxs], thereby maintaining hemodynamic stability and reducing stress-related complications [^111aoweu]. In critical illness, opioids modulate sympathetic activity [^117Ef2ch], potentially influencing cardiovascular stability and immune function [^111AdiJq]. During chronic opioid therapy, sustained suppression of sympathetic tone may contribute to **orthostatic hypotension** [^113bdJcn] and impaired stress responses.

Opioids primarily exert **sympatholytic effects** [^115nBVo2] by centrally suppressing sympathetic outflow, leading to peripheral vasodilation [^115rcTyK] and blunted catecholamine responses [^1133g5Vg]. These effects are clinically significant in perioperative management, critical illness, and chronic opioid therapy [^111i9EjT].

Use of opioids for an extended period may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted at the time of writing [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].

Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.

The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among those who have been previously treated with opioid agonists.

### Sympathetic neural activation evoked by mu-receptor blockade in patients addicted to opioids is abolished by intravenous clonidine [^115MXhhP]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Mu-opioid receptor blockade by naloxone, administered for acute detoxification in patients addicted to opioids, markedly increases catecholamine plasma concentrations and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA), and is associated with cardiovascular stimulation despite general anesthesia. The authors tested the hypothesis that the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (1) attenuates increased MSA during mu-opioid receptor blockade for detoxification and (2) prevents cardiovascular activation when given before detoxification.

- **Methods**: Fourteen mono-opioid addicted patients received naloxone during propofol anesthesia. Clonidine (10 microg/kg, administered over 5 min + 5 microg/kg/h intravenously) was infused either before (n = 6) or after (n = 6) naloxone administration. Two patients without immediate clonidine administration after naloxone served as time controls. Muscle sympathetic activity (n = 8) in the peroneal nerve, catecholamine plasma concentrations (n = 14), arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were assessed in awake patients, during propofol anesthesia before and after mu-opioid receptor blockade, and after clonidine administration.

- **Results**: Mu-receptor blockade markedly increased MSA from a low activity (burst frequency increased from 2 burst/min ± 1 to 24 ± 8, means ± SD). Similarly, norepinephrine (increased from 41 pg/ml ± 37 to 321 ± 134) and epinephrine plasma concentration (increased from 13 pg/ml ± 6 to 627 ± 146) significantly increased and were associated with increased arterial blood pressure and heart rate.

### Chronic mu-opioid receptor stimulation in humans decreases muscle sympathetic nerve activity [^115jduwa]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Opioid-addicted patients undergoing detoxification provide a unique opportunity to assess the effects of chronic opioid receptor stimulation on the sympathetic nervous system. We tested the hypothesis that chronic oral methadone intake decreases resting efferent sympathetic nerve activity to muscle (MSA) and further assessed whether this effect is reversed by mu-opioid receptor blockade during antagonist-supported detoxification under general anesthesia.

- **Methods and results**: Fifteen young patients (30 ± 1 years old, mean ± SEM) with a long history of mono-opioid addiction and under oral methadone substitution therapy (65 ± 10 mg/d for 21 ± 6 months) were selected. Peroneal MSA (microneurography) and catecholamine plasma concentrations (high-performance liquid chromatography) were assessed in the awake state and compared with age-matched healthy control subjects. The effects of mu-opioid receptor blockade by naloxone (12.4 mg IV) were determined during propofol anesthesia. Compared with healthy volunteers, resting MSA (4 ± 2 versus 22 ± 2 bursts/min, P < 0.0001) and antecubital venous norepinephrine plasma concentration (100 ± 64 versus 256 ± 48 pg/mL, P = 0.01) were markedly decreased in addicted patients despite similar arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Opioid receptor blockade markedly increased MSA (5 ± 2 to 24 ± 3 bursts/min), norepinephrine (49 ± 12 to 305 ± 48 pg/mL), and epinephrine (13 ± 2 to 482 ± 67 pg/mL) arterial plasma concentrations, as well as mean arterial pressure (82 ± 4 to 108 ± 3 mm Hg) and heart rate (70 ± 3 to 86 ± 4 beats/min).

### Fentanyl citrate [^113Cwg5K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Fentanyl citrate injection is an opioid agonist, whose principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.

- **Mechanism of action**: Fentanyl produces respiratory depression by direct action on the brain stem respiratory centers. This depression involves a reduction in responsiveness to increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Fentanyl also causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils can indicate opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic, as pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings. In overdose situations, marked mydriasis rather than miosis may occur due to hypoxia.

- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Fentanyl reduces motility, with increased smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. This results in delayed digestion in the small intestine and decreased propulsive contractions. In the colon, decreased propulsive peristaltic waves and increased tone can lead to spasms and constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include reduced biliary and pancreatic secretions, sphincter of Oddi spasm, and transient serum amylase elevations.

- **Effects on the cardiovascular system**: Fentanyl induces peripheral vasodilation, which may cause orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritis and flushing.

### Opioid receptor blockade prevents exercise-associated autonomic failure in humans [^1133g5Vg]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia and exercise both induce the release of β-endorphin, which plays an important role in the modulation of the autonomic response during subsequent events. Because opioid receptor (OR) blockade during antecedent hypoglycemia has been shown to prevent hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, we hypothesized that OR blockade during exercise would prevent exercise-associated autonomic failure (EAAF).

We studied eight healthy subjects over two consecutive days, with each participating in three different studies in random order. The protocol on the first day involved one of the following scenarios:

- **Control**: Two 90-minute hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps plus naloxone infusion.
- **N+**: Two 90-minute hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with exercise at 60% V O2max, plus naloxone infusion.
- **N−**: The same protocol as in the N+ group, but with saline infusion only.

On the second day, all subjects were studied using stepped hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamps, with hormone concentrations and glucose turnover serving as indicators of hypoglycemia counterregulation. Compared to the control, N− studies resulted in significantly blunted epinephrine and norepinephrine responses to subsequent hypoglycemia. Conversely, the N+ group exhibited unimpaired hypoglycemia counterregulation, characterized by appropriate increases in epinephrine, norepinephrine, and endogenous glucose production. Thus, OR blockade with naloxone during antecedent exercise prevents the development of acute EAAF by improving catecholamine responses and restoring endogenous glucose production.

### Effect of perioperative systemic α2 agonists on postoperative morphine consumption and pain intensity: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115HGEKu]. Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Systemic α2 agonists are believed to reduce pain and opioid requirements after surgery, thus decreasing the incidence of opioid-related adverse effects, including hyperalgesia.

- **Methods**: The authors searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials testing systemic α2 agonists administered in surgical patients and reporting on postoperative cumulative opioid consumption and/or pain intensity. Meta-analyses were performed when data from 5 or more trials and/or 100 or more patients could be combined.

- **Results**: Thirty studies (1,792 patients, 933 received clonidine or dexmedetomidine) were included. There was evidence of postoperative morphine-sparing at 24 h; the weighted mean difference was -4.1 mg (95% confidence interval, -6.0 to -2.2) with clonidine and -14.5 mg (-22.1 to -6.8) with dexmedetomidine. There was also evidence of a decrease in pain intensity at 24 h; the weighted mean difference was -0.7 cm (-1.2 to -0.1) on a 10-cm visual analog scale with clonidine and -0.6 cm (-0.9 to -0.2) with dexmedetomidine. The incidence of early nausea was decreased with both (number needed to treat, approximately nine). Clonidine increased the risk of intraoperative (number needed to harm, approximately nine) and postoperative hypotension (number needed to harm, 20). Dexmedetomidine increased the risk of postoperative bradycardia (number needed to harm, three). Recovery times were not prolonged. No trial reported on chronic pain or hyperalgesia.

- **Conclusions**: Perioperative systemic α2 agonists decrease postoperative opioid consumption, pain intensity, and nausea. Recovery times were not affected.

### Conzip [^1176xLwB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Conzip contains tramadol, an opioid agonist and an inhibitor of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable from animal tests: binding of parent and M1 metabolite to mu-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.

- **Mechanism of action**: Opioid activity of tramadol is due to both low-affinity binding of the parent compound and higher-affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to mu-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to six times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in mu-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opioid antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound.

- **Reuptake inhibition**: Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol. The relationship between exposure of tramadol and M1 and efficacy has not been evaluated in clinical studies.

Apart from analgesia, tramadol administration may produce a constellation of symptoms, including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating, and pruritus, similar to that of other opioids. In contrast to morphine, tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect…

### Local anaesthetic sympathetic blockade for complex regional pain syndrome [^111CMc6s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005, Issue 4 (and last updated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2013, Issue 8), on local anaesthetic blockade (LASB) of the sympathetic chain to treat people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of LASB for the treatment of pain in CRPS and to evaluate the incidence of adverse effects of the procedure.

- **Search methods**: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), LILACS (Birme), conference abstracts of the World Congresses of the International Association for the Study of Pain, and various clinical trial registers up to September 2015. We also searched bibliographies from retrieved articles for additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of sympathetic blockade with local anaesthetics in children or adults with CRPS compared to placebo, no treatment, or alternative treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The outcomes of interest were reduction in pain intensity, the proportion who achieved moderate or substantial pain relief, the duration of pain relief, and the presence of adverse effects in each treatment arm. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

### Norepinephrine dose and concentration reporting: the devil is in the details [^1156kCK3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

We are glad that the discussion around the use of norepinephrine is gaining momentum, which will undoubtedly nurture the research agenda and our understanding of this fascinating drug. Hopefully, this will translate into homogenizing our practice throughout the world and providing safer and more efficient patient care.

### Opioid receptor blockade prevents exercise-associated autonomic failure in humans [^11743hqR]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Concentrations of plasma epinephrine (A), norepinephrine (B), glucagon (C), and cortisol (D) are shown on day 2 at each glucose step in the N−, N+, and control studies. ✱ p < 0.05 for N− vs. N+ and control.

Plasma norepinephrine concentrations were equivalent during the 5.0 and 4.4 mmol/L glucose steps in all studies. However, during the 3.3 mmol/L glucose step, plasma norepinephrine (in pmol/L) increased only slightly in the N− studies (1,672.8 ± 443.3 pmol/L) compared with the N+ (3,322 ± 461.1) and control studies (2,873 ± 366, P < 0.05 for N− vs. N+ and control).

Plasma glucagon and cortisol concentrations were equivalent in all studies at baseline and increased similarly with hypoglycemia in the N−, N+, and control studies.

Mean baseline EGP was similar in all studies (2.2 ± 0.2, 2.1 ± 0.2, and 2.1 ± 0.2 mg/kg/min in the N−, N+, and control studies, respectively; P = NS). With the initiation of insulin infusion, EGP was equally suppressed by approximately 65% in all studies. During the 3.3 mmol/L glucose step, EGP recovered by 53% in the N− studies and by 92% and 85% in the N+ and control studies, respectively (P < 0.01 vs. N−).

### Disrupted circadian rhythms and opioid-mediated adverse effects: Bidirectional relationship and putative mechanisms [^1116gjpt]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

The circadian regulation of the HPA axis involves hormones such as CRH, ACTH, and glucocorticoids, as well as noradrenergic neurons in the LC, which are all regulated by the SCN. The clock system also influences the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor in peripheral tissues. Rhythmic glucocorticoid secretion induces variations in μ‐opioid receptor expression in the mouse brainstem, potentially affecting pain threshold variations. CRH‐deficient mice exhibited no rhythmic variation in μ‐opioid receptor expression, while corticosterone administration heightened μ‐opioid receptor expression in the brainstem and enhanced morphine's analgesic effect. These findings suggest enhanced μ‐opioid receptor function may amplify morphine's analgesic impact. Given glucocorticoids' stimulatory effect on μ‐opioid receptor expression and the importance of the 24-hour circulating glucocorticoid rhythm in synchronizing central and peripheral clocks, chronopharmacological strategies aimed at normalizing glucocorticoid levels could mitigate opioid treatment complications and adverse effects. The interaction between stress, circadian rhythms, and opioids is illustrated in Figure 7.

### Central nicotine induces browning through hypothalamic κ opioid receptor [^112czuPe]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In summary, our results show that besides its possible direct action on nicotinic receptors in white adipose tissue (WAT), nicotine modulates browning by acting centrally and modulating the sympathetic firing on white fat. Moreover, we demonstrate that an intact κ opioid receptor (KOR) in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) is critical for nicotine to exert its catabolic and browning-inducing actions. Overall, this evidence suggests that the functional dependence of nicotine on KOR may offer new possible targets for the treatment of obesity and associated comorbidities.

### Structural basis of norepinephrine recognition and transport inhibition in neurotransmitter transporters [^1121GYVQ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Norepinephrine is a biogenic amine neurotransmitter that has widespread effects on alertness, arousal, and pain sensation. Consequently, blockers of norepinephrine uptake have served as vital tools to treat depression and chronic pain. Here, we employ the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter as a surrogate for the norepinephrine transporter and determine X-ray structures of the transporter in its substrate-free and norepinephrine-bound forms. We also report structures of the transporter in complex with inhibitors of chronic pain including duloxetine, milnacipran, and a synthetic opioid, tramadol.

When compared to dopamine, we observe that norepinephrine binds in a different pose, in the vicinity of subsite C within the primary binding site. Our experiments reveal that this region is the binding site for chronic pain inhibitors and a determinant for norepinephrine-specific reuptake inhibition, thereby providing a paradigm for the design of specific inhibitors for catecholamine neurotransmitter transporters.

### What are set and setting: Reducing vagueness to improve research and clinical practice [^116gzMrp]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). High credibility.

Placebos exert their effects through various pathways. These include the activity of µ-opioid and β-adrenergic receptors, cytokines, serotonin and dopamine, and cholecystokinin, as well as (potentially overlapping) psychological effects involving expectancy and suggestibility. These effects may be modulated by the relationship between patient and provider or various medical rituals. These pathways are also utilized in pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments across several medical disciplines. Many of these treatments display profound placebo effects, including those in pain medicine, cardiology, neurology, endocrinology, immunology, and psychiatry. We do not consider these other interventions to be placebos because they are associated with placebo effects; instead, they are treatments in the relevant contexts. So, why are psychedelics an exception worth calling placebos when these other interventions are not?

Mounting evidence suggests that it is naïve to reduce psychedelic mechanisms only to those involving expectancy and suggestibility. There are psychological and neurological characteristic mechanisms through which psychedelics exert their effects without an obvious placebo role. Psychedelics have positive outcomes in placebo-controlled trials, though admittedly blinding is difficult to ensure in psychedelic trials. Preliminary evidence suggests that expectancy effects may influence selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as much, or more, than psychedelics. These findings suggest that psychedelic mechanisms indeed involve more than expectancy alone.

### Effect of opioid-free anaesthesia on post-operative period in cardiac surgery: a retrospective matched case-control study [^111i9EjT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Since the 1960s, the systematic administration of opioids has been considered one of the pillars of modern anaesthesia. The use of opioid analgesics has become widespread with the development of new opioid agents. Their use is based on their antinociceptive effects, the control of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to surgical stress, and their induced hypnotic reduction. However, the principle underlying the administration of opioids during anaesthesia has only recently been called into question. Opioids have a number of adverse effects that limit their effectiveness in perioperative care, the most relevant being respiratory depression, gastrointestinal alterations, hyperalgesia, inflammation modulation, and immunologic modulation. Moreover, the recent opioid epidemic, due in part to the persistent use of perioperative opioids, raises questions about the systematic administration of opioids during anaesthesia and the development of new non-opioid strategies.

Opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) is a long-standing concept. It is based on the fact that a sympathetic reaction evidenced by hemodynamic changes in an anesthetised patient does not systematically reflect pain. In addition, a sleeping patient will not recall pain, while hormonal stress and sympathetic and inflammatory reactions can be controlled by therapeutic classes other than opioids. There is an increasing body of literature on OFA, demonstrating its feasibility with a decrease of post-operative morphine consumption and improvement of postoperative well-being. Several OFA protocols have also been published, reflecting this emerging trend in anaesthesia.

### Safety and effectiveness of opioid-free anaesthesia in thoracoscopic surgery: a preliminary retrospective cohort study [^116188qq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Opioids have been an integral part of balanced anaesthesia because of their strong analgesic effect. They can also inhibit sympathetic nerve excitation and do not cause histamine release. Therefore, they can inhibit the stress response caused by various noxious stimuli brought about by surgery during general anaesthesia to maintain the stability of patient haemodynamics during surgery. However, with the recognition of adverse reactions to opioids and the promotion of the ERAS concept, opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) has been increasingly studied and reported, with its safety and effectiveness becoming a focus of attention. Thus, it is necessary to collect relevant data to clearly evaluate the benefit-risk ratio of OFA.

Many factors affect haemodynamic changes during surgery. Therefore, we adopted nearest neighbour matching (NNM) and included basic characteristics of the patients such as sex, age, BMI, ASA grade, presence or absence of hypertension, type of operation, and amount of intraoperative bleeding in the matching factors. After matching, there were no significant differences between the two groups in these characteristics. In a review on OFA in thoracic surgery, Tempe and Sawhney reported that an important factor contributing to successful OFA is regional anaesthesia or nerve block, such as thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA), thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB), or intercostal nerve block. TEA was once considered the gold standard for postoperative analgesia in thoracic surgery but has significant side effects, including hypotension, respiratory depression, and urinary retention; moreover, rare complications may result in permanent nerve damage.

### Alpha₂-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^1138Czbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of long-term substitution treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha₂-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications, or an alpha₂-adrenergic agonist regimen different from the experimental intervention for managing the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects, and completion of treatment.

The search methods involved consulting the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946 to November week 2, 2015), EMBASE (January 1985 to November week 2, 2015), PsycINFO (1806 to November week 2, 2015), Web of Science, and reference lists of articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha₂-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications, or placebo, or trials comparing different alpha₂-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid-dependent.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

- **Main results**: We included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 1,728 participants. Six studies compared an alpha₂-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications, and five compared different alpha₂-adrenergic agonist regimens.

### Are peripheral opioid antagonists the solution to opioid side effects [^112XzU6n]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Opioid medication is the mainstay of therapy for severe acute and chronic pain. Unfortunately, the side effects of these medications can affect patient comfort and safety, thus limiting their proven therapeutic potential. Whereas the main analgesic effects of opioids are centrally mediated, many of the common side effects are mediated via peripheral receptors. Novel peripheral opioid antagonists have been recently introduced that can block the peripheral actions of opioids without affecting centrally mediated analgesia. We review the clinical and experimental evidence of their efficacy in ameliorating opioid side effects and consider what further information might be useful in defining their role.

- **Implications**: The major analgesic effects of opioid medication are mediated within the brain and spinal cord. Many of the side effects of opioids are caused by activation of receptors outside these areas. Recently developed peripherally restricted opioid antagonists have the ability to block many opioid side effects without affecting analgesia.

### The autonomic nervous system and heart failure [^112ZRLoa]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) is characterized by hemodynamic abnormalities that result in neurohormonal activation and autonomic imbalance, with an increase in sympathetic activity and a withdrawal of vagal activity. Alterations in receptor activation due to this autonomic imbalance may profoundly affect cardiac function and structure.

Inhibition of sympathetic drive to the heart through β-receptor blockade has become a standard component of therapy for HF with a dilated left ventricle because of its effectiveness in inhibiting the ventricular structural remodeling process and prolonging life. Several devices for selective modulation of sympathetic and vagal activity have recently been developed in an attempt to alter the natural history of HF. However, the optimal counteraction of excessive sympathetic activity is still unclear. A profound decrease in adrenergic support with excessive blockade of the sympathetic nervous system may result in adverse outcomes in clinical HF.

In this review, we analyze the data supporting a contributory role of autonomic functional alterations in the course of HF. We also examine the techniques used to assess autonomic nervous system activity, the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of pharmacological and device interventions, and the potential future role of autonomic nervous system modifiers in the management of this syndrome.

### Mitigo [^117M7Eto]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

- **Severe hypotension**: MITIGO® may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope, in ambulatory patients. There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g. phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of MITIGO®. In patients with circulatory shock, MITIGO® may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of MITIGO® in patients with circulatory shock.

- **Risks of use in patients with increased intracranial pressure, brain tumors, head injury, or impaired consciousness**: In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO₂ retention (e.g. those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), MITIGO® may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO₂ retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with MITIGO®. MITIGO® should be used with extreme caution in patients with head injury or increased intracranial pressure. Pupillary changes (miosis) from morphine may obscure the existence, extent, and course of intracranial pathology. High doses of neuraxial morphine may produce significant effects.

### Opioid receptor blockade prevents exercise-associated autonomic failure in humans [^113JT4QN]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we have shown that opioid receptor blockade with naloxone during antecedent exercise can prevent the onset of exercise-associated autonomic failure (EAAF) during subsequent hypoglycemia in healthy subjects. Although the response to opioid blockade during exercise cannot be predicted in patients with type 1 diabetes — because this group has been reported to have a decreased exercise-induced release of β-endorphin — the effect of opioid receptor blockade on EAAF ought to be evaluated in individuals with type 1 diabetes since EAAF remains a significant risk for this population.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride [^113bdJcn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Buprenorphine affects the cardiovascular system by producing peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and orthostatic hypotension. Buprenorphine HCl may cause a decrease or, rarely, an increase in pulse rate and blood pressure in some patients. Thorough QT studies with buprenorphine products have demonstrated QT prolongation ≤ 15 msec.

- **Effects on the endocrine system**: Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon. Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted at the time of writing.

- **Effects on the immune system**: Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system with in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.

### Influence of a chronic beta-blocker therapy on perioperative opioid consumption - a post hoc secondary analysis [^113Lett3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

In our study, being one of the first to examine the influence of a chronic beta-blockade on perioperative opioid consumption, we could not show an association between these two. There is a need for randomized controlled trials and adequately powered prospective studies to examine this question further before any conclusions can be made.

### Modulation of remifentanil-induced postinfusion hyperalgesia by the β-blocker propranolol in humans [^114Dqwhw]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic exposure to opioids has been associated with hyperalgesia in both animals and humans. A genetic analysis of opioid-induced hyperalgesia in mice linked the β(2)-adrenergic receptor to mechanical sensitization after opioid exposure. In humans, expansion of the area of mechanical hyperalgesia surrounding an experimentally induced lesion after the cessation of remifentanil infusion is a commonly used model of opioid hyperalgesia (remifentanil-induced postinfusion hyperalgesia, RPH). The purpose of our translational study was to test the hypothesis that the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol modulates the expression of RPH in humans.

This double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed in 10 healthy human volunteers. During test sessions, intracutaneous electrical stimulation was used to generate areas of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia. The area of this sensitization was measured before, during, and after remifentanil infusion, while heat pain sensitivity was also monitored. During one test session, subjects received propranolol infusion.

We observed an average increase in the areas of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia to 141% of the baseline in subjects infused with remifentanil and placebo (P = 0.00040). However, when remifentanil infusion was combined with propranolol, the area of secondary hyperalgesia after terminating remifentanil was not significantly different than the area before beginning the opioid infusion (P = 0.13). Thermal hyperalgesia was not observed after remifentanil infusion.

### Disrupted circadian rhythms and opioid-mediated adverse effects: Bidirectional relationship and putative mechanisms [^115q4seW]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The pineal gland receives adrenergic innervation, which is vital for natural nighttime generation of melatonin. Studies have shown a diurnal variation in the expression of β‐ARs in the pineal gland. These rhythmic variations are regulated by the SCN, which stimulates NE release from pineal sympathetic afferents (from the superior cervical ganglion) during the night. NE binds to β‐ARs and increases pineal melatonin production. In the rat pineal gland, the density of β‐ARs reaches its peak either late in the light phase or at mid‐dark. Additionally, NE synchronization of rat pineal gland culture maintains the natural rhythmic release of NE, enhancing melatonin production. This NE release in the pineal gland can be strongly suppressed by light.

- **Adrenergic and opioid systems**: The α1‐, α2‐, and β‐ARs have been identified on thalamic IGL neurons, which send integrated information synchronizing circadian rhythms to the SCN and express both μ‐ and δ‐opioid receptors. Previous studies have shown that μ‐ and δ‐opioid receptor agonists increase NAT activity and thereby boost the synthesis of melatonin, which plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms and influences opioid effects. These data suggest the existence of an interplay between the adrenergic, circadian, and opioid systems. This idea is supported by an in vitro study in which activation of SCN neurons by enkephalins and morphine was inhibited or attenuated by the α2‐AR agonist clonidine.

The NE system plays a significant role in the stress response via an effect on the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis.

### Placebo analgesia and the heart [^115JHyJV]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

Placebo-activated endogenous opioids act on pain mechanisms, inducing analgesia, as well as on the respiratory centers, inducing respiratory depression. Here, we show that placebo analgesia is accompanied by reduced beta-adrenergic activity of the heart. We measured heart rate during placebo-induced expectation of analgesia, both in the clinical and laboratory settings. In the clinical setting, we found that the placebo analgesic response to an electrical noxious stimulus was accompanied by a reduced heart rate response.

In order to investigate this effect from a pharmacological viewpoint, we reproduced the same effect in the laboratory setting using experimental ischemic arm pain. We found that the opioid antagonist naloxone completely antagonized both placebo analgesia and the concomitant reduced heart rate response, whereas the beta-blocker propranolol antagonized the placebo heart rate reduction but not placebo analgesia. By contrast, both placebo responses were present during muscarinic blockade with atropine, indicating no involvement of the parasympathetic system.

To better understand the effects of naloxone and propranolol, we performed a spectral analysis of the heart rate variability for the identification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic components. We found that the beta-adrenergic low-frequency (0.15 Hz) spectral component was reduced during placebo analgesia, an effect that was reversed by naloxone. These findings indicate that placebo analgesia is accompanied by a complex cascade of events that affect the cardiovascular system.

### Sympathetic nervous system: Evaluation and importance for clinical general anesthesia [^115nBVo2]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

For more than 100 years, scientists have studied the sympathetic nervous system and its cardiovascular control mechanisms. Muscle sympathetic activity is the most important direct and rapidly responding variable for the evaluation of sympathetic neural outflow. Because of its significance in response to environmental challenges and its role in cardiovascular control, great attention has been paid to the sympathetic nervous system in both health and disease and, more recently, during general anesthesia. In fact, general anesthesia can also be considered an investigational tool to assess mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation. This review evaluates different methods for determining sympathetic nervous system activity and describes its role in human neurohumoral circulatory control. Furthermore, the effects of general anesthesia on sympathetic nervous system activity and their relevance for clinical anesthesia are discussed.

### Opioid receptor blockade prevents exercise-associated autonomic failure in humans [^1122L3Np]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Plasma insulin concentrations were similar in all studies at baseline, averaging (in pmol/L) 42.4 ± 4.2 in the N−, 57.64 ± 3.5 in the N+, and 47.9 ± 3.5 in the control studies (P = NS). Similarly, there was no significant difference in plasma insulin concentration during all clamps, averaging 357.7 ± 25 in the N−, 366 ± 23.6 in the N+, and 367.4 ± 29.9 in the control studies (P = NS).

Plasma C-peptide concentrations were comparable in all sets of studies at baseline, averaging 0.46 ± 0.1 nmol/L and during the hypoglycemic nadir, averaging 0.04 ± 0.01 nmol/L.

- **Figure 2**:
	- **Panel A**: Concentrations of plasma insulin are shown on day 2 in the N−, N+, and control studies.
	- **Panel B**: Concentrations of plasma C-peptide are shown on day 2 in the N−, N+, and control studies.

Plasma epinephrine concentrations were similar in all studies during the 5.0 and 4.4 mmol/L glucose steps (306.3 ± 60.6, 365.2 ± 46.4, and 284.4 ± 46.4 pmol/L in the N−, N+, and control studies, respectively; P = NS). Further reduction in plasma glucose to 3.3 mmol/L was associated with increments in plasma epinephrine in all studies; however, a significantly lower plasma epinephrine concentration (in pmol/L) was demonstrated in the N− studies (2,538.4 ± 256.6) compared with the N+ (3,832.2 ± 480.4) and control studies (4,192.5 ± 502.2; P < 0.01).

### Autonomic effects of epidural and intravenous fentanyl [^115pofxs]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

We tested the hypothesis that there is greater suppression of autonomic reflexes during general anaesthesia when fentanyl is administered epidurally than when it is given intravenously.

- **Methods**: Ten volunteers were anaesthetized with desflurane. Noxious stimuli of variable intensity were then delivered by tetanic electrical stimuli. Heart rate, arterial pressure, and pupillary dilation in response to these stimuli defined nociception. Seven of these volunteers participated twice using a crossover design: they received i.v. fentanyl on one study day and epidurally on the other. Autonomic responses to alternative tetanic stimuli at L4 and C5 dermatomes were measured every 5 min for 3 h after fentanyl administration.

- **Results**: After a brief redistribution period, plasma fentanyl concentrations were virtually identical on both days. After stimulation of the L4 dermatome only, block of pupillary reflex dilation was greater by 47 (22)% after epidural fentanyl compared with i.v. fentanyl. Time to maximal depression of reflex dilation after L4 stimulation was 41 (13) min. Arterial pressure and heart rate decreased after fentanyl by either route, but there were no differences observed between L4 and C5 stimulations.

- **Conclusion**: We conclude that during general anaesthesia, epidural fentanyl enhances antinociception by a spinal mechanism, which can be detected by pupillary dilation but not by changes in arterial pressure or heart rate.

### Dexmedetomidine infusion for the management of opioid-induced hyperalgesia [^1135wb2b]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Understanding the actions of opioids now encompasses pronociceptive as well as antinociceptive mechanisms. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) refers to increased pain sensitivity due to high-dose or prolonged opioid exposure. It has become more important as patients with pain remain on opioids at higher doses for longer periods. One setting that highlights the dilemma of OIH is in the opioid-tolerant patient who is hospitalized for painful medical conditions or procedures and is unable to achieve adequate analgesia despite escalating opioid doses. This patient population often requires agents that act synergistically with opioids through different mechanisms to achieve analgesia. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has been shown to synergize with opioids.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care hospital.
- **Design**: Case series.
- **Method**: Eleven hospitalized patients with OIH received dexmedetomidine to improve pain control and to lower opioid doses while avoiding opioid withdrawal.
- **Results**: A total of 64% (7/11) had substantial reductions in their baseline opioid doses at the time of discharge.
- **Conclusions**: The cases presented provide support for the clinical utility of alpha-2 agonists during opioid dose reduction in patients with OIH, as well suggesting that they may contribute to the recovery of normal nociceptive and antinociceptive responses.

### Lazanda [^113xSnWr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Fentanyl is an opioid agonist whose principal therapeutic action is analgesia.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
	- **Effects on the central nervous system**: Fentanyl produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Fentanyl causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic; for instance, pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

	- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Fentanyl causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed, and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may increase to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

	- **Effects on the cardiovascular system**: Fentanyl produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.

### How the complex pharmacology of the fentanyls contributes to their lethality [^1156aTQM]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Fentanyls are relatively selective and potent agonists at mu-opioid receptors (MORs), with fentanyl and carfentanil being, respectively, approximately 50 and about 10,000 times more potent than morphine. Such high potency means that only small amounts of the drug are required to produce respiratory depression, and thus even a minor error could result in too much being taken. Fentanyls are highly lipid-soluble molecules and readily penetrate into the brain, resulting in overdose levels being reached rapidly.

Deaths in heroin overdose may take more than 30 minutes to occur after injection, providing a window of opportunity for intervention with the administration of the antagonist naloxone. In contrast, fentanyl overdose deaths can occur very quickly, within 5 minutes, potentially before remedial action can be taken.

In recent years, there has been enormous interest within the pharmacological community in the phenomenon of biased agonism, whereby agonists acting at the same receptor may activate one downstream signalling pathway more strongly over another. Activation of MOR results in downstream signalling through either G protein or arrestin pathways. It has been claimed that respiratory depression results from opioid signalling through arrestins and that fentanyl is arrestin-biased, thus explaining its greater ability to depress respiration than heroin.

The view that respiratory depression by opioids is mediated by arrestin signalling and that fentanyl is arrestin-biased is, however, highly contentious. We did not find fentanyl to be arrestin-biased in our extensive analysis of bias at MOR.

### Does the β-receptor antagonist esmolol have analgesic effects? A randomised placebo-controlled cross-over study on healthy volunteers undergoing the cold pressor test [^116xCebe]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Esmolol may attenuate the sympathetic response to pain and reduce postoperative opioid consumption. It is not clear whether esmolol has an analgesic effect per se.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of esmolol in the absence of anaesthetics and opioids. We tested the hypothesis that esmolol would reduce the maximum pain intensity perceived during the cold pressor test (CPT) by 2 points on a 0 to 10 numeric pain rating scale (NRS) compared to placebo.

- **Design**: Randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over study.

- **Setting**: Postoperative recovery area, Örebro University Hospital. Study period: November 2013 to February 2014.

- **Participants**: Fourteen healthy volunteers. Exclusion criteria included ongoing medication, pregnancy and breastfeeding, and participation in other medical trials.

- **Interventions**: At separate study sessions, participants received interventions: esmolol (0.7 mg/kg bolus over 1 min followed by infusion at 10 μg/kg/min); 0.9% normal saline bolus then remifentanil infusion at 0.2 μg/kg/min, and 0.9% normal saline bolus and infusion according to a random sequence. All infusions were administered over 30 min.

- **Main outcome measures**: Perceived maximum pain intensity score, pain tolerance, haemodynamic changes during CPT, and occurrence of side effects to interventions compared to placebo.

- **Results**: Esmolol did not reduce perceived pain intensity or pain tolerance during the CPT. The NRS-max score was similar for esmolol, 8.5 (± 1.4), and placebo, 8.4 (± 1.3). The mean difference was 0.1 [95% confidence interval]…

### Hypothalamic kappa opioid receptor mediates both diet-induced and melanin concentrating hormone-induced liver damage through inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress [^1112Nvrj]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Anatomical studies have shown that the sympathetic and parasympathetic connections to the liver originate from different brain regions within the hypothalamus and the brainstem. Within the hypothalamus, the paraventricular, arcuate, and suprachiasmatic nuclei, as well as the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), project and modulate liver metabolism.

Extensive research has suggested that the central opioid system is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Agonists and antagonists of the three main classes of opioid receptors (mu, kappa, and delta) increase and decrease food consumption, respectively, when injected into various brain areas. Studies in mice specifically lacking each of the opioid receptors have demonstrated their resistance to diet‐induced obesity and, importantly, suggested that opioid receptors may regulate energy metabolism in peripheral tissues. For instance, mice lacking the mu opioid receptor showed increased expression of key mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation within skeletal muscle. Mice lacking the delta opioid receptor showed activation in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Finally, mice lacking the kappa opioid receptor (κOR) had reduced hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels and increased lipid oxidation in fat and liver.

### Peripherally-acting opioids [^113o4W3A]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Opioids are broad-spectrum analgesics with potent pain-relieving qualities, but they also come with potential adverse effects related to both short-term and long-term therapies. Researchers have attempted to alter existing opioid analgesics, utilize different routes and formulations, or combine opioid analgesics with other compounds in efforts to improve analgesia while minimizing adverse effects. Exogenous opioids are administered to achieve analgesia by mimicking the actions of endogenous opioids.

Endogenous opioids and their receptors are located in the brain (supraspinal areas), spinal cord, and periphery. Although opioids and opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord have received much attention over many years, peripheral endogenous opioid analgesic systems have only been extensively studied during the past decade. It has been known since 1990 that following injection into the rodent hindpaw, D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol-enkephalin (DAMGO), a mu-opioid receptor agonist, probably exerts its antinociceptive effects locally since the doses administered are too low to have an effect in the central nervous system (CNS). This notion has been supported by the observation that the quaternary compound morphine methyliodide, which does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the CNS, produced antinociception following intradermal administration into the hindpaw, but not when the same dose was administered systemically (subcutaneously at a distant site).

With a growing appreciation of peripheral endogenous opioids and peripheral endogenous opioid receptors, researchers continue to explore these elements in pain management strategies.

### Sympathetic overactivity in dialysis patients-underappreciated and clinically consequential [^116nyYty]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain frustratingly common in dialysis patients. A dearth of established evidence-based treatments calls for alternative therapeutic avenues to be embraced. Sympathetic hyperactivity, predominantly due to afferent nerve signaling from the diseased native kidneys, has been established as prognostic in the dialysis population for over 15 years. Despite this, tangible therapeutic interventions have, at the time of writing, been unsuccessful, and the outlook for patients remains poor. This narrative review summarizes established experimental and clinical data, highlighting recent developments, and proposes why interventions to ameliorate sympathetic hyperactivity may well be beneficial for this high-risk population.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115oZ5dY]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically concerning alpha-adrenergic agonists, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of α-2 adrenergic agonists, such as lofexidine or clonidine, for the management of opioid withdrawal. However, the guidelines recognize that methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, retaining patients in withdrawal management, and supporting the completion of withdrawal management.

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^112YMvjt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naloxone hydrochloride injection is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of opioid depression, including respiratory depression, induced by natural and synthetic opioids, such as propoxyphene, methadone, and certain mixed agonist-antagonist analgesics: nalbuphine, pentazocine, butorphanol, and cyclazocine. Naloxone hydrochloride is also indicated for the diagnosis of suspected or known acute opioid overdosage.

Naloxone hydrochloride injection may be useful as an adjunctive agent to increase blood pressure in the management of septic shock (see clinical pharmacology; adjunctive use in septic shock).

### Alpha2-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal [^114vX3iC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Withdrawal is a necessary step prior to drug-free treatment or as the endpoint of long-term substitution treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications, or with a comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists for the management of the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included the intensity of signs and symptoms, overall withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects, and completion of treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 7, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 4, 2013), EMBASE (January 1985 to August week 1, 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to July week 5, 2013), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications, or placebo, or comparing different alpha2-adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid-dependent.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One review author assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. All review authors decided on inclusion and confirmed the overall process.

- **Main results**: We included 25 randomised controlled trials, involving 1,668 participants. Five studies compared a treatment regimen based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist.

### Assessing the clinical advantage of opioid-reduced anesthesia in thoracoscopic sympathectomy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^111oK4sj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

Opioids have played a crucial role in surgical procedures for many years owing to their strong analgesic effects; however, their use can lead to adverse reactions such as dose-dependent inhibition of respiratory and circulatory function, scratching, nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness. In the last few decades, anesthesiologists have attempted to minimize opioid consumption to reduce surgical complications. Opioid-reduced anesthesia is a technique based on perioperative multimodal pain management that uses few or no opioid drugs. It involves using various drugs to minimize the use of opioids and reduce their side effects. These drugs include sedatives, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, anti-inflammatory drugs, α2 receptor agonists, and local anesthetics. Additionally, intrathecal anesthesia (including spinal and epidural) or peripheral nerve block may be used to replace opioids partially or completely.

With the continuous promotion of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), a combination of opioid receptor excitement-antagonists (such as dezocine and butorphanol), α2-adrenal agonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or nerve block techniques has been used to achieve multi-mode anesthesia. This approach has proven to be safe and effective.

Thoracoscopic sympathectomy is an important treatment for palmar hyperhidrosis, offering precise results, minimal trauma, and rapid postoperative recovery. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of opioid-reduced anesthesia for this procedure by investigating the clinical effects of a dezocine.

### Diprivan [^11398ibc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In addition, lower heart rates are observed during maintenance with Diprivan, possibly due to the reduction of sympathetic activity and/or resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes. Therefore, anticholinergic agents should be administered when increases in vagal tone are anticipated.

As with other anesthetic agents, Diprivan reduces myocardial oxygen consumption. Further studies are needed to confirm and delineate the extent of these effects on the myocardium and the coronary vascular system.

Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary Diprivan maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. The rate of Diprivan administration should be determined based on the patient's premedication and adjusted according to clinical responses.

A rapid bolus induction should be avoided. A slow rate of approximately 20 mg every 10 seconds until induction onset (0.5 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg) should be used. To ensure adequate anesthesia when Diprivan is used as the primary agent, maintenance infusion rates should not be less than 100 mcg/kg/min and should be supplemented with analgesic levels of continuous opioid administration. When an opioid is used as the primary agent, Diprivan maintenance rates should not be less than 50 mcg/kg/min, and care should be taken to ensure amnesia. Higher doses of Diprivan will reduce the opioid requirements. When Diprivan is used as the primary anesthetic, it should not be administered with the high-dose…

### Molecular biology of opioid analgesia [^111KoUrd]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Opioids provide excellent pain relief in most patients, yet the responses of patients to individual opioids can vary markedly, even among the mu opioids. Understanding this variability would greatly enhance our ability to treat patients appropriately. Classical pharmacological studies have long implied the existence of multiple subtypes of mu opioid receptors. More recently, a number of variants of the cloned mu opioid receptor have been described. These variants all show the same selectivity for mu opioids, confirming their classification as mu opioid receptors. However, they differ in their functional activation by opioids as well as in their localization within cells and regions in the brain. These multiple mu opioid receptors may help explain the range of responses seen clinically among patients for the various opioid drugs.

### Lucemyra [^114QxsGp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Lofexidine is a central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that binds to receptors on adrenergic neurons. This action reduces the release of norepinephrine and decreases sympathetic tone.

- **Pharmacodynamics**:

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: Single Lucemyra doses of 1.44 mg to 1.8 mg produced a maximum mean change from baseline in QTcF (ΔQTcF) of 14.4 msec (upper two-sided 90% CI: 22.3 msec) and 13.6 msec (17.4 msec) for 1.44 mg and 1.8 mg, respectively, in healthy normal volunteers. In a Phase 3 placebo-controlled, dose-response study in opioid-dependent subjects, Lucemyra was associated with a maximum mean prolongation of the QTcF interval by 7.3 (8.8) msec and 9.3 (10.9) msec at doses of 2.16 mg/day and 2.88 mg/day, respectively.

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Administration of Lucemyra to subjects with hepatic impairment was associated with prolongation of the QTc interval, which was more pronounced in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.

- **Patients with renal impairment**: Administration of Lucemyra to subjects with renal impairment was associated with prolongation of the QTc interval, which was more pronounced in subjects with severe renal impairment.

- **Lucemyra coadministered with methadone**: Lucemyra (2.88 mg/day) coadministered with methadone in 18 methadone-maintained patients (80 to 120 mg/day) resulted in a maximum mean increase from methadone-alone baseline in QTcF of 9.1 (14.2) msec.

- **Lucemyra coadministered with buprenorphine**: Lucemyra (2.88 mg/day) coadministered with buprenorphine…

### Vasodilation from sufentanil in humans [^117EdUP8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Sufentanil is a potent opioid that occasionally has been associated with hypotension. The mechanism behind this hypotension is unclear. We hypothesized that sufentanil had a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle to cause vasodilation. Sufentanil was infused into the brachial artery of 10 young, healthy volunteers at rates of 0.083, 0.167, 0.333, and 0.833 μg/min. Forearm blood flow was measured in both the experimental and control arms using venous occlusion plethysmography.

The forearm blood flow in the infused arm increased in a dose-dependent fashion from 3.2 to 5.2 mL/min per 100 mL of tissue, whereas simultaneous measurements in the control (non-infused) arm did not increase. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were unchanged during the infusions. Furthermore, respiratory rate did not change at any infusion level, and sedation did not occur. Thus, the data support that significant systemic "spillover" of sufentanil did not occur. We conclude that sufentanil has a direct, vasodilatory effect on human vascular tissue that is likely independent of a neurogenic or systemic mechanism.

### The role of the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system on pain before and after third molar extraction - an observational cohort study [^1146eaXE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

The estimated number needed to treat (NNT) for each drug dose or combination has been taken from the literature where the comparison was done versus placebo in dental surgery (see references in the Methods section). Comparison with an analgesic drug score has been made by recalculating the absolute risk reduction (ARR = 1/NNT) on the following basis: 0 if no treatment given; 0.5 for poor analgesia (ARR = 5); 1 for average analgesia (ARR 20–30%, NNT 3.33–5); 2 for good analgesia (ARR 30–50%, NNT 2–3.33); 3 for very good analgesia (ARR > 50%, NNT < 2); 4 when the three analgesic drug families (acetaminophen + NSAID + opiate) were administered.

### Multimodal general anesthesia: Theory and practice [^117Ef2ch]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Opioids play a significant role as antinociceptive agents by interacting with various opioid receptors located in the periaqueductal gray, spinal cord, amygdala, rostral ventral medulla, and cortex.

- **Mechanisms of opioid-induced antinociception**: Opioids bind to receptors in the brainstem and spinal cord, disrupting nociceptive circuit transmission. This occurs through decreased conductance of voltage-gated calcium channels and activation of inward-rectifying potassium channels.

- **Decreased arousal effects**: Opioids block cholinergic arousal projections from the brainstem to the thalamus and cortex. The pharmacological effects include excitatory and inhibitory actions, denoted by various symbols.

Activation of opioid receptors results in two main effects on nociceptive information transmission: blocking afferent nociceptive inputs into the spinal cord and enhancing descending inhibition starting at the periaqueductal gray. Descending projections from the periaqueductal gray to the spinal cord involve synapses in the rostral ventral medulla.

The key abbreviations used in discussing these mechanisms include ACh (acetylcholine), DRG (dorsal root ganglia), Glu (glutamate), LDT (laterodorsal tegmental area), mPRF (medial pontine reticular formation), NE (norepinephrine), PAF (peripheral afferent fiber), PAG (periaqueductal gray), PN (projection neuron), PPT (pedunculopontine tegmental area), and RVM (rostral ventral medulla).

### Opioid receptor blockade prevents exercise-associated autonomic failure in humans [^1153djSn]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia and exercise both induce the release of β-endorphin, which plays an important role in the modulation of the autonomic response during subsequent events. Because opioid receptor (OR) blockade during antecedent hypoglycemia has been shown to prevent hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, we hypothesized that OR blockade during exercise would prevent exercise-associated autonomic failure (EAAF).

We studied 8 healthy subjects on 2 consecutive days, each of whom participated in three different studies in random order. The protocol on day 1 involved one of the following:

- **Control**: Two 90-minute hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps plus naloxone infusion.
- **N+ condition**: Two 90-minute hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with exercise at 60% VO2max, plus naloxone infusion.
- **N- condition**: Same protocol as in the N+ group, but with saline infusion only.

On day 2, all subjects were studied with stepped hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamps, using hormone concentrations and glucose turnover as indicators of hypoglycemia counterregulation. Compared to control, N- studies resulted in significantly blunted epinephrine and norepinephrine responses to subsequent hypoglycemia. Conversely, the N+ group exhibited unimpaired hypoglycemia counterregulation, characterized by appropriate increases in epinephrine, norepinephrine, and endogenous glucose production.

Thus, opioid receptor blockade with naloxone during antecedent exercise prevents the development of acute EAAF by improving the catecholamine responses and by restoring endogenous glucose production.

### Effects of opioids administered via intravenous or epidural patient-controlled analgesia after caesarean section: A network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1118QkMx]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Opioid receptors are abundant in the central nervous system, including the periaqueductal grey, rostral ventral medulla, and the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn. Activation of the opioid receptors at the periaqueductal grey increases the neuronal signal through the nucleus raphe magnus, which in turn stimulates 5-hydroxytryptamine and enkephalin-containing neurons that connect with the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn. This leads to the activation of the descending inhibition pathway, modulates nociceptive transmission, and reduces pain sensation. In addition, local spinal mechanisms also contribute to the analgesic effects of opioids. Fentanyl administered epidurally as a bolus acts through a local spinal mechanism. Activation of the opioid receptors at the substantia gelatinosa inhibits the release of glutamate and substance P from the primary afferent neuron and therefore reduces pain transmission.

Common opioid-induced adverse effects include, but are not limited to: nausea and vomiting, pruritus, sedation, and respiratory depression. The mechanisms underlying opioid-induced nausea and vomiting include direct stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone, increased vestibular sensitivity, and delayed gastric emptying. Systemic and neuraxial opioid-induced pruritus may be mediated by several complex mechanisms involving both peripheral and central pathways. Compelling evidence suggests that neuraxial opioid-induced pruritus may be mediated by a spinal mechanism that involves neuronal disinhibition. Opioids cause respiratory depression by direct action on the brain.

### Buprenorphine [^11422pAg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Buprenorphine in intravenous (IV) doses of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg, as well as sublingual doses of 12 mg, has been administered to opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for the treatment of opioid dependence. Compared to placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O2 saturation, or skin temperature over time. Systolic blood pressure was higher in the 8 mg group than the placebo group (3-hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to a low voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were observed.

The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs decreased O2 saturation to the same degree.

- **Effects on the endocrine system**: Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. They also stimulate prolactin and growth hormone (GH) secretion.

### Methadose [^116q3MNi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Methadone hydrochloride is a mu-agonist and a synthetic opioid analgesic exhibiting multiple actions similar to those of morphine. The most prominent actions affect the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. Methadone's principal therapeutic uses are analgesia and detoxification or maintenance treatment in opioid addiction. While the methadone abstinence syndrome is qualitatively similar to that of morphine, it is characterized by a slower onset, more prolonged course, and less severe symptoms.

Some data indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, although the contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone's efficacy remains unknown.

- **Pharmacodynamics: Effects on the central nervous system**: Methadone causes respiratory depression by directly acting on brain stem respiratory centers, resulting in reduced responsiveness to increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Methadone also induces miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils may indicate opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic, as pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings. In overdose situations, marked mydriasis may occur due to hypoxia. Some NMDA receptor antagonists have shown neurotoxic effects in animals.

- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Methadone causes a reduction in motility associated with the gastrointestinal tract and smooth muscle, which can affect various bodily functions.

### Effects of continuous remifentanil administration on intra-operative subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension [^111aoweu]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Surgical stress response markedly increases sympathetic nerve activity and catecholamine concentrations. This may contribute to peripheral vasoconstriction, reduced wound perfusion, and subsequent tissue hypoxia. Opioids are known to depress the hypothalamic-adrenal response to surgery in a dose-dependent manner. We tested the hypothesis that continuous remifentanil administration produces improved subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension compared to fentanyl bolus administration.

Forty-six patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were randomly assigned to receive either fentanyl bolus administration or continuous remifentanil infusion. Mean subcutaneous tissue oxygen values over the entire intra-operative period were significantly higher in the remifentanil group compared to the fentanyl group: 8 (2) kPa vs 6.7 (1.5) kPa, % CI difference: -2.3 kPa to -0.3 kPa, p = 0.013. Continuous intra-operative opioid administration may blunt vasoconstriction caused by surgical stress and adrenergic responses more than an equi-effective anaesthetic regimen based on smaller-dose bolus opioid administration.

### Local analgesia of electroacupuncture is mediated by the recruitment of neutrophils and released β-endorphins [^112uqxp1]. Pain (2023). Low credibility.

In this study, we found that the activation of the sympathetic nerve was involved in the local analgesic effect mediated by EA, and chemical sympathectomy completely abolished intrinsic opioid analgesia. The sympathetic nervous system stimulated adrenergic receptors on inflammatory cells by producing NE and releasing β-END into peripheral inflamed tissue. In addition, the NE secreted by sympathetic nerves regulates immunological response primarily by β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-AR) expressed on lymphocytes. Although most studies suggest that β2-AR agonists have immunosuppressive effects, several studies suggest that β2-AR activation on immune cells can enhance inflammation by MAPK signaling pathways.

The enhanced expression of endothelial cell ICAM-1 and the subcutaneous recruitment of opioid peptide–containing neutrophils and monocytes during painful paw inflammation have been demonstrated to be caused by sympathetic fibers. The use of β-blockers decreases the expression of chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and peripheral blood leukocytes infiltration into the site of damage. By acting on β-ARs expressed on nonhematopoietic cells, the sympathetic nerve has been demonstrated to generate circadian changes in the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules and chemokines and to regulate rhythmic recruitment of leukocytes to the inflammatory site. Some researchers have observed that the activation of β2-AR inhibited antigen-primed T cells egress from LNs by interactions with CCR7 and CXCR4. The effect of SNS on cell migration may provide insight into the endogenous opioid analgesic mechanisms.

### Neurotransmitter receptor densities are associated with changes in regional cerebral blood flow during clinical ongoing pain [^114RZJru]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Low credibility.

We suggest that future studies should take into account these considerations and previous evidence, particularly utilizing PET/fMRI to shed further light on the opioid–dopamine system, which has been shown to play an important role in endogenous analgesia and placebo effects (Shih et al.). Specifically, as most striatal neurons express both opioid and dopamine D2/D3 receptors, it is thought that dopamine produces analgesic effects via interactions with endogenous opioids in midbrain areas (Bannister & Dickenson). A recent study exploiting 7 T fMRI has shown evidence that placebo is likely mediated by the lateral PAG, an area that produces a non-opiate mediated analgesia upon stimulation (Crawford et al.).

Generally, PAG, an essential element of the descending pain modulatory system (DaSilva et al.), has a dense concentration of mu-opioid receptors but also contains a subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons that, if ablated or antagonized, attenuate the antinociceptive effects of systemic morphine. On the other hand, dopamine receptor agonists and dopamine transport inhibitors enhance the antinociceptive effects of opioids (Bannister et al.).

Other analgesics (e.g. gabapentinoids), used in combination with those having a direct effect on the monoaminergic system, have been reported to alleviate certain types of chronic pain (Bravo et al; Woolf). Therefore, combined therapies that modulate multiple neurotransmitter systems may offer stronger therapeutic benefits than those of systemic analgesics.

### Opioid overdose: Limitations in naloxone reversal of respiratory depression and prevention of cardiac arrest [^115QUarr]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Opioids are effective analgesics, but they can have harmful adverse effects, such as addiction and potentially fatal respiratory depression. Naloxone is currently the only available treatment for reversing the negative effects of opioids, including respiratory depression. However, the effectiveness of naloxone, particularly after an opioid overdose, varies depending on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of the opioid that was overdosed. Long-acting opioids and those with a high affinity at the µ-opioid receptor and/or slow receptor dissociation kinetics are particularly resistant to the effects of naloxone. In this review, the authors examine the pharmacology of naloxone and its safety and limitations in reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression under different circumstances, including its ability to prevent cardiac arrest.

### Dexmedetomidine as a novel countermeasure for cocaine-induced central sympathoexcitation in cocaine-addicted humans [^11513J1e]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Cocaine-induced acute hypertension is largely mediated by increased central sympathetic nerve activity. We hypothesized that dexmedetomidine, a central sympatholytic, could reverse cocaine-induced increases in sympathetic nerve activity, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) in cocaine-addicted subjects.

First, we conducted a dose-finding study with 15 nontreatment-seeking cocaine-addicted subjects and 12 cocaine-naive healthy controls to determine the doses of intravenous dexmedetomidine that lower MAP and HR without an acute cocaine challenge. We subsequently conducted a placebo-controlled treatment trial with 26 cocaine-addicted subjects to establish whether dexmedetomidine reverses MAP and HR increases following intranasal cocaine (3 mg/kg). Skin sympathetic nerve activity (measured in the second protocol) and skin vascular resistance (measured in both protocols) served as indices of cocaine-sensitive central sympathoexcitation.

Dexmedetomidine, in doses up to 0.6 µg/kg IV, caused comparable dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure in both cases and controls; however, a 1.0 µg/kg dose was required to lower HR. In cocaine-addicted subjects, low-dose dexmedetomidine (0.4 µg/kg; n = 14) effectively abolished cocaine-induced increases in skin sympathetic nerve activity (156 ± 26% versus -15 ± 22%, cocaine/placebo versus cocaine/dexmedetomidine; P < 0.05), skin vascular resistance (+10 ± 2 versus -2 ± 3 U; P < 0.05), and MAP (+6 ± 1 versus -5 ± 2 mm Hg; P < 0.01) without significantly affecting HR (+13 ± 2 versus +9 ± 2 bpm; P = ns).

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^113Y4nfv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naloxone hydrochloride plays a crucial role in the complete or partial reversal of opioid depression. It effectively prevents or reverses the effects of opioids, including respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. Additionally, naloxone hydrochloride can reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects caused by agonist-antagonists like pentazocine.

Naloxone hydrochloride is essentially a pure opioid antagonist, meaning it lacks the "agonistic" or morphine-like properties typical of other opioid antagonists. When administered in usual doses without the presence of opioids or agonistic effects from other opioid antagonists, it displays essentially no pharmacologic activity.

Importantly, naloxone hydrochloride does not lead to tolerance or cause physical or psychological dependence. In situations involving physical dependence on opioids, naloxone hydrochloride will induce withdrawal symptoms. Opiate withdrawal symptoms may appear within minutes of naloxone hydrochloride administration and typically subside in about two hours. The severity and duration of the withdrawal syndrome depend on the naloxone hydrochloride dose and the degree and type of opioid dependence.

- **Mechanism of action**: While the mechanism of action of naloxone hydrochloride is not fully understood, in vitro evidence suggests that it works by antagonizing opioid effects. This is achieved by competing for the mu, kappa, and sigma opiate receptor sites in the central nervous system (CNS), with the greatest affinity for the mu receptor.

When administered intravenously (I.V.), the onset of action for naloxone hydrochloride is generally rapid.
