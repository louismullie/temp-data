## Question

Physical exam findings in overactive bladder women

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the physical examination findings in women with overactive bladder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that OAB is a symptom syndrome with no pathognomonic exam findings. Then, I should verify which physical findings are most common and clinically relevant, including pelvic organ prolapse, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and pelvic floor dysfunction. Next, I will consider functional and mobility assessments that influence toileting and care. After that, I need to check for red flags that warrant further evaluation. Finally, I will integrate how these findings shape management and when to escalate testing, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: there are no physical exam findings that are specific or diagnostic for idiopathic OAB, so the exam's role is to identify contributors and exclude mimics rather than to confirm OAB itself, which is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion based on symptoms and urinalysis [^41601494] [^7be99083].

> Wait, let me verify the most prevalent and impactful finding: pelvic organ prolapse is commonly observed in women with OAB symptoms and may coexist or contribute via outlet obstruction and altered bladder mechanics. Importantly, OAB symptoms can improve after prolapse repair, though not universally, so I should document POP using POP-Q when present and consider its management in shared decision-making [^41601494] [^3f751295] [^8592c1df].

> I need to check for genitourinary syndrome of menopause next, because atrophic vaginitis, pale thin mucosa, loss of rugae, and urethral changes can mimic or amplify urgency and frequency. Recognizing GSM on exam supports a trial of topical vaginal estrogen, which can improve urinary symptoms in appropriately selected patients [^41601494] [^163079c8].

> Hold on, I should verify pelvic floor findings that change management: assess pelvic floor muscle tone and the patient's ability to perform a voluntary pelvic floor contraction, since hypertonicity or poor recruitment can drive urgency and frequency and may respond to pelvic floor physical therapy. Tenderness or myofascial trigger points may correlate with symptom bother, particularly in OAB-dry phenotypes, so I should palpate for tenderness and document function [^41601494] [^b68a98d6].

> Next, I should review functional and mobility assessments that indirectly shape OAB care: observe gait and transfers, and consider the Timed Up and Go test, where TUG greater than 12 seconds signals fall risk and toileting impairment. This informs behavioral strategies, bathroom access, and the need for assistive devices or caregiver support [^41601494].

> I will now examine the abdominal exam briefly: look for suprapubic distension suggesting retention, scars or masses that might indicate prior surgery or pathology, and consider a focused neurologic assessment of perineal sensation and anal sphincter tone if neurogenic etiologies are suspected, since these findings redirect evaluation toward retention or neurogenic LUTD rather than idiopathic OAB [^41601494] [^860ae0f3].

> But wait, what if I see skin changes or excoriations? Perineal skin irritation, rash, or excoriation suggests chronic moisture exposure from incontinence and should prompt counseling on skin care, barrier methods, and expedited treatment of leakage, while also reinforcing the need to assess for concomitant stress incontinence and prolapse [^41601494].

> I should double-check red flags that mandate further evaluation: hematuria, recurrent UTIs, severe or new pelvic pain, markedly elevated post-void residual, new neurologic symptoms, or prior pelvic cancer or radiation should trigger targeted testing such as cystoscopy, upper tract imaging, or urodynamics rather than empiric OAB therapy, because these findings indicate alternative or complicated pathology [^c445bc5a] [^3d0a9c19].

> Let me consider how these findings change management: documenting prolapse may shift therapy toward addressing outlet anatomy, recognizing GSM supports a trial of topical estrogen, and identifying pelvic floor dysfunction guides referral for PFMT. Conversely, a normal exam supports proceeding with first-line behavioral and pharmacologic therapy while using diaries and questionnaires to track response, aligning with guideline-based care [^41601494] [^8ed8cfc4] [^28c413f8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a high post-void residual might be a routine exam finding, but I should correct that: PVR is not a physical exam maneuver. It is a measurement obtained by ultrasound or catheterization, and I should reserve it for patients with voiding symptoms, risk factors for retention, or when response to therapy is suboptimal, rather than routinely in all OAB patients [^aa1d6691] [^ecdce529].

> In summary, I need to ensure my documentation captures the absence of OAB-specific signs and the presence of contributory findings such as POP, GSM, pelvic floor dysfunction, and functional limitations, because these shape prognosis and therapy selection. This approach remains consistent with contemporary AUA/SUFU and EAU guidance emphasizing a focused, contributor-oriented exam within a symptom-based diagnostic framework [^41601494] [^5a4391d9].

In women with overactive bladder (OAB), the physical examination is typically **normal** [^41601494], but it is essential to identify **contributing or alternative conditions** [^7be99083]. Key findings include:

- **Pelvic organ prolapse (POP)**: Common and may coexist with OAB; assess using POP-Q [^8592c1df] [^3f751295].
- **Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)**: Atrophic vaginitis, urethral caruncle, or prolapse may mimic or worsen OAB symptoms [^163079c8].
- **Pelvic floor dysfunction**: Hypertonicity or poor coordination can contribute to urgency and frequency [^b68a98d6].
- **Stress urinary incontinence (SUI)**: Often coexists with OAB and should be distinguished on exam [^e5d8d8a8].
- **Post-void residual (PVR)**: Not a physical finding, but should be measured if retention is suspected [^aa1d6691] [^ecdce529].

The exam should also assess for **neurologic deficits**, **mobility impairment**, and **abdominal masses** that could explain or complicate symptoms [^860ae0f3] [^41601494]. No **pathognomonic** physical findings confirm OAB; the exam's role is to exclude other causes and guide management [^41601494].

---

## Common physical examination findings

### Pelvic organ prolapse (POP)

Pelvic organ prolapse is **common in women with OAB** and may coexist or contribute to symptoms [^3f751295]. The AUA/SUFU guideline recommends documenting POP using the Pelvic Organ Quantification (POP-Q) system [^8592c1df] because it can influence treatment decisions and may improve after prolapse repair [^3f751295].

---

### Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)

GSM, previously called atrophic vaginitis, is common in postmenopausal women and can cause irritative urinary symptoms that overlap with OAB [^163079c8]. On examination, look for:

- Pale, dry, friable vaginal mucosa
- Loss of rugae
- Urethral caruncle or prolapse
- Decreased pelvic floor muscle tone

Recognizing GSM is important because **topical vaginal estrogen** can improve urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence [^163079c8].

---

### Pelvic floor dysfunction

Pelvic floor muscle hypertonicity or poor coordination can contribute to OAB symptoms [^b68a98d6]. Assessing the **ability to contract and relax** the pelvic floor muscles is essential, as this may impact treatment and referral for pelvic floor muscle training [^41601494].

---

### Stress urinary incontinence (SUI)

SUI often coexists with OAB, and distinguishing between them is important for management [^e5d8d8a8]. On examination, **cough stress testing** can help identify SUI, particularly when prolapse is present [^8592c1df].

---

### Post-void residual (PVR) volume

Although not a physical finding, measuring PVR is recommended in women with OAB symptoms — especially with voiding difficulty or retention risk — to exclude incomplete emptying or urinary retention [^aa1d6691] [^ecdce529].

---

## Less common but significant findings

- **Neurologic deficits**: Lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, or abnormal reflexes may suggest neurogenic bladder dysfunction [^notfound].
- **Mobility impairment**: Difficulty with gait or transfers can contribute to functional incontinence and should be documented [^41601494].
- **Abdominal masses or scars**: May indicate underlying pathology contributing to urinary symptoms [^860ae0f3].

---

## Physical examination findings and their clinical implications

| **Finding** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|
| Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) | - Common in OAB <br/> - May improve after prolapse repair <br/> - Document with POP-Q [^8592c1df] [^3f751295] |
| Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) | - Overlaps with OAB symptoms <br/> - Topical estrogen may help [^163079c8] |
| Pelvic floor dysfunction | - May contribute to OAB <br/> - Pelvic floor muscle training may be beneficial [^b68a98d6] |
| Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) | - Often coexists with OAB <br/> - Important to distinguish for management [^e5d8d8a8] |
| Elevated post-void residual (PVR) | - Suggests incomplete emptying or retention <br/> - May alter treatment approach [^aa1d6691] [^ecdce529] |

---

## Limitations of physical examination in OAB

- **No pathognomonic findings**: There are no specific physical findings that confirm OAB; diagnosis is symptom-based and exclusionary [^41601494].
- **Overlap with other conditions**: Symptoms of OAB can overlap with other conditions, such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, urinary tract infection, and neurogenic bladder dysfunction [^4cdaa3b5].
- **Subjectivity**: Patient-reported symptoms and bother significantly guide diagnosis and management, as physical findings may be minimal or absent [^8ed8cfc4].

---

## Conclusion

In women with OAB, the physical examination is often normal but plays a critical role in identifying **contributing or alternative conditions** such as pelvic organ prolapse, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, pelvic floor dysfunction, and stress urinary incontinence. These findings guide **individualized management** and may significantly impact treatment outcomes [^41601494].

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^41601494]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline—physical examination in idiopathic overactive bladder states there are no findings specific to OAB; therefore, a directed physical exam should assess for anatomic factors and/or concomitant conditions that may contribute to OAB symptoms, and the genitourinary exam can identify signs of estrogen loss, pelvic organ prolapse (POP), stress urinary incontinence (SUI), and sequelae such as skin rash, excoriation, or ulceration. The ability of all patients to contract pelvic floor muscles should be documented as this may impact treatment and referral for pelvic floor muscle training. Observation of gait and transfers may help identify mobility impairments that can impact symptoms like UUI. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test measures transfer and walking to and from a point 10 feet away, and a time of >12 seconds is associated with an increased risk of falls and may offer an objective measure of impaired mobility sufficient to impact toileting.

### Overactive bladder: clinical updates in women's health care primary and preventive care review [^dbbc6679]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a condition that involves urinary urgency, usually accompanied by increased daytime frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. This condition is multifactorial, and several theories exist that explain the pathophysiologic process underlying the condition. Because the prevalence of the condition is high among women across all age groups, obstetrician-gynecologists will encounter women with OAB syndrome and should be able to evaluate and treat this condition. The appropriate management often is based on the degree of bother and severity of symptoms in an individual patient. This monograph will delineate the general characteristics of OAB syndrome from its epidemiology to potential causes and provide a detailed discussion of the evaluation of the patient with various diagnostic modalities and the range of available treatment options.

### Urinary urgency and frequency: what should a clinician do? [^e4de37eb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Obstetrician-gynecologists often care for women with urinary symptoms of urgency and frequency. These symptoms are bothersome and treatable. Although it is rare that serious disease is causative, the clinician must be alert to ominous signs and physical findings. Most patients experience relief of their symptoms after a simple initial evaluation with appropriately directed treatment. A step-wise evaluation includes the directed history and physical, assessment of urinary habits, typically with a urinary diary, and occasionally an assessment of voiding efficiency, typically with a postvoid residual. Treatments may include myofascial therapy when trigger points are present on physical examination. Behavioral therapy and pharmaceuticals also play an important role. Persistent symptoms, hematuria, severe de novo postoperative symptoms, and ominous physical findings may warrant specialty consultation.

### Underactive bladder in women: is there any evidence? [^293438bb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Underactive bladder (UAB) is a clinical symptom complex only recently gaining recognition as a clinical diagnosis. Lack of consensus agreement on a definition of UAB has limited its recognition and diagnosis in clinical practice. The purposes of this review are to: present existing definitions of UAB, review recent data regarding clinical and urodynamic diagnosis of the condition, and examine up-to-date hypotheses regarding its pathophysiology, with a focus on women.

Recent Findings

The process to develop a consensus definition for UAB as a clinical symptom complex is ongoing. Symptoms associated with UAB, such as weak stream, straining to void, and history of urinary retention are well correlated to detrusor underactivity on urodynamics, which frequently develops in elderly women. In addition to aging, UAB may be the end stage of a variety of contributing pathologic conditions such as diabetes and ischemic disease. In some women, UAB may result from a progression from overactive bladder to UAB.

Summary

Existing evidence supports UAB in women as a symptom complex with a clinical and pathophysiologic profile distinguishable from other lower urinary tract-associated clinical conditions. Consensus definitions of clinical and urodynamic diagnostic parameters will be essential to more widespread recognition of UAB.

### The impact of urodynamics on treatment and outcomes in women with an overactive bladder: a longitudinal prospective follow-up study [^f384661a]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Urodynamics appears to influence treatment decisions made by clinicians in determining treatment pathways in women presenting with OAB. Women treated based on UDS diagnoses appear to have greater reductions in symptoms than those who do not. In women with OAB, a multicentre RCT comparing patient outcomes of treatment based on UDS diagnoses versus treatment based on clinical assessment (history and examination alone) and related health economic evaluation for these diagnostic interventions is planned. This will help to consolidate the role of UDS in the management of these women, as has been done for stress urinary incontinence.

### The prevalence of detrusor overactivity amongst patients with symptoms of overactive bladder: a retrospective cohort study [^5e969edb]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom-based condition consisting of urgency, with or without incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. There are many potential causes of OAB, yet many patients are prescribed anticholinergic medications empirically. This study aimed to determine what proportion of patients presenting for urogynecologic assessment with symptoms of OAB had urodynamic detrusor overactivity (DO).

Methods

Retrospective chart review was performed for 220 consecutive patient referrals. Demographic data, physical exam information, and urodynamic results were collected. The t test and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analyses.

Results

The prevalence of DO was 11.8 % in this population. Urogenital atrophy and incomplete emptying were more common. Patients with DO were older and more often menopausal than those without DO. Significant prolapse was a common finding amongst patients with OAB symptoms.

Conclusions

Patients with symptoms of OAB should undergo pelvic examination and assessment of post-void residuals before being initiated on anticholinergic medication.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in OAB workup—GSM is defined as the signs and symptoms of decreased estrogen levels on urogenital tissues, and patients may report vaginal, labial, bladder, and/or urethral symptoms, with urinary symptoms that may include frequency, urgency, dysuria, urethral discomfort, recurrent UTI, and/or urethral caruncle or urethral prolapse. Because some GSM symptoms overlap with OAB, providers should assess for signs of GSM on physical exam during the workup of OAB and consider treatment in shared decision-making with the patient; topical vaginal estrogen in GSM has been associated with improvements in urinary urgency, frequency, UUI, dysuria, and recurrent UTIs.

### AUA releases guideline on diagnosis and treatment of overactive (...) [^3fa64fff]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder is characterized by urinary symptoms including urgency, frequency, and nocturia, with or without urge incontinence. The prevalence and severity of symptoms increase with age, and most patients have symptoms for years. The American Urological Association recently published recommendations to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of non-neurogenic overactive bladder. Diagnosis Physicians should document signs and symptoms of overactive bladder and exclude other disorders. A patient history should be taken and physical examination and urinalysis should be performed. Additional procedures may be necessary in some patients to confirm the diagnosis, exclude other disorders, and formulate a treatment plan. A urine culture or postvoid residual urine assessment may also be performed, and information can be obtained from bladder diaries or symptom questionnaires.

Urodynamics, cystoscopy, and diagnostic renal and bladder ultrasonography typically should not be used in the initial workup. Treatment Overactive bladder is a complex of symptoms that generally do not affect survival, but may compromise quality of life. For this reason, physicians should carefully weigh the potential benefit of a particular treatment against the risk, severity, and reversibility of adverse effects. The physician and patient may decide to defer treatment if the assessment excludes conditions that would require treatment and counseling. Information should be provided to patients about overactive bladder and normal lower urinary tract function, and about the benefits and risks of available treatments. Patients should also be informed that several treatments may need to be tried before symptoms are successfully controlled. FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS Behavioral therapies should be offered as first-line therapy to all patients with overactive bladder. Antimuscarinic agents may be used in combination with behavioral strategies. Limited evidence suggests that initiating behavioral and pharmacologic therapy simultaneously may improve outcomes, including frequency, voided volume, incontinence, and symptom distress. OTHER TREATMENTS Indwelling catheters are not recommended as a management strategy for overactive bladder except as a last resort in select patients. In rare cases, augmentation cystoplasty or urinary diversion may be considered in patients with severe, refractory, complicated overactive bladder.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^07fc6642]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU guideline—initial evaluation of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) states that clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics (UDS), cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB, and that clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as UDS, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging, in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. The initial evaluation of patients with symptoms of OAB should include a medical history, physical examination, and urinalysis, and additional components of an OAB evaluation may also include post-void residual (PVR) measurement, voiding diary, and a symptom questionnaire. There is no need to obtain UDS, cystoscopy, or upper tract imaging in the initial evaluation of a patient with OAB symptoms, but further evaluation with UDS, cystoscopy, and/or urinary tract imaging can be considered to clarify diagnosis when diagnostic uncertainty or abnormal findings exist and can also be considered if patients have a suboptimal or unexpected response to standard OAB therapy.

### Overactive bladder patients with and without urgency incontinence: a spectrum of one condition or different phenotypes? [^b68a98d6]. Urogynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance

The importance of this study is to explore potential differences in pathophysiologies of OAB-wet and OAB-dry.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to define fundamental and unique presenting features of patients exhibiting storage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with urgency incontinence (OAB-wet) and patients without urgency incontinence (OAB-dry).

Study Design

This was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases-sponsored Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network. Demographic, physical examination, and questionnaire responses were analyzed for women seeking care for LUTS at 6 U.S. centers. Differences between OAB-wet and OAB-dry patients were compared using the Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test. Differences in questionnaire data were assessed using a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction.

Results

Fifty-six, 84, and 67 women were included in the OAB-dry, wet, and control cohorts, respectively. There was no difference in demographic and physical examination characteristics of the 2 groups. OAB-wet patients reported more urgency incontinence symptoms (LUTS 16a, P < 0.001). OAB-dry reported more bladder pain, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying (LUTS 4, P < 0.001), and a need to strain to urinate (AUA-SI 7, P = 0.003). Sensation of incomplete emptying and straining with urination did not correlate with elevated postvoid residual volumes. Although degrees of symptomatic bother were similar, bother in OAB-dry patients was most closely related to pelvic floor tenderness severity, whereas bother in OAB-wet patients was most related to urgency severity.

Conclusions

Women with OAB-dry have distinct presenting features of straining with urination, bladder pain, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. These suggest a unique pathophysiology driving OAB-dry symptoms, which we hypothesize is pelvic floor myofascial dysfunction.

### The impact of urodynamics on treatment and outcomes in women with an overactive bladder: a longitudinal prospective follow-up study [^36e9c0f8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urinary incontinence can seriously influence the physical, psychological, and social wellbeing of affected individuals. Urodynamics (UDS) has been considered the test of choice for lower urinary tract symptoms. The International Continence Society (ICS) states that the objective of urodynamic studies is to replicate the patient’s symptoms whilst making measurements that aim to determine the underlying cause and in addition evaluate the related pathophysiological processes. Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as a symptom complex of urinary urgency (an intense, sudden desire to void) with or without incontinence, usually with increased urinary frequency, or nocturia, but in the absence of infection or other proven pathological condition. From UDS testing, multiple diagnoses may be obtained, including detrusor overactivity (DO), urodynamic stress incontinence (USI), and voiding dysfunction (VD). In women who present with OAB, 46% do not have a DO diagnosis on UDS. UDS may falsely miss DO or it may not be able to capture DO at that time point. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Clinical Guidelines on urinary incontinence (NICE CG171) recommends that patients undergo UDS if they are unresponsive to conservative therapies. There is a dilemma for clinicians as to whether to treat women based on their symptoms or their UDS findings. Typically in the UK, patients with OAB are initially offered behavioural therapies and antimuscarinic drugs. NICE guidelines do not recommend performing UDS to commence conservative measures. However, botulinum toxin A can only be offered to women who have not responded to conservative measures and have proven DO on UDS. Invasive therapies (botulinum toxin type A, neuromodulation) can be offered to those with confirmed DO.

Overactive bladder (OAB) diagnostics—urodynamic studies (UDS)—have not been able to predict response to medical therapy or minimally invasive treatments, and in patients with only OAB they often show no objective abnormalities to guide therapy. There are no pathognomonic UDS findings for OAB; a normal study is relatively common especially among women, and UDS parameters do not correlate with symptom severity or patient-reported symptom scores. While machine learning has been explored to predict antimuscarinic response, these tools have not been widely adopted.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder—initial evaluation and testing: Clinicians may offer telemedicine to initially evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB, with the understanding that a physical exam will not be performed and urinalysis should be obtained at a local laboratory (or recent lab results reviewed, if available). Clinicians may obtain a post-void residual in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to exclude incomplete emptying or urinary retention, especially in patients with concomitant voiding or emptying symptoms. Clinicians may obtain a symptom questionnaire and/or a voiding diary in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to assist in the diagnosis of OAB, exclude other disorders, ascertain the degree of bother, and/or evaluate treatment response. Clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB. Clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as urodynamics, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. Clinicians should assess for comorbid conditions in patients with OAB that may contribute to urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urgency urinary incontinence and should educate patients on the role that managing these conditions can have on bladder symptoms. Clinicians may use telemedicine for follow-up visits with patients with OAB.

### The role of urodynamics in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in women [^1fc77cb4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urodynamic investigation was developed as an extension of patient history and physical examination in order to reveal the pathology of a patient's complaints. Much progress in standardizing definitions and procedures has been made in recent years. In particular, stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder can be differentiated with urodynamics. The developed parameters, however, cannot distinguish the various types of stress urinary incontinence. Moreover the definition and diagnosis of voiding dysfunction is not clear. Finally our understanding of bladder sensations and the impact on voiding behaviour has only started to emerge. This review is about last year's publications that focus on urodynamics and lower urinary tract symptoms in women.

Recent Findings

Defining bladder outlet obstruction is based on voiding pressure, urinary flow speed and residual urine but standardization is lacking. Urodynamics to reveal occult stress urinary incontinence in patients with pelvic organ prolapse needs standardization of the reducing manoeuvres. The quest for urodynamic tools for distinguishing intrinsic sphincter deficiency from urethral hypermobility continues. Urodynamics are still not good enough to discriminate between treatment options for stress urinary incontinence. The use of urodynamics in overactive bladder is developing and has elicited new findings. Voiding habit seems to be independent from bladder sensations. Also bladder sensations appear to be imperfectly correlated with bladder filling. Even bladder volumes do not predict entirely bladder fullness sensations.

Summary

In order to use urodynamics as a proper clinical tool, defining subtypes of stress urinary incontinence and standardization of urodynamics in pelvic organ prolapse and bladder outlet obstruction in women is needed.

### Post-void residual urine volume in women with overactive bladder symptoms [^f61b8b32]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Most patients with overactive bladder symptoms initially present to their primary care provider for treatment. It is currently recommended that post-void residual urine (PVR) should be measured during the assessment of women complaining of overactive bladder symptoms and anticholinergic medication should be used if PVR is low. However, many primary care providers are reluctant to measure PVR and, therefore, they may delay treatment or even inappropriately treat patients who have a high PVR. We identified clinical factors that are associated with increased PVR that could be used to select which patients are at risk for this.

Materials and Methods

The charts of women presenting to our clinic with complaints of urinary frequency, urgency and/or urge incontinence were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, physical examination and PVR were analyzed to determine if any factor was associated with increased PVR (100 ml or greater).

Results

The charts of 201 patients with complete data were reviewed. Patient age was 20 to 90 years (mean 55). Overall 19% of patients were found to have elevated PVR. Univariate analysis identified that older age, prior incontinence surgery, history of multiple sclerosis, greater American Urological Association Symptom Score, vaginal parity greater than 2, greater pad use and stage 2 or greater vaginal prolapse were associated with elevated PVR. Multivariate analysis identified age older than 55 years, prior incontinence surgery, a history of multiple sclerosis and vaginal prolapse stage 2 or greater as independent predictors of elevated PVR.

Conclusions

It is possible to identify patients with overactive bladder symptoms who are at risk for elevated PVR based on history and physical examination. This could result in fewer patients needing PVR measurement prior to initiating treatment.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^8496cb1f]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Medical history and bladder symptom assessment—clinician assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB should characterize symptoms, assess severity and duration, exclude alternative diagnoses, and identify complicated signs or symptoms that may necessitate referral or additional evaluation. Bladder symptom assessment should include questions about typical OAB symptoms (urinary urgency, daytime and nighttime frequency, urgency urinary incontinence [UUI]), other urinary storage impairments (stress incontinence, incontinence without sensation), and the ability to empty the bladder (straining to void, poor force of stream, urinary hesitancy, history of urinary retention, sensation of incomplete emptying). Predominant emptying symptoms can indicate an elevated post-void residual (PVR) and/or bladder outflow obstruction (BOO), especially in patients with prostates. Certain signs or symptoms may suggest a more complicated process that may require further evaluation include abdominal pain, pelvic pain, hematuria, recurrent UTI, sudden onset of severe OAB symptoms, concomitant neurologic symptoms (blurred vision, limb weakness or numbness), and bowel dysfunction (fecal incontinence, severe constipation). The presence of incomplete emptying or other complicated symptoms warrants specialist evaluation.

American College of Physicians guideline—diagnosis of urinary incontinence in women states that physicians should proactively ask female patients about bothersome urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms as part of a routine review of systems, clinicians should take a focused history and ask specific questions about time of onset, symptoms, and frequency, and clinicians should also do a focused physical examination and evaluate neurologic symptoms. An example prompt is, “Do you have a problem with urinary incontinence (or your bladder) that is bothersome enough that you would like to know more about how it could be treated?”, and this quality improvement intervention has been shown to increase appropriate care by 15% in patients aged 75 years or older.

### Special considerations in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with symptoms of overactive bladder [^7a547379]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The term overactive bladder (OAB) is used to describe the symptoms of urinary frequency and urgency with or without urge incontinence. Commonly reported symptoms are nocturia, urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. However, some of these symptoms may be because of other lower urinary tract conditions or may simply represent a variant of normal physiologic function. Consequently, special considerations need to be made when diagnosing OAB in women. In women of all ages, lower urinary tract infection is the most common cause of irritative urinary symptoms, and midstream urine microscopy and culture should be performed. A chronic urinary residual secondary to voiding difficulties may also result in symptoms of frequency and overflow incontinence and may be diagnosed using a postmicturition ultrasound scan. In premenopausal women, pregnancy should also be excluded. In postmenopausal women, urogenital atrophy can cause irritative symptoms that may be improved with hormone replacement therapy. Vaginal administration has been shown to be most effective and may be used to supplement systemic replacement therapy. In addition, estrogen replacement may be beneficial in the management of OAB as an adjunct to anticholinergic therapy. When investigating elderly women with OAB, special consideration should be given to comorbidities, such as constipation and fecal impaction, mobility problems, and the loss of independence. Concomitant medication, such as diuretics and alpha-adrenergic blockers, should also be noted and the need for therapy reviewed. In conclusion, OAB is a subjective diagnosis that should only be made when other lower urinary tract conditions have been excluded.

### Defining overactive bladder: epidemiology and burden of disease [^2b8c5bf1]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common, disabling condition associated with considerable negative impact on quality of life, quality of sleep, and mental health. The age-specific prevalence of OAB is similar among men and women. Urge incontinence affects only a portion of the OAB population: 33% of patients have OAB with urge incontinence ("OAB wet"), while 66% have OAB without urge incontinence ("OAB dry"). The symptoms of OAB can affect social, psychological, occupational, domestic, physical, and sexual aspects of life. OAB can also lead to depression and low self-esteem. The shift away from urodynamic observation (essential in the identification of OAB) reflects increased emphasis on the symptom-specific nature of this common disorder. The overall costs of OAB to society are in the billions. Yet the condition often goes unrecognized, largely because of the reluctance of those with OAB to seek medical attention.

### Overactive bladder: an update [^0c2752fd]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Overactive bladder is an important lower urinary tract syndrome that negatively affects the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. Both sexes and all age groups may be affected; therefore many specialists, including urologists, gynaecologists, geriatricians, paediatricians, physiotherapists and continence advisors, are involved in the management of patients with overactive bladder.

Recent Findings

There is ongoing research, both basic science and clinical trials, to establish the cause of overactive bladder and to determine the best method of managing patients who suffer from this syndrome. New theories and modified definitions of overactive bladder have been proposed, structured evidence-based management guidelines have been established, more prevalence studies have been conducted and new treatment strategies have emerged.

Summary

Overactive bladder is now recognized as a chronic debilitating condition that costs millions of dollars. With an ageing population these costs will increase, and it is necessary that health systems around the world recognize this. Further research into the basic science of the condition is required to identify the true cause of overactive bladder, allowing new targeted treatments to be established.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^dcde5d4a]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline—telemedicine for idiopathic overactive bladder notes the Panel’s consensus that telemedicine is a viable option for the initial evaluation of patients with OAB. A thorough history can be obtained via telemedicine; however, neither a physical examination nor additional evaluations such as measurement of a PVR are possible via telemedicine. Urinalysis should be part of the initial evaluation to exclude UTI and hematuria and, at an initial telemedicine visit, can be obtained at a local laboratory or by review of recent lab results. Careful monitoring of response to any prescribed treatment is important when a physical examination cannot be performed at the initial telemedicine visit. Clinicians may use telemedicine to perform follow-up visits for patients with symptoms of OAB, but a physical examination is an important part of the OAB evaluation and cannot be ignored. For patients who do not respond to initial therapy after the initial telemedicine evaluation, an in-office visit with a physical examination, with measurement of PVR and urinalysis as indicated, should be considered. Caveats include patient willingness and technological ability, the possibility that some patients prefer in-person visits, and clinician awareness of local rules and regulations regarding telemedicine and billing.

### Diagnosis and management of outlet obstruction in the female [^7235354e]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bladder outlet obstruction in women results from a remarkable diversity of underlying pathologies. The potential array of presenting symptoms often makes the diagnosis complex, although the condition is predominantly assessed by the urologist as a consequence of incontinence surgery. Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of outlet obstruction in women and the impact on clinical practice are outlined. Recent trials have defined the importance of early intervention for successful resolution of acute, surgically induced obstruction in women. Methods of management for persistent symptoms due to induced obstruction have been reported that render improved symptomatic response.

Recent Findings

We present strategies for diagnostic evaluation of bladder outlet obstruction, including history taking and physical exam, as well as a review of appropriate imaging modalities and utilization of videourodynamics. Common conditions resulting in bladder outlet obstruction are discussed along with disease-specific treatment strategies. Diagnostic definitions of obstruction have evolved and improved nomograms have been developed to define study populations.

Summary

Recent data have underscored the need for a structured management algorithm. Areas of future research should focus on understanding the natural history of outlet obstruction in women, especially when it occurs in women who have undergone surgery for incontinence and have developed obstruction. Lower urinary tract response to acute obstruction and method of optimal management remain to be defined.

### International urogynecology consultation chapter 2 committee 3: the clinical evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse including investigations into associated morbidity / pelvic floor dysfunction [^8592c1df]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

This manuscript from Chapter 2 of the International Urogynecology Consultation (IUC) on Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) reviews the literature involving the clinical evaluation of a patient with POP and associated bladder and bowel dysfunction.

Methods

An international group of 11 clinicians performed a search of the literature using pre-specified search MESH terms in PubMed and Embase databases (January 2000 to August 2020). Publications were eliminated if not relevant to the clinical evaluation of patients or did not include clear definitions of POP. The titles and abstracts were reviewed using the Covidence database to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. The manuscripts were reviewed for suitability using the Specialist Unit for Review Evidence checklists. The data from full-text manuscripts were extracted and then reviewed.

Results

The search strategy found 11,242 abstracts, of which 220 articles were used to inform this narrative review. The main themes of this manuscript were the clinical examination, and the evaluation of comorbid conditions including the urinary tract (LUTS), gastrointestinal tract (GIT), pain, and sexual function. The physical examination of patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) should include a reproducible method of describing and quantifying the degree of POP and only the Pelvic Organ Quantification (POP-Q) system or the Simplified Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (S-POP) system have enough reproducibility to be recommended. POP examination should be done with an empty bladder and patients can be supine but should be upright if the prolapse cannot be reproduced. No other parameters of the examination aid in describing and quantifying POP. Post-void residual urine volume >100 ml is commonly used to assess for voiding difficulty. Prolapse reduction can be used to predict the possibility of postoperative persistence of voiding difficulty. There is no benefit of urodynamic testing for assessment of detrusor overactivity as it does not change the management. In women with POP and stress urinary incontinence (SUI), the cough stress test should be performed with a bladder volume of at least 200 ml and with the prolapse reduced either with a speculum or by a pessary. The urodynamic assessment only changes management when SUI and voiding dysfunction co-exist. Demonstration of preoperative occult SUI has a positive predictive value for de novo SUI of 40% but most useful is its absence, which has a negative predictive value of 91%. The routine addition of radiographic or physiological testing of the GIT currently has no additional value for a physical examination. In subjects with GIT symptoms further radiological but not physiological testing appears to aid in diagnosing enteroceles, sigmoidoceles, and intussusception, but there are no data on how this affects outcomes. There were no articles in the search on the evaluation of the co-morbid conditions of pain or sexual dysfunction in women with POP.

Conclusions

The clinical pelvic examination remains the central tool for evaluation of POP and a system such as the POP-Q or S-POP should be used to describe and quantify. The value of investigation for urinary tract dysfunction was discussed and findings presented. The routine addition of GI radiographic or physiological testing is currently not recommended. There are no data on the role of the routine assessment of pain or sexual function, and this area needs more study. Imaging studies alone cannot replace clinical examination for the assessment of POP.

### Detrusor overactivity and urodynamics [^7d40c7f3]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

While overactive bladder (OAB) is a clinical diagnosis, detrusor overactivity is identified through urodynamic testing. UDS is usually considered when primary treatment for OAB fails, because UDS is expensive, time consuming, invasive, and sometimes inaccurate, and it is not considered to influence treatment strategy substantially. On the other hand, UDS helps for diagnosis and treatment among women with OAB symptoms, and plays a key role in diagnosing DO to properly assess bladder function for complex LUTS situations such as nocturnal enuresis, bladder outlet obstruction, detrusor underactivity or after surgical correction of stress urinary incontinence. This article emphasizes the vital role of urodynamics in diagnosing and managing DO, highlighting its significance in treatment planning and the need for further research to refine diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies.

### Diagnosis and management of overactive bladder (...) [^c2ae0714]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with overactive bladder typically have a variety of symptoms that may include urinary urgency and frequency, nocturia, and urge incontinence. The condition is frequently encountered and affects an estimated 30 to 40 percent of persons 75 years of age or older. Patients with symptoms of overactive bladder often withdraw from their usual social activities, are more likely to be depressed, and may suffer from sleep disruption because of nocturia. Ouslander provides a review of the diagnostic work-up and treatment of overactive bladder. Overactive bladder has a multifactorial etiology in most persons. The author states that a targeted diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder is required. All older men should be questioned about symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy. Patient diaries may provide helpful details regarding frequency of urination, voiding volumes, pattern of voiding, and lifestyle factors that may contribute to symptoms.

All patients should have focused genitourinary, pelvic, and rectal examinations, and a clean-catch urine specimen should be checked for hematuria and infection. Sterile in-and-out catheterization can be used to check for the presence of post-void residual urine, and this procedure should be considered in patients at risk for urinary retention. Alternatively, ultrasonography provides a noninvasive way to measure post-void bladder volumes. Cystoscopy should be targeted to patients with unexplained hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, or risk factors for bladder cancer. Urodynamic testing is relatively more complex and invasive, and the author notes that its role in the diagnostic work-up of overactive bladder is controversial. He suggests targeting this procedure to patients who have failed initial therapy or those with nonspecific symptoms and an unclear etiology of overactive bladder.

The multifactorial causes of bladder dysfunction typically necessitate a multimodal approach to treatment that includes behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. All patients should be educated to limit caffeine intake, avoid constipation, and plan fluid intake to minimize social disruptions and sleep disturbance. Pelvic-muscle floor exercises and “bladder training” are more likely to be effective in cognitively intact, motivated patients whose primary problem is incontinence.

### Pelvic organ prolapse and overactive bladder [^a4266803]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

In this review we try to shed light on the following questions: *How frequently are symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) and is detrusor overactivity (DO) present in patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and is there a difference from women without POP? *Does the presence of OAB symptoms depend on the prolapsed compartment and/or stage of the prolapse? *What is the possible pathophysiology of OAB in POP? *Do OAB symptoms and DO change after conservative or surgical treatment of POP?

Methods

We searched on Medline and Embase for relevant studies. We only included studies in which actual data about OAB symptoms were available. All data for prolapse surgery were without the results of concomitant stress urinary incontinence (SUI) surgery.

Results

Community- and hospital-based studies showed that the prevalence of OAB symptoms was greater in patients with POP than without POP. No evidence was found for a relationship between the compartment or stage of the prolapse and the presence of OAB symptoms. All treatments for POP (surgery, pessaries) resulted in an improvement in OAB symptoms. It is unclear what predicts whether OAB symptoms disappear or not. When there is concomitant DO and POP, following POP surgery DO disappear in a proportion of the patients. Bladder outlet obstruction is likely to be the most important mechanism by which POP induces OAB symptoms and DO signs. However, several other mechanisms might also play a role.

Conclusions

There are strong indications that there is a causal relationship between OAB and POP.

AUA/SUFU guideline—cystoscopy in OAB explains that cystoscopy is not helpful to make the diagnosis of OAB, but specific scenarios may warrant it. Those with hematuria on urinalysis at the time of initial or subsequent OAB evaluation should undergo evaluation as recommended by the Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline which often calls for cystoscopy and upper urinary tract imaging. Patients with OAB symptoms and a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) may benefit from cystoscopy as recommended by the Recurrent Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections in Women: AUA/CUA/SUFU Guideline, and cystoscopy may be helpful in women with symptoms of OAB and a history of a prior sling for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), where potential issues include mesh erosion or BOO and potential indications include recurrent UTI, hematuria, and post-sling voiding symptoms.

### Overactive bladder symptoms: do we need urodynamics? [^43c6b210]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of our study was to determine whether the urodynamic diagnosis is useful in the management of women with symptoms of an overactive bladder (OAB).

Methods

Women with lower urinary tract symptoms, attending a tertiary referral urogynaecology clinic were studied. All women were fully evaluated, with history, urinary symptoms questionnaire, frequency-volume chart, vaginal examination, and videocystourethrography. Women with symptoms consistent with an overactive bladder (urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge incontinence) were selected. Women with neurological disorders were excluded. Finally, urinary symptoms and urodynamic diagnosis were correlated. All terms and definitions are in accordance with the International Continence Society [Abrams et al., 1988, Scand J Urol Nephrol 114(Suppl):5-19.].

Results

A total of 4,500 women 22-73 years of age were studied. Only 843 women (18.7%) could be classified as having an OAB. Of these, 457 women (54.2%) had urodynamically proven detrusor instability, whereas 386 women (45.8%) had a stable urodynamic trace. Sixty-eight (8.1%) of the women studied had postvoid residual greater than 100 mL. Of the 4,500 women studied, 1,641 (36.5%) had detrusor instability on laboratory urodynamics. Only 27.5% of these women (457 of 1,641) had OAB symptoms.

Conclusions

Symptomatic diagnosis of OAB does not correlate with a urodynamic diagnosis of detrusor instability. The diagnosis of overactive bladder based on urinary symptoms underdiagnoses the condition of detrusor instability in a population of women suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms. Therefore, symptomatic diagnosis of OAB alone is not recommended. Our study suggested that urodynamic evaluation is mandatory in the management of the women with symptoms of an overactive bladder.

### Overactive bladder in men: special considerations for evaluation and management [^15d8a3eb]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men may arise from a variety of underlying causes, including benign prostatic hyperplasia. LUTS may have a significant component of storage symptoms (urgency, frequency, urge incontinence) at presentation; however, the absence of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms does not necessarily imply pure outlet obstruction nor does their presence indicate the lack thereof. Symptomatic correlates to urodynamic findings are high when considering isolated OAB symptoms. However, mixed presentations or more overtly obstructive scenarios have less correlation with baseline symptom appraisal instruments. The ideal approach for diagnosis and management is predicated on a graded approach, with more invasive evaluation withheld for those men in whom presumptive therapy fails or who present with associated complex symptoms and in whom a higher level of intervention is being considered. The increasing incidence of LUTS with age implies a partial detrusor contribution, which must be considered in the overall management schema.

### The impact of urodynamics on treatment and outcomes in women with an overactive bladder: a longitudinal prospective follow-up study [^cf23c68d]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction and hypothesis

The aim of this study was to establish if the management of women with overactive bladder (OAB) and patient-reported outcomes differed based on the findings of urodynamics (UDS).

Methods

A prospective, longitudinal observational study conducted in urogynaecology clinics in 22 UK hospitals participating in the Diagnostic Accuracy of Bladder Ultrasound Study (BUS). A total of 687 women with OAB symptoms or urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence were recruited into a diagnostic study that used UDS as the reference standard. Detailed clinical history and International Consultation on Incontinence OAB Short Form (ICIQ-OAB sf) questionnaire responses were obtained before the UDS test was carried out. These questionnaires were subsequently collected at a mean of 7 and 20 months, along with patient global impression of improvement and details on medical and surgical treatments. The relationship between UDS diagnosis and treatment was examined using a multinomial regression model; logistic and repeated measures regressions were used to examine other outcomes.

Results

We recruited 687 women and the response rate was 69% at 20 months. Treatment subsequent to UDS was highly associated with diagnosis (p < 0.0001). Women who received treatment concordant with their UDS findings were more likely to report an improvement in bladder symptoms (57% vs 45%; p = 0.02) and ICIQ-OAB sf scores (0.5 points, 95%CI: 0.1 to 0.9; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Urodynamics influenced treatment decisions made by clinicians in determining treatment pathways in women presenting with OAB. Women treated based on UDS diagnoses appear to have greater reductions in symptoms than those who do not.

### Assessment of bladder pressure and discomfort symptoms: how do overactive bladder differ from interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome patients? [^503d1250]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Population

Patients who presented to urology clinic and were diagnosed clinically with IC/BPS or OAB by one urologist (HHL) consented to participate in this questionnaire study between late 2012 and early 2014 (the timing of the enrollment was related to funding). The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS and OAB was consistent with the AUA IC/BPS Guideline and the 2002 ICS definition respectively, and generally taken into accounts all clinical factors including chief complaint, history, physical examination findings, and laboratory and diagnostic workup as indicated. IC/BPS patients had an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. OAB patients had urinary urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, and in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. Consistent with the AUA Guidelines, cystoscopy and urodynamics were not performed on most of the patients, so we had no further information on detrusor overactivity for OAB, or Hunner lesion status for IC/BPS.

Assessment

Patients completed the following questions to rate their bladder pain, pressure, discomfort, and urinary urgency on separate 0–10 numeric rating scales (NRS):
Think about the pain associated with your bladder. On average, how would you rate these symptoms in the past 4 weeks? (0 = no pain, 10 = most severe pain I can imagine)
Think about the pressure associated with your bladder. On average, how would you rate these symptoms in the past 4 weeks? (0 = no pressure, 10 = most severe pressure I can imagine)
Think about the discomfort associated with your bladder. On average, how would you rate these symptoms in the past 4 weeks? (0 = no discomfort, 10 = most severe discomfort I can imagine)
Think about the urgency to urinate associated with your bladder. On average, how would you rate these symptoms in the past 4 weeks? (0 = no urgency, 10 = most severe urgency I can imagine)

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^cb62255d]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder—shared decision‑making approach emphasizes that diagnosis and management are complex because research has not identified a unifying pathophysiology and diagnostic testing has not led to reliable patterns that can guide treatment; nascent research has focused on phenotyping OAB and identifying predictors of treatment outcomes, and incorporating these into shared decision‑making can help clinicians and patients select the best treatment modality and improve outcomes. The text states that we should strive for upfront and clear communication with patients regarding OAB as a poorly understood and chronic syndrome, with interventions designed to mitigate symptoms rather than to treat or resolve an underlying condition, and that shared decision‑making should include a plan of care with emphasis on multiple modalities acceptable to the patient to optimize response.

### Patient-reported outcomes and different approaches to urinary parameters in overactive bladder: what should we measure? [^394ad687]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is highly prevalent and associated with considerable impact on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Assessment of HRQoL can reveal the burden of disease and post-intervention improvement. This review aims to highlight the importance of HRQoL assessment and outline the tools available for use in clinical trials and real-world clinical practice. A number of validated measures of HRQoL specific to OAB have been developed, offering greater sensitivity and responsiveness over generic instruments. These condition-specific, multi-dimensional and single-item global questionnaires are particularly useful for the multiple and varied symptoms of OAB, as they reflect the patient's needs, concerns and values. Measurements for lower urinary tract symptoms, e.g. bladder diaries, are being compared with HRQoL instruments to provide greater understanding of the disease and treatment from the patient's perspective. Therapeutic interventions to improve OAB symptoms should also be evaluated for their effect on the patient's HRQoL.

### The underactive bladder: a new clinical concept? [^b363cff2]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Detrusor underactivity (DU) is an increasingly recognised cause of lower urinary tract symptoms in both men and women. There has been a lack of research into all aspects of this dysfunction, and as yet, no effective treatments exist. DU can be diagnosed at present only on the basis of an invasive urodynamic study. An international consensus group met at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society and International Continence Society annual meetings in 2014 to consider the feasibility of developing a working definition of a symptom complex associated with DU. Drawing an analogy to detrusor overactivity (urodynamic diagnosis) and overactive bladder (symptom complex), the aim of this process is to help identify affected patients and facilitate further clinical and epidemiological research.

Patient Summary

Bladder underactivity is an underresearched but important cause of urinary symptoms in men and women. In this paper, an international expert group presents a working definition for the symptoms that characterise bladder underactivity, with the aim of facilitating further research in this area.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^4cdaa3b5]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder—treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise “first”→“second”→“third line therapy,” and to eliminate the concept of “step therapy,” options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient’s needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term “refractory OAB” lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

### Are voiding parameters a marker for the severity of quality of life impairment in women with overactive bladder symptoms? [^d969d318]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

There is evidence of an association between voiding parameters and the presence of overactive bladder symptoms. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is any association between pressure flow study parameters and the degree of health related quality of life impairment in women with OAB symptoms. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant correlation between quality of life domain scores and pressure flow study parameters.

Methods

One hundred and sixty-seven consecutive women with overactive bladder symptoms underwent evaluation with a quality of life assessment plus filling and voiding cystometry. These data were used to evaluate for any correlation between pressure flow study parameters and quality of life domain scores.

Results

Fifty-six out of 167 women had proven detrusor overactivity (DO). There were no differences in voiding parameters or quality of life scores between women with DO and women without DO. There was no consistent correlation identified between quality of life domain scores and pressure flow variables.

Conclusions

There is no evidence of an association between increasing quality of life impairment and voiding parameters in this cohort.

Recurrent urinary tract infection—physical examination: Although a physical examination may not be necessary before treatment for a woman with infrequent UTI, an examination should always occur as part of the rUTI evaluation to detect an underlying etiology, potential contributors, and findings suggestive of upper tract involvement; focused examination should include palpation for costovertebral angle and suprapubic tenderness, and the pelvic examination can check for vulvar skin and/or architecture changes, urethral diverticulum, pelvic floor muscle tenderness, urethra or bladder findings, vaginal discharge, and pelvic masses, with these assessments performed at initial evaluation and repeated as needed.

### Clinical and urodynamic differences among women with overactive bladder according to the presence of detrusor overactivity [^4afd208c]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

We tried to determine whether clinical and urodynamic differences exist between women with and without detrusor overactivity (DO) using a large database of overactive bladder (OAB) patients.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 513 women who underwent urodynamic studies for OAB symptoms without neurogenic or anatomical conditions that affect micturition function. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using a 3-day frequency-volume chart (FVC) including the Urinary Sensation Scale and American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI). All clinical and urodynamic findings were compared between women with and without DO.

Results

The patients' mean age was 58.9 years. DO was identified urodynamically in 167 (32.6 %) women. Those with DO were older (62.9 vs 57.0 years, p < 0.001); however, no differences in AUA-SI, episodes of daytime voiding, and episodes of nocturia were observed between the groups. Functional bladder capacity was smaller in women with DO; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Women with DO had significantly more urgency incontinence symptoms than those without DO (55.1 vs 29.5 %, p < 0.001). In urodynamic parameters, the volumes at first desire to void and strong desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity were significantly smaller, and detrusor pressure at the opening was significantly higher in women with DO compared to subjects without DO (26.2 vs 21.2 cmH(2)O, p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest a more severe disturbance of bladder function when DO exists, although no differences were observed in symptom scores and 3-day FVC parameters among women with OAB symptoms according to the presence of DO.

### The prevalence and risk factors of overactive bladder symptoms and its relation to pelvic organ prolapse symptoms in a general female population [^91529cee]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

The study was cross-sectional in a small town, Brielle, in the Netherlands. Brielle was chosen because it has a homogenic population, where all women are registered in one of the nine general practices. All women aged 45 to 85 years registered on the patients lists of eight out of nine general practices were invited to enrol in the study, which is 95% of the women in this age group. The women were sent information about the study and informed that they could enrol by filling out an informed consent form. All women who consented were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire. Non-responders received a reminder 8 weeks later that contained the same questionnaire. To check for selection bias, permanent non-responders were invited to complete a short questionnaire that comprised five questions about age, parity, presence of stress urinary incontinence (yes/no), faecal incontinence (yes/no) and feeling of vaginal bulging (yes/no). To encourage a high response to the questionnaire, we used envelopes with the name and logo of the Erasmus University, coloured paper and stamped addressed return envelopes.

Three options were possible: women refused to participate in the study, women filled out only the questionnaire and women filled out the questionnaire and underwent vaginal examination. For the purpose of this study, data on vaginal examination are not used. The relation between symptoms and signs of vagina prolapse has been extensively described in an earlier study. A flowchart of the study design is presented in Fig. 1. In this study, all women who answered the questionnaires are included.

Fig. 1 
Flowchart of the study

The self-reported questionnaire used for this study are a composite of internationally well-known questionnaires that have been validated for the Dutch language. It contains, amongst others, disease-specific questions from the validated Dutch translation of the Urinary Distress Inventory(UDI) next to other questionnaires and items which were not used for the present study.

Women rated the amount of bother of various symptom on a 5-point Likert scale, from 0 (no complaints at all) to 4 (very serious complaints). In addition, questions about ethnicity, parity, POP symptoms during pregnancy, family history, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), previous pelvic floor surgery, educational level, smoking and heavy physical work were also included.

The Medical Ethics Research Committee (METC) of the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, approved this study.

### Role of cystometry in evaluating patients with overactive bladder [^1b9807ca]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) can be caused by a variety of conditions. We believe that cystometrography (CMG) is an essential part of the diagnostic evaluation, both in defining underlying pathophysiology and directing treatment. Essential to the diagnosis of OAB syndrome is some combination of urinary frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and pain. CMG can be thought of simply as a provocative test to determine whether bladder filling, involuntary detrusor contractions, or low bladder compliance in fact reproduces any of these symptoms, and whether the symptoms abate when the bladder is empty or when the pressure decreases. At another level, the CMG has been likened to "the reflex hammer" of the lower urinary tract and, as such, provides important neurologic information. Finally, the voiding phase of the CMG is an essential component of the detrusor pressure/uroflow study, which is the only accurate method of diagnosing urethral obstruction and impaired detrusor contractility. Both of these conditions can coexist with detrusor overactivity. The treatment of OAB depends on the underlying cause. We believe that only by understanding the particular cystometric characteristics of patients with OAB can we determine the appropriate treatment. Urodynamic testing should serve as an essential part of therapy and guide future research in diagnosis and management.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^41bc8f3b]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) research needs and future directions—OAB, because it is a symptom complex, is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion and treatments are aimed at relieving symptoms, highlighting that understanding the pathophysiology and risk factors for development of OAB is needed and that future research will need to address epidemiology, QoL, treatment modalities, and basic bladder physiology including sensory and motor signaling. Research often dichotomizes OAB into OAB-dry and OAB-wet, but this compartmentalization highlights a lack of understanding; in addition, particularly in females, stress urinary incontinence may exist concomitantly with OAB symptoms and isolated nocturia is a separate symptom entity requiring different evaluation and management strategies; therefore the phenotype of bladder symptoms should be carefully considered and declared in all research. Studies assessing how OAB develops and its natural history and progression are required, and the timing and circumstances of development and associated risk factors are not yet well-understood.

### Non-neurogenic female voiding dysfunction [^2fcbc5a2]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The pathophysiological mechanisms of female voiding phase dysfunction are poorly understood, and there are neither standard definitions nor guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this review is to present up-to-date data and controversies associated with non-neurogenic female voiding dysfunction.

Recent Findings

Conceptually, voiding phase dysfunction may have bladder or urethral causes. Bladder causes include detrusor contraction of inadequate magnitude or duration to effect bladder emptying (detrusor underactivity), or the absence of detrusor contraction (detrusor arreflexia). Urethral causes consist of bladder outlet obstruction as a result of urethral overactivity (functional obstruction), or anatomical (mechanical obstruction) pathologies. The specific prevalence and contribution of each of the above mechanisms is unknown. Furthermore, a correct and timely diagnosis may be difficult, because clinical features are very similar to those of other lower urinary tract symptoms, and diagnostic modalities are often inconclusive or even misleading. A full urodynamic evaluation is essential in making the diagnosis; however, standard urodynamic definitions are still lacking. In the following review, we will present recent findings associated with the prevalence, etiology and diagnosis of each of the different categories of female voiding phase dysfunction, and highlight new advances presented during the past year.

Summary

Further epidemiological and pathophysiological investigations are needed to evaluate the causes and main risk factors of voiding dysfunction in women. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with this challenging condition may provide the possibility to use appropriate diagnostic and treatment modalities, thus avoiding unnecessary interventions.

### Pelvic organ prolapse quantification in women referred with overactive bladder [^079f92d5]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

A study was carried out to investigate the relationship of anterior vaginal wall descent or prolapse to overactive bladder and its potential mechanisms, advancing the management of overactive bladder (OAB).

Methods

Two hundred twenty-six consecutive women with OAB symptoms were prospectively studied using OAB questionnaire (OAB-q) and pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q). According to POP-Q staging, they were divided into three groups: stages 0, I, and II. For statistical analysis, a one-way ANOVA was used to test for significant differences with Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis for continuous variables (OAB-q symptom severity, health-related quality of life total scores, and age) and chi-squared test for discrete variable (number of menopausal women).

Results

Twenty-two women (9.73%) did not show any prolapse on examination; 204 (90.26%) had anterior vaginal wall descent or prolapse. The outcome statistics denoted that the difference in OAB-q scores among three groups has statistical significance (P < 0.05). Anterior vaginal wall descent or prolapse may have associations with OAB.

Conclusions

Anterior vaginal wall descent or prolapse may have associations with OAB and is directly correlated to OAB severity.

### Is coexistent overactive-underactive bladder (with or without detrusor overactivity and underactivity) a real clinical syndrome? ICI-RS 2019 [^d2a4ef33]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) can be classified into symptom syndromes based on which symptoms are predominant. Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, a storage dysfunction, and underactive bladder (UAB) syndrome, a voiding dysfunction, are common syndromes, which urodynamic tests may show to be caused by detrusor overactivity (DO) and detrusor underactivity (DU), but can also be associated with other urethro-vesical dysfunctions. Sometimes OAB and UAB can coexist in the same patient and, if so, need a specific approach beyond treatment of the single and apparently opposing syndromes.

Methods

During its 2019 meeting in Bristol, the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society held a literature review and expert consensus discussion focused on the emerging awareness of the coexisting overactive-underactive bladder (COUB).

Results

The consensus considered whether COUB is the combination of OAB and UAB syndromes, or a real unique clinical syndrome in the same patient, possibly with a common etiology. Definitions, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment were discussed, and high-priority research questions were identified.

Conclusions

COUB (with or without urodynamic evidence of DO and DU) may be considered a real clinical syndrome, because it differs from single OAB and UAB, and may not be the combination of both syndromes. Urodynamic tests may be necessary in unclear cases or in cases not responding to initial treatment of the most troublesome symptoms. It is pivotal to define the evolution of the syndrome and the characteristic population, and to recognize predictive or phenotyping factors to develop a specific approach and adequate outcome measures.

### Overactive bladder in women: does low-count bacteriuria matter? A review [^140a3fb8]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

Since the description of the overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, which excludes infection, the precise definition of significant bacteriuria in these women is critical. The traditional definition of 'significant' bacteriuria is >10(5) colony-forming units/ml which was described 50 years ago by a renal physician whose primary interest was the prevention of pyelonephritis. Subsequent studies have shown this to be an insensitive threshold in women with acute lower urinary tract symptoms. Bacterial counts between 10(2) and 10(5)CFU/ml ('low-count bacteriuria') are now considered important in women with acute dysuria and warrant treatment. However, these findings have been slow to translate into routine clinical practice. In addition, the role of low-count bacteriuria in women with OAB symptoms (frequency/urgency/nocturia) without dysuria is poorly studied. One recent study has shown low-count bacteriuria to be more prevalent among women with severe OAB than bacteriuria >10(5)CFU/ml. We present an outline of the history of this issue and summarise current microbiological and clinical concepts.

### Overactive bladder symptoms and voiding dysfunction in neurologically normal women [^72cd28e6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To understand mechanisms underlying overactive bladder (OAB) and voiding dysfunction (VD) in neurologically normal women.

Methods

Review of MEDLINE from (1982) to (2011) using defined search terms, and manual analysis. Only articles published in English were included.

Results

One in five women report moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Whilst VD is more common in men, women report a higher rate of storage symptoms or post-micturition symptoms. Post-void residual (PVR) volume measurements are vital in the assessment of women with LUTS and patients with VD without stress incontinence (SUI) are likely to have an elevated PVR (82%). Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) also causes VD in women and can be alleviated by surgery or alpha-blocker therapy, although OAB symptoms typically remain. Surgical repair for SUI can result in temporary VD in the minority of patients, highlighting the complex interplay that is emerging in the urethral bladder functioning complex in women.

Conclusions

Women with impaired bladder emptying present with a wide range of LUTS, and PVR measurement is essential for diagnosis. OAB and VD can clearly coexist and accurate diagnosis of underlying pathophysiology is required. Recommendations for clinical practice and research are provided including: investigation of VD in women with OAB; evaluation of PVR values to determine appropriate therapy and identification of BOO. There is clearly a need for further research into the impact of alpha-blockers in women with VD as well as an evaluation of PVR changes in women with OAB before and after antimuscarinic therapy.

### Urinary incontinence in women: evaluation and management [^d319db43]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Because the prevalence of urinary incontinence increases with age, a working knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of the various types of urinary incontinence is fundamental to the care of women. As the population of the United States ages, primary care physicians can expect to see an increasing number of patients with urinary incontinence. By obtaining a careful medical history and performing a comprehensive physical examination, the primary care physician can initiate successful treatment for the majority of patients without the need for invasive testing. This article offers a comprehensive approach to the evaluation and management of urinary incontinence in women.

Overactive bladder (OAB) general principles—OAB is not a disease and no treatment is an acceptable choice after assessment, and clinicians should provide education regarding normal lower urinary tract function, what is known about OAB, the benefits vs. risks/burdens of alternatives, and that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options before it is achieved.

### The impact of urodynamics on treatment and outcomes in women with an overactive bladder: a longitudinal prospective follow-up study [^cbee99cc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Women who presented consecutively to the urogynaecology units in 22 centres in the UK were recruited into a prospective multicentre study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of bladder ultrasound (BUS study) in diagnosing detrusor overactivity (Fig. 1). The study was conducted based on good clinical practice guidelines and ethics approval was obtained (Nottingham Research Ethics committee REC: 10/H0408/57).

Fig. 1 
Study flow diagram. OAB overactive bladder, DO detrusor overactivity, USI urodynamic stress incontinence, QoL quality of life,

Women over 18 years of age with symptoms of frequency, urgency, and urge-predominant MUI were approached to participate in the study. Following consent, demographics and detailed clinical history were obtained. Women completed the ICIQ-OAB sf to determine the extent of the impact of their symptoms on quality of life (QoL). All women underwent UDS, using a standardized protocol based on the good urodynamic practice guidance. Questionnaire booklets were sent to women beyond 6 and 12 months post-test. This included a patient PGI-I, the ICIQ-OAB sf questionnaire and questions on medical and surgical treatments received by the patients. If no response was received within 4 weeks, reminders were sent. Women who did not respond within 8 weeks of the initial request were contacted by telephone and questionnaires were completed in a telephone interview with a member of the research team where possible.

With the aim of informing a cohesive analysis, we categorized diagnoses from UDS as follows: DO; DO plus USI; USI alone; and women with no demonstrable findings on UDS were defined as normal UDS. In a similar fashion, subsequent treatment data were categorized to be concordant with diagnoses as follows:
“DO surgery” for diagnosis including DO, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) or sacral neuromodulation and/or botulinum A toxin injections into the bladder.
“USI surgery” for diagnosis including USI, midurethral sling including tension-free vaginal tapes (retropubic or transobturator), fascial sling, bladder neck injection and colposuspension.
“Bladder relaxants”—antimuscarinics and Mirabegron use were considered concordant with a UDS diagnosis including DO or normal UDS
“No treatment” was considered concordant with a UDS diagnosis of normal UDS

### Misconceptions and miscommunication among aging women with overactive bladder symptoms [^6d5b6069]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To better understand aging women's experience with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms and the care they receive, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of care provided to aging women with overactive bladder.

Methods

Women seen in outpatient female urology clinics were identified by ICD-9 codes for OAB and recruited. Patients with painful bladder syndrome, mixed stress and urge incontinence, prolapse, or recent pelvic surgery were excluded. Patient focus groups were conducted by trained nonclinician moderators incorporating topics related to patients' perceptions of OAB physiology, symptoms, diagnostic evaluation, treatments, and outcomes. Qualitative data analysis was performed using grounded theory methodology.

Results

Five focus groups totaling 33 women with OAB were conducted. Average patient age was 67 years (range, 39-91). Older women with OAB lacked knowledge about the physiology of their disease and had poor understanding regarding the rationale for many diagnostic tests, including urodynamics and cystoscopy. The results of diagnostic studies often were not understood by older patients. Many women were dissatisfied with the care they had received. This lack of knowledge and understanding was more apparent among the elderly women in the group.

Conclusions

Findings demonstrated a poor understanding of the physiology of overactive bladder and the rationale for various diagnostic modalities and treatments. This was associated with dissatisfaction with care. There is a need for better communication with older women experiencing OAB symptoms about the physiology of the condition.

AUA/SUFU overactive bladder—potential indications for urodynamics include diagnostic uncertainty; mixed incontinence or insensate incontinence; obstructive voiding symptoms (e.g., overactive bladder [OAB] versus benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH], lower urinary tract symptoms [LUTS] after sling); neurologic diagnosis/possible neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD); elevated post-void residual (PVR) as part of initial evaluation or found after OAB therapy; and poor response to therapy.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^00407946]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Bladder function context—history should address fluid intake, medications, and medical/surgical conditions that can mimic or exacerbate OAB, with optional cognitive and frailty screening when relevant. Bladder function is dependent on factors including fluid intake, medications, medical conditions, and surgical history, and clinicians should inquire about the volume and type of daily fluid intake along with the number of daytime and nighttime voids and whether urgency contributes to frequency. Large volume fluid intake will certainly lead to more frequent voiding, but in the absence of bothersome or persistent urgency it is not considered pathologic. Current medications should be reviewed with special attention to diuretics and diabetic medications that cause glucosuria (i.e., SGLT2 inhibitors) as these patients may have urinary frequency, and urinary frequency without persistent urgency can point to polyuria secondary to fluid intake and/or medication rather than OAB. Co-morbid medical conditions can mimic OAB symptoms, exacerbate symptoms, or limit OAB treatment response, including recurrent UTI, poorly controlled diabetes, untreated sleep apnea, and prior pelvic surgeries including those for incontinence; impaired cognition and mobility may lead to functional incontinence. Clinicians may use the Mini Mental Status Exam as a standardized, quick, and reproducible means to assess cognitive impairment in patients who are at high risk, and the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS-9) is a visual tool to assess frailty in a clinical setting. The presence of neurological disorders with OAB symptoms is suggestive of NLUTD and should be evaluated according to The AUA/SUFU Guideline on Adult Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction: Diagnosis and Evaluation, and a history of pelvic malignancies, pelvic radiation, or concerns about foreign bodies in the urinary tract warrants additional evaluation.

### Multicomponent intervention for overactive bladder in women: a randomized clinical trial [^0559eaa8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy of a multicomponent intervention with cognitive components in improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for women with moderate to severe overactive bladder (OAB)?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 79 women, those who underwent four 30-minute weekly sessions of a multicomponent intervention had a significantly and clinically significant improvement in HRQOL scores compared with the waiting list control group.

Meaning

These findings provide evidence to support a multicomponent intervention with cognitive components as an effective treatment option for women with moderate to severe OAB by improving HRQOL.

### Surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence: AUA / SUFU guideline [^e5d8d8a8]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence—differential diagnosis and adjunct testing: “The second goal of a diagnostic evaluation in a woman with SUI is to assess the differential diagnosis of incontinence and evaluate the impact of coexisting conditions.” The differential includes “overflow incontinence (a clinical diagnosis)” and “detrusor overactivity incontinence, low bladder compliance, and stress-induced detrusor overactivity (urodynamic diagnoses).” “Other anatomic findings such as pelvic organ prolapse and number and location of urethral orifices can be diagnosed by physical examination and cystoscopy, respectively,” while “additional functional conditions, such as urethral obstruction and impaired or absent contractility, can be identified via urodynamics testing, including cystometry, non-invasive uroflow, pressure-flow study, and PVR assessment.” Urinary incontinence “may also occur due to a urethral diverticulum, urinary fistula, or an ectopic ureter.”

AUA/SUFU guideline—future directions and mechanisms in overactive bladder (OAB): “There is no gold standard therapy for OAB since no single treatment is universally effective,” so “Use of a multidimensional approach to care addresses the multifactorial nature of OAB.” Proposed mechanisms include “afferent or efferent nerve dysfunction; detrusor muscle disease; detrusor mucosal hypersensitivity; pelvic floor dysfunction; other pelvic organ anatomic distortion; the microbiome; and alterations in the central nervous system,” and “It is also possible that OAB is simply a precursor of other aging conditions, such as cognitive decline due to loss of frontal cortex inhibition.” Pharmacologic targets include “muscarinic receptors and β3 receptors” using “antimuscarinics and β3 agonists,” with potential roles for “cannabinoid and purinergic receptors,” and “Future drug development will yield more effective medical therapy for OAB with greater tolerability and less financial toxicity.” Regarding risks, “those that are most obvious such as age and sex assigned at birth are not modifiable,” whereas for “obesity and smoking” public education is emphasized; the page highlights “The PLUS research consortium” and that “Their RISE FOR HEALTH study will focus on the prevalence of bladder health in women and assess risk and protective factors… used for educational strategies to improve bladder health promotion and well-being across the life course.”

### Predictive factors for overactive bladder symptoms after pelvic organ prolapse surgery [^24ba4d41]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction and hypothesis

This study focussed on the factors which predict the presence of symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) after surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP).

Methods

Consecutive women who underwent POP surgery with or without the use of vaginal mesh materials in the years 2004–2007 were included. Assessments were made preoperatively and at follow-up, including physical examination (POP-Q) and standardised questionnaires (IIQ, UDI and DDI).

Results

Five hundred and five patients were included with a median follow-up of 12.7 (6–35) months. Bothersome OAB symptoms decreased after POP surgery. De novo bothersome OAB symptoms appeared in 5–6% of the women. Frequency and urgency were more likely to improve as compared with urge incontinence and nocturia. The best predictor for the absence of postoperative symptoms was the absence of preoperative bothersome OAB symptoms.

Conclusion

The absence of bothersome OAB symptoms preoperatively was the best predictor for the absence of postoperative symptoms.

### A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, efficacy and safety study of oxybutynin vaginal ring for alleviation of overactive bladder symptoms in women [^e18c51b2]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a once monthly oxybutynin vaginal ring in women with overactive bladder.

Materials and Methods

This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, 12-week phase 2 study compared oxybutynin vaginal ring (4 or 6 mg daily) to a placebo vaginal ring in women with well-defined overactive bladder symptoms. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to week 12 in the total weekly number of incontinence episodes (stress and urge). Safety was measured in terms of treatment emergent adverse events, laboratory, physical, gynecologic examinations, electrocardiogram and vital signs.

Results

After a 3-week post-randomization placebo run-in phase (sample size 720) 445 women entered the treatment phase (safety population). Of these women 323 met all 3 overactive bladder specific baseline characteristics of 10 or more urinary urge incontinence episodes weekly, urinary frequency 8 or more voids per 24 hours and voided volume 3 L or less per 24 hours) (analysis population). Women treated with 4 and 6 mg daily oxybutynin vaginal ring had significantly fewer incontinence episodes weekly (p = 0.036 and p = 0.018, respectively), lower daily urinary frequency (p = 0.014, p = 0.002) and a higher proportion had no incontinence episodes at week 12 (p = 0.026, p = 0.027) compared with placebo. The change in severity of urgency and voided volume was similar for all groups (p >0.05). Except for a higher incidence of dry mouth and urinary tract infections that were not always culture confirmed, the oxybutynin vaginal ring was well tolerated and had a safety profile similar to that of the placebo vaginal ring.

Conclusions

The oxybutynin vaginal ring appears to be an effective and safe once monthly treatment option for women with overactive bladder characterized primarily by urinary urge incontinence that merits further evaluation in a phase 3 study.
