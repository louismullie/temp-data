## Question

does vitamin c supplementation help support the immune system in healthy adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin C supplementation helps support the immune system in healthy adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "support the immune system" means mechanistically and clinically. Then, I should verify the biological plausibility of vitamin C's immune roles. Next, I will review randomized controlled trial evidence for prevention and treatment of respiratory infections in healthy adults. After that, I should examine subgroup effects, dose-response, and safety. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and state the bottom line clearly with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm what "support the immune system" entails in this context. Clinically, that usually means either reducing the incidence of infections, shortening their duration or severity, or improving validated immune markers; mechanistically, it includes maintaining epithelial barriers, supporting leukocyte function, and modulating oxidative stress and inflammation, all of which are nutrient-dependent processes during immune activation [^114PaMi7] [^115Ar4XT].

> I need to check the mechanistic rationale for vitamin C. Vitamin C is a required cofactor for collagen synthesis and thus supports epithelial integrity, and it participates in leukocyte migration, phagocytosis, NK cell activity, T-cell function, and antibody production; it also has antioxidant roles that can buffer oxidative stress during immune responses, which together provide a biologically plausible basis for immune support [^115Ar4XT] [^111rmFYK].

> Next, I should review prevention data in healthy adults. High-quality meta-analyses show a modest reduction in acute respiratory infection risk with vitamin C supplementation, on the order of about a 4% relative risk reduction, with pooled RRs around 0.96 and confidence intervals that just exclude 1, suggesting a small but statistically detectable effect in mixed adult populations. However, sensitivity analyses indicate this effect may be driven by subgroups under physical stress or by settings with lower baseline vitamin C status, and it is not a large, universal prevention effect in all healthy adults [^11478qMY] [^113jbpm2] [^115XMSJP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment effects. For duration and severity of colds, randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that regular vitamin C supplementation shortens cold duration by roughly 8% on average and may reduce severity during episodes; this effect is modest but reproducible across multiple analyses and aligns with the mechanistic expectation of faster recovery rather than dramatic prevention in replete individuals [^116n3583] [^11478qMY].

> I should double-check subgroup nuances. The clearest clinical benefit appears in people exposed to high physical stress, such as athletes, soldiers, or those in subarctic conditions, where trials show larger reductions in incidence and duration. Additionally, effects may be stronger in men and in middle-income country settings, whereas high-income, generally well-nourished populations show smaller or null effects, reinforcing that baseline status and context matter [^115Ar4XT] [^113jbpm2] [^115XMSJP].

> Let me consider dose and regimen. Moderate daily doses in the 500–1000 mg range are associated with the observed modest benefits, whereas very high chronic intakes above 1500–2000 mg/day do not clearly improve outcomes and may increase gastrointestinal adverse effects. Importantly, there is no robust dose-response for prevention beyond this moderate range, and exceeding the tolerable upper intake level should be avoided outside specific clinical contexts [^115XMSJP] [^113ipR3e].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. At typical supplemental doses up to about 1 g/day, vitamin C is generally safe, with gastrointestinal upset being the most common issue; higher chronic doses can cause diarrhea, nausea, and may increase risk of hyperoxaluria or nephrolithiasis in susceptible individuals, so routine megadosing is not advisable without a clinical indication [^113ipR3e] [^115ukJBw].

> But wait, what if baseline status is already adequate. The principle that benefits are most apparent when correcting deficiency or suboptimal status applies here; in well-nourished, replete adults, additional vitamin C may have limited incremental benefit, whereas those with low intakes or higher demands may experience more measurable improvements in immune resilience and recovery, which is consistent with broader nutritional immunology principles [^112w4mG1] [^114PaMi7].

> Next, I should review how this translates into practice. For generally healthy adults who consume adequate fruits and vegetables, routine vitamin C supplementation is not necessary to "boost" immunity, but a modest daily supplement in the 500–1000 mg range may confer a small reduction in cold duration and a slight reduction in respiratory infection risk, with the clearest advantage in those with low dietary intake, older adults, smokers, or people under physical stress. Diet-first strategies remain foundational, and supplements should be viewed as adjuncts rather than substitutes for diverse, minimally processed plant foods [^1111mESW] [^112w4mG1] [^11478qMY].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure I'm not overstating. Yes, vitamin C supplementation can provide modest immune support in healthy adults by slightly reducing the risk and shortening the duration of respiratory infections, with the magnitude of benefit contingent on baseline status and exposure to stressors. This is not a dramatic "immunity boost", and it does not replace the broader immune benefits of a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and physical activity [^11478qMY] [^113jbpm2] [^1111mESW].

Vitamin C supports **immune function** in healthy adults by enhancing epithelial barriers, leukocyte activity, and antioxidant defenses [^115Ar4XT] [^111rmFYK]. Routine supplementation **does not prevent colds** in most people, but it can modestly reduce duration and severity, especially in those with low intake or under physical stress [^114QVUQL] [^116W3y9o]. Benefits are small and context-dependent; a balanced diet is the **primary strategy**, with supplementation considered for those with suboptimal intake or specific needs [^112w4mG1] [^1111mESW].

## Mechanisms of vitamin C in immune function

Vitamin C supports immunity through several mechanisms:

- **Epithelial barrier integrity**: Maintains skin and mucosal barriers, reducing pathogen entry [^115Ar4XT].

- **Leukocyte function**: Enhances neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and microbial killing [^115Ar4XT].

- **Antioxidant protection**: Scavenges free radicals, protecting immune cells from oxidative stress [^116GXahL].

- **Immune cell proliferation**: Supports T and B lymphocyte function and antibody production [^115Ar4XT].

---

## Clinical evidence on vitamin C supplementation and immune outcomes

### Prevention of infections

- **Common cold**: Routine vitamin C does not prevent colds in the general population, but reduces incidence in those exposed to extreme physical stress (e.g. athletes, soldiers) [^114QVUQL].

- **Respiratory infections**: Meta-analyses show a modest reduction in risk of acute respiratory infections (ARI) with vitamin C (RR ~0.96) [^11478qMY] [^113jbpm2].

---

### Duration and severity of infections

Vitamin C supplementation **modestly reduces cold duration and severity** in adults, with an average reduction of about 8% in duration and less severe symptoms during episodes [^116n3583] [^11478qMY]. Evidence for pneumonia is limited; some studies suggest reduced incidence and severity in those with low baseline vitamin C, but overall evidence remains limited and heterogeneous [^112vKzcT].

---

## Factors influencing efficacy

Several factors influence the **efficacy of vitamin C supplementation**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on efficacy** |
|-|-|
| Baseline vitamin C status | Greater benefit in deficient or suboptimal status |
| Dose and duration | Moderate doses (200–1000 mg/day) over weeks to months are effective |
| Population characteristics | Greater benefit in smokers, older adults, and those under physical stress |
| Formulation | Ascorbic acid is standard; no clear superiority of other forms |

---

## Recommended dietary intake and safety considerations

- **RDA**: 75 mg/day for women, 90 mg/day for men.

- **UL**: 2000 mg/day; higher doses may cause GI upset, diarrhea, and rare nephrolithiasis [^115XMSJP].

- **Safety**: Generally safe at recommended doses; monitor for GI effects at higher doses [^115XMSJP].

---

## Comparison with other micronutrients

Vitamin C is one of several micronutrients that support immunity. Vitamin D has **stronger evidence for reducing respiratory infection risk**, especially in deficient individuals [^116eHGg3] [^111rKdT8]. Zinc also shows a **modest reduction in cold duration**, particularly when taken within 24 hours of symptom onset [^112zR5kX] [^11478qMY].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Diet first**: Emphasize fruits and vegetables (e.g. citrus, berries, bell peppers, broccoli) to meet vitamin C needs [^115ukJBw].

- **Supplementation**: Consider 200–1000 mg/day for those with low intake, smokers, older adults, or under physical stress [^115XMSJP].

- **Avoid excess**: Stay below the UL to minimize adverse effects [^115XMSJP].

---

Vitamin C supports immune function in healthy adults, but **routine supplementation offers modest benefits** — primarily reducing cold duration and severity in specific contexts. A balanced diet remains the cornerstone; supplementation is best targeted to those with low intake or increased needs.

Steps to take to support the immune system through good nutrition

The foregoing discussion highlights that a number of vitamins (A, B6, B12, folate, C, D and E) and trace elements (zinc, copper, selenium, iron) are vital for supporting immune function. Other essential nutrients including other vitamins and trace elements, amino acids and fatty acids are also important in this regard. The understanding of the importance of these nutrients in immunity and in ensuring the host is better able to cope with pathogen exposure comes from states of deficiency (either experimental or 'real world') and their reversal. Thus, it is clear that situations of frank essential nutrient deficiency impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infections and that these two outcomes can both be prevented or reversed by treating the deficiency(ies). This may be through diet or in some cases may require supplementation or some other form of therapeutic administration, depending on the nutrient, the extent of the deficiency and the setting. Moving away from frank deficiency, there will be individuals in all populations who have 'suboptimal' intakes and status of one or more essential nutrients. It is not entirely clear the extent to which immune function in those individuals will be compromised. However, it seems likely that individuals with suboptimal intakes of a range of essential nutrients are likely to show suboptimal immune responses; this probably contributes to the variation in immune outcomes that is seen in the general population. In the interests of assuring the best possible immune response if an individual becomes infected, it would seem prudent to consume sufficient amounts of essential nutrients, although in most cases these amounts are not explicitly defined. Table 4 lists good dietary sources of key nutrients that support the immune system. This listing conveys that the best diet to support the immune system is one with a diverse and varied intake of vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, seeds, grains and pulses along with some meats, eggs, dairy products and oily fish. This diet is consistent with those regarded as generally healthyand is consistent with current dietary guidelines. Such a diet would preclude too much processed and 'junk' food and excessive amounts of saturated fat and sugar. A randomised controlled trial of > 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day compared with < 2 servings per day in older people (age 65 to 85 years) reported a better response to pneumococcal vaccination in the group consuming the higher amount of fruits and vegetables, although the response to tetanus vaccination was not different between the two groups. Human trials suggest that the intakes of some micronutrients needed to optimally support the immune system are likely to be in excess of intakes that can easily be achieved through diet alone. This is the case for vitamins C, D and E and zinc and selenium. There may be a role for immune-targeted supplements to achieve the intakes of these nutrients necessary to fully support the immune system. In addition to considering the 'direct' effects of nutrition on the immune system, many plant foods, fibre and fermented foods play a role in creating and maintaining a healthy gut microbiotathat will also help to support the immune system.

### Vitamin C as a cardioprotective agent against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity [^115D3aVq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

VITAMIN C

Vitamin C is an essential water‐soluble nutrient with profound biological significance. As a potent antioxidant, vitamin C plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals and ROS that can cause cellular damage. Beyond the antioxidant properties of vitamin C, it is integral to collagen synthesis and aids in the maintenance of connective tissues and promotes wound healing. Moreover, vitamin C supports immune function by enhancing the immune cell activity and contributes to the synthesis of neurotransmitters and hormones. The potential role of vitamin C in mitigating oxidative stress‐related damage, including that induced by chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin, emphasizes its therapeutic potential in supporting overall health and well‐being.

Structure, Source

Vitamin C, chemically known as ascorbic acid (Figure 1), is essential for its antioxidant properties and serves as a cofactor in various enzymatic reactions involved in collagen synthesis, neurotransmitter production, and immune function. Plant‐based foods are considered the primary dietary sources of vitamin C, and alongside other plant components such as vitamin E (alpha‐tocopherol), may be effective scavengers of ROS. Diets, rich in plant‐based sources, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been linked to protection against cancer and cardiovascular disease. Although citrus fruits are considered the main source for vitamin C, studies have shown that Brassica vegetables can also contribute significantly, and up to 50% of the relative dietary intake of vitamin C could be provided naturally, depending on the daily habits of the consumers and regional dietary patterns. In the study of García‐Closas et al, fruits (particularly oranges) accounted for 51% of vitamin C intake, with vegetables like tomatoes and sweet peppers contributing 20%, followed by juices and drinks and potatoes with 7% and 4%, respectively.

The human body relies entirely on dietary sources to meet the daily requirements of vitamin C. Because vitamin C is water soluble, excess is excreted through urine, necessitating regular dietary consumption to maintain adequate levels in the body.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1149kox8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Vitamin D and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — vitamin D has an immune-modulating role and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of exacerbations; vitamin D levels are lower in people with COPD than in healthy individuals. Some, but not all studies have shown that supplementation in people with severe deficiency results in a 50% reduction in episodes and hospital admission. Therefore, it is recommended that all patients hospitalized for exacerbations should be assessed and investigated for severe deficiency (< 10 ng/ml or < 25 nM) followed by supplementation if required.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on peripheral regulatory T cells and β cell function in healthy humans: a randomized controlled trial [^116ySD2h]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing evidence supports the role of vitamin D (vitD) in modifying the risk to develop type 1 diabetes (T1D) and other autoimmune diseases. VitD3 might stimulate regulatory T cells (Tregs), a central player in the maintenance of self-tolerance. In addition, direct effects of vitD on β-cell function are postulated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of a high dose vitD supplementation on Tregs frequency (%Tregs) and β-cell function assessed by a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) in healthy humans.

Methods

A double-blind, placebo controlled trial was performed in 59 healthy adult subjects (49% females). Subjects received oral vitD3 (140,000 IU monthly) or placebo for 3 months. %Tregs within 20,000 CD4+ T cells of peripheral blood was determined by multi-parametric FACS-analysis. A liquid MMTT was carried out before and after treatment.

Results

%Tregs increased significantly in the vitD group, but remained unchanged in the placebo group. Fasting C-peptide concentrations did not change significantly in either group. Similarly, the mean AUC for C-peptide after 3 months and the change in mean values from baseline to the end of the treatment were comparable in both groups.

Conclusions

A short time high dose vitD3 supplementation significantly increased the frequency of Tregs, but did not further improve β-cell function in apparently healthy subjects. The immunomodulatory potential of vitD might be an important mechanistic link for the association of vitD and T1D.

### Serum antioxidant vitamins and respiratory morbidity and mortality: a pooled analysis [^112Z1bTa]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamin A plays an important role in the proliferation and maintenance of epithelial cells in the lung. Evidence from animal models has long suggested a possible link between vitamin A and COPD. For instance, weanling rats fed with a diet poor in vitamin A for 6 weeks have been shown to develop emphysema independently of exposure to cigarette smoke. Other animal studies have reproduced these findings and confirmed that retinoic acid could reduce the risk of COPD. Yet, epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between vitamin A and respiratory disorders in adults have reported conflicting results. In our study, vitamin A levels were not associated with respiratory morbidity, but our longitudinal analysis demonstrated that a 30-percent decrease in vitamin A levels was associated with a 103% increase in CLRD mortality, albeit only among NHANES III participants who did not use vitamin supplements. Decreasing vitamin A levels were also associated with a 61% increase in CLRD mortality among smoking NHANES III participants. Although vitamin A deficiency was uncommon among U.S. adults, vitamin A levels were significantly lower among participants who did not use vitamin supplements than in those who reported supplemental vitamin use. Insufficient vitamin A intake and vitamin A deficiency have been associated with histopathological changes within the respiratory tract that can disrupt physiological functions and lead to severe tissue dysfunction in the lung. In addition to its critical role in the maintenance of healthy immune responses and epithelial integrity, vitamin A can affect pathogen control. In NHANES, lower vitamin A levels were associated with increased mortality risk from influenza/pneumonia. Although this association did not quite reach statistical significance, our results support previous findings that have shown vitamin A to influence host response to influenza virus infection.

### Overview of oxidative stress and the role of micronutrients in critical illness [^114MPdES]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Inflammation and oxidative stress represent physiological response mechanisms to different types of stimuli and injury during critical illness. Its proper regulation is fundamental to cellular and organismal survival and are paramount to outcomes and recovery from critical illness. A proper maintenance of the delicate balance between inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune response is crucial for resolution from critical illness with important implications for patient outcome. The extent of inflammation and oxidative stress under normal conditions is limited by the antioxidant defense system of the human body, whereas the antioxidant capacity is commonly significantly compromised, and serum levels of micronutrients and vitamins significantly depleted in patients who are critically ill. Hence, the provision of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients may help to reduce the extent of oxidative stress and therefore improve clinical outcomes in patients who are critically ill. As existing evidence of the beneficial effects of antioxidant supplementation in patients who are critically ill is still unclear, actual findings about the most promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidative candidates selenium, vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin D will be discussed in this narrative review. The existing evidence provided so far demonstrates that several factors need to be considered to determine the efficacy of an antioxidant supplementation strategy in patients who are critically ill and indicates the need for adequately designed multicenter prospective randomized control trials to evaluate the clinical significance of different types and doses of micronutrients and vitamins in selected groups of patients with different types of critical illness.

### Vitamin requirements during stem cell transplantation: a systematic review [^111XnC1Q]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The findings from this current systematic review must take into consideration the possible limitations of the studies included. Firstly, measurement of plasma micronutrient levels in the presence of systematic inflammation may be unreliable and results may not be representative of true nutritional status. Therefore, interpretation and accuracy of vitamin serum levels and nutrition biomarkers taken from critically ill patients must be considered. As SCT patients often see fluctuations of their blood serum levels, this may not be indicative of their current nutritional status. Only two of the studies reported on inflammatory markers that impact serum vitamin levels, such as C-reactive protein. Comparison between studies was difficult due to variations in the definitions of deficiency, differences in the diagnoses of OM or GvHD, limited reporting at timepoints and/or lack of statistical analysis reported. Most of the studies did not record oral intake or did not clearly specify the formulas used for nutrition support therapy, meaning analysis of these confounding factors could not be completed. Of the seven studies that reported the use of PN support, only three stated the duration of the supplementation period and only one of these studies commented on the adherence.

Overall, a limited number of studies were found in this review, with the weight of the literature focusing on the efficacy of EN or PN protocols rather than investigating the micronutrient requirements of this patient group. Additionally, due to the exclusion of studies focusing on a GvHD population, this review did not capture data that may have highlighted the differing nutritional needs of this group. In particular, the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency observed in previous research. Therefore, the importance of Vitamin D in immune function following SCT may be underrepresented in this review. As this review had a specific focus on vitamins and not vitamin derivatives, it may have excluded papers showing a possible link between supplementing varying derivatives of vitamins and improved clinical outcome, for example, Folinic Acid. Lastly, few studies examined the adult population specifically, with the majority of existing research in this area being within the paediatric population or including a mix of adults and children. This review has identified further opportunities for future research, such as the evaluation of trace element/ mineral requirements during SCT and micronutrient requirements during chronic GvHD.

### Vital role for primary healthcare providers: urgent need to educate the community about daily nutritional self-care to support immune function and maintain health [^1111mESW]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2023). High credibility.

Providing adequate nutrients to support immune function is an easily modifiable, high-priority self-care measure that can help to maintain general health. Improving nutritional status helps to maximise immune protection against infections and may protect against the development of inflammatory/immune-mediated diseases. Although more research is necessary, there is a good rationale based on mechanistic data to postulate that supporting immune function through nutrition on a daily basis could have a beneficial effect on maintaining homeostatic mechanisms throughout the body and may help protect against chronic diseases.

Minimally processed, naturally nutrient-dense foods are the preferred way to fill micronutrient gaps, with fruits, berries and vegetables in particular containing numerous micronutrients and several classes of bioactive compounds (eg, polyphenols, carotenoids, etc) that have immunomodulatory effects. However, the body may not be able to obtain all the nutrients it needs from the diet alone, particularly in some subgroups of the population. Geographical, sociological and lifestyle factors, combined with constant exposure to pathogens and other immunological challenges, can contribute to insufficient micronutrient intakes. Even in high-income countries, suboptimal micronutrient levels are common throughout the life course. Data indicate that daily intakes of vitamins A, C, D, E and B12, calcium, iron and zinc — all essential for immune function — fall below recommended intakes in some adultsand throughout the life course, even in seemingly healthy people. As increasing dietary diversity to meet daily requirements is desirable but can be hard to achieve in reality for many people, particularly for certain vitamins and minerals. In such cases, a supplement containing multiple micronutrients known to support immune function could be a simple and cost-effective way of complementing the diet and closing some nutritional gaps. A healthcare provider should always be consulted first to ensure that the consumer can safely use a micronutrient supplement, that they are using a certified product, and that they are not only aware of the potential benefits but also of the upper tolerable limits. Furthermore, it is important that they are advised where they are able to access evidence-based information from credible sources, and to always check the often misleading information contained in social media posts, for example.

### Low-dose supplementation with lycopene or β-carotene does not enhance cell-mediated immunity in healthy free-living elderly humans [^113z4TT7]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of supplementation with the carotenoids, beta-carotene or lycopene, at levels achievable within a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, on immune function in a group of free-living healthy elderly.

Design

A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. T cell subsets and the expression of functionally associated cell surface molecules, quantified by flow cytometry, and lectin-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, were compared before and following the treatment period.

Subjects

Fifty-eight subjects aged over 65 y were recruited; 52 were included in the final analysis.

Interventions

Participants received one placebo, one lycopene (13.3 mg) or one beta-carotene (8.2 mg) capsule daily for 12 weeks.

Results

No significant differences were observed in any of the parameters examined following either lycopene or beta-carotene supplementation.

Conclusions

In well-nourished, free-living, healthy elderly individuals, supplementation with relatively low levels of beta-carotene or lycopene is not associated with either a beneficial or detrimental effects on several aspects of cell-mediated immunity.

### Vital role for primary healthcare providers: urgent need to educate the community about daily nutritional self-care to support immune function and maintain health [^113pP3cx]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2023). High credibility.

The importance of self-care to improve health and social well-being is well recognised. Nevertheless, there remains a need to encourage people to better understand how their body works, and how to keep it healthy. Because of its important role, part of this understanding should be based on why the immune system must be supported. This highly complex system is essential for defending against pathogens, but also for maintaining health throughout the body by preserving homeostasis and integrity. Accordingly, the immune system requires active management for optimal functioning and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. In addition to regular exercise, healthy sleeping patterns, cultivating mental resilience, adequate nutrition through healthy and diverse dietary habits is key to the daily support of immune function. Diet and the immune system are closely intertwined, and a poor diet will impair immunity and increase the risk of acute and chronic diseases. To help elucidate the roles of primary healthcare providers in supporting individuals to engage in self-care, an international group of experts reviewed the evidence for the roles of the immune system in maintaining health and for nutrition in daily immune support, and discussed implications for population health and clinical practice.

### Nutrition, immunity and COVID-19 [^115ikjo4]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Summary and conclusions

The immune system protects the host from pathogenic organisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites). To deal with such an array of threats, the human immune system has evolved to include a myriad of specialised cell types, communicating molecules and functional responses. The immune system is always active, carrying out surveillance, but its activity is enhanced if an individual becomes infected. This heightened activity is accompanied by an increased rate of metabolism, requiring energy sources, substrates for biosynthesis and regulatory molecules, which are all ultimately derived from the diet. Through experimental research and studies of people with deficiencies, a number of vitamins (A, B6, B12, folate, C, D and E) and trace elements (zinc, copper, selenium, iron) have been demonstrated to have key roles in supporting the human immune system and reducing risk of infections. Other essential nutrients including other vitamins and trace elements, amino acids and fatty acids are also important in this regard. All of nutrients named above have roles in supporting antibacterial and antiviral defences but zinc and selenium seem to be particularly important for the latter. It would seem prudent for individuals to consume sufficient amounts of essential nutrients to support their immune system to help them to deal with pathogens should they become infected. Consumption of a diet of diverse and varied plant-based and animal-based foods that is consistent with current healthy eating guidelines would be best to support the immune system. However, human trials suggest that the intakes of some micronutrients (vitamins C, D and E and zinc and selenium) needed to optimally support the immune system are in excess of intakes that can easily be achieved through diet alone and in this case supplementation might be considered. The gut microbiota plays a role in educating and regulating the immune system and gut dysbiosis is a feature of disease including many infectious diseases. Therefore, dietary approaches to achieve a healthy microbiota can also benefit the immune system. There is evidence that probiotic bacteria, particularly some lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, can modify the microbiota, modulate the immune response and protect against infections, including of the respiratory tract. Many plant foods, fibre and fermented foods play a role in creating and maintaining a healthy gut microbiota and so will also help to support the immune system. Thus, specific nutrients and the foods that provide them can play a role in supporting the immune system in order that the host can better defend against bacteria and viruses if infected. Therefore, having a healthy diet could be an important factor, but one of many, in determining outcome in individuals should they become infected with coronavirus. However, it is important to note that there are no published nutrition studies in the context of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. Chinese researchers have noted dysbiosis in patients with severe COVID-19 and have recommended treatment with probiotics, but it is not clear whether this was done and, if it was, whether it was successful in improving clinical outcome. Severe infection of the respiratory epithelium can lead to ARDS, characterised by excessive and damaging host inflammation, termed a cytokine storm. This is seen in cases of severe COVID-19. There is evidence from ARDS in other settings that the cytokine storm can be controlled by the n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, possibly through their metabolism to SPMs. This therapeutic approach has not been attempted in severe COVID-19 and warrants investigation.

### Prepandemic prevalence of dietary supplement use for immune benefits [^112RmExc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Dietary supplement use is common in the US, and over 25 000 supplement labels in the Dietary Supplement Label Database (DSLD) display the word immune or immunity, suggesting immune benefits are a prevalent and marketable motivation for dietary supplement use. These motivations may impact nutrient intake and modify health behaviors. However, Crawford et alfound dietary supplement labeling related to immune benefits can be misleading. Utilizing the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, this study investigates the prevalence of using dietary supplements to prevent colds or boost the immune system (herein referred to as perceived immune benefits), and if label claims or health care professional recommendations influence use of dietary supplements for perceived immune benefits.

### Respiratory viral infections in children with asthma: do they matter and can we prevent them? [^114QVUQL]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

General immunologic strategies

Immune function and anti-viral defenses have a number of components, both specific and non-specific. Asthmatic children can improve their immune function by following some simple advice including a healthy life style with regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep and avoiding environmental tobacco smoke, stress and unnecessary antibiotics.

Exercise

Exercise has anti-inflammatory effects and in the long term can protect the development of chronic diseases and obesity. Regular exercise of moderate-intensity is associated with a reduced incidence of upper respiratory tract infection. However, long hours of intensive training appear to make children more susceptible to upper respiratory tract infections. The recommended means of aerobic exercise is walking, with an optimal frequency of three to five days a week and an optimal duration of 20 to 30 minutes of continuous activity. In a recent study, the IgA secretion rate was negatively correlated with the incidence of infections. A recent randomized trial comparing meditation and exercise with wait-list control among adults aged 50 years and older found significant reductions in ARI illness.

Diet

Malnutrition is the most common cause of immune deficiency worldwide and a balanced diet is fundamental for a healthy immune system. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk of infections, early-life wheeze and reduced asthma control. Vitamin A derivatives are involved in the regulation of the immune system and tissue inflammation as well as prevention of respiratory infections. Zinc, selenium and other trace elements are necessary for function of both innate and adaptive immune function. A high intake of fruit and vegetables ensures adequate consumption of nutrients and antioxidants and appears to be beneficial for asthma. Although recent reviews have shown that zinc, garlic, Echinacea purpurea or Ginseng supplementation for several months may reduce cold incidence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend any vitamin or mineral supplementation in the management of asthmatic children without nutrient deficiency. However, a large controlled trial showed Echinacea was ineffective in reducing infection rate or symptom severity of HRV infection in healthy young adult volunteers. Vitamin C supplementation failed to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population except in those exposed to short periods of extreme physical stress. Finally, it is worth remembering that infants who are not breastfed have significantly higher risk of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other infections, as breast milk is a biologically active substance containing antimicrobial and immunomodulatory elements.

### A review of probiotic supplementation in healthy adults: helpful or hype? [^117SWF5S]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Probiotic supplements have a positive impact on several health outcomes. However, the majority of published studies have focused on populations with specific health pathologies. Therefore, this study reviewed the current literature on the health effects of probiotic consumption in "healthy adults". The findings from this review may help guide consumers, researchers, and manufacturers regarding probiotic supplementation. Relevant literature published between 1990 and August 2017 was reviewed. Studies were included if they were experimental trials, included healthy adults, used live bacteria, and had accessible full-text articles published in English. Included studies were classified according to common foci that emerged. Forty-five studies were included in this review. Five foci emerged: gut microbiota changes (n = 15); immune system response (n = 16); lipid profile and cardiovascular disease risk (n = 14); gastrointestinal discomfort (n = 11); and female reproductive health (n = 4). Results suggest that probiotic supplementation in healthy adults can lead to transient improvement in gut microbiota concentration of supplement-specific bacteria. Evidence also supports the role of probiotics in improving immune system responses, stool consistency, bowel movement, and vaginal lactobacilli concentration. There is insufficient evidence to support the role of probiotics to improve blood lipid profile. Probiotic consumption can improve in the immune, gastrointestinal, and female reproductive health systems in healthy adults. However, this review failed to support the ability of probiotics to cause persistent changes in gut microbiota, or improve lipid profile in healthy adults. The feasibility of probiotics consumption to provide benefits in healthy adults requires further investigation.

### Dietary micronutrients in the wake of COVID-19: an appraisal of evidence with a focus on high-risk groups and preventative healthcare [^113HKZhN]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

There are as of yet few, if any published studies on the precise role of nutrition in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Defining this to provide evidence-informed guidelines will require more carefully designed studies, that first use available data from population and patient sources. This should be followed by ethically approved and applicable intervention studies, where the data suggest that these are appropriate. Unfortunately, given the speed at which the situation is developing, this has been challenging. In the absence of such evidence, the best option has been to synthesise published evidence and make reasonable assumptions and extrapolations based on previous knowledge of the relationship between nutrition, immunity and infections. What is clear is that conditions of nutrient deficiency impair the functioning of the immune system and increase susceptibility to infection. Importantly, both of these consequences can be reversed by correcting the deficiency. For now, there is a strong case to be made for a focus on achieving micronutrient adequacy alongside attention to overall nutritional status, which has proven to play an important part in infection prevention and treatment, particularly in those at highest risk.

### Nutrition, immunity and COVID-19 [^115Ar4XT]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin C, immunity and infection

There are reviews of the role of vitamin C in immunity and in host susceptibility to infection. These reviews contain citations to the many studies of vitamin C, immunity and infection that will be summarised here. Vitamin C is required for collagen biosynthesis and is vital for maintaining epithelial integrity. It also has roles in several aspects of immunity, including leucocyte migration to sites of infection, phagocytosis and bacterial killing, natural killer cell activity, T lymphocyte function (especially of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes) and antibody production. Jacob et al showed that a vitamin C-deficient diet in healthy young adult humans decreased mononuclear cell vitamin C content by 50% and decreased the T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses to recall antigens. Vitamin C deficiency in animal models increases susceptibility to a variety of infections. People deficient in vitamin C are susceptible to severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. A meta-analysis reported a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia with vitamin C supplementation, particularly in individuals with low dietary intakes(table 1). Vitamin C supplementation has also been shown to decrease the duration and severity of upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold, especially in people under enhanced physical stress.

### Cellular and metabolic mechanisms of nutrient actions in immune function [^116paH5B]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Various nutrients can change cell structure, cellular metabolism, and cell function which is particularly important for cells of the immune system as nutrient availability is associated with the activation and function of diverse immune subsets. The most important nutrients for immune cell function and fate appear to be glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamin D. This perspective will describe recently published information describing the mechanism of action of prominent nutritional intervention agents where evidence exists as to their action and potency.

### Comparative effectiveness of oral nutritional supplements in preventing respiratory tract infections among adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115XMSJP]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Two meta-analyses found that VD supplementation reduced the incidence of COVID-19 and influenza, but neither explored the dose-dependency of VD effects. The relationship between VD dosage and RTIs remains controversial. A recent meta-analysis showed that ≥ 2000 IU/day VD (RR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.96) was more effective than < 2000 IU/day (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98) in preventing adult RTIs. In this NMA, high-dose VD was found to have a good effect in preventing COVID-19 or influenza. High-dose vitamin D exerts multiple immunomodulatory effects on innate and adaptive immune cells, enhances the antibacterial activity of macrophages, and improves immune health and defense against infectious diseases.

We found that moderate-dose VC (501–1000 mg/day) were also effective in preventing RTIs. No dose-response relationship between VC supplementation and adult RTIs has been established. This study showed an inverted U-shaped relationship between VC dosage and RTI risk. Vitamin C plays a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity, affecting epithelial barriers, supporting phagocytosis, and enhancing lymphocyte differentiation. However, studies indicate that daily supplementation exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (2000 mg) in adults may cause adverse reactions such as diarrhea, headaches, gastrointestinal discomfort, and an increased risk of other diseases, impacting patients' quality of life and potentially reducing compliance. Interestingly, our dose-response meta-analysis showed that the effect of vitamin C in preventing RTIs begins to weaken at doses greater than 1500 mg/day, which may be related to the above. A previous meta-analysis found that moderate-dose vitamin C significantly reduces adult RTIs (RR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99), consistent with our findings. However, a Cochrane review suggested this effect is only significant in participants under severe physical stress (RR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.64), not the general population (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.00). Sensitivity analysis in our study showed that when excluding studies involving high-intensity-trained populations, the effect of moderate-dose vitamin C lost statistical significance. Therefore, further research is needed to establish the preventive effect of vitamin C on RTIs in the general adult population.

### Selenium and immune function: a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental human studies [^113n6usj]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Selenium is an essential trace element with both beneficial and detrimental effects on health depending on dose and chemical form. Currently, there is debate on recommendations for selenium supplementation as a public health measure to improve immune function and reduce infectious disease susceptibility.

Objectives

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental studies assessing the effect of selenium supplementation on immunity-related outcomes in healthy people.

Methods

We undertook a search of published and unpublished studies in literature databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov up to 17 October, 2022, and performed a meta-analysis comparing the effects on immunity-related outcomes between Se-supplemented versus control arms. Whenever possible we assessed the nonlinear relation using a dose-response approach.

Results

9 trials were included, 5 in North America, and 4 in Europe, with a duration between 8 and 48 weeks and supplementation of both inorganic and organic selenium forms. Selenium supplementation did not substantially affect immunoglobulin or white blood cell concentrations, and the dose-response meta-analysis indicated that an increase in plasma selenium concentrations above 100 μg/L did not further increase IgA levels nor T cells. An inverted U-shaped relation emerged for NK cell count, with a lower number of these cells both below and above 120 μg/L. The only beneficial effect of selenium supplementation was the increased activity for NK lysis, but the available data did not permit dose-response analysis. Cytokine levels were substantially unaffected by selenium supplementation.

Conclusions

Although some of the data suggested beneficial effects of selenium supplementation on immune function, the overall picture appears to be inconsistent and heterogeneous due to differences in trial duration and interventions, plus evidence of null and even detrimental effects. Overall, the evidence that we extracted from the literature in this systematic review does not support the need to supplement selenium beyond the recommended dietary intake to obtain beneficial effects on immune function. This trial was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42022312280).

### Nutrition and immunity: lessons for COVID-19 [^111qmu2S]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Zinc supports the activity of many cells of the immune system, helps to control oxidative stress and inflammation and has specific anti-viral actions including inhibiting the replication of coronaviruses. Zinc supplementation improves some markers of immunity especially in older people or those with low zinc intake, improves vaccination responses and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of zinc supplementation report reduced incidence of diarrhoeal and respiratory tract infections (see ref. for references). Multiple studies report an association between low zinc status and increased susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 (e.g.). Zinc supplementation in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is reported to reduce risk of poor outcome including mortality.

In contrast to the large literature on vitamin D and zinc that has emerged during the pandemic, there has been less research on selenium. Nevertheless, selenium may have important roles in supporting the immune system in general and in promoting anti-viral immunity in particular. Selenium supports the activity of many cells of the immune system and helps to control oxidative stress and inflammation. Extensive research in mice has shown that selenium deficiency impairs immune responses, increases susceptibility to viral infection, permits viruses (including influenza viruses) to mutate, and allows normally weak viruses to become more virulent. Selenium supplementation improves some markers of immunity especially in older people or those with low selenium intake; for example a supplementation study conducted in UK adults with marginal selenium status showed that selenium improved ex vivo anti-viral immune responses, promoted viral clearance and decreased viral mutation. Several studies report an association between low selenium status and increased susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 (e.g.).

### Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in critical illness-the known knowns and known unknowns [^115w2Hgj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The known unknowns

The optimum range for vitamin D and what level to aim for?

In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report based on examination of data by a group of experts. They estimated that a vitamin D level of 50 nmol/L or higher was adequate for good bone health, and a level < 50 was considered a vitamin D deficiency.

In 2011, the Endocrine Society issued a report urging a much higher minimum blood level of vitamin D. The society's clinical practice guideline was developed by experts in the field assigned to a Vitamin D Task Force, and based on all the evidence they recommended a minimum vitamin D level of 75 nmol/L and, because of the vagaries of some of the assays, levels between 100 and 150 nmol/L to guarantee sufficiency for both children and adults. These reference ranges are determined by levels of vitamin D that achieve maximal parathyroid hormone suppression. However, this method for identifying the optimal level of vitamin D remains controversial; the relationship between serum 25 hydroxy-D and parathyroid hormone is inconsistent, and no clear threshold defining "sufficiency" has been established.

These recommendations from the Endocrine Society pertain to patients at risk of complications related to vitamin D deficiency, while those from the IOM on the other hand relate to healthy individuals.

Interestingly, although low levels of vitamin D have been associated with higher mortality and poor health outcomes, high levels may not be beneficial and could even be harmful. The first reports of a U-shaped or reverse J-shaped relationship were for prostate cancer. Subsequently, this has been shown in other groups including with all-cause mortality.

Importantly, based on level of risk there is unlikely to be one single optimum level. For patients at high risk of poor bone health or colorectal cancer, accepting the potential risks of higher 25 hydroxy-D levels may be warranted to gain maximum possible benefits. In addition to variation in the optimum level between individuals, the optimum level for different cellular functions and target actions within the same individual may be different; for example the bone health target may differ from that required for immune function.

### Micronutrient supplementation in adults with HIV infection [^1152iktD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

How the intervention might work

Micronutrients play a critical role in the maintenance of a functional immune system. The interactions between micronutrients and the components of the immune response are multifaceted and complex Chandra 1997; Raiten 2015). Several observational studies have suggested that micronutrient deficiencies may hasten clinical disease progression in HIV‐positive adults. Low blood levels of vitamin A, B12, zinc, and selenium have been related to increased HIV progression (Graham 1991; Kupka 2004; Tang 1997) or death in this population (Baum 1997; Baum 2003; Semba 1993). Most participants in these earlier studies were not receiving ART at the time. More recently, vitamin D deficiency, which is assessed by low 25‐hydroxy vitamin D levels, has been associated with increased disease progression of untreated (Mehta 2010) or treated HIV disease (Sudfeld 2012; Viard 2011), and impaired CD4 cell count recovery of HIV‐positive men and women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (Aziz 2013; Ross 2011).

Widespread micronutrient supplementation may lessen the effects of concurrent micronutrient deficiency and help to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to HIV (Semba 1999). It has also been suggested that micronutrient supplementation may enhance the CD4 cell responses of individuals on ART who demonstrate adequate viral suppression (Tang 2005).

Assessing the effectiveness of micronutrient supplementation in participants with inflammation requires special consideration. Acute inflammation results in the redistribution of micronutrients due to changes in plasma proteins and may therefore impact on the validity of nutrient biomarkers, such as serum micronutrient concentrations (Raiten 2015).

### Association between vitamin C, D, and K intake and inflammatory bowel disease risk: findings from 2009 to 2010 NHANES [^111TCKe9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, plays a crucial role in coagulation, bone health, nervous system function, and metabolism. Beyond its role in coagulation, vitamin K also exerts anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-regulatory effects, which may influence IBD risk. Research suggested that vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs) may have mediated these effects, contributing to anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and immune-modulating actions. For instance, growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) is a widely expressed vitamin K-dependent protein that can regulate homeostasis and inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β), promoting phagocytosis of apoptotic cell debris, and protecting cells from stress-induced apoptosis. Additionally, vitamin K helps prevent IBD by reducing gut inflammation and oxidative stress, enhancing the composition of the gut microbiota, and modulating microbial metabolites. These mechanisms align with findings from prior research, further supporting the potential protective role of vitamin K in IBD prevention.

Our results showed a positive, though not statistically significant, correlation between vitamin C intake and IBD risk, which was partially in agreement with previous studies. While some studies in Japan and Iran showed that increasing vitamin C intake could reduce the risk of IBD, other studies in European countries and Israel showed no significant association between vitamin C intake and IBD risk. Vitamin C is generally considered to have anti-inflammatory properties, and research has demonstrated that vitamin C can enhance immune cell function and modulate immune responses, influencing anti-tumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory pathways. However, high doses of vitamin C may potentially exacerbate inflammation by stimulating immune cell activity, especially in inflammatory conditions with highly activated immune systems. Patients with IBD already have a dysregulated immune system, and vitamin C's immune-stimulatory effects may potentially worsen inflammation. Studies show that vitamin C can exacerbate oxidative stress in IBD via activating redox-active metal ions, which activate the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and enhance the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, leading to inflammation. In addition, vitamin C supplementation is not recommended for IBD patients due to its digestive side effects, including gas, bloating, and diarrhea. These findings suggest that the effect of vitamin C on IBD may vary according to doses, populations, and existing immunity conditions, which warrants caution and requires further research.

### Role of vitamin D in adults requiring nutrition support [^112qYx7Y]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

The major and most well-known function of vitamin D is to maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and promote bone mineralization. However, recent evidence suggests that vitamin D may be important for a variety of nonskeletal outcomes. The review synthesizes the available evidence for the role of vitamin D in skeletal health as well as its novel roles in medical conditions such as muscle function, falls, immunity, glucose homeostasis, and cardiovascular diseases. The article reviews methods for assessing vitamin D status and suggests strategies to restore vitamin D status in patients requiring enteral or parenteral nutrition who are at particularly high risk of hypovitaminosis D. Screening for hypovitaminosis D with plasma total 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be a routine part of the care of the patient requiring enteral or parenteral nutrition. Restoration of optimal vitamin D status with high-dose supplemental vitamin D is required in most cases, whereas exposure to sunlight or an ultraviolet B radiation-emitting device is most effective in patients with severe malabsorption or those requiring long-term parenteral therapy. Given the emerging role of vitamin D for a variety of acute and chronic conditions, the optimal vitamin D status in acutely ill patients as well as in patients requiring long-term nutrition therapy warrants further investigation.

### Nutrition, immunity and COVID-19 [^114PaMi7]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Introductory comments

The immune system is functioning at all times, but cells become activated by the presence of pathogens (see The immune system). This activation results in a significant increase in the demand of the immune system for energy yielding substrates (glucose, amino acids and fatty acids). Activation of the immune response induces the production of lipid-derived mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes and of many different types of protein including immunoglobulins, chemokines, cytokines, cytokine receptors, adhesion molecules and acute-phase proteins. This requires availability of the substrate fatty acids and amino acids, respectively. The immune response involves significant cellular proliferation, so increasing the number of immune cells available for defence: this requires DNA, RNA, protein and complex lipid synthesis and the ready availability of substrates to support this. The metabolic machinery involved in energy generation and biosynthesis requires many different vitamins and minerals as cofactors. Amino acids (eg, arginine) are precursors for the synthesis of polyamines, which have roles in the regulation of DNA replication and cell division. Various micronutrients (eg, iron, folate, zinc, magnesium) are also involved in nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. Some nutrients, such as vitamins A and D, and their metabolites are direct regulators of gene expression in immune cells and play a key role in the maturation, differentiation and responsiveness of immune cells. Creation of a pro-oxidant environment through generation of damaging reactive oxygen species is one element of innate immunity; the host needs protection against these through classic antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C and E) and the antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase); the latter require manganese, copper, zinc, iron and selenium. Thus, the roles for nutrients in supporting the function of the immune system are many and varied and it is easy to appreciate that an adequate and balanced supply of these is essential if an appropriate immune response is to be mounted. In essence, good nutrition creates an environment in which the immune system is able to respond appropriately to challenge, irrespective of the nature of the challenge. Conversely poor nutrition creates an environment in which the immune system cannot respond well. This is amply illustrated in conditions of nutrient deficiency (either 'real life' or experimentally induced) which are accompanied by impairments of both innate and acquired immunity and increased susceptibility to, and severity of, infections. Both the immune impairments and the susceptibility to infection can be reversed by correcting the deficiency(ies) showing a causal relationship between availability of specific nutrients and immune defences. This is recognised by the European Food Safety Authority which permits claims of 'maintenance of functions of the immune system' for vitamins A, B 6, B 12, C, D and folate (vitamin B 9) and for the trace elements zinc, iron, selenium and copper. There are a number of comprehensive reviews of aspects of nutrition and immunity, mainly focusing on the role of micronutrients, as well as useful single-author and multiauthor books on the topic. In addition, there are many comprehensive nutrient-specific reviews, which are cited in the relevant sections below. Some of the text of the following sections is updated from a previous publication.

### Evidences for a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19 [^115xyhMt]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Given the evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in modulating immune function, and the impact of vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D-deficient patients with COVID-19, as well as the favourable safety profile (and low cost) of vitamin D, practical recommendations should be synthesised as follows:

Current public health guidelines for optimising vitamin D status should be followed always and clinical data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses show benefits in the prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function when vitamin D-deficient patients are supplemented.
The optimal vitamin D status of the host may contribute key immunoregulatory functions in settings of viral respiratory infection and overall the altered immune-inflammatory COVID-19 reactivity at least by downregulating overly exuberant cytokine responses (pathological cytokine storm, in fact higher vitamin D levels correlate with lower IL-6 levels).
Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should have baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations measured and should be supplemented to a level > 30 ng/mL (optimal 40–60 ng/mL), especially when the baseline level is < 10 ng/mL.
In COVID-19 patients with 25(OH)D serum concentrations under 20 ng/mL the recommended dose for correction of deficiency is 6000–7000 oral IU/day for 6–8 weeks. For maintenance, the dose varies from 2000 to 3000 oral IU/day depending on the age and clinical condition of the individual up to reach optimal concentrations.
When it is not possible to measure baseline 25(OH)D concentrations in COVID-19 patients, it seems essential supplementing with 2000–3000 oral IU per day up to the suggested optimal serum concentrations (40–60 ng/mL).

A final message based on all the practical issues discussed: keep the vitamin D serum concentrations during all the year between 40 and 60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L), it is one of the fundamental care to reduce, at least the risk of RTIs, COVID-19 included.

### Cellular and metabolic mechanisms of nutrient actions in immune function [^116kStV6]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The immune system protects the host against infection from pathological microorganisms and provides constant surveillance for malignant cells that arise over a lifetime. The immune system is able to develop appropriate tolerance to self-proteins, circulating macromolecules, self-cells, and tissues, and to harmless environmental molecules.

Individual heterogeneity regarding the intensity of immunological responses exists, largely dependent on genetics, environment, lifestyle, nutrition, and the interaction of these factors. Nutritional immunology is a field of immunology that describes the influence of nutrition on the immune system, antiviral activity, and associated protective functions. Deficiency in macronutrients and/or micronutrients causes impairment of immune function, which usually can be reversed by nutrient repletion. A poor diet composition which is common in the elderly population, and excess calorie consumption are a problem. Nutritional deficiency or insufficiency must be corrected to ensure normal immune functions including maintaining tolerance. While recognition exists for the importance of various nutrients, the mechanism of action is often not considered by non-molecular scientists.

This perspective will describe recently published reports describing the mechanism of action of prominent nutritional intervention agents where evidence exists as to their action and potency (glutamine and arginine, fatty acids such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or medium-chain fatty acids, micronutrients e.g. vitamin D). This perspective has concentrated on describing the molecular and/or metabolic basis of their immunological effect.

### Regulation of immune function by vitamin D and its use in diseases of immunity [^1129LSTy]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence exists for a role for vitamin D and its active metabolites in modulating immune functions. In animal models, vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk for autoimmunity in genetically predisposed subjects and increases in susceptibility to infections. In addition, high-dose vitamin D can improve immune health, prevent autoimmunity, and improve defense against infections. In humans, evidence exists on associations between vitamin D deficiency and impaired immune function, leading to autoimmunity in genetically predisposed people and increased risk for infections; data on therapeutic immune effects of vitamin D supplementation when vitamin D levels are already sufficient are lacking.

### COVID-19: is there a role for immunonutrition, particularly in the over 65s? [^115ukJBw]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Summary and perspective

Unfortunately, the transmission and speed at which COVID-19 is spreading globally appear to be surpassing the speed at which nutritional immunology studies can give firm answers. An insight into the evidence that is currently available indicates that from an immunological and respiratory stance, ageing populations are undoubtedly more 'at risk' from the harmful ramifications of such infections. Subsequently, a number of nutritional strategies could help them, taking on board what we know so far:

Public health strategies involving immunonutrition could be an alternative way to promote prehabilitation and reduce burdens on healthcare systems.
The general public and indeed the ageing population should be encouraged to follow guidance from Public Health Englandand continue taking supplements containing 10 μg of vitamin D daily, given the fact that low vitamin D status appears to correlate with reduced immune function. Family and friends should help communicate this information to older generations given that they may have limited awareness of these guidelines.
Foods that are naturally abundant in vitamin C such as broccoli (60 mg/100 g), blackcurrants (130 mg/100 g), fortified breakfast cereals (up to 134 mg/100 g) and oranges (37–52 mg/100 g)should be made accessible to older individuals who are most in need of their nutritional benefits.
In the UK 5.5% of men and 4% of women 65 years and over (around 1 in 20) presently have zinc intakes lower than the lower reference nutrient intake (the level below which deficiency could occur). The consumption of foods naturally abundant in zinc such as canned crab (5.7 mg/100 g), canned shrimps (3.7 mg/100 g), canned adzuki beans (≈2.3 mg/100 g) and boiled eggs (1.3 mg/100 g) should be encouraged as a supplementation strategy to reinforce immunity.
Among those with established respiratory conditions or pneumonia, specific nutrients such as vitamin C, D or zinc could be considered as potential adjuvants to conventional treatment pathways.
Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) are intake levels which should not be surpassed as toxicity problems could appear. For vitamin D a UL of 50 µg/day is advised and for zinc a UL of 25 mg/day is recommended. There is insufficient evidence to establish UL for vitamin C, but available human data suggest that supplemental daily doses of up to about 1 g, in addition to normal dietary intake, are not associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects. Not having an adverse effect, however, is not necessarily indicative of a benefit either, and ongoing trials are warranted.
Every individual patient should be carefully assessed when providing nutrient intakes higher than the reference nutrient intake, and dosages should preferably be clinically validated for critically ill patients.
Now that a pandemic has arisen with SARS-CoV-2, and given the easy access, low cost and limited side effects of the discussed nutrients, now could be an appropriate time to trial and test their efficacy in relation to prevention, severity and recovery of such infections.
Ongoing research is urgently needed within the field of immunonutrition and, in particular, how this could benefit vulnerable, at risk groups.

### Control of immunity via nutritional interventions [^113ypBXA]. Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

Nutrition affects all physiological processes including those linked to the development and function of our immune system. Here, we discuss recent evidence and emerging concepts supporting the idea that our newfound relationship with nutrition in industrialized countries has fundamentally altered the way in which our immune system is wired. This will be examined through the lens of studies showing that mild or transient reductions in dietary intake can enhance protective immunity while also limiting aberrant inflammatory responses. We will further discuss how trade-offs and priorities begin to emerge in the context of severe nutritional stress. In those settings, specific immunological functions are heightened to re-enforce processes and tissue sites most critical to survival. Altogether, these examples will emphasize the profound influence nutrition has over the immune system and highlight how a mechanistic exploration of this cross talk could ultimately lead to the design of novel therapeutic approaches that prevent and treat disease.

### Comparative effectiveness of oral nutritional supplements in preventing respiratory tract infections among adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112cgzxm]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are defined as diseases of the respiratory system causing infections of the sinuses, throat, airways, and lungs, categorized into upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). The incidence of RTIs has been increasing annually, imposing a significant disease burden (URTI: 225,505.7 cases per 100,000 population per year [201,156.4–253,739.5]; LRTI: 4770 cases per 100,000 population per year [4510–5040]).

Interest in the potential for nutrient supplementation to reduce the risk of RTIs has increased since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemicand the resurgence of seasonal influenza globally. Nutrient supplementation has long been considered a potentially effective strategy for preventing RTIs. Supplementing with micronutrients (including vitamins A, C, D, E, zinc, selenium, iron, etc.) and plant-based antioxidants (such as flavonoids and polyphenols) can reduce the risk of RTI by activating the immune system, reducing oxidative stress, providing anti-inflammatory effects, and maintaining respiratory tract barrier function. Probiotics and synbiotics can mediate the balance and diversity of the gut microbiota, which plays a significant role in the host's response to many viral infections, either by promoting the attachment of viruses to host cells or by supporting antiviral immunity (such as interferons and innate immune activation).

In recent years, many systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have explored the effectiveness of oral nutrient supplements in preventing RTIs, suggesting beneficial effects of flavonoids and probiotics, while the effects of vitamins A, C, D, E, and zinc remain controversial. No review has simultaneously examined the comparative effects of all these interventions. Although primarily affecting children under 5 years of age, RTIs continue to have high incidence and mortality rates in adults, particularly among middle-aged and elderly individuals over 50 years old. However, fewer systematic reviews have focused on the adult population. Additionally, there are still limited meta-analyses on the role of nutrient supplementation in preventing COVID-19 and influenza. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of RCTs to investigate the effectiveness and safety of these interventions in reducing the incidence and severity of RTIs in adults.

A.S.P.E.N. weight maintenance — omega-3 fatty acid (ω-3 FA) supplementation during cancer care is described across randomized, timeseries, and nonrandomized studies with dosing and outcome details. In metastatic gastrointestinal cancer with malnutrition, SOD versus SOD + ω-3 FA liquid supplement (20 subjects) reported "Improved T-cell function; no difference in PS". In unresectable pancreatic cancer, ω-3 FA capsules in 18 patients had "Median max dose: fish oil 12 g/d; EPA 2 g" with "Decrease in rate of weight loss; reduction in CRP; no increase in LBM over time"; the regimen was "12 week treatment; no control group; initial dose: fish oil 2 g/d, increased by 2 g weekly to max dose 16 g/d". In solid tumors, ω-3 FA and vitamin E capsules versus placebo (60 subjects) showed "Improved T-cell and PBMC function in ω-3 FA group; increase in PS; increase in survival in fish oil group", with "6 week treatment; goal dose: EPA 3.06 g DHA 2.07 g, vitamin E 200 mg". For pancreatic cancer and ongoing weight loss, a timeseries of 20 patients receiving "EPA 2.1 g DHA 0.9 g" reported "Weight gain compared to pre-intervention; increase in LBM; increase in PS; increase in appetite; no change in CRP" during "7 week treatment". A nonrandomized trial (36 subjects) found "Stable CRP and increase in APP in ω-3 FA group; reduction of albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin in control patients" over "4 week treatment" with a "6 healthy individual "comparison group".

### Vitamins and nutritional supplements… [^114EGue7]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Incze M. Vitamins and Nutritional Supplements: What Do I Need to Know. JAMA Intern Med. 2019; 179:

460. doi:
10. 1001/jamainternmed.
2018. 5880 Vitamins and nutritional supplements include a very wide range of vitamins, minerals, and chemicals meant to add to the nutrients that people get through their diet. There are over 90 000 different supplements on the market. Some are derived from natural sources such as fish oil; however, many are created in a laboratory. For most people, the answer is no. Vitamins and supplements often advertise health benefits, such as improved thinking, better heart health, and a stronger immune system. For years, doctors have recommended certain supplements such as fish oil and multivitamins. However, these claims have not been supported by evidence from medical research. Most basic vitamins and minerals are presumed to be safe to take at the recommended doses. However, bad reactions to supplements are possible.

An estimated 23 000 emergency department visits every year are directly related to taking nutritional supplements. These visits often result from toxic ingredients in some supplements such as heavy metals, steroids, and stimulants. Bad reactions can also happen owing to an overdose of a certain ingredient or because children accidentally take the supplement. Be honest with your physician about any supplements you are considering taking. Dispose of any old vitamins and supplements that are not being used. A balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, some cheeses, fish, poultry, or lean meats provides all needed vitamins and nutrients. Evidence suggests that our body is better at absorbing nutrients from food than from supplements. Whole foods also provide the amounts and ratios of nutrients that our body can most efficiently use. Evidence shows that people who eat a balanced diet have positive health benefits, and these benefits are not found in supplements.

Vitamins and supplements cannot make up for a less-than-healthy diet. Most likely the answer is no. Vegetarian and other special diets generally provide adequate nutrients and vitamins without needing supplementation. Vegans are at increased risk for Vitamin B12 deficiency, but many vegan specialty foods, such as almond milk, are fortified with B12 to help ensure adequate daily intake. Sometimes a supplement may be recommended. Speak with your physician or a dietitian to discuss what makes the most sense for you.

### Dietary and supplemental intake of vitamins C and E is associated with altered DNA methylation in an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis [^111XJEC9]. Epigenetics (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, dietary and supplementary intake of vitamin C and vitamin E is associated with DNA methylation, which likely plays a critical role in the regulation of cell signalling mechanisms and subsequently, in the association of vitamin intake with the immune response. Our results highlight the importance of dietary and supplementary intake of vitamins C and E through consumption of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and oils in overall health and the reduction of burden from inflammatory processes.

### Evaluation of the safety, tolerability and plasma vitamin D response to long-term use of patented transdermal vitamin D patches in healthy adults: a randomised parallel pilot study [^113mUtHv]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D is the subject of wide-ranging research into the relationship between intake, status and overall health outcomes. Vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) is formed in the skin following exposure to UltravioletB (UVB) light and occurs naturally in a limited range of foods or may be added through fortification. Regardless of source, vitamin D is processed by the body to become physiologically active 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D.

Adequate vitamin D is important for skeletal health, immune function and suppression of inflammatory response. Interest is developing into the role of vitamin D in pain management as supplementation may decrease pain scores and improve chronic pain. Both observational and intervention studies support this altering of pain intensity, making vitamin D a potentially useful addition to pain management in varying clinical settings.

Vitamin D acts on nociceptor pain. Nociception is the stimulation of sensory nociceptor nerve cells by chemical (a classic example is capsaicin found in chilli peppers), mechanical (cutting or crushing) or thermal (heat and cold) stimuli, which produce pain signals. Vitamin D acts on the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 pain receptors, helping prevent hyperactivity of these receptors in chronic inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, or in soft tissue injuries, thus reducing pain.

Transdermal (via skin) therapeutics such as salves, ointments and patches have been used since ancient Egyptian and Babylonian medicine (around 3000 BC). Routine use of transdermal drug delivery systems has only become common practice in the latter part of the 20th century with the advent of delivery technology capable of precise and reproducible administration through the skin for systemic effects. Potential efficacy and suitability of patch drug delivery is normally determined by blood level–time profiles for the active components.

### Effect of micronutrient supplements on influenza and other respiratory tract infections among adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11478qMY]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) are a leading cause of ill-health and death globally. Individual or multiple micronutrients have been shown to modulate immune function and affect the risk and severity of a number of infectious diseases. We systematically reviewed the evidence on the impact of micronutrient supplements to reduce the occurrence of ARIs and shorten the duration of ARI symptoms among adults. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the pooled effects of vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) on the occurrence of ARIs and the duration of ARI symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI (risk ratio (RR) = 0.97; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00; p = 0.028) and shortened the duration of symptoms (per cent difference: -6% (95% CI -9% to -2%; p = 0.003)). The RR of vitamin D to prevent ARI was farther from the null when diagnosis was based on clinical diagnosis or laboratory testing, compared with self-report and when the loading dose was < 60 000 IU. Vitamin C supplementation reduced the risk of ARIs (RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99; p = 0.01) and shortened the duration of symptoms (per cent difference: -9% (95% CI -16% to -2%; p = 0.014)). The effect of vitamin C on preventing ARI was stronger among men and in middle-income countries, compared with women and high-income countries, respectively. Zinc supplementation did not reduce the risk of ARIs but shortened the duration of symptoms substantially (per cent difference: -47% (95% CI -73% to -21%; p = 0.0004)). Our synthesis of global evidence from randomised controlled trials indicates that micronutrient supplements including zinc, vitamins C and D, and multiple micronutrient supplements may be modestly effective in preventing ARIs and improving their clinical course. Further research is warranted to better understand the effectiveness that individual or multiple micronutrients have on SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment outcomes.

### A systematic review of the role of vitamin insufficiencies and supplementation in COPD [^114Vcmre]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary inflammation, oxidants-antioxidants imbalance, as well as innate and adaptive immunity have been proposed as playing a key role in the development of COPD. The role of vitamins, as assessed either by food frequency questionnaires or measured in serum levels, have been reported to improve pulmonary function, reduce exacerbations and improve symptoms. Vitamin supplements have therefore been proposed to be a potentially useful additive to COPD therapy.

Methods

A systematic literature review was performed on the association of vitamins and COPD. The role of vitamin supplements in COPD was then evaluated.

Conclusions

The results of this review showed that various vitamins (vitamin C, D, E, A, beta and alpha carotene) are associated with improvement in features of COPD such as symptoms, exacerbations and pulmonary function. High vitamin intake would probably reduce the annual decline of FEV1. There were no studies that showed benefit from vitamin supplementation in improved symptoms, decreased hospitalization or pulmonary function.

### Nutrition and immunity: lessons for COVID-19 [^111rmFYK]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of micronutrients in supporting the immune response

Nutrition plays multiple roles in supporting the immune system. The diet provides:
Fuels for the immune system to function.
Building blocks for the generation of RNA and DNA and for the production of proteins (antibodies, cytokines, receptors, acute phase proteins etc.) and new cells.
Specific substrates for the production of immune-active metabolites (e.g. arginine as a substrate for nitric oxide).
Regulators of immune cell metabolism (e.g. vitamin A, zinc).
Nutrients with specific antibacterial or anti-viral functions (e.g. vitamin D, zinc).
Regulators that protect the host from oxidative and inflammatory stress (e.g. vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and many plant polyphenols).
Substrates for the intestinal microbiota which in turn modulates the immune system (see next section).

Poor nutrition may not provide sufficient amounts of the nutrients needed by the immune system to function well. This would be associated with increased susceptibility to infection and inability to control the effects of being infected (Fig. 4). In this regard the role of micronutrients in supporting the immune system has been widely studied, as reviewed elsewhere. Multiple micronutrients play vital roles in supporting the immune response (Table 1). The roles of vitamins A, C and D and zinc, copper and iron are well explored, but B vitamins, vitamin E, vitamin K, selenium, magnesium and others all have roles. Deficiencies of several of these micronutrients impair many aspects of both innate and acquired immunity and increase susceptibility to infections. The immune impairments can be reversed by repletion and this reduces susceptibility to infection. There has been discussion around many micronutrients and anti-viral immunity in the context of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and there have been numerous publications on this topic since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^116n3583]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The common cold is characterized by acute inflammation of the nose, sinuses, pharynx, and larynx mainly due to viral infection. Cold episodes are usually mild and do not progress to serious health problems, such as pneumonia or bacterial infections, or require hospitalization. However, the high morbidity of this illness, accounting for 20% of medical visits in developed countries, has caused significant socioeconomic burden through adversely affecting daily activity, productivity, and attendance from work or school. – Globally, 6,090,503 disability-adjusted life years were lost because of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in 2016.

Intake of certain micronutrients enhances the immune system through strengthening epithelial barriers and cellular immunity and production of antibodies. The positive effects of micronutrient intake on the immune system suggest their potential protective role against infections. – In the area of respiratory infections, vitamin C's efficacy on cold prevention has been extensively studied. – The latest meta-analysis on vitamin C's effect on cold found that regular vitamin C supplementation in adults helped decrease cold duration by 8% (3–12%) and reduced cold severity during episodes.

### Vitamin C supplementation for prevention and treatment of pneumonia [^112vKzcT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015, lower respiratory tract infection is the leading cause of infectious disease death, and the fifth most common cause of death overall. Vitamin C has a role in modulating resistance to infectious agents, therefore vitamin C supplementation may be important in preventing and treating pneumonia.

Objectives

To assess the impact of vitamin C supplementation to prevent and treat pneumonia in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, and two trials registers to 4 March 2020. We also checked references to identify additional studies. We did not apply any publication status or language filters.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (studies using allocation methods that are not random, e.g. date of birth, medical record number) assessing the role of vitamin C supplementation in the prevention and treatment of pneumonia in children and adults compared to control or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included seven studies in the review and identified two ongoing studies. The seven included studies involved a total of 2774 participants; five studies were RCTs and two were quasi-RCTs. The included studies were conducted in high-income countries (UK, USA and Chile) and lower-middle-income countries (Bangladesh and Pakistan). Four studies were conducted in hospital inpatient settings, two in schools, and one in a military training centre. Three studies included children under five years of age, two school-aged children, one adult participants, and one older participants aged 60 to 90 years. Two studies assessed the effect of vitamin C supplementation for pneumonia prevention; four studies assessed the effect of vitamin C supplementation as an adjunct to pneumonia treatment; and one study assessed the role of vitamin C for both prevention and treatment of pneumonia. For pneumonia prevention, the included studies provided supplementation in doses of 500 mg daily for 14 weeks, 2 g daily for 8 weeks, and 2 g daily for 12 weeks. For pneumonia treatment, the included studies provided vitamin C supplementation in doses of 125 mg daily (until discharge), 200 mg for 4 weeks, and 200 mg until discharge, as an adjunct to the pneumonia treatment. We assessed the included studies as at overall either high or unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding. We judged the quality of the evidence as very low. Three studies assessed the effect of vitamin C supplementation for pneumonia prevention; we judged the quality of the evidence as very low. We are uncertain about the effect of vitamin C supplementation on pneumonia incidence (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 3.61; 2 studies, 736 participants; I² = 75%; very low-quality evidence) and adverse events (urticaria) (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.03; 1 study, 674 participants; very low-quality evidence). No included studies reported our other primary outcomes (pneumonia prevalence and mortality) or any of our secondary outcomes. Five studies assessed the effect of vitamin C supplementation as an adjunct to pneumonia treatment; we judged the quality of the evidence as very low. One study reported a decrease in the duration of illness in the vitamin C supplementation group (3.4 days ± 2.54) compared to the control group (4.5 days ± 2.35), and one study reported a decrease in number of days required for improvement in oxygen saturation (1.03 days ± 0.16 versus 1.14 days ± 1.0) and respiratory rate (3.61 days ± 1.50 versus 4.04 days ± 1.62) in the vitamin C supplementation group compared to the control group. We are uncertain of the effect of vitamin C supplementation on mortality due to pneumonia (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.66; 1 study, 57 participants; very low-quality evidence). One study reported that the mean duration of hospital stay was 6.75 days amongst children in the vitamin C supplementation group and 7.75 days in the control group; another study reported a lower mean duration of hospital stay in the vitamin C supplementation group compared to the control group (109.55 hours ± 27.89 versus 130.64 hours ± 41.76).

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the small number of included studies and very low quality of the existing evidence, we are uncertain of the effect of vitamin C supplementation for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia. Further good-quality studies are required to assess the role of vitamin C supplementation in the prevention and treatment of pneumonia.

### Nutrient supplementation for prevention of viral respiratory tract infections in healthy subjects: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fC9RJ]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

It remains uncertain as to whether nutrient supplementation for the general population considered healthy could be useful in the prevention of RTIs, such as COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the evidence was evaluated for primary prevention of any viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) such as SARS-CoV-2, through supplementation of nutrients with a recognized role in immune function: multiple micronutrients, vitamin A, folic acid, vitamin B12, C, D, E, beta-carotene, zinc, iron and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The search produced 15,163 records of which 93 papers (based on 115 studies) met the inclusion criteria, resulting in 199,055 subjects (191,636 children and 7,419 adults) from 37 countries. Sixty-three studies were included in the meta-analyses, which was performed for children and adults separately. By stratifying the meta-analysis by world regions, only studies performed in Asia showed a significant but heterogeneous protective effect of zinc supplementation on RTIs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.7–0.96, I² = 79.1%, p = .000). Vitamin D supplementation in adults significantly decreased the incidence of RTI (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–0.99, p = .272), particularly in North America (RR 0.82 95% CI 0.68–0.97), but not in Europe or Oceania. Supplementation of nutrients in the general population has either no or at most a very limited effect on prevention of RTIs. Zinc supplementation appears protective for children in Asia, whilst vitamin D may protect adults in the USA and Canada. In 10/115 (8.7%) studies post-hoc analyses based on stratification for nutritional status was performed. In only one study zinc supplementation was found to be more effective in children with low zinc serum as compared to children with normal zinc serum levels.

### Dietary micronutrients in the wake of COVID-19: an appraisal of evidence with a focus on high-risk groups and preventative healthcare [^117BQoQc]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

High-risk groups

Certain individuals are at greater risk of micronutrient deficiency; this includes women of childbearing age (particularly pregnant and lactating women), younger children, adolescents (particularly females), older adults, obese individuals, the critically ill, individuals with inflammatory bowel diseaseand those with other chronic inflammatory and malabsorptive conditions. This risk, in the case of vitamin D especially, extends to those living at higher latitudes, as well as immigrant and black and minority ethnic (BAME) populations. Deficiencies are also observed in individuals due to the clinical management of disease itself, which can impact negatively on status. In many of these groups, a balanced diet alone may not be sufficient to meet micronutrient requirements and deficiencies can contribute to impaired immune function. This can be due to a variety of factors affecting intakes, absorption and also due to increased utilisation of micronutrients during times of infection. In such cases, the immune system can be supported by micronutrient supplementation, particularly to help correct deficiencies and attenuate the effects of concurrent treatments. The following section details the role of specific micronutrients in two primary groups affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, the elderly and the critically ill. It is important to make clear that this is not a complete list. Consideration should also be taken for other immunocompromised patients and the unknowns that exist within these groups related to interindividual differences in absorption, requirements and other mitigating factors.

There is a general deterioration of immune function associated with ageing, often termed immunosenescence, which affects both innate and adaptive immune systems. This results in diminished response to vaccination, impaired skin and mucous membrane function (due to dermal and subcutaneous atrophy, decreased production of IgA and reduced functional activity of immune cells) and longer inflammatory processes. For this reason, elderly individuals are more likely to contract infections, many of which last longer, putting them at increased risk of complications. Higher levels of micronutrient deficiencies exist in older adults in both community (vitamins A, B 12, D and zinc) and residential populations (vitamins A, D and E), which has implications when admitted to the acute setting. This is due to a variety of factors influencing dietary intake and nutrient absorption, alongside increased requirements to compensate for deficits in cellular function and the stress response associated with ageing. This includes a reduced antioxidant production and vitamin D synthesis in skin. Overall, older people are 2–10 times more likely to die of infection than younger people.

### Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of stratified aggregate data [^111rKdT8]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are typically defined as any infection of the respiratory tract with symptom duration up to 21 days. Their contribution to global morbidity and mortality, with consequent strain on health-care systems, remains an ongoing problem. Evidence indicating that vitamin D supplementation could reduce risk of ARI arises from laboratory studies which show that vitamin D metabolites support innate immune responses to respiratory viruses, together with observational studies reporting independent associations of low circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D, the widely accepted biomarker of vitamin D status) and increased risk of ARI.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D for the prevention of ARIs have produced heterogeneous results, with some showing protection, and others reporting null findings. We previously did a meta-analysis of aggregate data from 48 488 participants in 43 RCTs, – and found a modest protective overall effect of vitamin D that was stronger in trials which gave vitamin D daily, with doses of 400–1000 IU/day, were up to 12 months in length, and that were conducted among participants aged 1–15 years at enrolment. Since the date of our previous literature search (on May 1, 2020), six RCTs with 19 337 participants fulfilling the same eligibility criteria have been completed. We aimed to use data from these recent studies for inclusion in an updated meta-analysis of stratified aggregate data (trial-level, stratified by baseline vitamin D status and age) to determine whether vitamin D reduced ARI risk overall, and to evaluate whether effects of vitamin D on ARI risk varied according to baseline 25(OH)D concentration, dosing regimen (frequency, dose size, and trial duration), or age at enrolment.

### Association between vitamin intake and respiratory complaints in adults from the UK national diet and nutrition survey years 1–8 [^111R5gGH]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Globally, there has been an emerging trend of pandemics affecting the respiratory system, which has culminated most recently in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2019 outbreak. Current efforts to tackle the pandemic rely on managing associated symptoms and providing standard supportive nutritional care, with a substantial burden on the National Health Service.

Nutrition is known to play a critical role in the prevention of a number of infectious diseases, while malnutrition is known to contribute to increased morbidity and mortality from such diseases. Although the mechanisms by which nutrition affects immunity are complex, optimal nutritional status is known to contribute to the maintenance of the immune system. Evidence also suggests that unhealthy western diets contribute to chronic inflammation and reduced host defence against viruses. Consistent with the latter, the beneficial role of specific nutrients, such as vitamins A, E, C and D, in the prevention of acute respiratory complaints is emerging and has been highlighted recently by a number of reviews and a report by the American Nutrition Association. According to the latter report, vitamin A is speculated to support mucosal tissues, and practitioners were advised to evaluate doses that exceed the recommended dietary allowance of 700 μg/2333 IU retinoic acid equivalent for women and 900 μg/3000 IU retinoic acid equivalent for men, respectively. Likewise, vitamin E has been hypothesised to play a role in lung protection through its fat-soluble properties, which enable it to accumulate in lipid membranes, neutralising free-radicals and triggering production of proinflammatory cytokines. Evidence for vitamin C in supporting white blood cells to fight infections is more established, while a number of reviews and studies indicate the potential health benefits of taking vitamin D supplements, particularly in individuals who are deficient. More recently, a number of studies have highlighted the consequences of malnutrition and the role of vitamin supplementation in managing the severity and long-term consequences of coronavirus disease.

### Impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in older COVID-19 vaccinated patients [^114MjwLd]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe respiratory disease linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, has profoundly affected the health of older adults. Age-related factors, such as the aging immune system, increased comorbidities, and physiological changes, have rendered old people the most vulnerable victims of this pandemic, with significantly high mortality rates reported within this population. As individuals age, they experience a decline in immune function, characterized by reduced T cell efficacy and elevated inflammatory cytokines — collectively termed immunosenescence — which can exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, it is crucial to identify tailored and effective preventive strategies within this demographic to improve health outcomes and overall well-being.

Vitamin D has emerged as a vital nutrient in supporting immune function. This fat-soluble vitamin enhances the pathogen-fighting abilities of immune cells, including macrophages and T cells, which are essential for orchestrating an effective response to infections. Moreover, vitamin D boosts serum levels of human cathelicidin LL-37, a key antimicrobial peptide of the innate immune system. Additionally, vitamin D possesses anti-inflammatory properties that may help mitigate the cytokine storms often observed in severe cases of COVID-19. Adequate levels of vitamin D have not only been shown to strengthen general immune responses but also to improve vaccine efficacy. Building on the promising findings from vaccination studies — such as those related to influenza — in older populations, a growing body of research indicates that vitamin D may also significantly influence the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Although previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the impact of optimal vitamin D levels on antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals, there is evidence supporting the beneficial effect of supplementation on vaccination responses and mortality. However, much of this research has primarily focused on younger patients, leaving a gap in understanding the impact of serum vitamin D levels on vaccine efficacy and mortality among older adults.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^113QpuLM]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Zinc

In general, zinc supplementation was shown to prevent up to 53% of common cold episodes when supplemented to healthy children younger than 10 years (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.88). However, such efficacy is not observed in healthy adults, even when a higher dosage was provided (RR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.34, 3.34). The discrepancy could be because of the relatively more robust immune systems of adults, compared with children, when both are free of chronic comorbidities. Thus, zinc supplementation in children helps to develop and regulate their immune systems, hence effectively preventing cold episodes in this population. Similar to vitamin D, the efficacy of zinc supplementation on cold prevention could also be influenced by an individual's zinc status. Zinc deficiency has been associated with a suppressed immune system, and the protective effects of zinc against colds have been evidenced in autoimmune subjects of all ages, of which 70% were zinc deficient. Thus, the lack of effect observed in Veverka et al.could be due to adequate zinc levels in the healthy adult subjects used in the study. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether zinc levels in the seemingly healthy subjects recruited in the study by Veverka et al.were truly sufficient because of the lower population-specific zinc deficiency cutoff levels. Although Veverka et al.measured subjects' zinc levels, zinc deficiency cutoff levels in the study population was not assessed and reported according to guidelines released jointly by the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group. According to the guidelines released, the lower cutoff level for zinc deficiency differs according to the age, gender, and time of the day the reading was taken for each population, and the cutoff value that can be applied universally to all adult humans does not exist. Thus, the possibility that zinc supplementation has no effect on cold effect in healthy adults (that are zinc deficient) still remains.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^111LAe34]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Respiratory effects

Vitamin D is known to influence the immune system. Most immune cells express the VDR and vitamin D metabolism–related enzymes; 1,25(OH) 2 D, in particular, induces innate antimicrobial effector mechanisms such as the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin LL-37 and human beta-defensin 2. Indeed, clinical data regarding the effects of adequate vitamin D status and supplementation on respiratory infections confirm, at least in part, its potential beneficial outcomes. Serum 25(OH)D levels of less than 25 nmol/L are associated (observationally and genetically) with an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia. Individual participant data from a meta-analysis of 25 trials showed a small but significant decrease in the incidence of acute respiratory infections in the vitamin D group compared with the control group when baseline vitamin D status was poor (< 25 nmol/L). A more recent, updated meta-analysis from the same group, including almost 50 RCTs, shows a protective but very small effect against respiratory infections following vitamin D supplementation with daily doses of 400 to 1000 IU; in contrast to their first meta-analysis, baseline vitamin D status did not modify the results in this more recent one.

### Dietary micronutrients in the wake of COVID-19: an appraisal of evidence with a focus on high-risk groups and preventative healthcare [^113LQGP6]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Existing micronutrient deficiencies, even if only a single micronutrient, can impair immune function and increase susceptibility to infectious disease. Certain population groups are more likely to have micronutrient deficiencies, while certain disease pathologies and treatment practices also exacerbate risk, meaning these groups tend to suffer increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. Optimisation of overall nutritional status, including micronutrients, can be effective in reducing incidence of infectious disease. Micronutrient deficiencies are rarely recognised but are prevalent in the UK, as well as much more widely, particularly in high-risk groups susceptible to COVID-19. Practitioners should be aware of this fact and should make it a consideration for the screening process in COVID-19, or when screening may be difficult or impractical, to ensure blanket treatment as per the best practice guidelines. Correction of established micronutrient deficiencies, or in some cases assumed suboptimal status, has the potential to help support immune function and mitigate risk of infection. The effects of and immune response to COVID-19 share common characteristics with more well-characterised severe acute respiratory infections. Correction of micronutrient deficiencies has proven effective in several infectious diseases and has been shown to promote favourable clinical outcomes. Micronutrients appear to play key roles in mediating the inflammatory response and such effects may be enhanced through correction of deficiencies. Many of those at highest risk during the COVID-19 pandemic are also populations at highest risk of micronutrient deficiencies and poorer overall nutrition. Correction of micronutrient deficiencies in established COVID-19 infection may contribute to supporting immune response to infection in those at highest risk. There is a need for further research to establish optimal public health practice and clinical intervention regimens.

### Dietary micronutrients in the wake of COVID-19: an appraisal of evidence with a focus on high-risk groups and preventative healthcare [^1174rYuz]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Research

With the recent identification of specific immune responses to COVID-19, now is the time to consider additional measures that can support optimal functioning of the immune system. Granted, in the case of nutritional immunology, the discrepancy in results from many studies adds the challenge of interpreting this into clinical practice. While there is no clear consensus at this time regarding the clinical relevance of these micronutrients, results from trial data are encouraging and suggestive of significant effects. In some cases, however, results in human studies are not always consistent with preclinical animal models, or the immunomodulatory effects have not yet been examined in humans. As this research develops further, there is a need for more standardised clinical trials, the assurance of quality in analytical measurementsand better characterised populations to establish optimal doses for maximum clinical benefits, which will vary depending on a variety of group and interindividual differences, a number of which have been discussed above.

### Vitamin C in sepsis-No longer a benign intervention? [^115f3xvg]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Scientists and laypeople have been captivated by the potential role of vitamin C in the treatment of infection since the publication of Linus Pauling's famed book, Vitamin C and the Common Cold in 1970. 1 In a contemporaneous article, Pauling described the methodology he used to pool the results of four double-blind controlled trials to conclude that ascorbic acid prevented upper respiratory infections. 2 Although these publications led to widespread use of vitamin C by the public, they were considered highly controversial by the scientific community and sparked debate over the veracity of Pauling's findings and the rigor of his meta-analysis methodology.

### Effects of antioxidants on immune system ageing [^115n1nXt]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

One of the most widely accepted theories proposed to explain ageing is the free radical theory, according to which oxygen-derived free radicals cause age-related impairment through oxidative damage to biomolecules, with mitochondria being the main target of free radical attack. Since oxygen radicals are needed for many metabolic and physiological processes, an equilibrium between radical production and their antioxidant-linked inactivation is required to preserve health. Thus, senescence is the result of an imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defences, with concomitant oxidative stress and age-dependent functional decline. This process is especially evident in the immune cells, which use free radicals in their functions and suffer a senescent deterioration probably linked to oxygen stress. Conversely, several laboratories, including our own, have shown that antioxidants preserve an adequate function of immune cells against homeostatic disturbances caused by oxidative stress, such as that involved with age. Therefore, since the immune system is an indicator of health and a longevity predictor, the protection of this system afforded by dietary antioxidant supplementation may play an important role in order to achieve a healthy ageing.

### Association of fruits and vegetables consumption and related-vitamins with inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in prediabetic individuals [^111nUAny]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary habits have been involved in the pathophysiology of diseases. Lifestyle interventions have confirmed that a healthy diet combined with physical activity are able to improve underlying mechanisms of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, such as oxidative stress, inflammation and insulin resistance. Several benefits from a fiber-rich diet including fruits & vegetables (FV) on health have been described. International recommendations of 5 servings a day of this food group are based also on their high micronutrient content, which can induce favorable cardiometabolic outcomes. High FV consumption has been associated with decreased incidence and mortality from a variety of obesity-related diseases including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are conditions of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. These associations have been attributed either as to an interaction between micro and macronutrients, or to nutrients in isolation.

Pro-vitamin A carotenoids and vitamins C and E, present in FV, are essential for proper physiological functioning. The importance of vitamin E for maintaining oxidative-antioxidant balance is widely recognized, but this must be accompanied by vitamin C in order to enhance antioxidant protection. Pro-vitamin A carotenoids are present in brightly colored FV; such micronutrients modulate immune system and exert a protective action by reducing LDL-cholesterol oxidation via induction of antioxidant enzymes. Although the synergism of different nutrients consumed in a daily diet could limit the ability to separate out specific effects, reported in observational studies, it was of our interest investigating how the intake of those particular vitamins or their main souces (FV) could be associated with circulating markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, then contributing to increase cardiometabolic risk.

The reported benefits of FV on health are in part dependent on their content of natural antioxidant as vitamins A, C, and E, since oxidative stress is an underlying mechanism for several chronic diseases. Studies in animal models and humans have provided evidence about the pathways by which micronutrients in FV may induce protective cardiometabolic effects. Unbalance between free radicals production and antioxidant enzymes causes damage of multiple cellular components and even death, and it would be expected that restoring redox equilibrium could attenuate the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. However, multivitamins supplementation in randomized trials have not proven to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Considering that high doses of certain vitamins may adversely affect lipid concentrations, natural intake through a healthy diet has been recommended.

### Eating for immunity: how diet shapes our defenses [^116RNeo8]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Emerging studies on the diet-immune axis have uncovered novel dietary immune regulators and identified crucial targets and pathways mediating the crosstalk between specific dietary components and diverse immune cell populations. Here, we discuss the recent discovery and mechanisms by which diet-derived components, such as vitamins, amino acids, fatty acids, and antioxidants, could impact immune cell metabolism, alter signaling pathways, and reprogram the overall cellular responses. We also note crucial considerations that need to be tackled to make these findings clinically relevant, acknowledging that our current understanding often relies on simplified models that may not adequately represent the intricate network of factors influencing the diet-immune axis at the whole organism level. Overall, our growing understanding of how diet shapes our defenses underscores the importance of lifestyle choices and illuminates the potential to fine-tune immune responses through targeted nutritional strategies, thereby fortifying the immune system and bolstering our defenses against diseases.

### Association between vitamin intake and respiratory complaints in adults from the UK national diet and nutrition survey years 1–8 [^116bgfj8]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

On the balance of this evidence, there is clearly an urgent need to expand our understanding of how intake of vitamins from dietary sources and supplements could influence the incidence and severity of respiratory complaints. This understanding is critical to developing short-term and long-term public health nutrition recommendations to help tackle respiratory complaints and reduce burden on healthcare systems.

This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional association between vitamins A, E, C and D intake from diet and supplements and the prevalence of respiratory complaints in a nationally representative sample of UK adults. These vitamins were selected among many nutrients as they have already been granted health claims in the European Union relating to the normal function of the immune systemand have been hypothesised by the American Nutrition Association to be of value to the prevention of respiratory infections.

### Vitamin D supplementation modulates T cell-mediated immunity in humans: results from a randomized control trial [^112Vnj8E]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Although studies have linked vitamin D deficiency with immune-mediated diseases, data demonstrating a direct effect on T-cell function are sparse.

Objective

Our objective was to determine whether oral vitamin D3 influences T-cell activation in humans with vitamin D deficiency.

Design

This was a single-center ancillary study within Vitamin D Therapy in Individuals at High Risk of Hypertension, a double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

This study was undertaken in a single academic medical center.

Participants

Adults with vitamin D deficiency and untreated pre- or early stage I hypertension were included.

Intervention

In Vitamin D Therapy in Individuals at High Risk of Hypertension, participants were randomized to either low- (400 IU daily) or high- (4000 IU daily) dose oral vitamin D3 for 6 months. In this ancillary study of 38 patients, we measured CD4+ T-cell activation estimated by intracellular ATP release after stimulation of whole blood with plant lectin phytohemagglutinin collected at baseline (pretreatment) and 2-month follow-up.

Main Outcome Measure

Determining whether ATP level changes were significantly different between treatment groups was the main outcome measure.

Results

Treatment with 4000 IU of vitamin D3 decreased intracellular CD4+ ATP release by 95.5 ng/ml (interquartile range, -219.5 to 105.8). In contrast, 400 IU of vitamin D3 decreased intracellular CD4+ ATP release by 0.5 ng/ml (interquartile range, -69.2 to 148.5). In a proportional odds model, high-dose vitamin D3 was more likely than low-dose vitamin D3 to decrease CD4+ ATP release (odds ratio, 3.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.11).

Conclusions

In this ancillary study of a randomized controlled trial, we found that high-dose vitamin D3 significantly reduced CD4+ T-cell activation compared to low-dose vitamin D3, providing human evidence that vitamin D can influence cell-mediated immunity.

### A systematic review of the role of vitamin insufficiencies and supplementation in COPD [^1148KBQc]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

When levels of vitamins were measured in the serum they were found to be significantly lower in COPD patients than in control subjects. The association of vitamins with pulmonary diseases is further supported by a meta-analysis of 40 studies in patients with asthma. This meta-analysis revealed that relatively low dietary intake of vitamins A and C were associated with statistically significant increased odds of asthma and wheezing.

A large number of studies and reviews highlight an association of vitamins with lung function in healthy subjects and COPD patients. Recently a randomized controlled trial suggested that a dietary shift to higher antioxidant food intake was associated with improvement in lung function. Furthermore, several studies associate vitamins with a reduction in symptoms, respiratory infections and exacerbations.

Although for vitamin D the role in respiratory diseases has been clarified through its implication in immunity, for most other vitamins the mechanism of action is less clear. Indeed we know that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D stimulates both innate and adaptive immunity, in addition to mineralization and calcium homeostasis. Further support on the important role of Vitamin D is given by the fact that it regulates genes that are implicated in apoptosis and cellular proliferation, known to be an important step in COPD pathogenesis. Vitamin D has both immunomodulatory and antiiflammatory properties. For vitamin A, B, C, and E, studies highlight their role in COPD risk as well as their connection with COPD outcomes such as symptoms and improvement in spirometric values, without a clear mechanism of action. This article aims to update the knowledge we have about the association between vitamin intake and COPD in outcome measures, as well as to assess the potential role of vitamin supplements.

### Intravenous vitamin C for patients hospitalized with COVID-19: two harmonized randomized clinical trials [^114jG8e9]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (non-critically ill) was published by LOVIT-COVID Investigators and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (non-critically ill) study, the trial question was: what is the role of intravenous vitamin C for non-critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19? In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (non-critically ill) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (non-critically ill) study, the population was: 1022 patients (405 female, 617 male). The inclusion criteria were non-critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; healthcare-associated pneumonia; imminent death; known allergy to vitamin C. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (non-critically ill) study, the interventions were: n = 456 vitamin C (IV dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight over 30–60 minutes every 6 hours for 96 hours) n = 566 control (no vitamin C or placebo). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (non-critically ill) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median organ support-free days to 21 days (22 days vs. 22 days; OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.01). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (non-critically ill) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in survival without persistent organ dysfunction at day 28 (83.6% vs. 84.3%; OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.23) No significant difference in the rate of survival to day 28 (84.8% vs. 85.3%; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.26) Significant decrease in the rate of endotracheal intubation through day 28 (13.8% vs. 8.8%; OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.83). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (non-critically ill) study, the conclusion was: in non-critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19, vitamin C was not superior to control with respect to median organ support-free days to 21 days.

### Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplements for the primary… [^113kkHjJ]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Rationale IMPORTANCE Use of dietary supplements is common in the U. S. adult population: 49% of adults used at least one dietary supplement between 2007 and 2010, and 32% reported using a multivitamin-multimineral supplement. 1 Supplement use is more common in women and older adults than in men and younger adults. 2 Most dietary supplements are used to improve or maintain overall health. 1 The substantial effect of cardiovascular disease and cancer on health status and mortality in the United States has been well described, 3 and many supplements are promoted to prevent these conditions.
4. BENEFITS OF VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTATION The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of supplementation with multivitamins to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer.

The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the benefits of supplementation with individual vitamins or minerals or functional pairs in healthy populations without known nutritional deficiencies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with beta carotene or vitamin E in healthy populations without known nutritional deficiencies does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer. SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE REGARDING THE I STATEMENTS Potential Preventable Burden. Evidence from in vitro and animal research and population-based epidemiologic studies supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress may play a fundamental role in the initiation and progression of cancer and common cardiovascular diseases. 3 If this hypothesis is correct, then some combination of specific supplements, a specific dose, a vulnerable host, and specific timing may be useful.

Specific groups of patients with well-defined conditions may benefit from specific nutrients. For example, women planning or capable of pregnancy should receive a daily supplement containing folic acid to help prevent neural tube defects. The USPSTF also recommends vitamin D supplements for older persons at risk of falling. USEFUL RESOURCES The USPSTF has a large portfolio of recommendations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, including smoking cessation; screening for lipid disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cancer; obesity screening and counseling; and aspirin use.

### A short-term dietary supplementation of high doses of vitamin E increases T helper 1 cytokine production in patients with advanced colorectal cancer [^112rQGN4]. Clinical Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with advanced cancer exhibit multifaceted defects in their immune capacity, which are likely to contribute to an increased susceptibility to infections and disease progression and to constitute a barrier to immunotherapeutic interventions. A chronic inflammatory condition associated with increased oxidative stress has been suggested as one of the responsible mechanisms behind the tumor-induced immune suppression. We, therefore, speculated that supplementation with the antioxidant vitamin E could enhance the immune functions in patients with advanced cancer.

Experimental Design

This hypothesis was here tested in twelve patients with colorectal cancer (Dukes' C and D) who, prior to intervention with chemo- or radiotherapy, received a daily dose of 750 mg of vitamin E during a period of 2 weeks.

Results

Short-term supplementation with high doses of dietary vitamin E leads to increased CD4:CD8 ratios and to enhanced capacity by their T cells to produce the T helper 1 cytokines interleukin 2 and IFN-gamma. In 10 of 12 patients, an increase of 10% or more (average, 22%) in the number of T cells producing interleukin 2 was seen after 2 weeks of vitamin E supplementation, as compared with peripheral blood monocyte samples taken before treatment (P = 0.02). Interestingly, there seemed to be a more pronounced stimulatory effect by vitamin E on naïve (CD45RA(+)) T helper cells as compared with T cells with a memory/activated phenotype.

Conclusions

Dietary vitamin E may be used to improve the immune functions in patients with advanced cancer, as a supplement to more specific immune interventions.

### Vitamin D modulation of innate immune responses to respiratory viral infections [^115bXfJg]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin D, in addition to its classical functions in bone homeostasis, has a modulatory and regulatory role in multiple processes, including host defense, inflammation, immunity, and epithelial repair. Patients with respiratory disease are frequently deficient in vitamin D, implying that supplementation might provide significant benefit to these patients. Respiratory viral infections are common and are the main trigger of acute exacerbations and hospitalization in children and adults with asthma and other airways diseases. Respiratory monocytes/macrophages and epithelial cells constitutively express the vitamin D receptor. Vitamin D, acting through this receptor, may be important in protection against respiratory infections. Whether the in vitro findings can be translated into a substantial in vivo benefit still remains uncertain. Here we review the in vitro data on the role of vitamin D in antiviral innate immunity, the data concerning the deficient levels of vitamin D in lung diseases, and the in vivo role of supplementation as protection against respiratory viral infections in healthy individuals and in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Finally, we suggest ways of improving the effectiveness of vitamin D as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections.

### Dietary micronutrients in the wake of COVID-19: an appraisal of evidence with a focus on high-risk groups and preventative healthcare [^1175ECLD]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Elderly people are at higher risk of vitamin C deficiency, and once deficient are more likely to have a compromised immune system, infections and develop sepsis. Supplementation has reduced incidence and duration of RTI and severity of pneumonia in hospitalised older adults, while prophylactic supplementation has also been demonstrated to reduce the risk of acquiring pneumonia in patients with poor baseline status. Lower vitamin E status is commonly found in the elderly. Beneficial effects of supplementation have been observed in older institutionalised residents, with alpha-tocopherol shown to specifically enhance the dampened immune response associated with ageing. Zinc deficiency is more prevalent in the elderly and contributes to immunosenescense. Reduced immune function occurs even if deficiency is marginal, which is common in elderly populations due to plasma zinc concentration declining with age. Zinc deficiency is common in the institutionalised elderly, and higher status (> 70 mg/dL) appears to be predictive of lower pneumonia incidence and more favourable treatment outcomes.RCTs have demonstrated that the supplementation of high doses (45 mg) in healthy elderly individuals improves several aspects of immune functioning and reduces the incidence of infections.

The role of micronutrients in mediating the inflammatory response is particularly relevant in the systemic inflammatory response observed in sepsis, an over-reactive host response to infection. Higher vitamin D status is associated with decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and conversely low status appears to be associated with the activation of inflammatory processes. This could be particularly relevant when considering the relationship between vitamin D and the mediation of inflammation in critically ill patients. The activation of vitamin D in the lung has the potential to induce specific antimicrobials and attenuate inflammatory cytokines in response to viruses, which is particularly relevant in the case of sepsis derived from lung infection. Cytokine production is altered during zinc deficiency, contributing to oxidative stress and inflammation. Inadequate zinc status has been associated with increased susceptibility to sepsis and fatality to infection. This can have severe consequences in patients who require intensive care. Selenium has a role in the regulation of cytokines and deficiency is associated with clinical sepsis. In these patients, status can be predictive of outcomesand improved outcomes have been shown through supplementation in RCTs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

### Nutrition, immunity and COVID-19 [^115T2R8B]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

The immune system protects the host from pathogenic organisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites). To deal with this array of threats, the immune system has evolved to include a myriad of specialised cell types, communicating molecules and functional responses. The immune system is always active, carrying out surveillance, but its activity is enhanced if an individual becomes infected. This heightened activity is accompanied by an increased rate of metabolism, requiring energy sources, substrates for biosynthesis and regulatory molecules, which are all ultimately derived from the diet. A number of vitamins (A, B 6, B 12, folate, C, D and E) and trace elements (zinc, copper, selenium, iron) have been demonstrated to have key roles in supporting the human immune system and reducing risk of infections. Other essential nutrients including other vitamins and trace elements, amino acids and fatty acids are also important. Each of the nutrients named above has roles in supporting antibacterial and antiviral defence, but zinc and selenium seem to be particularly important for the latter. It would seem prudent for individuals to consume sufficient amounts of essential nutrients to support their immune system to help them deal with pathogens should they become infected. The gut microbiota plays a role in educating and regulating the immune system. Gut dysbiosis is a feature of disease including many infectious diseases and has been described in COVID-19. Dietary approaches to achieve a healthy microbiota can also benefit the immune system. Severe infection of the respiratory epithelium can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterised by excessive and damaging host inflammation, termed a cytokine storm. This is seen in cases of severe COVID-19. There is evidence from ARDS in other settings that the cytokine storm can be controlled by n-3 fatty acids, possibly through their metabolism to specialised pro-resolving mediators.

### Micronutrient deficiencies in patients with COVID-19: how metabolomics can contribute to their prevention and replenishment [^115N9zTZ]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Dear Editors,

Reading the recent article by McAuliffe et al, we were interested in the approach presented to target the micronutrient deficiencies of the high-risk population for COVID-19 and empower their immune system against the infection. The authors present evidence on the central role of selected nutrients on the immune system function against respiratory infections while showing clinical data from studies using prophylactic supplementation.

However, clinical studies have not yielded conclusive results on the beneficial role of nutrient supplementation to the support of the immune system that can be translated into clinical practice. The authors report three main reasons that we will elaborate on in this letter: (1) poor study design; (2) lack of an established methodology for the assessment of the micronutrient status; and (3) unstandardised optimal dosing of the nutritional supplements.

Clinical studies are usually designed to assess the role of a single nutrient on the immune system function. Although this approach facilitates close monitoring of the nutrient subtraction/supplementation effect, it does not reflect the biological system complexity. Thus, several interventional studies report no effect of the nutrient supplementation, which contradicts others that demonstrate a positive impact, hampering the validation of results. It should also be noted that the primary role of nutrients, which is the facilitation of enzymatic reactions, is accomplished via the synergy of multiple nutrients. Thus, a combination of nutrients should be given as intervention instead of single nutrients. In addition, a nutrient cocktail could be provided at baseline to cover some of the deficiencies permitting the normal function of metabolic pathways, prior to the administration of a single nutrient in a dose–response manner to assess its effect on health and disease. A control group receiving the nutrient cocktail should also be included in these studies in addition to the no-intake control group. Such study design might also reduce the interindividual differences in response to the intervention, caused by the diverse nutrient requirements within the sample population.

### Vitamin D and the immune system: new perspectives on an old theme [^114oNx4R]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

It is almost 30 years since an interaction between vitamin D and the immune system was first documented. Although this was initially proposed as a nonclassic effect of vitamin D associated with granulomatous diseases, our current view is now changed considerably. Recent studies have shown a potential physiologic role for vitamin D in regulating normal innate and adaptive immunity. Future studies now need to focus on the clinical implications of vitamin D–mediated immunity and, in particular, the possible beneficial effects of supplementary vitamin D with respect to infectious and autoimmune diseases.

### Vitamin C as a cardioprotective agent against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity [^116GXahL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological Application

Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant by scavenging free radicals and ROS in the body. It works by transferring or donating electrons to neutralize oxidative damage, thereby reducing sulfur, nitrogen, and unstable oxygen radicals. Additionally, vitamin C plays an important role in the regeneration of other antioxidants (ie, vitamin E). Research has demonstrated that vitamin C can inhibit peroxide radical‐induced lipid peroxidation in human plasma, affording further protection against oxidative stress.

Vitamin C boosts immune function, helps avoid allergic reactions, and improves the absorption of iron, calcium, and folic acid. Reduced intracellular vitamin C levels have been linked to immune suppression. Moreover, vitamin C is necessary for the interferon synthesis, immunoglobulin synthesis and inhibition of IL‐18 (interleukin‐18), which is a factor in the regulation of malignant tumors.

Vitamin C also supports gallbladder function by aiding in the production of bile and facilitating the elimination of steroid hormones. It also serves as an essential cofactor for lysyl and prolyl hydroxylases enzymes that are essential for stabilizing and cross‐linking type I and III collagen fibers. Furthermore, vitamin C is essential for the intracellular signaling that encourages the proliferation of fibroblasts, which is necessary for tissue repair and wound healing.

In 1969, it was first reported that high concentrations of intravenously administered vitamin C could have a pro‐oxidant effect on cancer cellsRecent studies by Yun et al have suggested that vitamin C might selectively kill cancer cells by inducing (H 2 O 2) production. This selective action is thought to occur because cancer cells have lower levels of antioxidant enzymes compared with normal cells. However, this theory remains controversial, as H 2 O 2 is commonly produced by cells, especially in malignant conditions, and could be directly administered instead of vitamin C.

### Vitamin effects on the immune system: vitamins A and D take centre stage [^115qkSsS]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamins are essential constituents of our diet that have long been known to influence the immune system. Vitamins A and D have received particular attention in recent years as these vitamins have been shown to have an unexpected and crucial effect on the immune response. We present and discuss our current understanding of the essential roles of vitamins in modulating a broad range of immune processes, such as lymphocyte activation and proliferation, T-helper-cell differentiation, tissue-specific lymphocyte homing, the production of specific antibody isotypes and regulation of the immune response. Finally, we discuss the clinical potential of vitamin A and D metabolites for modulating tissue-specific immune responses and for preventing and/or treating inflammation and autoimmunity.

### Health effects of vitamin D supplementation: lessons learned from randomized controlled trials and mendelian randomization studies [^116iFrFV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and many cellular processes. Although vitamin D supplements are widely recommended for community-dwelling adults, definitive data on whether these supplements benefit clinically important skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes have been conflicting. Although observational studies on effects of vitamin D on musculoskeletal and extraskeletal outcomes may be confounded by reverse causation, randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies can help to elucidate causation. In this review, we summarize the recent findings from large RCTs and/or MR studies of vitamin D on bone health and risk of fractures, falls, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, disorders of the immune system, multiple sclerosis, and mortality in community-dwelling adults. The primary analyses indicate that vitamin D supplementation does not decrease bone loss, fractures, falls, cancer incidence, hypertension, or cardiovascular risk in generally healthy populations. Large RCTs and meta-analyses suggest an effect of supplemental vitamin D on cancer mortality. The existence of extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D supplementations are best documented for the immune system especially in people with poor vitamin D status, autoimmune diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Accumulating evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce all-cause mortality. These findings, in mostly vitamin D-replete populations, do not apply to older adults in residential communities or adults with vitamin D deficiency or osteoporosis. The focus of vitamin D supplementation should shift from widespread use in generally healthy populations to targeted vitamin D supplementation in select individuals, good nutritional approaches, and elimination of vitamin D deficiency globally. © 2023 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

### Induction of cellular and molecular immunomodulatory pathways by vitamin E and vitamin C [^117EU61P]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamins E and C are well known small molecules that have been used to maintain health for decades. Recent studies of the cellular and molecular pathways leading to immunomodulation by these molecules have been of interest, as have their anti-oxidant properties and signal transduction pathways for curing or improving infectious diseases and cancer. Areas covered: Herein, the authors provide a definition and the structural classification of vitamins E and C and how these molecules influence cellular function. The studies include in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies in animal models as well as clinical trials. The authors give particular focus to the scientifically factual and putative roles of these molecules in innate and adaptive immunomodulation and prevention or cure of diseases. Expert opinion: The antioxidant properties of vitamins E and C are well studied. However, whether there is a link between their antioxidant and immunomodulation properties is unclear. In addition, there is a strong, albeit putative, prevailing notion that vitamin C can prevent or cure infectious diseases or cancer. Presently, while there is proven evidence that vitamin E possesses immunomodulatory properties that may play a positive role in disease outcomes, this evidence is less available for vitamin C.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^111pGDWj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is another micronutrient that is more intensively studied in the area of cold prevention and management. However, studies presented conflicting observations – until a recent review pooled individual participant data from primary studies to provide a more definite conclusion on vitamin D's effect on common cold. The review indicated that vitamin D did not prevent colds in adults, regardless of health status (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.10; P = 0.41). Although the aforementioned review analyzed data at the individual participant level, its analysis was not focused on a healthy adult population, as with the other available literature which evaluated micronutrients' efficacy on the relevant outcomes but were rarely focused on a healthy adult population. The healthy adult population is often overlooked compared with the diseased and/or vulnerable (children and older) populations, where micronutrient deficiency is prevalent and supplementation had been shown to help with cold prevention and/or management. Although there are no global statistics on the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency in seemingly healthy adults, a review on the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency in the Middle East found up to 51.8% women and 27% men were suffering from vitamin D deficiency, and up to 27.2% healthy women were anemic. Thus, there is a possibility that healthy adults may benefit from micronutrient supplementation, especially if they were already deficient. From the public health standpoint, it is also important to prevent and/or manage colds in the healthy adult population, to maintain their good health status and reduce public health burden. Moreover, the evidence of other micronutrients supplementation on the management and protection against colds has also been limited. Thus, there is a need to systematically assess the existing literature, specifically randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to better understand the importance and effects of all micronutrients, except vitamin C, in fending off and managing colds among healthy adults, other than in diseased and/or vulnerable populations. This systematic review aims to assess whether 1) regular oral supplementation of a micronutrient singly prevents cold incidence or 2) oral provision of a micronutrient singly when infected with cold decreases its duration or severity among healthy adults aged between 18 and 65 years. In addition, we aim to assess the certainty of the evidence collected for each outcome of interest, when possible, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

### Vitamin D and innate immunity [^111wR37Q]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D's role in bone health has been well established. Recently, studies have identified additional roles of vitamin D in the immune system, cardiovascular system, and cancer prevention. The effect of vitamin D on the immune system is particularly relevant to the dermatologist in that it has implications for atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and skin cancer. However, there is much disagreement on a dose of vitamin D that is both safe and effective as both ultraviolet exposure and certain vitamin D-rich foods come with unwanted consequences. This review aims to update the dermatologist on the roles of vitamin D in the immune system, the safety and dose of different sources, and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency that may necessitate supplementation. Immune consequences of vitamin D status represent one additional aspect that illustrates how guidelines for supplementation are needed and will only be useful clinically if they are presented in context with validated controlled clinical trials.

### Effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on upper respiratory tract infections in healthy adults: the VIDARIS randomized controlled trial… [^1141JjCm]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

The mean baseline 25-OHD level of participants was 29 ng/mL. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in an increase in serum 25-OHD levels that was maintained at greater than 48 ng/mL throughout the study. The role of vitamin D in infectious diseases and the potential impact of vitamin D supplementation as a preventive measure for infectious diseases are unclear. 1 Vitamin D has a role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Of particular interest is the induction by vitamin D of cathelicidins, a group of antimicrobial peptides produced by neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells. Epidemiological studies show an association between low vitamin D levels and a variety of respiratory tract infections. For example, vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased risk of developing tuberculosis.

1.

This finding is consistent with 2 other randomized controlled trials that were specifically designed to assess whether vitamin D supplementation prevents acute respiratory infections in adults. Li-Ng et al8 found no decrease in the incidence or severity of URTIs with vitamin D supplementation during winter in 162 adults. However, this study was of short duration, was underpowered, and first administered vitamin D3 during winter. Strengths of our study include the relatively large sample size, the 18-month duration, and the high dose of vitamin D3 administered, thus avoiding the shortcomings of previous adult studies. Our dosing regimen, started during summer/fall, resulted in sustained mean 25-OHD levels greater than 48 ng/mL throughout the study period in those in the intervention group. Other strengths are the rigorous efforts to capture URTI episodes and the collection of virological data.

With regard to safety, our regimen of monthly 100 000-IU doses of vitamin D3 was more than 5 times the recommended daily allowance of 600 IU for adequacy in adults, 28 yet we documented no episodes of hypercalcemia and no adverse events attributed to vitamin D. In conclusion, we report that monthly administration of 100 000-IU doses of vitamin D3 did not reduce the incidence or severity of URTIs in healthy, predominantly European adults with near-normal vitamin D levels. Further research is required to clarify whether there is benefit from supplementation in other populations and with other dosing regimens.

### Effect of micronutrient supplements on influenza and other respiratory tract infections among adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116W3y9o]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

We reviewed 80 RCTs that examined the effects of micronutrients on the occurrence and course of ARIs among adults. Vitamin D, vitamin C and MMS reduced the risk of ARIs by 3%–21%. Vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc shortened the duration of ARI symptoms by 6%–59%. Here we explore these results and identify gaps in published studies.

Our findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation reduces ARI risk by 3% overall, and by 18% when ARI was diagnosed based on laboratory testing or clinical diagnosis. This is comparable to findings in previous meta-analyses. The current study focuses on adults and includes recent trials. Vitamin D levels are insufficient in ≥ 50% of the global population, even though moderate sun exposure should be enough to prevent it. Vitamin D modulates immunity through effects on macrophage, dendritic and T cell function. Vitamin D promotes T-helper 2 (Th2) response and suppresses T-helper 1 (Th1) cells by enhancing interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10 production. In addition, many pathogens provoke oxidative stress and vitamin D enhances the production of antioxidative enzymes that counter it. Notably, the trials were conducted in temperate, high-income countries, limiting the generalisability of our findings to this setting. Further, the studies did not always report baseline levels of vitamin D and any adverse events of supplementation.

Vitamin C was observed to have a modest effect of preventing ARIs and shortening the duration of ARI symptoms. This is consistent with evidence from previously published meta-analyses. Vitamin C is an important cofactor for enzymes involved in tissue repair after an insult or injury. Vitamin C also has critical antioxidant properties, thereby limiting inflammation and improving recovery. This effect is stronger in people with vitamin C deficiency, as well as those undergoing stressful conditions. Though frank vitamin C deficiency or scurvy is rare, recent studies have shown the potential for adverse consequences in persons with subnormal vitamin C levels. Notably, the effect of vitamin C to prevent ARIs was considerably stronger in middle-income countries, compared with high-income ones. There was no significant dose-response relationship of vitamin C with the risk of ARI or duration of symptoms, and included studies did not evaluate the adverse events due to vitamin C.

### Vitamin D and respiratory health [^11313PxD]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is now known to be of physiological importance outside of bone health and calcium homeostasis, and there is mounting evidence that it plays a beneficial role in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of diseases. In this brief review the known effects of vitamin D on immune function are described in relation to respiratory health. Vitamin D appears capable of inhibiting pulmonary inflammatory responses while enhancing innate defence mechanisms against respiratory pathogens. Population-based studies showing an association between circulating vitamin D levels and lung function provide strong justification for randomized controlled clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with respiratory diseases to assess both efficacy and optimal dosage.

### Micronutrient supplementation in adults with HIV infection [^113Z9Rw7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Micronutrient deficiencies are common among adults living with HIV disease, particularly in low‐income settings where the diet may be low in essential vitamins and minerals. Some micronutrients play critical roles in maintenance of the immune system, and routine supplementation could therefore be beneficial. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2010.

Objectives

To assess whether micronutrient supplements are effective and safe in reducing mortality and HIV‐related morbidity of HIV‐positive adults (excluding pregnant women).

Search methods

We performed literature searches from January 2010 to 18 November 2016 for new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of micronutrient supplements since the previous review included all trials identified from searches prior to 2010. We searched the CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), Embase, and PubMed databases. Also we checked the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of all new included trials.

Selection criteria

We included RCTs that compared supplements that contained either single, dual, or multiple micronutrients with placebo, no treatment, or other supplements. We excluded studies that were primarily designed to investigate the role of micronutrients for the treatment of HIV‐positive participants with metabolic morbidity related to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Primary outcomes included all‐cause mortality, morbidity, and disease progression.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, and appraised trial quality for risk of bias. Where possible, we presented results as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous variables, as hazard ratios (HRs) for time‐to‐event data, and as mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, each with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Since we were often unable to pool the outcome data, we tabulated it for each comparison. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

We included 33 trials with 10,325 participants, of which 17 trials were new trials. Ten trials compared a daily multiple micronutrient supplement to placebo in doses up to 20 times the dietary reference intake, and one trial compared a daily standard dose with a high daily dose of multivitamins. Nineteen trials compared supplementation with single or dual micronutrients (such as vitamins A and D, zinc, and selenium) to placebo, and three trials compared different dosages or combinations of micronutrients.

Multiple micronutrients

We conducted analyses across antiretroviral therapy (ART)‐naive adults (3 trials, 1448 participants), adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (1 trial, 400 participants), and ART‐naive adults with concurrent active tuberculosis (3 trials, 1429 participants). Routine multiple micronutrient supplementation may have little or no effect on mortality in adults living with HIV (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.15; 7 trials, 2897 participants, low certainty evidence).

Routine supplementation for up to two years may have little or no effect on the average of mean CD4+ cell count (MD 26.40 cells/mm³, 95% CI −22.91 to 75.70; 6 trials, 1581 participants, low certainty evidence), or the average of mean viral load (MD −0.1 log 10 viral copies, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.06; 4 trials, 840 participants, moderate certainty evidence). One additional trial in ART‐naïve adults did report an increase in the time to reach a CD4+ cell count < 250 cells/mm³ after two years of high dose supplementation in Botswana (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.88; 1 trial, 439 participants). However, the trial authors reported this effect only in the trial arm that received multiple micronutrients plus selenium (not either supplementation alone), which is inconsistent with the findings of other trials that used similar combinations of micronutrients and selenium.

In one additional trial that compared high‐dose multiple micronutrient supplementation with standard doses in people on ART, peripheral neuropathy was lower with high dose supplements compared to standard dose (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.94; 1 trial, 3418 participants), but the trial was stopped early due to increased adverse events (elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels) in the high dose group.

Single or dual micronutrients

None of the trials of single or dual micronutrient supplements were adequately powered to assess for effects on mortality or morbidity outcomes. No clinically significant changes in CD4 cell count (data not pooled, 14 trials, 2370 participants, very low or low certainty evidence) or viral load (data not pooled, seven studies, 1334 participants, very low or low certainty evidence), were reported. Supplementation probably does increase blood concentrations of vitamin D and zinc (data not pooled, vitamin D: 4 trials, 299 participants, zinc: 4 trials, 484 participants, moderate certainty evidence) and may also increase blood concentrations of vitamin A (data not pooled, 3 trials, 495 participants, low certainty evidence), especially in those who are deficient.

Authors' conclusions

The analyses of the available trials have not revealed consistent clinically important benefits with routine multiple micronutrient supplementation in people living with HIV. Larger trials might reveal small but important effects.

These findings should not be interpreted as a reason to deny micronutrient supplements for people living with HIV where specific deficiencies are found or where the person's diet is insufficient to meet the recommended daily allowance of vitamins and minerals.

### Zinc supplementation reduces common cold duration among healthy adults: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with micronutrients supplementation [^112b9zvX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The common cold had resulted in significant economic and social burden worldwide. The effect of vitamin C on preventing common cold in healthy adults has been investigated extensively, but not that of other micronutrients. Thus, we aim to assess the effects of providing micronutrients singly through oral means, on cold incidence, and/or management (in terms of cold duration and symptom severity) in healthy adults from systematically searched randomized controlled trials. From four electronic databases, 660 identified studies were screened and data were extracted from 20 studies (zinc, 10; vitamin D, 8; and vitamins A and E, 2). The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and certainty in the outcomes was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. The review found that micronutrients supplementation, except vitamin C, may not prevent cold incidence or reduce symptom severity among healthy adults. However, zinc supplementation was observed to potentially reduce cold duration by 2.25 days (when zinc is provided singly, 95% CI: -3.39, -1.12). This suggests that zinc supplementation may reduce the overall burden due to common cold among healthy adults.

### Effects of supplementation with tocotrienol-rich fraction on immune response to tetanus toxoid immunization in normal healthy volunteers [^1163u9Zd]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Vitamin E is an essential fat-soluble vitamin that has been shown to induce favorable effects on animal and human immune systems. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) supplementation on immune response following tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine challenge in healthy female volunteers.

Subjects/Methods

In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (control group) or 400 mg of TRF (study group) supplementation daily. Over the 2-month period of the study, volunteers were asked to attend three clinical sessions (that is, on days 0, 28 and 56) and blood samples were obtained from the volunteers during the follow-up. On day 28, all volunteers were also vaccinated with the TT vaccine (20 Lf) intramuscularly.

Results

The results from the clinical trial showed that TRF supplementation significantly increased the total vitamin E level in the plasma of the TRF-supplemented volunteers compared with the placebo group, indicating overall compliance. Volunteers supplemented with TRF showed a significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced production of interferon-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 by the mitogen or TT-stimulated leukocytes compared with the control group. Volunteers from the TRF group produced significantly (P < 0.05) lower amounts of IL-6 compared with the placebo group. Anti-TT IgG production was also significantly (P < 0.05) augmented in the TRF-supplemented group compared with the placebo group.

Conclusions

We conclude that TRF has immunostimulatory effects and potential clinical benefits to enhance immune response to vaccines.

Figure 4
Vitamin C and the risk of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) among adults. RE, Random effects.

Omitting one studywith an RR of 0.91 (95% CI 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98) in influence analysis changed the pooled RR to 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.01). I 2 did not change. The pooled RR significantly differed by sex (p = 0.049). The pooled RR was 1.11 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.30) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.96) in women and men, respectively. The pooled RR significantly differed by country income classification (p = 0.017). The pooled RR was 0.65 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.89) in middle-income countries and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.99) in high-income countries. The pooled RR was neither influenced by the magnitude of the daily dose (p = 0.63) nor the loading dose (p = 0.18). The pooled RR was not significantly influenced by mean age, but none of the included studies were restricted to older adults (mean age of participants > 60 years). The pooled RR was also not significantly influenced by mean age or duration of the trial.

The pooled RR of the effect of vitamin C on prevention of common cold was 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.99; p = 0.022; online supplemental figure 6). There was no heterogeneity in the estimates (I 2 = 0%). The funnel plot was asymmetrical, (online supplemental figure 7), suggesting possible publication bias. Trim-and-fill analysis suggests one study may be missing on the right side, and the corrected pooled RR does not change.

### Nutrition, immunity and COVID-19 [^1118RnVY]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin E, immunity and infection

There are a number of reviews of the role of vitamin E in immunity and host susceptibility to infection. These reviews contain citations to the many studies of vitamin E, immunity and infection that will be summarised here. In laboratory animals, vitamin E deficiency decreases lymphocyte proliferation, natural killer cell activity, specific antibody production following vaccination and phagocytosis by neutrophils. Vitamin E deficiency also increases susceptibility of animals to infectious pathogens. Vitamin E supplementation of the diet of laboratory animals enhances antibody production, lymphocyte proliferation, T helper 1-type cytokine production, natural killer cell activity and macrophage phagocytosis. Vitamin E promotes interaction between dendritic cells and CD4 + T lymphocytes. There is a positive association between plasma vitamin E and cell-mediated immune responses, and a negative association has been demonstrated between plasma vitamin E and the risk of infections in healthy adults over 60 years of age. There appears to be particular benefit of vitamin E supplementation for the elderly. Studies by Meydani et al demonstrated that vitamin E supplementation at high doses (one studyused 800 mg/day and the otherused doses of 60, 200 and 800 mg/day) enhanced T helper 1 cell-mediated immunity (lymphocyte proliferation, IL-2 production) and improved vaccination responses, including to hepatitis B virus. Supplementation of older adults with vitamin E (200 mg/day) improved neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis, natural killer cell activity and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Secondary analysis of data from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study identified that daily vitamin E supplements for 5 to 8 years reduced the incidence of hospital treated, community-acquired pneumonia in smokers. One study reported that vitamin E supplementation (200 IU/day~135 mg/day) for 1 year decreased risk of upper respiratory tract infections in the elderly, but another study did not see an effect of supplemental vitamin E (200 mg/day) on the incidence, duration or severity of respiratory infections in an elderly population.

### Vitamin C augments lymphocyte glutathione in subjects with ascorbate deficiency [^113Bw9x2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Ascorbate and glutathione play central roles in the defense against free radicals and oxidants that are implicated in chronic diseases.

Objective

The objective was to determine the ability of vitamin C supplements to modulate the concentration of glutathione in human lymphocytes.

Design

The effect of vitamin C supplements was determined in a sequential study with time points before supplementation, after 13 wk of vitamin C supplements (500 or 1000 mg/d), and after 13 wk of matching placebo. The supplementation group was selected on the basis of low plasma ascorbate (< 33 mmol/L) and consisted of 48 healthy men and women, smokers and nonsmokers, aged 25–64 y. Ascorbate and glutathione were measured in purified lymphocytes.

Results

At baseline, the mean (± SD) concentration of plasma ascorbate was 19.5 ± 7.2 micro mol/L, 22.5 micro mol/L below the median of normal distribution. The ascorbate concentration in plasma was linearly associated with that in lymphocytes (r = 0.53, P < 0.001). On supplementation with vitamin C, lymphocyte ascorbate increased by 51% (from 16.7 ± 4.9 to 25.3 ± 6.9 nmol/mg protein; P < 0.001) and was accompanied by an increase of lymphocyte glutathione by 18% (from 22.5 ± 4.5 to 26.6 ± 6.5 nmol/mg protein; P < 0.001). After placebo, the ascorbate and glutathione concentrations fell to near baseline concentrations (17.1 ± 5.4 and 23.5 ± 6.4 nmol/mg protein, respectively). No significant interaction was observed for sex and smoking status. Finally, the changes in lymphocyte ascorbate after supplementation were strongly associated with changes in lymphocyte glutathione (r = 0.71, P < 0.001). The association suggests that every 1-mol change in ascorbate is accompanied by a change of approximately 0.5 mol in glutathione.

Conclusion

Vitamin C supplements increase glutathione in human lymphocytes.

### What do we really know about micronutrient supplementation and risk for upper respiratory infection? [^1161xSwH]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Populations. The studies included in the review by Abioye et al enrolled populations that we know from other research have a wide range of baseline health and micronutrient status and usual intakes and, in the case of vitamin D, sun exposure, but few of the studies actually reported or accounted for baseline status in analysing the results of supplementation. As the authors noted, trials in low-income and middle-income countries were more likely to observe beneficial effects of vitamin D supplements on risk for developing URIs. Types of URIs also varied between viral and bacterial. Although not certain, this difference could potentially have contributed to heterogeneity within and among studies.

Interventions. Immune function is affected by the total diet, especially by intake of protein and calories. In low-income and middle-income countries, the likelihood of macronutrient inadequacy among those with inadequate micronutrient status cannot be dismissed. This is one of the challenges of identifying the role of individual micronutrient status in human immune function, and it could help explain the findings of Abioye et al that micronutrient supplements have at best borderline significant impacts on the risk for URIs. The studies on multivitamin combinations were too small in number and heterogeneous in intervention design to combine meaningfully.

Few if any of the studies Abioye et al identified assessed achieved nutrient status following supplementation, despite adequate biomarkers of status, especially for vitamin D. However, another major concern when pooling studies of vitamin D supplementation is that the methods used to assess vitamin D have changed over time, such that older and newer studies really should not be pooled. The Vitamin D Standardization Program has published a manual that enables comparison of study findings across time and assay methods.

Another concern with the studies is the wide range of dosing across the studies included in the review, from physiological to clearly pharmacological doses. Part of the concern involves verifying the actual nutrient contents of the supplements. However, a bigger concern is that dietary supplements delivered at supraphysiological doses can have effects that are totally unrelated to the physiological roles of the nutrients.

### Is vitamin supplementation appropriate in the healthy old? [^115KzJbf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vitamin supplements are used by large numbers of older adults. Although vitamins serve several functions in the body, the benefits or harm of routine supplementation are far from clear. Data from studies over the last decade are reviewed to enable an understanding.

Recent Findings

Summarized data from studies conducted over the last few years, pertinent to the use of vitamins, as multivitamin combinations and as individual vitamins specifically A, D, E, C, and the B group, are presented. This review targets the benefits and harm of multivitamins when used to lower the risk of cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, visual disorders (e.g., cataracts and age-related macular degeneration), and bone disease. The effects of vitamins on total mortality are discussed. In addition, isolated or multiple vitamin deficiencies, their predisposing settings and manifestations from mild-to-life-threatening illness are discussed.

Summary

Data from studies demonstrate considerable variations, most confirming little to no benefit following supplementation in healthy adults. However, clear roles exist for vitamin supplementation in states of deficiency and in subgroups of older adults at high risk for deficiency of specific or multiple vitamins. In these settings, vitamin supplements help prevent or correct deficiency and related manifestations.

### Prevention of exacerbations in patients with COPD and vitamin D deficiency through vitamin D supplementation (PRECOVID): a study protocol [^114zWMkj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin D and pulmonary infections

Vitamin D might influence the development and course of tuberculosis. Patients with low 25(OH)D concentrations have a higher risk of active tuberculosis and vitamin D supplementation may shorten the duration of disease. It is also known that patients with rickets more frequently suffer from airway infections and pneumonia. Several prospective cohort studies in the general population show that lower levels of 25(OH)D are related to increased risk of respiratory infections. A trial with Japanese schoolchildren during the influenza season demonstrated that, compared to placebo, vitamin D supplementation lowered the incidence of influenza A infections. Trials assessing effects of vitamin D supplementation on prevention of respiratory infections in the general adult population have shown conflicting results, which may partly be attributed to differences in prevalence of vitamin D deficiency at baseline and rise of serum 25(OH)D levels during treatments.

Vitamin D and COPD

Patients with COPD are characterised by an abnormal inflammatory response of the airways. Viral and bacterial infections are important triggers of exacerbations and contribute to its progression. Thus, potential effects of vitamin D on the immune system pose an attractive mechanism for the treatment of COPD. Also, in some, but not all studies in the general population serum 25(OH)D is positively associated with lung function. Vitamin D deficiency is present in 40–80% of patients with COPD and is related to disease severity. Recent cohort studies, however, did not show a relationship between 25(OH)D levels and exacerbation rate, although these studies had limited statistical power to rule out effects of vitamin D deficiency.

In addition to exacerbations and lung function, skeletal muscle dysfunction in COPD patients contributes to poor exercise capacity, decreased quality of life and increased mortality. In COPD patients, vitamin D deficiency is related to impaired physical performance. In healthy adults, positive effects of vitamin D supplementation have been demonstrated on muscle function and physical performance in particular in older and frail individuals.

### Vitamin A supplementation coverage and associated factors among Ethiopian children under five years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154Rp3X]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin A is a fat-soluble micronutrient, playing a pivotal role in maintaining numerous critical physiological functions throughout the human lifespan. These include its well-established role in vision, particularly adaptation to low light; its crucial involvement in immune system function, enhancing the body's defense against infections; support for healthy growth and development; and its essential contribution to cellular differentiation, ensuring proper tissue formation and maintenance. Despite its vital importance, Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) remains a widespread global public health issue, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations, particularly children. Children under five years of age are particularly susceptible, especially those residing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This heightened vulnerability in young children stems from several factors: their rapid growth and development necessitate increased vitamin A requirements; inherently lower baseline vitamin A stores at birth; and a high propensity for recurrent infections, which can rapidly deplete existing vitamin A reserves. The epidemiological burden of VAD is alarmingly high in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with prevalence rates among children ranging from 42.4 to 48%, underscoring a significant health crisis in the region.

The consequences of VAD in young children are profound and contribute substantially to the global burden of disease and mortality in this age group. VAD is directly associated with an increased risk and severity of common childhood infections such as measles, diarrhea, and acute respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, it impairs growth and development, compromises overall nutritional status, and is the leading preventable cause of childhood blindness globally, manifesting as xerophthalmia — a spectrum of eye conditions from night blindness to irreversible corneal damage. Ultimately, these severe impacts collectively elevate child morbidity and mortality rates. Within this global context, Ethiopia, an East African nation, faces a significant and recognized public health burden of vitamin A deficiency, which is a major contributing factor to its high rates of childhood morbidity and mortality.

Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) is a cost-effective and crucial public health intervention for preventing and controlling VAD in young children. Periodic VAS has been shown to substantially reduce childhood morbidity and mortality, particularly from measles, diarrhea, and respiratory infections. Vitamin A supplementation improves vitamin A status, strengthens the immune system, enhances resistance to infections, and promotes overall child health and survival. In recognition of its profound benefits, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF strongly recommend routine VAS every six months for children aged 6–59 months in regions where vitamin A deficiency is considered a public health problem.

### Nutrition and immunity: lessons for COVID-19 [^112UMYfp]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Taken together, the existing evidence indicates that multiple micronutrients play vital roles in supporting all aspects of the immune response and therefore that their intake and status need to be considered in the context of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Roles of specific nutrients including vitamin D and zinc in anti-viral immunity seem to be important and the ability of selenium to prevent viral mutation is intriguing in the context of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, low intakes of several micronutrients impair vaccination responses and so must be considered in the context of the current and future COVID-19 vaccination programmes; this is likely to be particularly important in the elderly but also in other groups who are more likely to have low intakes or status of one or more micronutrients. Although micronutrients are provided as part of a diverse, plant-based diet (see ref.) there is a question about whether sufficient amounts of some of the key immune-active micronutrients (vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc and selenium) can be obtained from the diet or whether supplements are necessary to provide the relevant intakes of these micronutrients.

### Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data [^116eHGg3]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of experiencing at least one acute respiratory tract infection. Subgroup analysis revealed that daily or weekly vitamin D supplementation without additional bolus doses protected against acute respiratory tract infection, whereas regimens containing large bolus doses did not. Among those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects were strongest in those with profound vitamin D deficiency at baseline, although those with higher baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations also experienced benefit. This evidence was assessed as being of high quality, using the GRADE criteria. Since baseline vitamin D status and use of bolus doses varied considerably between studies, our results suggest that the high degree of heterogeneity between trials may be at least partly attributable to these factors. Use of vitamin D was safe: potential adverse reactions were rare, and the risk of such events was the same between participants randomised to intervention and control arms.

Why might use of bolus dose vitamin D be ineffective for prevention of acute respiratory tract infection? One explanation relates to the potentially adverse effects of wide fluctuations in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, which are seen after use of bolus doses but not with daily or weekly supplementation. Vieth has proposed that high circulating concentrations after bolus dosing may chronically dysregulate activity of enzymes responsible for synthesis and degradation of the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, resulting in decreased concentrations of this metabolite in extra-renal tissues. Such an effect could attenuate the ability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to support protective immune responses to respiratory pathogens. Increased efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in those with lower baseline vitamin D status is more readily explicable, based on the principle that people who are the most deficient in a micronutrient will be the most likely to respond to its replacement.

### Probiotics and vitamin C for the prevention of respiratory tract infections in children attending preschool: a randomised controlled pilot study [^115EQaMa]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Respiratory tract infection (RTI) in children presents a considerable health-care burden involving not only the cost of direct medical care but also that incurred due to parental absence from work. Children attending preschool are three times more likely to suffer an infection than those staying at home due to high transmission rates within such facilities.RTIs can occur in the upper or lower respiratory tract affecting the sinuses, throat, airways or lungs. Antibiotics are administered for bacterial infections, but their inadvertent use for viral infections is ineffective and can contribute to antibiotic overuse and antibiotic resistance. Alternative strategies for the prevention of RTI in children attending preschool are needed.

Evidence suggests that supplementation with probiotics may prevent upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Probiotics are defined as 'live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host'. Some studies using probiotics alone for children attending preschool facilities have shown significant reductions in incidence and/or duration of URTIs, while others observed little or no effect. Meta-analysis of the results from supplementation with vitamin C also suggests a beneficial effect on the duration of common cold symptoms in children.

Administration of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826 or Lactobacillus reuteri F275 prevented severe RTI in healthy mice by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression at the respiratory mucosa, and an 'anti-inflammatory priming' of immunity has been observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells extracted from healthy humans supplemented with the Lab4 probiotic consortium. Vitamin C has also been shown to hinder the pro-inflammatory cytokine response in monocytes and lymphocytes extracted from healthy adults, but to date, no studies have examined the effect of a probiotic and vitamin C combination on RTI in preschool children. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of a probiotic consortium in combination with vitamin C on both the incidence and duration of RTIs and assess any associated immunological and metabolic changes in children.

### Potential positive effects of multivitamins and minerals… [^113GM2RL]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Although vitamins and minerals are commonly used, the health benefits of these supplements are unclear. Most research has looked at the effect of these supplements on immunity and infectious disease, with conflicting results. Barringer and associates used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the subjective effect of vitamin and mineral supplementation on physical and emotional well-being in healthy adults. A total of 158 participants older than 45 years received a daily oral tablet containing common doses of vitamins and minerals or a control tablet containing calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B 2 for 12 months. All participants completed a stress scale questionnaire and kept a daily food diary. The primary end point was participant-reported infection noted in a daily symptom list kept by all participants as well as a record of infection significance represented by days of missed work or inability to perform planned activities.

Quality of life was assessed at baseline and at 12 months using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short Form. Seventy-three percent of the participants in the control group had at least one infection-related illness, a rate that was significantly greater than the 43 percent infection rate in the treatment group. Illness-related absenteeism also was significantly greater in the control group. These differences were primarily noted among participants with diabetes. There was no difference in effect on quality of life between the treatment and control groups. The authors conclude that although there appears to be no improvement in physical and mental health measures or quality of life among healthy users of daily vitamin and mineral supplements, patients with diabetes who may suffer from micronutrient deficiency demonstrate reduced infection frequency. Further testing is necessary to identify additional populations who may benefit from daily vitamin and mineral supplementation.

In an editorial in the same journal, Fawzi and Stampfer point out the specific vitamin supplements that have been demonstrated to prevent chronic disease in certain situations, including folate, vitamin B 12, vitamin A, andzinc. Although the data are not definite, they suggest that the potential positive impact of supplements on infection deserves further study, especially among susceptible populations, such as patients with diabetes.
