## Question

Can lamotrogene be used to treat depression?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lamotrigine can be used to treat depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA has actually approved lamotrigine for in terms of mood disorders. Then, I should verify whether "depression" refers to unipolar major depressive disorder or bipolar depression, because the evidence base differs. Next, I will review guideline positions for bipolar depression, including maintenance versus acute treatment, and the quality of evidence. After that, I should examine data for unipolar depression and clarify what is known versus unknown. Finally, I need to weigh benefits, risks, dosing strategy, and provide a clear, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indications so I don't overstate anything. Lamotrigine is FDA-approved for maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder to delay recurrence of mood episodes, with the most robust signal for delaying depressive episodes, and it is not approved for acute bipolar depression or for unipolar major depressive disorder, so any use in those contexts would be off-label [^112XGdU1] [^117JhuCQ] [^111d9SkD].

> Wait, let me verify the exact phrasing about depressive episodes versus mania. The pivotal maintenance trials showed lamotrigine prolonged time to intervention for mood episodes overall and specifically delayed depressive episodes, while the effect on mania was weaker or absent in some analyses, reinforcing its relative strength in preventing depression rather than mania [^116vvfka] [^111zXUpk] [^117JhuCQ].

> Next, I should review where guidelines land for bipolar depression. The VA/DoD guideline recommends lamotrigine for prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes with strong support, but for acute bipolar depression it suggests lamotrigine as an adjunct to lithium or quetiapine and concludes that monotherapy evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against, reflecting low to very low certainty of evidence quality [^1141LNbd] [^115x5Cdj] [^111UiB9T].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of acute treatment data before concluding. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews show a modest but real antidepressant effect of lamotrigine in acute bipolar depression, particularly as augmentation or in more severely depressed samples, whereas several large monotherapy RCTs failed on primary endpoints, so the effect size is small and context-dependent; the most consistent, reproducible benefit remains in maintenance rather than acute monotherapy [^1116yoRV] [^1166YUEm] [^114nPjRg].

> I will now examine the evidence for unipolar major depressive disorder, because that's where confusion often arises. The data are limited and mixed: small RCTs of augmentation have shown signals on some secondary outcomes or in completer analyses, but larger, better-powered trials have not demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on primary depression scales; a meta-analysis suggests possible benefit in treatment-resistant populations, but the certainty remains low and lamotrigine is not an established treatment for unipolar depression at this time [^112vGBWD] [^117V1Ljv] [^111dJkGy].

> But wait, what about safety and practicalities that could sway a decision. Lamotrigine generally has a favorable tolerability profile, but it requires slow titration over about six weeks to mitigate the risk of serious rash, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis; drug–drug interactions with valproate and enzyme inducers necessitate dose adjustments, and pooled analyses of antiepileptics show a small increase in suicidal ideation risk, so monitoring for mood and suicidality is prudent during initiation and dose changes [^117V8ZJK] [^111GTYHH] [^111PvFB2].

> Let me consider dosing strategy so I don't gloss over implementation. For bipolar maintenance, the usual target is 200 mg/day, with 100 mg/day if combined with valproate and up to 400 mg/day if combined with enzyme inducers; for acute bipolar depression, when used adjunctively, clinicians often titrate to 200 mg/day over six weeks, recognizing that onset may be delayed relative to agents like quetiapine or lurasidone, which can be important if a rapid response is needed [^111rUvwD] [^111wCovR].

> I should double-check the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. Yes, lamotrigine can be used to treat depression in the context of bipolar disorder, with the clearest, guideline-endorsed role in preventing recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes. For acute bipolar depression, it may be considered as an adjunct, particularly with lithium or quetiapine, but monotherapy evidence is insufficient and effects are modest, so expectations should be calibrated. For unipolar major depressive disorder, evidence is preliminary and lamotrigine is not a standard treatment and should be considered investigational or reserved for select treatment-resistant cases after established strategies fail [^1141LNbd] [^111UiB9T] [^114nPjRg] [^111dJkGy].

Lamotrigine is **FDA-approved for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder** [^112XGdU1] to prevent depressive episodes, with moderate-quality evidence supporting its use [^113MfWrV] [^11546H1w]. For acute bipolar depression, evidence is mixed [^1166YUEm] [^1179VdeD]; **some guidelines suggest adjunctive use with lithium or quetiapine** [^111UiB9T] [^111gWx4D], but monotherapy is not recommended due to insufficient evidence [^113jYqoY]. In unipolar depression, lamotrigine is not FDA-approved and evidence is limited; it may be considered for treatment-resistant cases as an off-label augmentation strategy, but data are inconclusive [^112vGBWD] [^111dJkGy]. Lamotrigine requires slow titration to reduce rash risk [^117V8ZJK], and patients should be monitored for rare but serious adverse effects [^111GTYHH].

## Clinical evidence for lamotrigine in depression

### Bipolar depression

- **Maintenance therapy**: Lamotrigine is FDA-approved for maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder [^112XGdU1], with strong evidence that it delays recurrence of depressive episodes [^111zXUpk] [^114VWFDN].

- **Acute bipolar depression**: Evidence for acute treatment is mixed [^1179VdeD] [^1166YUEm]; some guidelines suggest adjunctive use with lithium or quetiapine [^111UiB9T] [^111gWx4D], but monotherapy is not recommended due to insufficient evidence [^113jYqoY] [^117ArZ3w].

- **Bipolar II depression**: Evidence is limited and conflicting [^114UY5Ui]; some guidelines list lamotrigine as a second-line option [^111v14sJ].

---

### Unipolar depression

In unipolar depression, lamotrigine is **not FDA-approved** and evidence is limited and mixed [^112vGBWD]; it may be considered for treatment-resistant cases as an off-label augmentation strategy, but data are inconclusive [^111dJkGy].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical context** | **Guideline recommendations** |
|-|-|
| Bipolar disorder (maintenance) | Strongly recommended by VA/DoD and CANMAT/ISBD guidelines [^1141LNbd] [^111ZJyUL] [^111i2q4o] |
| Bipolar depression (acute) | Adjunctive use with lithium or quetiapine suggested by VA/DoD; monotherapy not recommended [^111UiB9T] [^111gWx4D] |
| Unipolar depression | Not recommended as first-line; may be considered off-label for treatment-resistant cases |

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Rash risk**: Serious rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, can occur; slow titration is required [^117V8ZJK] [^111GTYHH].

- **Suicidality**: Antiepileptic drugs, including lamotrigine, carry a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior; monitor closely [^111PvFB2] [^1168jE2j].

- **Common side effects**: Headache, dizziness, nausea, insomnia, and mild gastrointestinal symptoms are common but generally well tolerated [^117QdScN].

---

## Practical considerations

- **Titration**: Start low and titrate slowly to minimize rash risk; typical target dose is 200 mg/day, adjusted for interacting medications [^117V8ZJK] [^111rUvwD].

- **Monitoring**: Regular clinical monitoring for efficacy, side effects, and adherence is essential [^117QdScN].

- **Patient selection**: Particularly useful for patients with predominantly depressive polarity, bipolar II disorder, or treatment-resistant cases [^114oQq4h] [^111D114p].

---

Lamotrigine is **effective for preventing depressive episodes in bipolar disorder** [^113MfWrV] and may be considered for acute bipolar depression as an adjunct [^111UiB9T]. Evidence in unipolar depression is limited; it may be used off-label for treatment-resistant cases, but data are inconclusive [^111dJkGy].

### Rash in multicenter trials of lamotrigine in mood disorders: clinical relevance and management [^111GTYHH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The rate of lamotrigine-associated rash in patients with mood disorders has not been well characterized. The objective of this report was to determine rash rates in clinical trials of lamotrigine in DSM-IV unipolar depression or bipolar disorder.

Method

A retrospective analysis was conducted of rates of lamotrigine-related rash in 12 multicenter studies, including 1 open study, 7 randomized controlled acute trials, and 4 randomized controlled maintenance trials from 1996 to 2001.

Results

A total of 1955 patients were treated with lamotrigine in open-label settings (open-label phases preceding or following randomization and 1 stand-alone open-label study); 1198 patients received lamotrigine in controlled settings, and 1056 patients received placebo. In controlled settings, rates of benign rash were 8.3% and 6.4% in lamotrigine- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Rates of serious rash were 0% with lamotrigine, 0.1% (N = 1) with placebo, and 0% with comparators. In the open-label setting, the overall rate of rash for lamotrigine was 13.1% (N = 257) and of serious rash, 0.1% (N = 2). One mild case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome not requiring hospitalization occurred in a patient treated with lamotrigine. There were no cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis in any setting.

Conclusion

Serious drug eruptions associated with lamotrigine were rare. Although rash is a potentially life-threatening reaction, the risk of serious rash due to lamotrigine should be weighed against more common risks associated with untreated or undertreated bipolar depression.

### Lamotrigine augmentation in treatment-resistant unipolar depression: a comprehensive meta-analysis of efficacy and safety [^111dJkGy]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Augmentation strategies are commonly applied when an individual is unresponsive to antidepressant monotherapy. Lamotrigine is currently considered at best only as second line augmentation for treatment-resistant unipolar depression while its clinical efficacy and safety profiles remain inconclusive. We intended to assess the therapeutic effects and safety profiles of lamotrigine augmentation in patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression by conducting a meta-analysis.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, EBSCO, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, Wanfang and Ariniti databases were searched. Coprimary outcomes, including changes in severity of depression and response rate, were measured in this study. Secondary outcomes were defined as the safety profile of the intervention, including reported discontinuation rate and adverse events.

Results

Eight double-blinded randomized controlled trials with 677 patients overall were included. Significant improvements in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores and response rates were shown in lamotrigine augmentation groups compared with control groups, of which the pooled result of six Chinese studies showed positive effects of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression improvement while the pooled result of two non-Chinese studies was statistically non-significant. Patients with more severe illness and longer duration of illness were more effectively treated with lamotrigine augmentation. The magnitude of depression improvement after lamotrigine augmentation was higher in patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors than those treated with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Lamotrigine augmentation is well-tolerated in terms of all-cause discontinuation rate and adverse events.

Conclusions

Lamotrigine augmentation may serve as a possible choice for patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression and further trials are warranted to clarify the optimal dosage of lamotrigine augmentation together with the treatment duration and safety over time.

### Newer anticonvulsants in the treatment of bipolar disorder [^114eouTS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine have efficacy in treating acute mania, but their efficacy in treating acute bipolar depression and preventing mood episodes remains uncertain. Despite this, and given their utility and widespread use, both are widely accepted as standard treatments for bipolar disorder. All the newer anticonvulsants that have become available during the last decade have been or are being assessed to determine their efficacy in the treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. Among the newer anticonvulsants, some appear to have efficacy in treating core bipolar symptoms, while others have efficacy in treating psychiatric comorbidity such as substance abuse or an anxiety disorder. Lamotrigine is the most widely studied and is effective in treating and preventing bipolar depression, and it is the only anticonvulsant approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. Other newer anticonvulsants, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, and zonisamide offer promise, but further studies are required before they can be recommended for routine use to treat bipolar disorder. Gabapentin and topiramate do not appear to have efficacy in treating acute mania, but their utility in bipolar depression and prevention of mood episodes has not been studied in double-blind trials. Pregabalin has utility in treating generalized anxiety disorder, but it has not been studied in bipolar disorder. Given the success of lamotrigine in treating bipolar disorder, further double-blind controlled trials of the newer anticonvulsants in treating bipolar disorder are warranted. This article summarizes current evidence from trials of anticonvulsants in bipolar disorder and makes recommendations for their clinical use.

### Lamotrigine (Lamictal) [^117V8ZJK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Bipolar Disorder

The goal of maintenance treatment with LAMICTAL is to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Indications and Usage (1.2)].

Patients taking LAMICTAL for more than 16 weeks should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

Adults

The target dose of LAMICTAL is 200 mg/day (100 mg/day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400 mg/day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine). In the clinical trials, doses up to 400 mg/day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400 mg/day compared with 200 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Accordingly, doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended.

Treatment with LAMICTAL is introduced, based on concurrent medications, according to the regimen outlined in Table 5. If other psychotropic medications are withdrawn following stabilization, the dose of LAMICTAL should be adjusted. In patients discontinuing valproate, the dose of LAMICTAL should be doubled over a 2-week period in equal weekly increments (see Table 6). In patients discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, the dose of LAMICTAL should remain constant for the first week and then should be decreased by half over a 2-week period in equal weekly decrements (see Table 6). The dose of LAMICTAL may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated.

If other drugs are subsequently introduced, the dose of LAMICTAL may need to be adjusted. In particular, the introduction of valproate requires reduction in the dose of LAMICTAL [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations of LAMICTAL should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning].

### Lamotrigine in the acute treatment of bipolar depression: results of five double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [^1166YUEm]. Bipolar Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The efficacy of lamotrigine as maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), particularly for delaying depressive episodes, is well established, but its efficacy in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is less clear. This paper reports the results of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of lamotrigine monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

Methods

Adult subjects with bipolar I or II disorder experiencing a depressive episode were randomized to placebo or lamotrigine monotherapy (after titration, at a fixed dose of 50 mg or 200 mg daily in Study 1; a flexible dose of 100–400 mg daily in Study 2; or a fixed dose of 200 mg daily in Studies 3, 4 and 5) for 7–10 weeks.

Results

Lamotrigine did not differ significantly from placebo on primary efficacy endpoints [17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in Studies 1 and 2; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in Studies 3, 4 and 5]. In Study 1, lamotrigine significantly separated from placebo on some secondary measures of efficacy, including the MADRS, the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I), but seldom differed on secondary efficacy endpoints for the other studies.

Conclusions

Lamotrigine monotherapy did not demonstrate efficacy in the acute treatment of bipolar depression in four out of five placebo-controlled clinical studies. Lamotrigine was well tolerated in the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

### An observational nationwide register based cohort study on lamotrigine versus lithium in bipolar disorder [^116FReB2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

It is not clear whether the effectiveness of lamotrigine versus lithium differs for patients with bipolar disorder treated in clinical practice. We compared rates of switch to, or add on of, another psychotropic, and rates of psychiatric hospitalization for patients treated with lamotrigine or lithium in clinical practice. Using linkage of nationwide Danish registers we identified 730 patients who received lamotrigine and 3518 patients received lithium subsequent to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in psychiatric hospital settings during a period from 1995 to 2006. The overall rate of switch to or add on of another psychotropic (the opposite drug of interest (lithium or lamotrigine), antidepressants, antipsychotics or other anticonvulsants than lamotrigine) was increased for lamotrigine compared with lithium (HR = 2.60, 95% CI: 2.23–3.04), regardless of whether the index episode was depressive, manic, mixed or remission. In addition, the overall rate of psychiatric hospitalization was increased for lamotrigine compared with lithium (HR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.28–1.65), as were the rates for patients with a depressive (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01–1.70) and patients with a manic (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.31–2.09) index episode. Rates did not differ significantly between the drugs for patients with a mixed index episode and for patients in remission. It is concluded that in daily clinical practice, treatment with lithium is in general superior to treatment with lamotrigine.

### Bipolar disorders and the effectiveness of novel anticonvulsants [^113rZrt3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The discovery that valproic acid is helpful in the management of patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder led to an explosion of research culminating in the third-generation anticonvulsants. Refractory depressive phases are frequent in bipolar disorders. No studies to date have shown that gabapentin is effective in bipolar mania or hypomania. Lamotrigine may have a role in treating bipolar depressive episodes, but it is not a particularly effective antimanic agent. Topiramate has shown encouraging results in both depressed and manic bipolar patients, and it may also promote weight loss. The new anticonvulsants are promising agents for the treatment of bipolar disorders, but they are heterogeneous with regard to their efficacy, target symptoms, and adverse event profiles.

### Lamotrigine (Lamictal) [^111PvFB2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Antiepileptic drugs, including LAMICTAL, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^117QdScN]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — Recommendation 21 on lamotrigine for bipolar disorder states: "We suggest against lamotrigine as monotherapy for the prevention of recurrence of mania" and is rated "(Weak against | Reviewed, New-added)". The guideline notes "Evidence does not support the use of lamotrigine to prevent recurrence of mania", although "the evidence does support the use of lamotrigine to prevent bipolar depressive episodes". Adverse effects are described as generally mild with "no difference from placebo in discontinuation because of side effects", but "rare, but serious" events including "potentially fatal SJS/TEN" are reported; "milder rashes occur in 10% of individuals" and other symptoms "blurred vision, ataxia, headaches, and nausea might occur", leading the Work Group to conclude "the harms exceed the benefits for this indication". The guideline highlights that "If an individual is on valproate, the drug might raise lamotrigine levels and can increase the risk of rashes, including dangerous ones", and that lamotrigine "requires a slow titration… that usually takes at least six weeks", with "Frequent follow-up with the prescribing provider" needed; the recommendation is "categorized as Reviewed, New-added".

### Lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder… [^112F6Pq9]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Compared with placebo, lamotrigine reduces the recurrence of manic symptoms at one year and the need for additional psychotropics necessitated by worsening clinical symptoms. The adverse effect profile of lamotrigine is similar to that of placebo. 1 Compared with lithium, lamotrigine is similarly effective at treating recurrences of depressive episodes and any episode requiring additional psychotropic therapy, but it is less effective at reducing the recurrence of manic episodes at one year. Patients using lamotrigine have fewer reported adverse effects and withdrawals from treatment compared with those using lithium.

1.

Compared with placebo, lamotrigine was more effective at reducing the recurrence of manic episodes at one year. Lamotrigine was also more effective than placebo at reducing clinical symptoms requiring additional psychotropic medication. No differences were noted in the recurrence of depressive episodes at one year or in short-term or long-term adverse effects in patients treated with lamotrigine compared with placebo. Fewer study participants receiving lamotrigine stopped taking their medication after six to 12 months of treatment. Among the effectiveness outcomes studied, lamotrigine and lithium had a similar recurrence of depressive symptoms, recurrence of clinical symptoms requiring additional psychotropic therapy, recurrence of manic symptoms using the Young Mania Rating Scale, and active suicidal behavior.

However, lamotrigine was less effective in reducing the recurrence of manic episodes at one year among studies using an assessor's judgment instead of a rating scale. 4 Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. It is not effective for treating acute bipolar mania or hypomania. Given the reduced adverse effect profile compared with lithium, lamotrigine may be an appropriate monotherapy during the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder.

5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

Antiepileptics, including SUBVENITE, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo.

There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

### A pooled analysis of 2 placebo-controlled 18-month trials of lamotrigine and lithium maintenance in bipolar I disorder [^111zXUpk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Two clinical trials, prospectively designed for combined analysis, compared placebo, lithium, and lamotrigine for treatment of bipolar I disorder in recently depressed or manic patients.

Method

1315 bipolar I patients (DSM-IV) enrolled in the initial open-label phase, and 638 were stabilized and randomly assigned to 18 months of double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine (N = 280; 50–400 mg/day fixed dose or 100–400 mg/day flexible dose), lithium (N = 167; serum level of 0.8–1.1 mEq/L), or placebo (N = 191). The primary endpoint was time from randomization to intervention for a mood episode. Data were gathered from August 1997 to August 2001.

Results

Lamotrigine and lithium were superior to placebo for time to intervention for any mood episode (median survival: placebo, 86 days [95% CI = 58 to 121]; lithium, 184 days [95% CI = 119 to not calculable]; lamotrigine, 197 days [95% CI = 144 to 388]). Lamotrigine was superior to placebo for time to intervention for depression (median survival: placebo, 270 days [95% CI = 138 to not calculable]; lithium, median not calculable; lamotrigine, median not calculable). Lithium and lamotrigine were superior to placebo for time to intervention for mania (median survival not calculable for any group). Results of additional analyses adjusted for index mood were similar; however, only lithium was superior to placebo for intervention for mania. There was no evidence that either active treatment caused affective switch. Adverse event analysis indicated more diarrhea (19% vs. 7%, p < .05) and tremor (15% vs. 4%, p < .05) in lithium-treated patients compared with lamotrigine-treated patients.

Conclusions

Lamotrigine and lithium stabilized mood by delaying the time to treatment for a mood episode. Lamotrigine was effective against depression and mania, with more robust activity against depression. Lithium was effective against mania.

### Bipolar depression: criteria for treatment selection, definition of refractoriness, and treatment options [^116hJeP9]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This paper reviews controlled studies of bipolar depression, outlines criteria for choosing treatment, defines refractoriness in bipolar depression, and provides options for treatment of refractory bipolar depression.

Methods

Controlled studies that examined the efficacy of treatments for acute and long-term treatment of bipolar depression were located through electronic searches of several databases and by manual crosssearch of references and proceedings of international meetings.

Results

Lithium comes close to fulfilling the proposed criteria for first-line treatment for bipolar depression, and those not responding to lithium should be considered to have refractory bipolar depression. Options for such patients include addition of lamotrigine or a second mood stabilizer, or a newer-generation antidepressant such as a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor or bupropion, or the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine.

Conclusions

Although there is a paucity of research in the treatment of refractory bipolar depression, available data could be used for providing rational treatment options for such patients. However, further studies are urgently needed to determine which options are most appropriate for which type of patients.

### Treatment-resistant bipolar depression: a STEP-BD equipoise randomized effectiveness trial of antidepressant augmentation with lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone [^111tojQh]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinicians have few evidence-based options for the management of treatment-resistant bipolar depression. This study represents the first randomized trial of competing options for treatment-resistant bipolar depression and assesses the effectiveness and safety of antidepressant augmentation with lamotrigine, inositol, and risperidone.

Method

Participants (N = 66) were patients with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder enrolled in the NIMH Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD). All patients were in a current major depressive episode that was nonresponsive to a combination of adequate doses of established mood stabilizers plus at least one antidepressant. Patients were randomly assigned to open-label adjunctive treatment with lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone for up to 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the rate of recovery, defined as no more than two symptoms meeting DSM-IV threshold criteria for a mood episode and no significant symptoms present for 8 weeks.

Results

No significant between-group differences were seen when any pair of treatments were compared on the primary outcome measure. However, the recovery rate with lamotrigine was 23.8%, whereas the recovery rates with inositol and risperidone were 17.4% and 4.6%, respectively. Patients receiving lamotrigine had lower depression ratings and Clinical Global Impression severity scores as well as greater Global Assessment of Functioning scores compared with those receiving inositol and risperidone.

Conclusions

No differences were found in primary pairwise comparison analyses of open-label augmentation with lamotrigine, inositol, or risperidone. Post hoc secondary analyses suggest that lamotrigine may be superior to inositol and risperidone in improving treatment-resistant bipolar depression.

### New treatment guidelines for acute bipolar depression: a systematic review [^112iy3Ff]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar depression poses a great burden on patients and their families due to its duration, associated functional impairment, and limited treatment options. Given the complexity of the disorder and the advances in treatment, a number of clinical guidelines, consensus statements and expert opinions were developed with the aim to standardize treatment and provide clinicians with treatment algorithms for every-day clinical practice. Unfortunately, they often led to conflicting conclusions and recommendations due to limitations of the available literature. As findings emerge from research literature, guidelines quickly become obsolete and need to be updated or revised. Many guidelines have been updated in the last 5 years, after the last review of bipolar disorder (BD) treatment guidelines.

Objective

The purpose of this work is to systematically review guidelines, consensus meetings and treatment algorithms on the acute treatment of bipolar depression updated or published since 2005, to critically underline common and critical points, highlight limits and strengths, and provide a starting point for future research

Materials and Methods

The MEDLINe/PubMed/Index Medicus, PsycINFO/PsycLIT, Excerpta Medica/EMBASE, databases were searched using "depression", "bipolar", "manic-depression", "manic-depressive" and "treatment guidelines" as key words

Results

The search returned 204 articles. Amongst them, there were 28 papers concerning structured treatment algorithms and/or guidelines suggested by official panels. After excluding those guidelines that were not performed by scientific societies or international groups and those published before 2005, the final selection yielded 7 papers When looking into guidelines content, the results indicate a trend to the gradual acceptance of the use of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine as monotherapy as first-line treatment. Antidepressant monotherapy is discouraged in most of them, although some support the use of antidepressants in combination with antimanic agents for a limited period of time. Lamotrigine has become a highly controversial option.

Conclusion

The management of bipolar depression is complex and should be differentiated from management of unipolar depression. Guidelines may be useful instruments for helping clinicians to choose and plan bipolar depression treatment by integrating the more updated scientific knowledge with every-day clinical practice and patient-specific factors; however, a further effort is needed in order to improve guidelines implementation in clinical practice. The latest updates on treatment guidelines for bipolar depression give priority to novel treatment approaches, such as quetiapine, over more traditional ones, such as lithium or antidepressants. Lamotrigine is a controversial option.

### Lamotrigine chewable dispersible (lamotrigine) [^111rUvwD]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.4. Bipolar Disorder

The goal of maintenance treatment with lamotrigine is to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Patients taking lamotrigine for more than 16 weeks should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

Adults

The target dose of lamotrigine is 200 mg/day (100 mg/day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400 mg/day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine). In the clinical trials, doses up to 400 mg/day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400 mg/day compared with 200 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Accordingly, doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended.

Treatment with lamotrigine is introduced, based on concurrent medications, according to the regimen outlined in Table 5. If other psychotropic medications are withdrawn following stabilization, the dose of lamotrigine should be adjusted. In patients discontinuing valproate, the dose of lamotrigine should be doubled over a 2-week period in equal weekly increments (see Table 6). In patients discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, the dose of lamotrigine should remain constant for the first week and then should be decreased by half over a 2-week period in equal weekly decrements (see Table 6). The dose of lamotrigine may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated.

### Treatment of bipolar depression: an update [^112iUf11]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

This article attempts to summarize the current status of our knowledge and practice in the acute treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar depression. For prophylactic treatment, our knowledge about lithium firmly supports its usefulness against bipolar depression and its specific effectiveness for suicidal prevention. Valproic acid and carbamazepine could be effective, too, while lamotrigine which seems to be preferably effective against depression but not mania. The FDA has approved the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and quetiapine monotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression. The usefulness of antidepressants in bipolar depression is controversial both for acute and prophylactic treatment; guidelines suggest their cautious use and always in combination with an antimanic and mood stabilizer agent, because in some patients they may induce switching to mania or hypomania, mixed episodes and rapid cycling. Data on psychosocial intervention are restricted to the maintenance phase. Electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation are additional options for refractory patients. Bipolar depression seems to be a more difficult condition to treat than mania. Most patients need complex combination treatment although the published evidence on this type of treatment is limited.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^1136YV3R]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians are advised to appropriately dose these medications for an adequate period of time before concluding lack of efficacy. Clinical trials have shown that there is no difference in efficacy between quetiapine 300mg and 600mg daily doses. Lower doses of quetiapine have not been studied in clinical trials for bipolar depression. Therefore, clinicians are advised to consider a target dose of 300 mg/day for quetiapine. For lithium, we suggest that serum lithium levels should be maintained between 0.8 and 1.2 meq/L, while for lamotrigine, the target should be a minimum of 200 mg/day.

### Clinical factors leading to lamotrigine prescription in bipolar outpatients: subanalysis of the SIN-DEPRES study [^111D114p]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of lamotrigine is a point of discrepancy among the diverse guidelines published on the management of bipolar disorder (BD). Evidence supporting the long-term efficacy is reasonably robust. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of lamotrigine in acute treatment is vigorously debated and it is unclear how this drug is used in routine clinical practice. This subanalysis of the SIN-DEPRES study was designed to understand the clinical profile of bipolar patients receiving lamotrigine.

Methods

In this prospective national multicenter study, 652 patients with clinically stable bipolar I and II disorder were recruited. Clinical assessments included sociodemographic and clinical data, the Modified Clinical Global Impression scale for BD (CGI-BP-M), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and prescriptions of psychotropic medications and their doses.

Results

By means of a logistic regression model, an association between receiving treatment with lamotrigine and the following clinical variables was found: number of past depressive episodes (O.R. = 2.875, 95% CI: 1.203–6.869, p = 0.018), depressive polarity of the most recent episode (O.R. = 1.945, 95% CI: 1.267–2.985, p = 0.002), severity in CGI-BD-M depression (O.R. = 1.850, 95% CI: 1.215–2.817, p = 0.004), bipolar II disorder diagnosis (O.R. = 1.635, 95% CI: 1.078–2.482, p = 0.021) and number of episodes per year (O.R. = 1.310, 95% CI: 1.069–1.605, p = 0.009).

Limitations

Subanalysis of the SIN-DEPRES study with a cross-sectional design.

Conclusions

The use of lamotrigine in clinical practice is in accordance with most of the guidelines, which support its use in patients with depressive predominant polarity and bipolar II disorder.

### Treatment options for acute depression in bipolar disorder [^116MYpkZ]. Bipolar Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The burden of depression represents the most debilitating dimension for the majority of patients with bipolar disorder and dominates the long-term course of the illness. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the evidence base of the available treatment options for bipolar depression within two frequent clinical scenarios.

Methods

The evidence is largely based on a systematic literature search and appraisal that was part of the development of the German Guideline for Bipolar Disorders. All relevant randomized controlled trials were critically evaluated.

Results

Overall, the number of suitably controlled studies for the treatment of bipolar depression is relatively low. There are two common scenarios. Scenario A, if a patient with bipolar depression is currently not being treated with a mood-stabilizing agent (de novo depression, first or subsequent episode), then quetiapine or olanzapine are options, or alternatively, carbamazepine and lamotrigine can be considered. Antidepressants are an option for short-term use, but whether they are best administered as monotherapy or in combination with mood-stabilizing agents is still controversial. In practice, most clinicians use antidepressants in combination with an antimanic agent. Scenario B, if a patient is already being treated optimally with a mood-stabilizing agent (good adherence and appropriate dose) such as lithium, lamotrigine is an option. There is no evidence for additional benefit from antidepressants where a patient is already being treated with a mood stabilizer; however, in practice an antidepressant is often trialled. Efficient psychotherapy is an important part of the treatment regimen and should span all phases of the illness.

Conclusions

Treatment decisions in bipolar depression involve a range of different pharmacological and non-pharmacological options. Monitoring potential unwanted effects and the appropriateness of treatment can help to effectively balance benefits and risks in individual situations. However, the quality of the assessment and reporting of risks in clinical trials need to be improved to better inform treatment decisions.

### The efficacy of lamotrigine in bipolar disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116yoRV]. Bipolar Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide up-to-date clinical guidance on the efficacy of lamotrigine in bipolar disorder (BD).

Methods

Eligible studies were identified during a systematic literature search according to PRISMA-guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that quantitatively assessed lamotrigine's efficacy in BD. We divided the included studies into three groups: 1. acute treatment of depression, 2. acute treatment of mania and hypomania, and 3. maintenance treatment. Analyses were stratified by control group (placebo vs active comparator) and treatment strategy (monotherapy vs add-on treatment).

Results

We included 20 RCTs (n = 1166 lamotrigine users) and 20 cohort studies (n = 11,141 lamotrigine users). Twenty-four of these studies were included in meta-analyses. During depressive episodes, greater decreases in depressive symptomatology were associated with initiation of lamotrigine as add-on treatment than with placebo (SMD -0.30 [95% CI = -0.51, -0.10], df = 3, p = 0.004). Decreases in depressive symptomatology did not differ significantly between lamotrigine and the active comparator (SMD -0.28 [95% CI = -1.06, 0.50], df = 3, p = 0.488). As a maintenance treatment, lamotrigine was associated with a significantly lower relapse/recurrence rate than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.84 [95% CI = 0.71, 0.99], df = 2, p = 0.037). Relapse/recurrence rates did not differ significantly between lamotrigine and lithium (RR 1.06 [95% CI = 0.89, 1.25], df = 2, p = 0.513). A qualitative assessment of high-quality register-based studies found that lamotrigine was associated with lower hospital admission rates than other commonly used treatment regimes.

Conclusions

There is substantial evidence for the efficacy of lamotrigine in BD, specifically as add-on treatment during acute depressive episodes and as maintenance treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence.

### The current understanding of lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer [^112cNUQT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether lamotrigine has a unique role in the treatment of bipolar disorder, we evaluated the results of recent clinical trials and molecular and cell biological studies on lamotrigine.

Data Sources

Using keywords such as bipolar disorder, lamotrigine, clinical trial, outcomes studies, and mechanisms, we conducted a search for English-language articles on MEDLINE and Index Medicus and also on abstracts presented in recent research conferences.

Data Synthesis

Several studies have strongly suggested that lamotrigine is effective for the acute treatment of bipolar depression as well as for long-term maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a concern, but the incidence of this side effect may not be as high as previously believed, if dosing is slowly titrated. The action mechanisms underlying the mood-stabilizing effects of lamotrigine are unknown at present but recent studies have produced interesting leads. Lamotrigine modulates various ion channels, altering neuronal excitability. The use-dependent inhibition of neuronal firing by lamotrigine is potentially important because it could result in attenuating supranormal neuronal activities that are possibly associated with bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine inhibits the release of glutamate, similarly to lithium, and its possible association with mood-stabilizing or antidepressant effects needs to be further examined. Unlike lithium or valproic acid, however, lamotrigine does not down-regulate the expression of protein kinase C or MARCKS, suggesting that lamotrigine employs different intracellular mechanisms for long-term changes in neuro-biology from those of lithium or valproic acid.

Conclusion

The efficacy of lamotrigine for bipolar depression may provide us with new options in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Examining the effects of lamotrigine on various molecular mechanisms in correlation with its unique efficacy on bipolar depression may enhance our understanding of action mechanisms of the mood stabilizers.

### A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of augmentation with lamotrigine or placebo in patients concomitantly treated with fluoxetine for resistant major depressive episodes [^117V1Ljv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence of the antidepressant efficacy of lamotrigine is increasing, although there are no placebo-controlled trials of lamotrigine augmentation in depression. The aim of this study was to assess if augmentation with lamotrigine was superior to placebo in patients who were receiving fluoxetine for resistant major depressive episodes.

Method

Twenty-three patients who had experienced at least 1 major depressive episode that was resistant to at least 1 prior trial of antidepressant therapy were selected. These patients were treated with fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, and concomitantly randomly assigned to receive either lamotrigine (N = 13) or placebo (N = 10) for 6 weeks. The dose of lamotrigine was titrated upward from 25 mg/day to 100 mg/day. Patients suffering from bipolar II disorder (N = 8) or from major depressive disorder (N = 15) (DSM-IV criteria) were enrolled, resulting in heterogeneity of the sample. The primary outcome measure was Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score. Data were collected from 2000–2001.

Results

Lamotrigine was statistically superior to placebo on the Clinical Global Impressions scale at endpoint, both in absolute terms (mean ± SD Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scores: lamotrigine, 2.15 ± 1.28; placebo, 3.40 ± 1.17; p = .0308) and using a responder analysis, with response defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of 2 or less (lamotrigine, 84.62% [N = 11]; placebo, 30.00% [N = 3]; p = .013). The effect of lamotrigine on Clinical Global Impressions scale scores was seen in both major depressive disorder and bipolar II disorder. Lamotrigine, however, failed to separate statistically from placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. This failure to differentiate on a primary outcome measure is essentially a negative study result. This result is most likely an artifact of the small sample size used and the resultant limited power of the study.

Conclusion

The results of this trial add to the literature suggesting potential efficacy of the antidepressant profile of lamotrigine. In addition, this study points to a possible role of lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in depression.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^111Fg6wz]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy — prevention of recurrence of bipolar depression: We recommend lamotrigine for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes. We suggest lithium or quetiapine as monotherapy for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes. If lithium or quetiapine is not selected based on patient preference and characteristics, we suggest olanzapine as monotherapy for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes. We suggest olanzapine, lurasidone, or quetiapine in combination with lithium or valproate for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against other first-generation antipsychotics, other second-generation antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants (including valproate) as monotherapies for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against other first-generation antipsychotics, other second-generation antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in combination with a mood stabilizer for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes.

### A placebo-controlled 18-month trial of lamotrigine and lithium maintenance treatment in recently depressed patients with bipolar I disorder [^116vvfka]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The anticonvulsant lamotrigine was previously shown to be effective for bipolar depression. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine and lithium compared with placebo for the prevention of mood episodes in bipolar disorder.

Method

During an 8- to 16-week open-label phase, lamotrigine (titrated to 200 mg/day) was added to current therapy for currently or recently depressed DSM-IV-defined bipolar I outpatients (N = 966) and concomitant drugs were gradually withdrawn. Patients stabilized on open-label treatment (N = 463) were then randomly assigned to lamotrigine (50, 200, or 400 mg/day; N = 221), lithium (0.8–1.1 mEq/L; N = 121), or placebo (N = 121) monotherapy for up to 18 months. The primary outcome measure was time from randomization to intervention (addition of pharmacotherapy) for any mood episode (depressive, manic, hypomanic, or mixed). Data were gathered from September 1997 to August 2001.

Results

Time to intervention for any mood episode was statistically superior (p = .029) for both lamotrigine and lithium compared with placebo-median survival times were 200, 170, and 93 days, respectively. Intervention for depression was more frequent than for mania by a factor of nearly 3:1. Lamotrigine was statistically superior to placebo at prolonging the time to intervention for a depressive episode (p = .047). The proportions of patients who were intervention-free for depression at 1 year were lamotrigine 57%, lithium 46%, and placebo 45%. Lithium was statistically superior to placebo at prolonging the time to intervention for a manic or hypomanic episode (p = .026). The proportions of patients who were intervention-free for mania at 1 year were lamotrigine 77%, lithium 86%, and placebo 72%. Headache was the most frequent adverse event for all 3 treatment groups.

Conclusion

Lamotrigine and lithium were superior to placebo for the prevention of mood episodes in bipolar I patients, with lamotrigine predominantly effective against depression and lithium predominantly effective against mania.

### Methodological differences between pharmacological treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder: what to do for the clinicians? [^115TLopZ]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Numerous guidelines for bipolar disorder have been published. The aim of this article is to underline the main differences between consensus-based guidelines (CBG) and evidence-based guidelines (EBG) currently available for the management of bipolar disorder.

Methods

A literature search for guidelines published since 2006 was performed. A qualitative analysis was then conducted to compare the methodologies and the guidelines contents.

Results

Comparison between CBG and EBG found more similarities than differences. However, discordances were found in the first-line choice of treatment (monotherapy or combination, use of lamotrigine or lithium in bipolar depression), time to reassessment and duration of maintenance treatment, introduction as from the acute phase a regimen compatible with long-term use and pharmacotherapy during pregnancy.

Conclusions

The choice of policy, whatever the methodology used, is up to the authors and can, therefore, depend on their interpretation of the available scientific evidence. Combining both methodologies (CBG and EBG) enables us to meet the complete definition of evidence-based medicine.

### Acute neural effects of the mood stabiliser lamotrigine on emotional processing in healthy volunteers: a randomised control trial [^116e38H8]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is among the top causes of worldwide disability, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. It usually presents during adolescence or early adulthood and affects 3% of the world's population. First line treatment for BD includes monotherapy or adjunctive treatment with mood stabilisers such as lithium and various anticonvulsants and antipsychotics. However, treating BD is often complicated by initial misdiagnosis as unipolar depression and subsequent treatment with conventional antidepressants, which carry a high risk of mood destabilisation in this group. The mood stabiliser lamotrigine is however generally successful in BD therapy at treating the depressive phase without inducing mania. Initially synthesized in the 1980s as an antiepileptic drug, lamotrigine is also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the long-term maintenance treatment of BD.

Despite its widespread use, lamotrigine's mode of action as a mood stabiliser has yet to be fully elucidated. One hypothesis is that lamotrigine exerts its mood stabilising effects in a way that is similar to its antiepileptic properties, by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels and reducing downstream glutamate release. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from granule cells in the dentate gyrus have shown that lamotrigine inhibits glutamate release in preclinical models. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have also shown that lamotrigine pre-treatment attenuates the neural effects of the glutamate release promoter ketamine. Further, studies using the forced swim test animal model of depression have shown that pre-treatment with the voltage-gated sodium channel opener veratrine reverses lamotrigine's antidepressant effects

### FDA warns of serious immune system reaction with seizure and… [^113qGDgN]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

04–25–2018] The Food and Drug Administration is warning that the medicine lamotrigine for seizures and bipolar disorder can cause a rare but very serious reaction that excessively activates the body's infection-fighting immune system. This can cause severe inflammation throughout the body and lead to hospitalization and death, especially if the reaction is not diagnosed and treated quickly. As a result, we are requiring a new warning about this risk be added to the prescribing information in the lamotrigine drug labels. *. Lamotrigine is used alone or with other medicines to treat seizures in patients two years and older. It may also be used as maintenance treatment in patients with bipolar disorder to help delay the occurrence of mood episodes such as depression, mania, or hypomania. Stopping lamotrigine without first talking to a prescriber can lead to uncontrolled seizures, or new or worsening mental health problems.

Lamotrigine has been approved and on the market for 24 years, and is available under the brand name Lamictal and as generics. ± The cases were reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System.
- Lamotrigine is used alone or with other medicines to treat seizures in patients two years and older. Use of lamotrigine as a single drug to treat seizures is approved only in patients 16 and older.
- Lamotrigine is also used as maintenance treatment in adults with bipolar disorder to help delay the occurrence of mood episodes such as depression, mania, or hypomania.
- The medicine lamotrigine, prescribed for seizures and bipolar disorder, has been associated with a rare but very serious reaction in which the body's immune system is excessively activated, called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This can cause severe inflammation, or swelling, throughout the body and lead to hospitalization or death, especially if treatment is delayed.

All cases were reported to have serious outcomes. All eight reported hospitalization, three reported other serious important medical events, two reported the outcome as being life-threatening, and one reported death. All cases had a plausible temporal relationship with lamotrigine, occurring within 24 days of starting lamotrigine treatment. Doses ranged from 25 mg every other day to 250 mg once daily in the six cases that reported this information.

### Separate and concomitant use of lamotrigine, lithium, and divalproex in bipolar disorders [^111XAXvz]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Expert consensus emphasizes the need for better recognition and accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Current research on lithium, divalproex, and lamotrigine provides new insight into the effective management of this illness. Advances in identifying the mechanism of action of mood stabilization has focused on signaling pathways within the cell that are associated with neurotrophic effects. Clinical research has led to confirmatory evidence of the efficacy of lithium in all phases of bipolar disorder, with the greatest effects seen in the treatment and prevention of mania. Compared to divalproex, lithium also has been found to have greater efficacy in the prevention of suicide. Lamotrigine has emerged as a first line treatment for bipolar depression, which is an area of weakness for other mood stabilizers. Oral loading of divalproex leads to rapid stabilization of mania without imposing a greater adverse effect burden than conventional dosing. Because no agent is universally effective in all phases of the illness, combination therapy with two or more agents often is the best option.

### Lamotrigine (Subvenite) [^114VWFDN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Trial 1, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine 50 mg/day (n = 50), lamotrigine 200 mg/day (n = 124), lamotrigine 400 mg/day (n = 47), or placebo (n = 121). Lamotrigine (200- and 400-mg/day treatment groups combined) was superior to placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 1). Separate analyses of the 200- and 400-mg/day dose groups revealed no added benefit from the higher dose.

In Trial 2, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day, n = 59), or placebo (n = 70). Lamotrigine was superior to placebo in delaying time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 2). The mean dose of lamotrigine was about 211 mg/day.

Although these trials were not designed to separately evaluate time to the occurrence of depression or mania, a combined analysis for the 2 trials revealed a statistically significant benefit for lamotrigine over placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of both depression and mania, although the finding was more robust for depression.

### Randomized, double-blind pilot trial comparing lamotrigine versus citalopram for the treatment of bipolar depression [^114wGZDj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists regarding the best approach for treating bipolar depression among patients already receiving a first-line mood stabilizer. The aim of this pilot study was to compare adding a second mood stabilizer or an antidepressant at this treatment decision point.

Methods

Twelve-week, randomized, double-blind pilot trial comparing the addition of lamotrigine or citalopram for bipolar depressed patients on mood stabilizer medication. Change in depressive symptoms and risk of switch were examined.

Results

Twenty subjects were randomized. Each treatment group experienced a significant mean reduction in total MADRS scores (citalopram Delta - 14.2, p = 0.002; lamotrigine Delta - 13.3, p = 0.001), and there was no significant difference between treatment groups (p = 0.78). Total response rates increased from 31.6% at week 6 to 52.6% at week 12. One out of ten patients in each group experienced a switch to hypomania.

Limitations

Small sample size. Lack of a placebo arm.

Conclusions

Results of this small trial suggest that both lamotrigine and citalopram appear to be reasonable choices as add-on acute treatment for bipolar depression, with response rates continuing to rise considerably past 6 weeks of treatment.

### Lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [^113MfWrV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental disorder with repetitive mania/hypomania as well as depressive episodes, which eventually results in marked impairment in overall functioning and health-related quality of life. A worldwide prevalence rate of 2.4% has been reported. The risk of suicide is higher in people with bipolar disorder than those with other mental disorders. Therefore, effective management of bipolar disorder in the maintenance period is warranted to minimize the risk of relapse or recurrence. Although lithium has been the standard treatment of bipolar disorder for many years, it is associated with adverse effects and teratogenicity. Lamotrigine is approved to be expected for prevention of recurrence for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. In addition, lamotrigine is as effective as lithium. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to confirm the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialized Register (CCMDCTR) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to 21 May 2021. We also searched international trial registries and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials enrolling adults with bipolar disorder who were treated with lamotrigine, placebo or lithium.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviews authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardized form. Data extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in the term of efficacy and tolerability. Study information were then entered into RevMan web.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with a total of 2314 participants in this review; 1146 were randomized to lamotrigine, 869 were randomized to placebo and, 299 to lithium. We rated all studies as having an unclear risk of bias in at least one domain of Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias, with the most commonly observed weakness being selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment). We judged five studies to be at a high risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment). These potential biases pose as major threat to the validity of the included studies in this review. Outcomes of efficacy showed a possible advantage of lamotrigine over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for recurrence of manic symptom at one year as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) was 0.67, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87; 3 studies, 663 participants; low-certainty evidence) in favor of lamotrigine. The RR of clinical worsening with the need for additional psychotropic treatment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 4 studies, 756 participants) based on moderate-certainty evidence. The possible benefits of lamotrigine were also seen for the outcome of treatment withdrawal due to any reason at 6–12 months after treatment (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; 4 studies, 700 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Regarding tolerability, our analyses showed that the incidence rates of adverse effects were similar between the lamotrigine group and the placebo group (short-term effect: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.42; 5 studies, 1138 participants; very low-certainty evidence; long-term effect: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 4 studies, 756 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In the comparison between lamotrigine and lithium, efficacy was similar between groups except for recurrence of mania episode at one year. Recurrence of manic symptoms was higher in the lamotrigine group than that of the lithium group (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.44; 3 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Analysis of adverse effects at 6–12 months showed that a lower proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with lamotrigine compared to lithium (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; 4 studies, 691 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low- to moderate-certainty evidence collectively suggests that lamotrigine may be superior to placebo as a treatment modality for bipolar disorder. In comparison to lithium, people with bipolar disorder seem to tolerate lamotrigine better in the long run; however, the demonstrated efficacy in the maintenance of bipolar disorder was similar between the two groups.

First‐line

Quetiapine is the only recommended first‐line treatment for BDII depression (level 1). Pooled analyses of five identically designed trials demonstrated that quetiapine was superior to placebo, and moreover was equally effective for acute depression in BDI and BDII. 243, 437 The latter finding must be reconciled with the fact that quetiapine beat placebo in only three of the five individual trials in patients with BDII, compared to all five in patients with BDI. 253, 290, 438, 439, 440 This is probably because the smaller sample of BDII patients — only about half as many patients with BDII as BDI were enrolled in each of the trials — provided less statistical power for BDII. Finally, open‐label studies also suggest efficacy for adjunctive quetiapine (level 4). 441, 442

Second‐line

Second‐line treatments include lithium, ideally at a serum level of 0.8‐1.2 mEq/L (level 2) (Figure 5), and the antidepressants sertraline (level 2) 426 and venlafaxine (level 2), 443, 444 mainly for patients with pure (non‐mixed) depression (Figure 6). Lamotrigine (level 2) is also recommended as a second‐line agent despite conflicting evidence, with the rationale for this provided in Figure 7. ECT (level 3) 261 can also be considered second‐line and is a good option, particularly for treatment refractory patients and those in need of rapid response.

14.2 Bipolar Disorder

Adults

The effectiveness of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. Trial 1 enrolled patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV and Trial 2 included patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) episode of mania or hypomania as defined by DSM-IV. Both trials included a cohort of patients (30% of 404 subjects in Trial 1 and 28% of 171 patients in Trial 2) with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (4 to 6 episodes per year).

In both trials, patients were titrated to a target dose of 200 mg of lamotrigine as add-on therapy or as monotherapy with gradual withdrawal of any psychotropic medications during an 8- to 16-week open-label period. Overall 81% of 1,305 patients participating in the open-label period were receiving 1 or more other psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics (including olanzapine), valproate, or lithium, during titration of lamotrigine. Patients with a CGI-severity score of 3 or less maintained for at least 4 continuous weeks, including at least the final week on monotherapy with lamotrigine, were randomized to a placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period for up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was TIME (time to intervention for a mood episode or one that was emerging, time to discontinuation for either an adverse event that was judged to be related to bipolar disorder, or for lack of efficacy). The mood episode could be depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed episode.

### Acute neural effects of the mood stabiliser lamotrigine on emotional processing in healthy volunteers: a randomised control trial [^115ega9B]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A single dose of lamotrigine significantly reduced activation in a range of brain areas important for emotional processing, including bilateral amygdala and ACC, in response to both positive and negative emotions. Therefore, lamotrigine has an effect that seems to be valence-independent rather than valence-specific. Together, while also considering the limitations of the current study, this suggests lamotrigine has a broad-acting mechanism of action that is not specific to negative emotional stimuli. This data is important as it suggests a mechanism of action underlying lamotrigine that may be relevant to its mood stabilisation effects. Future research in a larger sample is needed to further clarify the neural mechanisms underlying lamotrigine administration, their relevance for the treatment of bipolar disorder and the translation to unipolar depression.

### Making optimal use of combination pharmacotherapy in bipolar disorder [^111CNznD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Because patients with bipolar disorder often do not respond sufficiently to treatment with 1 mood stabilizer, psychiatrists frequently employ combination therapy and add antipsychotics, antiepileptics, or antidepressants to mood stabilizers. Combination therapy can be more effective than monotherapy in controlling breakthrough or treatment-resistant episodes. For example, atypical antipsychotics have been shown to be effective adjunctive treatments for mania and for patients with psychotic symptoms during a depressive episode, while the combination of a mood stabilizer and lamotrigine or an anti-depressant has been found to control bipolar depression. The American Psychiatric Association guideline for the treatment of bipolar disorder recommends optimizing individual medications before switching to combination therapy. Selecting a combination treatment regimen with an acceptable side effect profile is critically important because patients may discontinue therapy they cannot tolerate. Agents should be added carefully, with continued monitoring of adverse effects. Physicians should give patients only as much medication as needed.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116kji8X]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) previously published treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, along with international commentaries and subsequent updates in 2007, 2009, and 2013. The last two updates were published in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD). These 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Treatment Guidelines represent the significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, including updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacological and psychological treatments. These advances have been translated into clear and easy to use recommendations for first, second, and third- line treatments, with consideration given to levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment-emergent switch risk. New to these guidelines, hierarchical rankings were created for first and second- line treatments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder. Created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness, this hierarchy will further assist clinicians in making evidence-based treatment decisions. Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and cariprazine alone or in combination are recommended as first-line treatments for acute mania. First-line options for bipolar I depression include quetiapine, lurasidone plus lithium or divalproex, lithium, lamotrigine, lurasidone, or adjunctive lamotrigine. While medications that have been shown to be effective for the acute phase should generally be continued for the maintenance phase in bipolar I disorder, there are some exceptions (such as with antidepressants); and available data suggest that lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, asenapine, and aripiprazole monotherapy or combination treatments should be considered first-line for those initiating or switching treatment during the maintenance phase. In addition to addressing issues in bipolar I disorder, these guidelines also provide an overview of, and recommendations for, clinical management of bipolar II disorder, as well as advice on specific populations, such as women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, and older adults. There are also discussions on the impact of specific psychiatric and medical comorbidities such as substance use, anxiety, and metabolic disorders. Finally, an overview of issues related to safety and monitoring is provided. The CANMAT and ISBD groups hope that these guidelines become a valuable tool for practitioners across the globe.

### Comparative economic evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo) in patients with bipolar depression (CEQUEL) [^115WcAHB]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Worldwide, mental and substance abuse disorders accounted for 8.6 million years lived with disability (YLD) in 2010, making it the number one cause of YLDs. 7.4% of it are attributed to bipolar disorders, 1 ranking them 18th for all global years lived with disability and 6th of all mental and behavioural disorders. 2 Bipolar disorders are associated with reduced life expectancy by 11‐20 years 3 and a 20% higher risk of suicide 4 compared to the general population as well as reduced quality of life for both the people affected 5 and their families. 6 These adverse outcomes are especially related to the depressive episodes of bipolar disorders. In addition, bipolar disorders cause high direct healthcare costs and substantial societal costs due to patients' production losses. 7

Quetiapine or lamotrigine is among the few treatment options recommended by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines 8 for treatment of bipolar depression. However, monotherapy is associated with limited efficacy or, in the case of lamotrigine, switch to mania, while combination therapies appear to be associated with better outcomes. 9 Thus, lamotrigine in combination with lithium therapy was found to be effective in the LamLit trial. 10 The CEQUEL trial investigated if quetiapine combined with lamotrigine resulted in greater improvement in depressive symptoms than quetiapine monotherapy. Since there was also some evidence that folic acid, a widely accessible over‐the‐counter drug, is an effective treatment option for patients with unipolar depression, 11 its add‐on effect was also investigated using a factorial design.

In the CEQUEL trial, a lower mean QIDS‐SR16 (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology — self report version) total score for the group receiving lamotrigine vs the placebo group was observed at 12 weeks (−1.73, 95% CI: −3.57 to 0.11, P = 0.066) and at 52 weeks (−2.69, 95% CI: −4.89 to −0.49, P = 0.017), implying that quetiapine‐lamotrigine combination therapy improved depressive symptoms more than quetiapine alone. Accordingly, lamotrigine's use was recommended in the recent BAP (British Association for Psychopharmacology) bipolar guidelines. 12 Addition of folic acid was not found to be superior to placebo but, rather, to reduce the effect of lamotrigine. 9

### Defining treatment-resistant bipolar depression: recommendations from the ISBD task force [^111ENvT2]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

11 Conclusion

Treatment Resistant Bipolar Depression remains a formidable challenge due to its complex nature and the variability in its definitions across studies. Despite the availability of various pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatments, a substantial subset of patients continues to experience persistent depressive episodes that are unresponsive to standard therapies. The proposed definition of TRBD, which emphasizes the failure to achieve a significant and sustained clinical response after two consecutive approved pharmacological treatments, aims to provide clarity and consistency across studies. This new definition is crucial for improving the comparability and conclusiveness of clinical trials and guiding the development of novel, more effective treatment strategies. By adopting this standardized approach, future research can better address the complexities of TRBD, leading to more robust and targeted clinical trials that can ultimately enhance patient outcomes. However, the ISBD TRBD Task Force also acknowledged that while a strict definition may aid in clinical trials, it may be too restrictive in clinical practice, where psychiatrists frequently rely on off‐label treatments to manage TRBD. Also, lumateperone is not widely available in many parts of the world, and this can limit the correct application of the current definition of TRBD, especially for BD‐II. It should be emphasized that, although the proposed definition of TRBD aligns with clinical and regulatory considerations, there is a paucity of empirical evidence demonstrating that failure of two sequential trials of atypical antipsychotics enhances the validity or prognostic utility of the diagnosis. Our recommendations should thus be viewed as a consensus‐based operationalization intended to guide future research and clinical characterization, rather than as a definitively validated construct. Although lithium and lamotrigine are first‐line treatments per CANMAT‐ISBD guidelines, their exclusion from our definition reflects a pragmatic focus on approved acute‐phase treatments with consistent evidence in bipolar depression. The role of these agents — particularly in maintenance and combination strategies — warrants further exploration and may be integrated into future models. One of the Task Force's key objectives moving forward will be to explore how this definition can be adapted to better reflect real‐world clinical challenges, ensuring that it can be effectively applied in everyday practice to optimize patient care and treatment outcomes.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: update 2007 [^115KRsEh]. Bipolar Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

In 2005, the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder. This update reviews new evidence since the previous publication and incorporates recommendations based on the most current evidence for treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the 2005 CANMAT Guidelines. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain mostly unchanged. Lithium, valproate and several atypical antipsychotics continue to be recommended as first-line treatments for acute mania. For the management of bipolar depression, new data support quetiapine monotherapy as a first-line option. Lithium and lamotrigine monotherapy, olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion continue to remain the other first-line options. First-line options in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder continue to be lithium, lamotrigine, valproate and olanzapine. There is recent evidence to support the combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine as a second-line maintenance therapy for bipolar depression. New data also support quetiapine monotherapy as a second-line option for the management of acute bipolar II depression. The importance of comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions cannot be understated, and this update provides an expanded look at the prevalence, impact and management of comorbid conditions in patients with bipolar disorder.

Bipolar depression

There are no RCTs of any agents in older adults with acute bipolar depression. Post hoc analyses of RCTs suggest efficacy of quetiapine (level 2) 661 and lurasidone (level 2) 662 monotherapy and hence these are recommended as first‐line options. However, in older adults, given the concerns about side effects of atypical antipsychotics, clinicians may wish to try lithium or lamotrigine first based on their efficacy in adult populations, although the evidence of efficacy is limited in older adults (lithium, level 4; lamotrigine, level 4). 663, 664 Divalproex (level 4), aripiprazole (level 4), 658 and carbamazepine (level 4) 665 are third‐line options. ECT (level 4) 654 is an important option that should be considered in treatment‐resistant cases, for suicidal patients, or for patients with inadequate food or fluid intake.

While the use of antidepressants in BD remains controversial 260, 426 and there have been no studies in older age BD; antidepressants are frequently used in this population (> 40% of patients). 666 Antidepressants with lower manic switch potential (eg, SSRIs and bupropion) 260 used in combination with mood stabilizers may be beneficial in selected patients who cannot tolerate/do not respond to other agents with a stronger geriatric evidence base. Possible medication interactions with ongoing medications for non‐psychiatric conditions must always be considered.

Maintenance

Choice of agents should be based on what has been effective in the acute phase, with recommended options with geriatric efficacy data being lithium (level 2), 667, 668 lamotrigine (level 2), 668 and divalproex (level 3). 667

5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

AEDs, including lamotrigine extended-release, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

4.4.3 Step 3: add on or switch therapy (alternate first‐line agents)

Across several different medications for bipolar depression, early improvement (after 2 weeks) has been found to be a reasonable predictor of overall response, whereas lack of early improvement is a more robust predictor of non‐response. 255 Lamotrigine is the exception to this rule, given a necessary slow titration initiating the medication. In the case of non‐response, dosing should be optimized and issues of non‐adherence identified and addressed (see Section 2) prior to adjusting treatment strategies.

When determining whether an agent should be switched or another first‐line agent be added on to any current treatment, the effectiveness of each of the medications needs to be understood in the context of all the goals of managing BD. It is often the case that a medication may be selected to address several goals; for instance, lithium could be added for acute depression with intent to also bolster anti‐manic prophylaxis. In this scenario, if lithium is ineffective in the individual patient for an acute bipolar depression but is also being used over the long term for anti‐manic prophylaxis, then an "add‐on" intervention should be the next treatment for the acute bipolar depression. If, for instance, the anti‐manic prophylaxis is already being fully provided by an atypical antipsychotic, then the new medication could replace lithium via a switch strategy. Decision‐making must also address efficacy for comorbid conditions, as well as tolerability concerns. In principle, all things being equal, a switch is preferred over add‐on to limit the degree of polypharmacy, but the clinical reality is that medications may be helpful for some but not all components of the illness, and using rational polypharmacy via add‐on treatments is often required. For situations in which patients experience a depressive episode while already receiving an adequately dosed antidepressant, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing or switching the class of antidepressant, unless clear benefits are apparent in reducing the severity or frequency of depressive episodes. Switch of medications should be done in an overlap and taper manner unless there is medical necessity for abrupt discontinuation. 257

All first‐line options should be tried in adequate doses for an adequate duration of time before considering second‐line options either as an add‐on or switch strategy.

### Changes in brain glx in depressed bipolar patients treated with lamotrigine: a proton MRS study [^1171afbZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lamotrigine is a useful treatment in bipolar depression but requires several weeks of dose titration before its clinical effects can be assessed. Animal experimental studies suggest that lamotrigine lowers glutamate release. The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of lamotrigine on brain glutamate in depressed bipolar patients and to determine whether baseline glutamate could be used to predict clinical response.

Methods

We studied 21 bipolar patients who received lamotrigine treatment for a current episode of depression. Before starting lamotrigine and after 10–12 weeks treatment, patients underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) scanning at 3 Tesla where levels of glutamate (measured as Glx) were determined in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

Results

Overall, lamotrigine treatment had no significant effect on Glx levels in ACC. However, in patients who responded clinically to lamotrigine treatment Glx concentrations were significantly increased. Baseline levels of Glx did not predict response to lamotrigine.

Limitations

The main limitation of the study was the modest sample size. Most patients were medicated which may have modified the effect of lamotrigine on glutamate activity. MRS at 3T cannot give a reliable estimate of glutamate separate from its main metabolite, glutamine, and thus changes in Glx may not give a precise estimate of effects of lamotrigine on glutamate itself.

Conclusion

Lamotrigine does not appear to have a direct effect on glutamate levels in ACC in bipolar patients. However, therapeutic improvement during lamotrigine was associated with increased Glx, suggesting that alterations in glutamatergic activity might be related to recovery from bipolar depression.

Responders to lamotrigine have a predominantly depressive polarity as well as comorbid anxiety. 420, 421 Lamotrigine monotherapy is not appropriate for patients with frequent manic episodes, as it has limited efficacy in preventing mania.

Quetiapine has been shown to be effective in preventing manic, depressive and mixed episodes in patients with index manic, depressive and mixed episodes, and thus may be particularly valuable in those with mixed features. 422 Asenapine appears to be effective in preventing both mania and depression, although the magnitude of prophylactic efficacy is greater for mania relative to depression. In a randomized open trial of carbamazepine versus lithium, responders to carbamazepine were more likely to have an atypical illness, BDII or schizoaffective disorder. 405

Data to differentiate anti‐psychotic medication responders from non‐responders are lacking.

Overall, some of these possible predictors can have clinical utility, but not all are practical. For instance, it is difficult to evaluate a pre‐treatment course in patients who started their treatment after one or two episodes (practice recommended by most treatment guidelines), and biomarkers are intriguing but lack sufficient replication and are not readily available.

In patients with a history of a rapid cycling course, as indicated in previous sections, factors associated with rapid cycling must be addressed. These include discontinuation of stimulants and antidepressants and treating hypothyroidism if present. With regard to treatment options, the evidence suggests that monotherapy with a single mood stabilizer is often ineffective and patients may require a combination of mood stabilizers to achieve mood stability.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder in 2005, with updates in 2007 and 2009. This third update, in conjunction with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders, reviews new evidence and is designed to be used in conjunction with the previous publications. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain largely unchanged. Lithium, valproate, and several atypical antipsychotic agents continue to be first-line treatments for acute mania. Monotherapy with asenapine, paliperidone extended release (ER), and divalproex ER, as well as adjunctive asenapine, have been added as first-line options. For the management of bipolar depression, lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine monotherapy, as well as olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion remain first-line options. Lurasidone monotherapy and the combination of lurasidone or lamotrigine plus lithium or divalproex have been added as a second-line options. Ziprasidone alone or as adjunctive therapy, and adjunctive levetiracetam have been added as not-recommended options for the treatment of bipolar depression. Lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone long-acting injection, and adjunctive ziprasidone continue to be first-line options for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Asenapine alone or as adjunctive therapy have been added as third-line options.

A literature search was performed 20th November 2024 across PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO, and grey literature for studies of lithium, lamotrigine, and placebo in adults with BDII, across illness phases. Primary outcomes were efficacy and tolerability. We conducted random-effects pair-wise meta-analysis to provide a summary measure of effect, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework.

Results

Our search yielded 2326 records, including 10 randomized trials comprising 645 patients with BDII. The evidence was very uncertain regarding lithium's effect on the risk of new affective episodes, regardless of polarity, compared with placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI [0.66, 1.11], I² = 0%, four studies, very low certainty evidence). A quantitative synthesis could not be conducted to compare lamotrigine and placebo. The evidence was very uncertain regarding the effect of lithium on depression severity compared with lamotrigine (mean HAMD17 difference: 1.27, 95% CI [-3.84, 6.38], I² = 0%, two studies, very low certainty evidence). The overall risk of bias was of 'some concern' for 84% of outcomes assessed. For all outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was graded 'very low'.

Conclusion

The evidence for lithium and lamotrigine in treating BDII is scarce, and the certainty of the evidence is very low. Large, well-conducted RCTs of patients with BDII are needed.

### Comparative economic evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo) in patients with bipolar depression (CEQUEL) [^115jtGJo]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although not licensed for acute bipolar depression, lamotrigine has evidence for efficacy in trials and its use is recommended in guidelines. So far there had been no prospective health economic evaluation of its use.

Methods

Cost-utility analysis of the CEQUEL trial comparing quetiapine plus lamotrigine vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo in an add-on factorial design) for patients with bipolar depression (n = 201) from the health and social care perspective. Differences in costs together with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between the groups were assessed over 52 weeks using a regression-based approach.

Results

Health-related quality of life improved substantially for all randomization groups during follow-up with no significant difference in QALYs between any of the comparisons (mean adjusted QALY difference: lamotrigine vs placebo -0.001 (95% CI: -0.05 to 0.05), folic acid vs placebo 0.002 (95% CI: -0.05 to 0.05)). While medication costs in the lamotrigine group were higher than in the placebo group (£647, P < 0.001), mental health community/outpatient costs were significantly lower (-£670, P < 0.001). Mean total costs were similar in the groups (-£180, P = 0.913).

Conclusions

Lamotrigine improved clinical ratings in bipolar depression compared with placebo. This differential effect was not detected using the EQ-5D-3L. The additional cost of lamotrigine was balanced by significant savings in some other medical costs which made its use cost neutral to the health service. Compared to placebo, folic acid produced neither clinical nor significant health economic benefits. The study supports the use of lamotrigine in combination with other drugs to treat bipolar depression.

Abstract

Objectives

Although not licensed for acute bipolar depression, lamotrigine has evidence for efficacy in trials and its use is recommended in guidelines. So far there had been no prospective health economic evaluation of its use.

Methods

Cost‐utility analysis of the CEQUEL trial comparing quetiapine plus lamotrigine vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo in an add‐on factorial design) for patients with bipolar depression (n = 201) from the health and social care perspective. Differences in costs together with quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) between the groups were assessed over 52 weeks using a regression‐based approach.

Results

Health‐related quality of life improved substantially for all randomization groups during follow‐up with no significant difference in QALYs between any of the comparisons (mean adjusted QALY difference: lamotrigine vs placebo −0.001 (95% CI: −0.05 to 0.05), folic acid vs placebo 0.002 (95% CI: −0.05 to 0.05)). While medication costs in the lamotrigine group were higher than in the placebo group (£647, P < 0.001), mental health community/outpatient costs were significantly lower (−£670, P < 0.001). Mean total costs were similar in the groups (−£180, P = 0.913).

Conclusions

Lamotrigine improved clinical ratings in bipolar depression compared with placebo. This differential effect was not detected using the EQ‐5D‐3L. The additional cost of lamotrigine was balanced by significant savings in some other medical costs which made its use cost neutral to the health service. Compared to placebo, folic acid produced neither clinical nor significant health economic benefits. The study supports the use of lamotrigine in combination with other drugs to treat bipolar depression.

### Bipolar depression before and after lamotrigine treatment… [^113DTRM5]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study compared glutamate and other neurometabolites measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in bipolar I and II patients currently depressed with age-matched healthy controls. The study will also compare 1H-MRS of bipolar I and II patients before and after taking a 12-week course of lamotrigine. The goal of this study was to better understand the neurobiology of bipolar depression and how lamotrigine may therapeutically impact brain function and mood response.

The hypothesis was that in comparison to non-remission participants, bipolar participants who achieve remission score < 12 at week 12) associated with lamotrigine monotherapy will exhibit a greater decrease in glutamate and an increase in N-acetyl aspartate, reported as a cerebrospinal fluid -corrected absolute concentration percent change from baseline to endpoint in anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This was a 5-year single-site study of bipolar depression utilizing 1H-MR spectroscopy before and after treatment with lamotrigine. At baseline bipolar depressed subjects and age-matched controls underwent a 1H-MRS at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The bipolar depressed subjects were then be placed on 12-week, open evaluation of lamotrigine monotherapy. After 12 weeks, the bipolar subjects underwent a second 1H-MRS scan.

Two different MRS sequences were used to measure the brain chemicals in a single 2 x 2 x 2 cm cube located in the center of anterior cingulate cortex: an intermediate echo-time PRESS sequence and a 2D J-resolved averaged PRESS sequence. Spectroscopic data were inspected for quality; subjects whose data were contaminated by artifact were excluded from the study.

### A 7-week, randomized, double-blind trial of olanzapine / fluoxetine combination versus lamotrigine in the treatment of bipolar I depression [^1173CviQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Determine the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) for treatment of acute bipolar I depression compared with lamotrigine.

Method

The 7-week, acute phase of a randomized, double-blind study compared OFC (6/25, 6/50, 12/25, or 12/50 mg/day; N = 205) with lamotrigine ([LMG] titrated to 200 mg/day; N = 205) in patients with DSM-IV-diagnosed bipolar I disorder, depressed. The study was conducted from November 2003 to August 2004.

Results

Completion rates were similar between treatments (OFC, 66.8% vs. LMG, 65.4%; p = .835). OFC-treated patients had significantly greater improvement than lamotrigine-treated patients in change from baseline across the 7-week treatment period on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (primary outcome) (p = .002, effect size = 0.26), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (p = .002, effect size = 0.24), and Young Mania Rating Scale total scores (p = .001, effect size = 0.24). Response rates did not significantly differ between groups when defined as ≥ 50% reduction in MADRS score (OFC, 68.8% vs. LMG, 59.7%; p = .073). Time to response was significantly shorter for OFC-treated patients (median days [95% CI] = OFC, 17 [14 to 22] vs. LMG, 23 [21 to 34]; p = .010). There was a significant difference in incidence of "suicidal and self-injurious behavior" adverse events (OFC, 0.5% vs. LMG, 3.4%; p = .037). Somnolence, increased appetite, dry mouth, sedation, weight gain, and tremor occurred more frequently (p < .05) in OFC-treated patients than lamotrigine-treated patients. Weight, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in OFC-treated patients compared with lamotrigine-treated patients (all p ≤ .001).

Conclusions

Patients with acute bipolar I depression had statistically significantly greater improvement in depressive and manic symptoms, more treatment-emergent adverse events, greater weight gain, and some elevated metabolic factors with OFC than lamotrigine. Treatment differences were of modest size.

### A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of lamotrigine as an antidepressant augmentation agent in treatment-refractory unipolar depression [^112vGBWD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports have suggested that lamotrigine is effective as an antidepressant augmentation agent in patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression. This study is the largest double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted to date of lamotrigine in this role.

Method

In this multicenter trial, conducted at 19 sites, patients aged 18–65 years with a DSM-IV/ICD-10 diagnosis of unipolar, nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) who had failed at least 1 adequate trial of an antidepressant (N = 183) were first treated for 8 weeks with open-label paroxetine or paroxetine controlled-release in dosages up to 50 mg/d or 62.5 mg/d, respectively. Individuals with a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score ≥ 15 (n = 96) were then randomized on a double-blind basis to receive either placebo or lamotrigine in dosages titrated upward to a maximum of 400 mg/d for 10 weeks. Sixty-five patients completed the study. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the main secondary outcome measures were the HDRS-17 and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) ratings. Data were collected from 2003 to 2006.

Results

Results of the primary efficacy analysis of the randomized patients using the MADRS, HDRS-17, CGI-S, and CGI-I did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo groups, although some secondary analyses were suggestive of efficacy, particularly in those patients who completed the study (completer analysis) and in more severely ill patients (HDRS-17 ≥ 25).

Conclusions

This add-on study of patients with treatment-resistant depression failed to detect a statistically significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo given for 10 weeks. However, post hoc analyses suggest that future studies of lamotrigine's efficacy might focus on specific subgroups with depression.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115m8nwC]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

First‐line

Quetiapine (level 1), 241, 242, 243 lithium (level 2), 244, 245, 246 lamotrigine (level 2) 242, 247, 248 and lurasidone (level 2) 249 are all recommended as first‐line treatment options with evidence for efficacy as monotherapy.

Lurasidone (level 1) 249, 250 and lamotrigine (level 2) 251, 252 are also recommended as first‐line adjunctive treatments (Figure 2). Although quetiapine and lithium have not been assessed for efficacy as adjunctive treatments for acute bipolar depression, clinicians may choose to apply this combination in patients who experience depression when optimized on one of either of these medications.

Figure 2
Lithium and lamotrigine as first‐line agents for bipolar I depression: Summary of evidence > [Colour figure can be viewed at]

Recommendations as to which first‐line treatment should be considered first are outlined in our hierarchy. We recommend that the agents listed first in the hierarchy be tried first, in the order listed, unless there are patient‐specific reasons for choosing an agent lower down in the order, such as previous history of response/ non‐response or clinical features (see Clinical features which help direct treatment choices). For instance, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and is not taking any treatment and has not been treated for this episode, that patient should be commenced on quetiapine monotherapy if there is no previous history of non‐response or tolerability concerns with quetiapine. However, if a patient had been taking lithium and either had a breakthrough acute bipolar depressive episode or did not respond to monotherapy with lithium, then lurasidone or lamotrigine or quetiapine add‐on or switch to quetiapine monotherapy or lurasidone monotherapy might be more appropriate in that order, given that lurasidone and lamotrigine adjunctive therapies have demonstrated efficacy in lithium non‐responders. Similarly, in non‐responders to lithium monotherapy, adjunctive lamotrigine could be another option.

### Role of lamotrigine in the management of treatment-resistant bipolar II depression: a chart review [^112ayeyQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

We report the results of a retrospective, naturalistic study of lamotrigine in the management of treatment-resistant bipolar II depression.

Methods

Hospital charts of 31 patients treated at a mood disorders clinic, who had been on lamotrigine for at least six months after failing to show an adequate response to a combination of two mood stabilizers or a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant, were reviewed using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI) rating scale.

Results

Patients were seen for an average of 19.4 months following the introduction of lamotrigine. The lamotrigine daily dose ranged from 50–400 mg (mean dose 199.2 mg) as monotherapy or in combination with a mood stabilizer, an atypical antipsychotic, or a sedative/hypnotic drug. Very much improvement was seen in 52% of patients and 32% were considered much improved.

Conclusions

These naturalistic data suggest that lamotrigine alone or in combination with other psychotropic drugs was well tolerated and effective in the management treatment-resistant bipolar II depression.

Limitations

Retrospective design, small sample size, and lack of a control group.

### Lamotrigine adjunctive treatment in resistant unipolar depression: an open, descriptive study [^1167iS3k]. Depression and Anxiety (2006). Low credibility.

Adjunctive treatment of lamotrigine compared to other antidepressants in the treatment of partially responsive, poorly functioning patients with unipolar depression was assessed. Fourteen consenting patients with confirmed DSM-IV-R diagnosis of unipolar depression were identified as treatment resistant. All patients failed at least two 8-week treatment trials with antidepressants. All were treated with lamotrigine as an adjunct to other antidepressants for at least 6 months. The primary effectiveness measure was the Clinical Global Impression Severity subscale (CGI-S). Other scales included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). Monitoring for skin rashes, headache, dizziness, somnolence, and gastrointestinal disturbances was carried out to assess for adverse events. Baseline measures prior to adding lamotrigine were compared to those at 8 weeks and 6 months with adjunctive treatment. Twelve patients of the total (n = 14) completed the trial, and two discontinued treatment. There was significant, rapid, and robust resolution in symptoms in all effectiveness measures, including the core symptoms of depression, as shown by the changes from baseline in CGI-S, and MADRS at 8 weeks. Social and occupational functioning was significantly improved at 6 months. Eight patients returned to gainful employment or started schooling. Patients tolerated the adjunctive lamotrigine treatment well. Lamotrigine may have antidepressant properties in patients with unipolar depression and may have an earlier onset of action when given in combination with antidepressants.

### The American society of clinical psychopharmacology survey of psychopharmacologists' practice patterns for the treatment of mood disorders [^114ePecT]. Depression and Anxiety (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal successive treatment decisions are not well established after an initial medication nonresponse in major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. While practice guidelines offer consensus-based expert treatment recommendations, little is known about "real world" pharmacology decision making by practicing psychopharmacologists.

Materials and Methods

We surveyed via Internet the national membership of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology (ASCP) to study preferred pharmacotherapy strategies and factors that influence medication choices for patients with mood disorders.

Results

Surveys were returned by 154/752 ASCP members (21%). After nonresponse to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in major depressive disorder, participants equally favored switching within or across antidepressant classes. After a partial response, adjunctive bupropion was the preferred intervention, followed by changing antidepressant classes. Atypical antipsychotic augmentation was only a fourth-line consideration, even though moderate or marked efficacy was perceived in most instances with olanzapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine. Respondents favored avoiding antidepressants in bipolar I patients with mixed/cycling features or prior antidepressant-associated mania/hypomania. In rapid cyclers, they advocated antidepressant cessation and preferred the use of atypical antipsychotics and lamotrigine.

Conclusions

Participating psychopharmacologists treating adults with mood disorders report prescribing medications that largely mirror the evidence base with only a few notable exceptions, in consideration of the characteristics of definable clinical subpopulations.

### Lamotrigine in psychiatric disorders [^115A1Y9G]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Owing to the prevalence of medication side effects and treatment resistance, prescribers often consider off-label uses of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents for the treatment of persistent symptoms. The authors review the available literature on the FDA-approved and non-FDA-approved uses of lamotrigine in adults with psychiatric disorders.

Data Sources

We used PubMed, MEDLINE, and a hand search of relevant literature to find studies published between 1990 and 2012 and available in English language. The following keywords were searched: lamotrigine, psychiatric, mood disorders, depression, personality disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, side effects, and rash.

Study Selection

Data were selected from 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). When RCTs were not available, open-label trials (6), retrospective case reviews (10), and case series (4) were summarized.

Data Extraction

We extracted results of monotherapy and augmentation trials of lamotrigine on primary and secondary outcome measures.

Results

Lamotrigine is generally well tolerated, with the best evidence for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, particularly in prevention of depressive episodes. In acute bipolar depression, meta-analyses suggested a modest benefit, especially for more severely depressed subjects, with switch rates similar to placebo. In unipolar depression, double-blind RCTs noted benefit on subsets of symptoms and improved response in more severely depressed subjects. Data are limited but promising in borderline personality disorder. Use of lamotrigine in schizophrenia and anxiety disorders has little supportive evidence.

Conclusions

Lamotrigine is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent. It also has a role in treating acute bipolar depression and unipolar depression, though the latter warrants more research. Data are too limited in other psychiatric disorders to recommend its use at this time.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^114qisTW]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline — lamotrigine dosing and hepatic adjustment: For bipolar depression, initial dosing is 25 mg every other day −50 mg/day depending on concomitant medications, and in older adults initiate at lower end of dosing range. For hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment (Child-Pugh A); reduce initial and maintenance dose by 25% for Child-Pugh B and C without ascites, and by 50% for Child-Pugh B and C with ascites. Lamotrigine is not beneficial for acute mania or acute bipolar depression but is effective in preventing recurrences of bipolar depression.

### Lamotrigine as adjunct to paroxetine in acute depression: a placebo-controlled, double-blind study [^115GEszw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Mood stabilizers appear to be more potent in treating mania than depression. The anticonvulsant lamotrigine has been shown to be effective for bipolar depression. This study examines putative antidepressive properties of lamotrigine in a mainly unipolar routine clinical patient population.

Method

Forty patients with a depressive episode (DSM-IV criteria) requiring psychiatric intervention received lamotrigine or placebo using a fixed dose escalation scheme with a target dose of 200 mg/day for 9 weeks. Additionally, all patients were treated with paroxetine. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) ratings were used to monitor therapeutic efficacy.

Results

Adjunctive treatment with lamotrigine did not result in a significant difference in HAM-D total score at the endpoint of the study when compared with paroxetine alone. However, lamotrigine demonstrated significant efficacy on core depressive symptoms as reflected by HAM-D items 1 (depressed mood; p = .0019), 2 (guilt feelings; p = .0011), and 7 (work and interest; p = .049) and the CGI-Severity of Illness scale (p < .0001). Patients receiving lamotrigine had fewer days on treatment with benzodiazepines and fewer withdrawals for treatment failure. Lamotrigine appeared to accelerate the onset of action of the antidepressant. Two patients on lamotrigine treatment developed neutropenia, and 1 developed a benign rash. There was no detectable pharmacokinetic interaction between lamotrigine and paroxetine.

Conclusion

Lamotrigine might have antidepressive properties in unipolar patients and may accelerate onset of action when given in combination with typical antidepressants.

### Lamotrigine (Lamictal) [^117JhuCQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Trial 1, patients received double-blind monotherapy with LAMICTAL 50 mg/day (n = 50), LAMICTAL 200 mg/day (n = 124), LAMICTAL 400 mg/day (n = 47), or placebo (n = 121). LAMICTAL (200- and 400-mg/day treatment groups combined) was superior to placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 1). Separate analyses of the 200- and 400-mg/day dose groups revealed no added benefit from the higher dose.

In Trial 2, patients received double-blind monotherapy with LAMICTAL (100 to 400 mg/day, n = 59), or placebo (n = 70). LAMICTAL was superior to placebo in delaying time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 2). The mean dose of LAMICTAL was about 211 mg/day.

Although these trials were not designed to separately evaluate time to the occurrence of depression or mania, a combined analysis for the 2 trials revealed a statistically significant benefit for LAMICTAL over placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of both depression and mania, although the finding was more robust for depression.

Acute bipolar depression adjunctive therapy — We suggest lamotrigine in combination with lithium or quetiapine for acute bipolar depression (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). A systematic review (SR) and network meta-analysis reported five studies of adjunctive lamotrigine in mixed samples of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), with primary analysis treatment response favoring lamotrigine (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.00–2.04); there were no significant effects in analyses limited to BD 1 or BD 2, the quality of evidence was very low, and secondary analyses found no significant differences in symptoms or remission. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adjunctive lamotrigine with lithium produced significant changes in provider-rated symptoms and response rates based on > 50% reductions at 6 and 8 weeks; as an adjunct to quetiapine, patient-reported symptoms were significantly greater than placebo at one year with low quality of evidence, and remission was greater at 12 weeks and one year, but not at 22 weeks; neither study reported outcomes specifically for BD 1 or BD 2 subtypes.

### Lamotrigine: when and where does it act in affective disorders? A systematic review [^1179VdeD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Recent published data and treatment guidelines have created uncertainty about the use of lamotrigine in affective disorders, especially in acute bipolar depression. Furthermore, unpublished data on lamotrigine in mania, mixed episodes, unipolar depression and rapid cycling are still waiting to be integrated into the literature. Therefore, we critically reviewed the position of lamotrigine in the acute and long-term treatment of affective disorders. Studies were identified by searching English language articles published in MEDLINE using the key words: lamotrigine, bipolar depression, unipolar depression, mania, mixed episode, long-term treatment, rapid-cycling. Results of unpublished trials were obtained from the GlaxoSmithKline website. Lamotrigine showed efficacy in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, more so in depressive than manic episodes. There was no evidence of effectiveness in the acute treatment of mania, mixed episodes, unipolar depression or rapid-cycling bipolar I disorder. Its effect in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is at most small. Based on current evidence, lamotrigine is indicated for the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder with predominantly depressive episodes. Its effectiveness in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is open to debate, and practical considerations limit its usefulness here. There are no grounds for recommending its use in manic or mixed states, in rapidly-cycling bipolar I or in unipolar depression.

### Efficacy and safety of lamotrigine as add-on treatment to lithium in bipolar depression: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1155pfm9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Lamotrigine is one of the pharmacologic options for the treatment of bipolar depression but has only been studied as monotherapy. This study compared the acute effects of lamotrigine and placebo as add-on therapy to ongoing treatment with lithium in patients with bipolar depression.

Method

Outpatients (N = 124) aged 18 years and older with a DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder and a major depressive episode (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score ≥ 18 and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version [CGI-BP] severity of depression score ≥ 4) while receiving lithium treatment (0.6–1.2 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with lamotrigine (titrated to 200 mg/d) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline in total score on the MADRS at week 8. Secondary outcome measures were response (defined as a reduction of ≥ 50% on the MADRS and/or change of depression score on the CGI-BP of "much improved" or "very much improved" compared to baseline) and switch to mania or hypomania (defined as a CGI-BP severity of mania score of at least mildly ill at any visit). Patients were included in the study between August 2002 (Spain started in October 2003) and May 2005.

Results

Endpoint mean change from baseline MADRS total score was -15.38 (SE = 1.32) points for lamotrigine and -11.03 (SE = 1.36) points for placebo (t = -2.29, df = 104, p = .024). Significantly more patients responded to lamotrigine than to placebo on the MADRS (51.6% vs. 31.7%, p = .030), but not on the CGI-BP change of depression (64.1% vs. 49.2%, p = .105). Switch to mania or hypomania occurred in 5 patients (7.8%) receiving lamotrigine and 2 patients (3.3%) receiving placebo (p = .441).

Conclusion

Lamotrigine was found effective and safe as add-on treatment to lithium in the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

### Lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in treatment-resistant depression [^115V4jjA]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The anticonvulsant lamotrigine has been reported to be efficacious and well tolerated as monotherapy in the treatment of bipolar patients as well as in treatment-refractory bipolar disorder. However, there is a paucity of research on the use of lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in treatment-refractory unipolar major depressive disorder.

Method

This study was a retrospective chart review on the efficacy of lamotrigine augmentation in 37 individuals diagnosed with chronic or recurrent major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) who had failed to respond adequately to at least 2 previous trials of antidepressants. Thirty-one patients who were on lamotrigine treatment for at least 6 weeks (6 discontinued prematurely due to adverse events) took a mean dose of 112.90 mg/day for a mean of 41.80 weeks. The primary efficacy parameter for this study was the Clinical Global Impressions scale, which was retrospectively applied. In addition, these data were supplemented by an analysis of prospectively rated Global Assessment of Functioning scores.

Results

On the basis of intent-to-treat analysis, response rates were as follows: 40.5% (15/37) much improved or very much improved, 21.6% (8/37) mildly improved, and 37.8% (14/37) unchanged. The percentage of patients who were rated much or very much improved and completed 6 weeks on the drug was 48.4% (15/31). No differences were found in the doses of lamotrigine given to responders and nonresponders.

Conclusion

Analyses revealed that lamotrigine treatment was most effective for patients who had been depressed for shorter periods of time and had failed fewer previous trials of antidepressants. Data also suggested a trend toward increased response for patients with comorbid anxiety disorders and/or chronic pain syndromes.

Other common treatments for BD-D

The US FDA approval process relies on a review of manufacturer-provided information regarding safety and effectiveness of a drug for specific indications. Once approved for a specific indication, 'off label' use is allowed. There are several drugs not approved by the FDA that are commonly used 'off label' for treatment of BD-D and have substantial supporting evidence.

Classic mood stabilisers

Lithium is effective in the acute treatment of mania and long-term maintenance of mood and prophylaxis, and may be particularly effective in a subset of patients. There are few trials comparing lithium with placebo for BD-D, but a small study of 29 patients with acute depression assigned to lithium or imipramine after a placebo trial found a 32% reduction in depressive symptoms among patients treated with lithium for 4 weeks. Despite clear evidence of long-term benefits, including robust antisuicidal effects, the evidence for rapid or short-term benefits of lithium in acute BD-D is generally considered modest.

Of the antiepileptic mood stabilisers, lamotrigine, which has been found to have antidepressant effects in placebo-controlled trials, may be best supported. In a meta-analysis of five RCTs (n = 1072), lamotrigine improved MADRS, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.41, p = 0.005). The author concludes that the overall pool effect was modest, although the advantage over placebo was larger in patients with more severe depression. Some evidence also exists for use of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine as secondary choices. In a meta-analysis of monotherapy (including lamotrigine, carbamazepine and valproic acid), mood stabilisers are moderately efficacious for acute BD-D (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.44; NNT = 10, 95% CI: 7 to 18), but studies are few and limited by the high rates of discontinuation.

### What not to use in bipolar disorders: a systematic review of non-recommended treatments in clinical practice guidelines [^114X7SKo]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are an important tool for implementation of evidence-based clinical care. Despite clinical trials showing lack of efficacy of some agents in bipolar disorder (BD), they are still frequently prescribed in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to systematically review the CPG recommendations on pharmacological interventions with evidence against their use due to lack of efficacy data and/or due to serious safety concerns.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified 29 guidelines published by national and international organizations during the 1994–2020 period. Information was extracted regarding how the recommendations framed non-use of treatments in particular clinical situations as well as the actual recommendation in the guideline.

Results

Twenty-three guidelines (79%) mentioned at least one non-recommended treatment. The terms used to qualify recommendations varied amongst guidelines and included: "not recommended" "no recommendation" and "negative evidence". Lamotrigine, topiramate and gabapentin were commonly cited as non-recommended treatments for mania and most CPG did not recommend monotherapy with antidepressants, aripiprazole, risperidone, and ziprasidone for treatment of acute bipolar depression. Most guidelines made recommendations about lack of efficacy data or potential harm in treatments for BD but there is a significant variation in the way this information is conveyed to the reader.

Limitations

Non-recommended treatments were based on their use for BD episodes or maintenance but specific medications may benefit patients when treating comorbid conditions.

Conclusions

The absence of a uniform language and recommendations in current guidelines may be an additional complicating factor in the implementation of evidence-based treatments in BD.

### Acute neural effects of the mood stabiliser lamotrigine on emotional processing in healthy volunteers: a randomised control trial [^113SjD1j]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of lamotrigine on subjective mood and neural measures of emotional processing in healthy volunteers. Participants in the lamotrigine group were more accurate at identifying the gender of fearful faces compared to the placebo group. In addition to this behavioural effect, we saw a reduction in BOLD activity in the lamotrigine group relative to placebo in response to fearful, happy, and angry faces (versus baseline) in a network of regions associated with emotional processing, including the amygdala, insula and ACC. Therefore, not in line with our hypothesis, lamotrigine had valence-independent rather than emotion-specific effects on neural measures of emotional processing. There were no effects of lamotrigine in response to visual stimulation, supporting the conclusion that the effects on emotional processing were not driven by global drug-related modulation of the BOLD signal. Undesired side effects related to lamotrigine included reduced alertness and increased drowsiness. However, neural results were not affected by adding subjective ratings as nuisance regressors. Together these findings indicate that lamotrigine has broad ranging effects on neural response to emotional stimuli. This would suggest an effect of lamotrigine that is not specific to negative emotional stimuli, at least at a neural level, which may be relevant for models of mood stabilising action to consider.

The amygdala and ACC play an important role in emotional processing, and are postulated as a key site of traditional antidepressant action. Specifically, acute doses of conventional antidepressants have been shown to reproducibly and significantly reduce amygdala response to fearful faces and/or increase activation to happy faces in this region perhaps reflecting early normalisation of negative affective bias in depression. These changes in emotional processing have been associated with later improvements in mood, suggesting that they represent a critical pathway through which antidepressants exert their effects. In our current study lamotrigine reduced BOLD activity in the amygdala and ACC in response to both positive and negative faces. The amygdala plays a key role in detecting salient information in the environment. It is therefore possible that this effect of reducing activity in the amygdala in response to both positive and negative valences could contribute to the mood-stabilising effect of lamotrigine, given that patients with BD suffer from mood instability and their interpretation of positive and negative events can oscillate greatly between mood episodes. This hypothesis remains speculative however and further research is needed to further explore this.

Lamotrigine for acute bipolar depression — We suggest lamotrigine in combination with lithium or quetiapine for acute bipolar depression, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine was very low with the recommendation categorized as Reviewed, New-added. In general, lamotrigine is well tolerated, but its use is associated with the rare occurrence of a serious and potentially fatal dermatological condition, SJS/TEN, and based on guidance from FDA approved product labeling, minimizing this risk requires that lamotrigine treatment starts at low, subtherapeutic doses with slow titration over 6 weeks to effective target doses. Overall, though, the Work Group concluded that, the benefits of adjunctive treatment with lamotrigine for individuals with bipolar depression outweigh the harms and burdens. In addition to its effectiveness as an adjunctive treatment of acute bipolar depression, lamotrigine has also demonstrated effectiveness as a monotherapy for the prevention of recurrent episodes of bipolar depression in BD 1 but not for mania, and early use during an acute episode might simplify long-term management by establishing a treatment regimen effective for maintenance as well as acute treatment.

### Long-term treatment of bipolar disorder with lamotrigine [^11645EME]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is as debilitating as mania in bipolar disorder, but the treatment of bipolar depression has historically received less attention. To date, there is no mood stabilizer (liberally defined as a medication that decreases episode severity, duration, or frequency in one phase of bipolar illness without producing a negative effect in other phases) that demonstrates similar efficacy in both the depressive and the manic phases of bipolar disorder. However, bipolar depression — which is prevalent, sometimes chronic, and associated with a low quality of life and a high risk of suicide — must be addressed as energetically as mania. Recent research into the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder has raised several questions about the generalizability of early lithium studies, as a result of these studies' designs. Researchers conducting more recent studies of mood stabilizers in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder have attempted to clarify their results by, for example, performing survival analyses of the data. Until pharmacotherapy has been found that is equally efficacious in the treatment of both manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, the use of combination therapy to manage bipolar disorder is advised. Lithium and divalproex sodium remain the first-line treatments for mania. Lamotrigine has been found to have acute efficacy in treating episodes of bipolar depression without increasing cycling or provoking a switch into mania, as well as a long-term role in delaying relapse and recurrence of depressive episodes.

### Lamotrigine as add-on treatment to lithium and divalproex: lessons learned from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder [^116Bamt3]. Bipolar Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

A substantial portion of the morbidity associated with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (RCBD) stems from refractory depression. This study assessed the antidepressant effects of lamotrigine as compared with placebo when used as add-on therapy for rapid-cycling bipolar depression non-responsive to the combination of lithium plus divalproex.

Methods

During Phase 1 of this trial, hypomanic, manic, mixed, and/or depressed outpatients (n = 133) aged 18–65 years with DSM-IV RCBD type I or II were initially treated with the open combination of lithium and divalproex for up to 16 weeks. During Phase 2, subjects who did not meet the criteria for stabilization (n = 49) (i.e., remained in or cycled into the depressed phase) were randomly assigned to double-blind, adjunctive lamotrigine (n = 23) or adjunctive placebo (n = 26). The primary endpoint was the mean change in depression symptom severity from the beginning of Phase 2 to the end of Phase 2 (week 12) on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Data were analyzed by analysis of covariance with last observation carried forward and a mixed-models analysis.

Results

During Phase 1, a high rate of study discontinuations occurred due to intolerable side effects (13/133; 10%) and study non-adherence (22/133; 17%). Only 14% (19/133) stabilized on the open combination of lithium and divalproex. Among the 49 (37%) patients randomized to the double-blind adjunctive treatment phase, mean ± standard error change from baseline on the MADRS total score was -8.5 ± 1.7 points for lamotrigine and -9.1 ± 1.5 points for placebo (p = not significant; mixed-models analysis). No significant differences were observed in the rates of response, remission, or bimodal response between lamotrigine and placebo.

Conclusions

The poor tolerability, lack of efficacy, and high rate of early discontinuation with the combination of lithium and divalproex suggests this regimen was ineffective for the majority of patients with RCBD. Among patients who did not stabilize on lithium and divalproex, the addition of lamotrigine was no more effective than placebo in reducing depression severity. The findings suggest an opportunity for several design modifications to enhance signal detection in future trials of RCBD. The main limitation is the small number of subjects randomized to double-blind treatment.

### Reevaluating therapies for bipolar depression [^115GWPcg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The most commonly employed pharmacotherapies for bipolar depression include antidepressants, lithium, and anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, valproate, and carbamazepine. A combination of these agents, usually an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer, is often required to achieve an optimal response. However, some treatment guidelines still caution that antidepressant exposure should be minimized in patients with bipolar depression, due to concern that they may trigger treatment-emergent mania or cycle acceleration. This advice prevails despite data showing that antidepressants are effective in treating bipolar depression and evidence that coadministration of a mood-stabilizing medication, at least with modern antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can reduce the risk of treatment-emergent mania to levels comparable with those observed with mood stabilizer monotherapy. Although the antidepressant efficacy of most mood stabilizers has not been satisfactorily proven, first-line therapy with 1 mood stabilizer alone or a combination of 2 mood stabilizers is still recommended by many guidelines. Inappropriate treatment of bipolar depression may leave patients at high risk of suicide and increased chronicity of symptoms; effective therapy should, therefore, be provided as early as possible. The efficacy and safety of antidepressants for bipolar depression both as monotherapy and when combined with a mood stabilizer should be studied in adequately powered trials in order to revise treatment guidelines. Electroconvulsive therapy remains an option for treatment-refractory patients and those intolerant to pharmacologic treatment, as well as patients who are pregnant or at high risk of suicide.

14.2 Bipolar Disorder

Adults

The effectiveness of LAMICTAL in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. Trial 1 enrolled patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV and Trial 2 included patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) episode of mania or hypomania as defined by DSM-IV. Both trials included a cohort of patients (30% of 404 subjects in Trial 1 and 28% of 171 patients in Trial 2) with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (4 to 6 episodes per year).

In both trials, patients were titrated to a target dose of 200 mg of LAMICTAL as add-on therapy or as monotherapy with gradual withdrawal of any psychotropic medications during an 8- to 16-week open-label period. Overall 81% of 1,305 patients participating in the open-label period were receiving 1 or more other psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics (including olanzapine), valproate, or lithium, during titration of LAMICTAL. Patients with a CGI-severity score of 3 or less maintained for at least 4 continuous weeks, including at least the final week on monotherapy with LAMICTAL, were randomized to a placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period for up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was TIME (time to intervention for a mood episode or one that was emerging, time to discontinuation for either an adverse event that was judged to be related to bipolar disorder, or for lack of efficacy). The mood episode could be depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed episode.

### Treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder: a critical review [^115so2bi]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

The development of treatment guidelines emerged as an important element so as to standardize treatment and to provide clinicians with algorithms, which would be able to carry research findings to the everyday clinical practice.

Material and Method

The MEDLINE was searched with the combination of each one of the key words 'mania', 'manic', 'bipolar', 'manic-depression', 'manic-depressive' with 'treatment guidelines'.

Results

The search was updated until March 1st, 2004 and returned 224 articles. Twenty-seven papers concerning the publication of treatment algorithms were traced.

Discussion

Despite supposedly being evidence-based, guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder vary significantly across committees or working groups. Overall, however, at the first stage of the mania/hypomania algorithm, monotherapy with lithium, divalproex sodium or olanzapine is generally recommended. At latter stages combination therapy is strongly recommended. It is clearly stated that in bipolar depression antidepressants should be used only in combination with antimanic agents in order to avoid switching of phases. During the maintenance phase all patients should receive antimanic agents, while some may need the addition of antidepressants. The most recent guidelines emphasize the use of atypical antipsychotics for mania and lamotrigine for depression. The main problem with guidelines is that they are rapidly outdated and that the evidence base relies mainly on registration monotherapy trials that hardly reflect treatment in routine clinical conditions.

Conclusion

Treatment guidelines may be useful to avoid non-evidence-based treatment decisions, but they are quickly out-of-date and may not fully apply to the clinical setting. The more recent guidelines point the value of atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and valproate in the treatment of mania; the role of lithium, lamotrigine, and olanzapine as options for maintenance therapy; and the scarcity of options for the treatment of bipolar depression. Psychoeducation is also supported by most guidelines as an adjunctive treatment.

### A 52-week, open-label continuation study of lamotrigine in the treatment of bipolar depression [^117U3WKJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy for the acute treatment of depression in bipolar I patients in a placebo-controlled, monotherapy study. We describe the results of a 52-week, open-label continuation of that trial.

Method

Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with a current major depressive episode who completed a 7-week, double-blind study of bipolar depression were offered 1 year of open-label lamotrigine therapy (flexible doses of 100–500 mg/day) in a continuation study. To maintain the acute study blind, the first 3 weeks of the continuation study remained blinded while patients previously randomly assigned to placebo were titrated to a lamotrigine dose of 50 mg/day. Patients who had been randomly assigned to lamotrigine continued at their fixed doses. Beginning at week 4, all patients received open-label lamotrigine for up to 49 additional weeks. Concomitant psychotropic medications were permitted during the open-label phase. Effectiveness (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale) and safety assessments were administered at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52. The study was conducted from June 1996 to December 1998.

Results

Of 135 patients completing the acute study, 124 (92%) entered the continuation study: 77 had received lamotrigine and 47 had received placebo in the acute study. The mean duration of lamotrigine exposure was 10.4 months, with a mean modal dose of 187 mg/day. Sixty-nine patients (56%) completed 1 year of treatment. Significant and sustained improvement from baseline was seen in mean observed MADRS scores (p < .05). The proportion of patients achieving remission (MADRS score ≤ 11) by week 4 of the study was 81.4%, and episodes of mania/hypomania occurred less frequently than in the preceding year. Headache was the most common drug-related adverse event.

Conclusion

During 1 year of open-label therapy with lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy or monotherapy, bipolar I patients experienced sustained improvement in depressive symptoms without evidence of mood destabilization.

4.4.7 No specific recommendation/agents that require further study

There are insufficient data to make a recommendation regarding the use of aspirin (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), 296 celecoxib (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), 297 gabapentin (monotherapy) (level 3 negative), 298 leviteracitam (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), 299 lisdexamfetamine (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), 300 memantine (adjunctive) (level 3), 301 pioglitazone (adjunctive) (level 3), 302, 303 riluzole (level 4 negative), 304 and risperidone (adjunctive) (level 3). 305 Although adjunctive therapy with pregnenolone separated from placebo at week 6, the change in depressive symptoms was not significantly different from week 8 to week 12 between the two groups (level 2). 306

4.5 Clinical features that help direct treatment choices

There are limited data on predictors of treatment response in bipolar depression. However, clinical features of a depressive episode including DSM‐5 specifiers may assist clinicians in choosing among recommended treatment options.

Need for rapid response

Amongst the first‐line options recommended, quetiapine and lurasidone have separated from placebo in clinical trials at as early as week 1. 249, 307, 308 Thus, these medications may be preferable when a rapid response is required, for example in patients who are at increased risk of suicide or who have medical complications, including dehydration. While ECT is recommended as a second‐line option, this may also be used earlier when a rapid response is imperative. Second‐line options such as cariprazine and olanzapine‐fluoxetine have also separated from placebo at as early as week 1 and may also be considered when a rapid response is desirable, but this needs to be balanced against the potential side effects. Lamotrigine administration requires slower titration due to the risk of skin rashes, Stevens‐Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and is thus not ideal for patients requiring a rapid response. Lamotrigine, however, is well tolerated, and there is some evidence that its effectiveness may be more pronounced in patients experiencing depressive cognitions and psychomotor slowing. 309

Previous treatment response

Adjunctive antidepressant use may be appropriate in those with prior antidepressant response if there was no history of treatment‐emergent switch. 310

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) collaborative update of CANMAT guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: update 2009 [^115seu7m]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder in 2005, with a 2007 update. This second update, in conjunction with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD), reviews new evidence and is designed to be used in conjunction with the previous publications. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain mostly unchanged. Lithium, valproate, and several atypical antipsychotics continue to be first-line treatments for acute mania. Tamoxifen is now suggested as a third-line augmentation option. The combination of olanzapine and carbamazepine is not recommended. For the management of bipolar depression, lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine monotherapy, olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion remain first-line options. New data support the use of adjunctive modafinil as a second-line option, but also indicate that aripiprazole should not be used as monotherapy for bipolar depression. Lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, and olanzapine continue to be first-line options for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. New data support the use of quetiapine monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for the prevention of manic and depressive events, aripiprazole monotherapy for the prevention of manic events, and risperidone long-acting injection monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, and adjunctive ziprasidone for the prevention of mood events. Bipolar II disorder is frequently overlooked in treatment guidelines, but has an important clinical impact on patients' lives. This update provides an expanded look at bipolar II disorder.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111i2q4o]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments previously published treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, along with international commentaries and subsequent updates in 2007, 2009, and 2013. The last two updates were published in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders. These 2018andBipolar Treatment Guidelines represent the significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, including updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacological and psychological treatments. These advances have been translated into clear and easy to use recommendations for first, second, and third‐ line treatments, with consideration given to levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment‐emergent switch risk. New to these guidelines, hierarchical rankings were created for first and second‐ line treatments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder. Created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness, this hierarchy will further assist clinicians in making evidence‐based treatment decisions. Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and cariprazine alone or in combination are recommended as first‐line treatments for acute mania. First‐line options for bipolar I depression include quetiapine, lurasidone plus lithium or divalproex, lithium, lamotrigine, lurasidone, or adjunctive lamotrigine. While medications that have been shown to be effective for the acute phase should generally be continued for the maintenance phase in bipolar I disorder, there are some exceptions (such as with antidepressants); and available data suggest that lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, asenapine, and aripiprazole monotherapy or combination treatments should be considered first‐line for those initiating or switching treatment during the maintenance phase. In addition to addressing issues in bipolar I disorder, these guidelines also provide an overview of, and recommendations for, clinical management of bipolardisorder, as well as advice on specific populations, such as women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, and older adults. There are also discussions on the impact of specific psychiatric and medical comorbidities such as substance use, anxiety, and metabolic disorders. Finally, an overview of issues related to safety and monitoring is provided. Theandgroups hope that these guidelines become a valuable tool for practitioners across the globe.

### Lamotrigine for the treatment of bipolar spectrum disorder: a chart review [^115vhbje]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar spectrum disorders are highly prevalent and disabling but are often misdiagnosed and inadequately treated. The use of mood stabilizers may be an important treatment option. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of lamotrigine in bipolar spectrum patients.

Methods

Retrospective follow-up of 34 charts of bipolar outpatients treated with lamotrigine in monotherapy or as add-on therapy. Clinic notes were used to score the Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorders (CGI-BP-M) scale and to identify manic, hypomanic mixed or depressive relapses.

Results

A mean dose of lamotrigine of 113.2 ± 66.6 mg/day for a mean duration of 29.7 ± 17.3 weeks (range 6–96 weeks) achieved remission on depression (score 1 on the CGI-BP-M depression subscale) in 47.1% of the patients. Eleven patients (32.4%) remained euthymic (score 1 on the CGI-BP-M overall subscale) during the follow-up, after initiating treatment with lamotrigine. Effectiveness of lamotrigine was greater for those patients diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorders other than bipolar I. Lamotrigine was well-tolerated and only two patients discontinued due to side effects.

Limitations

Chart review is open to several biases.

Conclusions

In this sample of bipolar spectrum patients, lamotrigine was a safe and effective treatment.

Evidence suggests that treatment with lamotrigine can help prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes in individuals with BD, with trials reporting efficacy for preventing not just mood episodes in general, but depressive episodes in particular; limited comparative evidence found no difference when comparing lamotrigine to lithium, and studies included both BD 1 and BD 2 without distinguishing between groups. As lamotrigine monotherapy has demonstrated effectiveness for prevention of depression but not mania, the Work Group acknowledged that it should be of value specifically in individuals with BD 2. Patient-centered considerations include that the medication is in general well tolerated though a risk of serious side effects (e.g. SJS/TEN) exists, many individuals prefer not to take maintenance medication, and titration can be cumbersome because it requires slow titration over the course of many weeks.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: consensus and controversies [^1174WYc5]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Since the previous publication of Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines in 1997, there has been a substantial increase in evidence-based treatment options for bipolar disorder. The present guidelines review the new evidence and use criteria to rate strength of evidence and incorporate effectiveness, safety, and tolerability data to determine global clinical recommendations for treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. The guidelines suggest that although pharmacotherapy forms the cornerstone of management, utilization of adjunctive psychosocial treatments and incorporation of chronic disease management model involving a healthcare team are required in providing optimal management for patients with bipolar disorder. Lithium, valproate and several atypical antipsychotics are first-line treatments for acute mania. Bipolar depression and mixed states are frequently associated with suicidal acts; therefore assessment for suicide should always be an integral part of managing any bipolar patient. Lithium, lamotrigine or various combinations of antidepressant and mood-stabilizing agents are first-line treatments for bipolar depression. First-line options in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder are lithium, lamotrigine, valproate and olanzapine. Historical and symptom profiles help with treatment selection. With the growing recognition of bipolar II disorders, it is anticipated that a larger body of evidence will become available to guide treatment of this common and disabling condition. These guidelines also discuss issues related to bipolar disorder in women and those with comorbidity and include a section on safety and monitoring.

14.2. Bipolar Disorder

Adults The effectiveness of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. Trial 1 enrolled patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV and Trial 2 included patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) episode of mania or hypomania as defined by DSM-IV. Both trials included a cohort of patients (30% of 404 subjects in trial 1 and 28% of 171 patients in Trial 2) with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (4 to 6 episodes per year).

In both trials, patients were titrated to a target dose of 200 mg of lamotrigine, as add-on therapy or as monotherapy, with gradual withdrawal of any psychotropic medications during an 8- to 16-week open-label period. Overall 81% of 1,305 patients participating in the open-label period were receiving 1 or more other psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics (including olanzapine), valproate, or lithium, during titration of lamotrigine. Patients with a CGI-severity score of 3 or less maintained for at least 4 continuous weeks, including at least the final week on monotherapy with lamotrigine, were randomized to a placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period for up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was TIME (time to intervention for a mood episode or one that was emerging, time to discontinuation for either an adverse event that was judged to be related to bipolar disorder, or for lack of efficacy). The mood episode could be depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed episode.

5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

AEDs, including Lamotrigine Extended-Release Tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.

In Trial 1, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine, 50 mg/day (n = 50), lamotrigine 200 mg/day (n = 124), lamotrigine 400 mg/day (n = 47), or placebo (n = 121). Lamotrigine (200- and 400-mg/day treatment groups combined) was superior to placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 1). Separate analyses of the 200- and 400- mg/day dose groups revealed no added benefit from the higher dose.

In Trial 2, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day, n = 59), or placebo (n = 70). Lamotrigine was superior to placebo in delaying time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 2). The mean dose of lamotrigine was about 211 mg/day.

Although these trials were not designed to separately evaluate time to the occurrence of depression or mania, a combined analysis for the 2 trials revealed a statistically significant benefit for lamotrigine over placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of both depression and mania, although the finding was more robust for depression.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for acute bipolar depression in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114nPjRg]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Background

Bipolar depression constitutes a major public health problem due to its substantial burden of disease. Although pharmacological interventions are available, guidelines required updated evidence synthesis to improve their current recommendations. In order to inform evidence-based prescribing, we investigated the comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for acute bipolar depression.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions with each other or placebo in adults with acute bipolar depression (type I, type II, or not otherwise specified), excluding those with substance misuse, unipolar depression, or schizophrenia, in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, and LILACS from database inception up to April 13, 2023. Criteria for eligibility were a duration of 2–16 weeks with masked outcome assessments, and we included combination, add-on design, and monotherapy studies. The co-primary outcomes were depressive symptoms, examined with standardised mean differences (SMDs), and manic switch, examined with odds ratios (ORs). We also investigated dropouts due to any reason, inefficacy, adverse events, and important side-effects as secondary outcomes. The confidence in the evidence was evaluated using Confidence-In-Network-Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020171726.

Results

We analysed data from 101 randomised controlled trials covering 20081 participants, 8063 men (41.7%) and 11263 women (58.3%; sex not available in four studies), mean age 41.0 years (range of means 28.7–53.6 years), and 68 medications and placebo. Ethnicity data were not available. With moderate confidence in the evidence, olanzapine plus fluoxetine, quetiapine, olanzapine, lurasidone, lumateperone, cariprazine, and lamotrigine were more efficacious than placebo in reducing depressive symptoms, with SMDs ranging from 0.41 (95% CI 0.19–0.64) for olanzapine plus fluoxetine to 0.16 (0.03–0.29) for lamotrigine. Several other drugs might also be efficacious, but the confidence in the evidence was very low to low. Antidepressants as a class seem to be efficacious, but had a higher risk for manic switch compared to antipsychotics. Medications differed in their side-effect profiles.

Interpretation

This is, to our knowledge, the largest network meta-analysis of pharmacotherapy for bipolar depression to date. Olanzapine plus fluoxetine, quetiapine, olanzapine, lurasidone, lumateperone, cariprazine, and lamotrigine were found to be more efficacious than placebo in adults with acute bipolar depression, with good confidence in the evidence, and to differ in their side-effect profiles. These findings can inform evidence-based care and the development of treatment guidelines internationally.

5.4. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation

AEDs, including lamotrigine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.
