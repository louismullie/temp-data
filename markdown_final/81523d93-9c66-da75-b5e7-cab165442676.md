tmj syndrome

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome, specifically seeking a synthesis of its definition, prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and evidence-based management, with explicit self-verification and citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and scope. Then, I should verify epidemiology and natural history. Next, I will examine etiologic factors and classification. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including when to image. Then, I will review the strength of evidence for conservative, pharmacologic, and invasive therapies. Finally, I should consider special populations, prognosis, and synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misframe the problem. "TMJ syndrome" is best encompassed by temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), a heterogeneous group of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions involving the TMJ, masticatory muscles, and associated structures, with pain and dysfunction as core features [^94b32cd8] [^9b23093c].

> I need to verify prevalence and burden. TMD affects roughly 5–12% of adults, with a female predominance and peak incidence in early adulthood; importantly, signs are common in the general population, but only a minority report symptoms or seek care, and many cases improve spontaneously over time, which shapes a conservative-first approach [^44243b2c] [^94b32cd8] [^0358d904].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes; I should review etiology carefully. TMD is multifactorial, with biologic, psychosocial, and behavioral contributors; common drivers include bruxism, stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, and systemic or local inflammatory disease, and many patients exhibit central sensitization and pain amplification, reinforcing the need for biopsychosocial care [^94b32cd8] [^9b23093c] [^4578ed59].

> Next, I should review classification to guide treatment. TMDs are broadly categorized as myogenous (muscle pain/dysfunction), arthrogenous (joint-centric, including disc displacement and degenerative or inflammatory arthritis), or mixed; this distinction helps align therapies to pain generators and functional deficits [^94b32cd8] [^9b23093c].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, grounded in history and examination focused on pain location, jaw movement, joint sounds, and masticatory muscle tenderness; imaging is reserved for refractory cases, diagnostic uncertainty, or suspected structural disease, with MRI preferred for soft tissue and disc pathology and CT/CBCT for bony assessment, while plain radiographs add little value in routine care [^94b32cd8] [^06cf26b3] [^dcb083ec].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for conservative therapies because this drives first-line care. High-quality guidance supports strong recommendations for CBT with biofeedback or relaxation, therapist-assisted mobilization, manual trigger point therapy, supervised jaw exercises and stretching, and usual care (education, home exercises, reassurance); these movement- and coping-focused interventions yield clinically meaningful pain reductions and functional gains, whereas many other modalities have low or very low certainty evidence [^7ff6b177] [^9df713cd].

> I should double-check pharmacologic evidence before recommending drugs. NSAIDs can help acute inflammatory flares but evidence for chronic TMD pain is limited and mixed; muscle relaxants may be used short term; tricyclics and gabapentin are reasonable for chronic pain with sleep or neuropathic features; benzodiazepines are generally discouraged; overall, pharmacotherapy should be adjunctive and time-limited, with careful attention to risks and comorbidities [^d546eaba] [^0a1a039a] [^94b32cd8].

> Let me consider occlusal splints carefully, since they are commonly used. The most recent high-quality review concludes there is very low certainty evidence; stabilization splints may reduce muscle pain versus no treatment in some contexts, but effects are modest and often indistinguishable from placebo, so splints can be considered reversible and low-risk, but should not be overpromised [^5f03f7af] [^673c8aaa].

> I need to check minimally invasive procedures. Arthrocentesis/lavage with or without corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid may help selected refractory cases with internal derangement or inflammatory effusions, but evidence is heterogeneous and generally low certainty; PRP shows promise in small studies but requires more robust trials; botulinum toxin to masticatory muscles has conflicting evidence and should be reserved for carefully selected patients after conservative care fails [^9dc424e3] [^ad2c9bd3] [^4515b89b].

> But wait, what if the patient has juvenile idiopathic arthritis–related TMJ disease? I should confirm pediatric-specific guidance. In children with active TMJ arthritis, early and often aggressive systemic therapy is recommended, with NSAIDs and/or intra-articular glucocorticoids as initial options and rapid escalation to biologic DMARDs if response is inadequate; intra-articular steroids are not first-line in skeletally immature patients due to potential harm, and interdisciplinary care is essential to monitor growth and dentofacial development [^b191c3c5] [^373dd5ed] [^689af8db].

> I should review prognosis and risk stratification. High pain intensity, chronicity, psychosocial distress, and comorbid pain syndromes predict poorer outcomes; interdisciplinary programs and treat-to-target strategies improve care coordination, and many patients improve over time, though a subset develop persistent pain requiring multimodal, longitudinal management [^4578ed59] [^2bf9f673] [^0358d904].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. Start with education, jaw hygiene, soft diet, and home exercises; add CBT-based coping and supervised physical therapy; use NSAIDs short term for acute pain; consider a reversible stabilization splint if bruxism or parafunction is prominent; reassess at 6–8 weeks and escalate to trigger point/manual therapy, pharmacologic adjuncts, or minimally invasive procedures if refractory; reserve surgery for confirmed structural pathology unresponsive to conservative care, ideally in specialized centers [^7ff6b177] [^94b32cd8] [^46bf33c1].

> Hold on, I should verify that I've addressed key controversies and uncertainties. Evidence quality varies widely across modalities, many recommendations are conditional, and shared decision-making is crucial; patients should be counseled that most TMDs improve with conservative care, that splints are optional and may work via placebo mechanisms, and that invasive treatments carry uncertain benefit and potential harms, reinforcing a conservative-first stance [^7ff6b177] [^5f03f7af] [^9df713cd].

TMJ syndrome, or temporomandibular disorder (TMD), is a **multifactorial condition** characterized by jaw pain, joint noises, and limited mouth opening, often with earache, headache, or facial pain [^94b32cd8] [^9b23093c]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with imaging reserved for refractory or unclear cases [^06cf26b3] [^dcb083ec]. Most patients improve with **conservative care** — patient education, soft diet, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, occlusal splints, and physical therapy — while surgery is reserved for refractory cases with structural disease [^7ff6b177] [^94b32cd8]. Prognosis is generally favorable, but symptoms may persist or recur, especially with psychosocial stressors or parafunctional habits [^0358d904] [^4578ed59].

---

## Clinical presentation

TMJ syndrome presents with a **characteristic symptom complex**:

- **Pain**: Jaw pain, preauricular pain, facial pain, earache, headache, and neck/shoulder pain [^94b32cd8] [^9b23093c].
- **Joint sounds**: Clicking, popping, or grating during jaw movement [^94b32cd8] [^9b23093c].
- **Functional impairment**: Limited mouth opening, jaw locking, deviation on opening, and difficulty chewing [^94b32cd8] [^9b23093c].
- **Associated symptoms**: Tinnitus, dizziness, and otalgia [^44243b2c].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

TMJ syndrome is **multifactorial**, with contributing factors including:

- **Muscle hyperactivity**: Bruxism, clenching, and stress-related muscle tension [^94b32cd8] [^18b74032].
- **Joint pathology**: Disc displacement, osteoarthritis, and inflammatory arthritis [^06cf26b3] [^dcb083ec].
- **Trauma**: Direct injury or chronic microtrauma [^notfound].
- **Psychosocial factors**: Anxiety, depression, and stress [^94b32cd8] [^4578ed59].
- **Structural abnormalities**: Malocclusion and dentofacial deformities [^94b32cd8] [^ee2a68a2].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on history and examination:

- **History**: Characterize pain, joint sounds, functional limitations, and psychosocial factors [^94b32cd8] [^9b23093c].
- **Physical examination**: Palpate TMJs and masticatory muscles, assess mandibular range of motion, and evaluate occlusion [^94b32cd8] [^b7024e4c].
- **Imaging**: Reserve MRI for refractory cases, suspected internal derangement, or when diagnosis is uncertain; CT for bony pathology [^06cf26b3] [^dcb083ec].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **conservative-first**, with escalation only as needed:

| **Treatment modality** | **Indications** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Patient education, self-care, soft diet | First-line for all patients | Strong recommendation [^7ff6b177] |
| NSAIDs, muscle relaxants | Acute pain, inflammation | Conditional recommendation [^7ff6b177] [^d546eaba] |
| Occlusal splints | Bruxism, muscle pain | Conditional recommendation [^7ff6b177] [^5f03f7af] |
| Physical therapy, jaw exercises | Chronic pain, limited motion | Strong recommendation [^7ff6b177] [^6e893ef2] |
| Cognitive behavioral therapy | Chronic pain, psychosocial distress | Strong recommendation [^7ff6b177] [^60cf9da2] |
| Intra-articular injections (corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid) | Refractory inflammatory or degenerative disease | Conditional recommendation [^7ff6b177] [^9dc424e3] |
| Surgery (arthroscopy, arthroplasty) | Refractory cases with structural disease | Reserved for severe, refractory cases [^7ff6b177] [^46bf33c1] |

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable**; most patients improve with conservative care, though symptoms may persist or recur, particularly with ongoing psychosocial stressors or parafunctional habits [^0358d904] [^4578ed59]. Chronic TMD can significantly impact quality of life, necessitating multidisciplinary care [^9b23093c] [^4578ed59].

---

TMJ syndrome is a common, multifactorial disorder presenting with jaw pain, joint sounds, and limited function; **conservative management is effective** for most, with imaging and surgery reserved for refractory or structural cases.

### Evaluation of the patient for temporomandibular joint surgery [^5f1cc10d]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery is the preferred treatment for tumors, neoplasms, and selected injuries and infections of the TMJ. It is also an appropriate and effective treatment for subsets of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) that are characterized by mechanical disruption of joint function. Careful and systematic clinical evaluation and imaging is required to determine if painful TMD with altered range of motion is amenable to surgery of the TMJ. This article offers a rational approach to evaluation of patients for TMJ surgery.

### Interventions for the management of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis [^9dc424e3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and can often lead to severe pain in the orofacial region. Management options for TMJ OA include reassurance, occlusal appliances, physical therapy, medication in addition to several surgical modalities.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of different surgical and non-surgical therapeutic options for the management of TMJ OA in adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 26 September 2011); CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3); MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 26 September 2011); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 26 September 2011); and PEDro (1929 to 26 September 2011). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any form of non-surgical or surgical therapy for TMJ OA in adults over the age of 18 with clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of TMJ OA according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) guideline or compatible criteria. Primary outcomes considered were pain/tenderness/discomfort in the TMJs or jaw muscles, self assessed range of mandibular movement and TMJ sounds. Secondary outcomes included the measurement of quality of life or patient satisfaction evaluated with a validated questionnaire, morphological changes of the TMJs assessed by imaging, TMJ sounds assessed by auscultation and any adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened and extracted information and data from, and independently assessed the risk of bias in the included trials.

Main Results

Although three RCTs were included in this review, pooling of data in a meta-analysis was not possible due to wide clinical diversity between the studies. The reports indicate a not dissimilar degree of effectiveness with intra-articular injections consisting of either sodium hyaluronate or corticosteroid preparations, and an equivalent pain reduction with diclofenac sodium as compared with occlusal splints. Glucosamine appeared to be just as effective as ibuprofen for the management of TMJ OA.

Authors' Conclusions

In view of the paucity of high level evidence for the effectiveness of interventions for the management of TMJ OA, small parallel group RCTs which include participants with a clear diagnosis of TMJ OA should be encouraged and especially studies evaluating some of the possible surgical interventions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders [^94b32cd8]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a heterogeneous group of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions involving the temporomandibular joint complex, and surrounding musculature and osseous components. TMD affects up to 15% of adults, with a peak incidence at 20 to 40 years of age. TMD is classified as intra-articular or extra-articular. Common symptoms include jaw pain or dysfunction, earache, headache, and facial pain. The etiology of TMD is multifactorial and includes biologic, environmental, social, emotional, and cognitive triggers. Diagnosis is most often based on history and physical examination. Diagnostic imaging may be beneficial when malocclusion or intra-articular abnormalities are suspected. Most patients improve with a combination of noninvasive therapies, including patient education, self-care, cognitive behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and occlusal devices. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants are recommended initially, and benzodiazepines or antidepressants may be added for chronic cases. Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is indicated for refractory cases.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^dbd49a16]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Management of TMD

A suitable therapeutic approach for TMD should be aimed at alleviating the main signs and symptoms of this condition. The most relevant signs of TMD are the presence of joint sounds (clicking and crepitation), reduced mouth opening, and disrupted jaw movements. However, pain is the primary problem of this pathology, and it is typically the reason these patients request medical care. Also, it is likely the reason that most studies have been aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of various intervention measures related to pain as the main variable.

Conservative treatments for TMD include medication, physiotherapy, occlusal splints, self-management strategies, and interventions based on cognitive behavioral approaches.–At present, a conservative treatment approach prevails over surgery, given it is less aggressive and usually results in satisfactory clinical outcomes in mild–moderate TMD.–In fact, the evidence for the greatest effectiveness of surgical versus conservative intervention to reduce short-term pain in arthrogenic TMD is controversial and inconclusive.–Indications for the application of each of the interventions, as well as their potential effects for the treatment of patients with TMD, are described in the following sections.

### Orthodontics for treating temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders [^dca35322]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) relate to discomfort of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The disorder is multifactorial with a degree of psychogenic influence varying throughout an individual's life with phases of symptoms affecting the quality of life. In an attempt to treat this complex group of disorders many treatment modalities have been identified some of which are also considered in other Cochrane reviews. The disorder also has a normal cycle of events appearing to spontaneously improve without treatment.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness of orthodontic intervention in reducing symptoms in patients with TMD (compared with any control group receiving no treatment, placebo treatment or reassurance) and to establish if active orthodontic intervention leads to TMD.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Handsearching of orthodontic journals and other related journals was undertaken in keeping with the Cochrane Collaboration handsearching programme. No language restrictions were applied. Authors of any studies were identified, as were experts offering legal advice, and contacted to identify unpublished trials. Most recent search: 13th April 2010.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including quasi-randomised trials assessing orthodontic treatment for TMD were included. Studies with adults aged equal to or above 18 years old with clinically diagnosed TMD were included. There were no age restrictions for prevention trials provided the follow-up period extended into adulthood. The inclusion criteria required reports to state their diagnostic criteria for TMD at the start of treatment and for participants to exhibit two or more of the signs and/or symptoms. The treatment group included treatment with appliances that could induce stable orthodontic tooth movement. Patients receiving splints for 8 to 12 weeks and studies involving surgical intervention (direct exploration/surgery of the joint and/or orthognathic surgery to correct an abnormality of the underlying skeletal pattern) were excluded. The outcomes were: how well were the symptoms reduced, adverse effects on oral health and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in triplicate and independently by three review authors. As no two studies compared the same treatment strategies (interventions) it was not possible to combine the results of any studies.

Main Results

The searches identified 284 records from all databases. Initial screening of the abstracts and titles by all review authors identified 55 articles which related to orthodontic treatment and TMD. The full articles were then retrieved and of these articles only four demonstrated any data that might be of value with respect to TMD and orthodontics. After further analysis of the full texts of the four studies identified, none of the retrieved studies met the inclusion criteria and all were excluded from this review.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient research data on which to base our clinical practice on the relationship of active orthodontic intervention and TMD. There is an urgent need for high quality randomised controlled trials in this area of orthodontic practice. When considering consent for patients it is essential to reflect the seemingly random development/alleviation of TMD signs and symptoms.

### Review of diagnosis and treatment of TMJ disorders… [^6d1ceb61]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Approximately 70 percent of adults have at least one sign of a temporomandibular joint disorder, but only 25 percent report symptoms and only about 5 percent seek medical intervention. Dimitroulis reviews the clinical features of TMJ and the role of conservative treatment measures. The most common type of TMJ disorder is myofascial pain and dysfunction, usually the result of bruxism or jaw clenching. These habits may be related to stress, anxiety, depression or chronic pain. Less commonly, TMJ is due to mechanical problems or osteoarthrosis. The three cardinal features of TMJ are orofacial pain, restricted jaw function and noise in the joint. Patients may also report pain in the ear, neck and shoulder, tinnitus and generalized headaches, as well as stress-related symptoms, especially insomnia. Jaw movement is usually described as "a tightness. "Patientswho describe the jaw suddenly "sticking" or "catching" usually have mechanical dysfunction of the joint.

A classic presentation is pain in front of the tragus, with radiation to the ear, lower jaw, cheek and temple. Pain is usually worse in the morning and may occur in cyclical episodes. Patients may also report clicking or grating sounds during chewing and progressive limitation of mouth opening. Conservative therapy is effective in over 80 percent of cases. It is essential to thoroughly explain the condition and educate the patient about it. Patients should be advised to identify and address sources of stress and to modify chewing and other habits that cause excessive jaw movement. Massage, application of local moist heat and exercises are all important recommendations. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are useful if pain is due to synovitis or myositis. Low dosages of tricyclic antidepressants or tranquilizers have been used to reduce stress if this is a significant contributor to TMJ syndrome. All drugs should be prescribed in a specified regimen for a defined period of time.

The use of "as-needed" medications is unlikely to be successful and may lead to dependency or overuse. Occlusal dental devices are commonly prescribed for TMJ and are reported to alleviate symptoms in over 70 percent of patients. In selected patients, physical therapy, behavioral therapy or psychotherapy may be indicated. Surgical intervention is usually required in fewer than 5 percent of patients with TMJ disorders.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^ad2c9bd3]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Surgical interventions

Among the surgical options, two of the most frequently used techniques for internal derangements of the TMJ or degenerative pathology are arthrocentesis based on articular lavage with or without injection of pharmaceuticals and arthroscopy. There are no differences regarding pain and mandibular function when comparing arthroscopy with arthrocentesis;, however, there is a lack of evidence to support arthrocentesis as a better therapeutic intervention than nonsurgical interventions. For internal derangement of the TMJ, medical management or rehabilitation is recommended over other surgical options; patients with symptomatic disk displacement without reduction should be treated with the simplest and least invasive intervention. Furthermore, there is growing evidence supporting the benefit of platelet-rich plasma injections over hyaluronate combined with arthrocentesis for TMJ osteoarthritis; however, more clinical trials are needed.–

### Temporomandibular joint disorders [^683a71bd]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular joint disorders are common in adults; as many as one third of adults report having one or more symptoms, which include jaw or neck pain, headache, and clicking or grating within the joint. Most symptoms improve without treatment, but various noninvasive therapies may reduce pain for patients who have not experienced relief from self-care therapies. Physical therapy modalities (e.g., iontophoresis, phonophoresis), psychological therapies (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy), relaxation techniques, and complementary therapies (e.g., acupuncture, hypnosis) are all used for the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders; however, no therapies have been shown to be uniformly superior for the treatment of pain or oral dysfunction. Noninvasive therapies should be attempted before pursuing invasive, permanent, or semi-permanent treatments that have the potential to cause irreparable harm. Dental occlusion therapy (e.g., oral splinting) is a common treatment for temporomandibular joint disorders, but a recent systematic review found insufficient evidence for or against its use. Some patients with intractable temporomandibular joint disorders develop chronic pain syndrome and may benefit from treatment, including antidepressants or cognitive behavior therapy.

### Temporomandibular disorders: old ideas and new concepts [^9b23093c]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Background Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is an umbrella term for pain and dysfunction involving the masticatory muscles and the temporomandibular joints (TMJs). TMD is the most common orofacial pain condition. Its prominent features include regional pain in the face and preauricular area, limitations in jaw movement, and noise from the TMJs during jaw movements. TMD affects up to 15% of adults and 7% of adolescents. Chronic pain is the overwhelming reason that patients with TMD seek treatment. TMD can associate with impaired general health, depression, and other psychological disabilities, and may affect the quality of life of the patient. Assessment Evaluations indicate that the recently published Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (DC/TMD) are reliable and valid. These criteria cover the most common types of TMD, which include pain-related disorders (e.g., myalgia, headache attributable to TMD, and arthralgia) as well as disorders associated with the TMJ (primarily disc displacements and degenerative disease). As peripheral mechanisms most likely play a role in the onset of TMD, a detailed muscle examination is recommended. The persistence of pain involves more central factors, such as sensitization of the supraspinal neurons and second-order neurons at the level of the spinal dorsal horn/trigeminal nucleus, imbalanced antinociceptive activity, and strong genetic predisposition, which also is included in DC/TMD. Conclusion The etiology is complex and still not clearly understood, but several biological and psychosocial risk factors for TMD have been identified. Several studies indicate that patients with TMD improve with a combination of noninvasive therapies, including behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and occlusal appliances. More stringently designed studies, however, are needed to assess treatment efficacy and how to tailor treatment to the individual patient.

### Temporomandibular disorder treatment algorithm for otolaryngologists [^d71955d5]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review current literature describing the management of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and to propose an evidence-based algorithm for otolaryngologists.

Data Sources

A literature review using PubMed and Scopus was conducted to identify manuscripts that describe TMJ disorder etiology, diagnostic methods, and management across the fields of otolaryngology, general practice medicine, physical therapy, dentistry, and maxillofacial surgery.

Review Methods

Two reviewers subjectively evaluated the studies based on the inclusion criteria, incorporating them into a comprehensive algorithm.

Conclusions

TMD is one of the most common conditions presenting to otolaryngology outpatient clinics. Etiologies of TMD vary widely, including myofascial, intraarticular, neurologic, traumatic, or psychiatric in origin. When conservative measures fail to produce symptom relief, alternative treatments and referral to outside specialists including psychiatry, physical therapy, dentistry, and maxillofacial surgery may be indicated. Premature or inappropriate referrals may lead to patients suffering TMD for extended periods of time, with alternating referrals between various specialists. Thus, we present a TMD treatment algorithm for otolaryngologists to aid in the decision-making process in managing TMD.

Implications For Practice

Patients frequently present to otolaryngology outpatient clinics for symptoms of TMD. Multidisciplinary practice may be necessary to effectively treat TMD of varying etiology and severity. Following conservative treatment, appropriate referrals and treatment plans will reduce ineffective use of resources, deferral of treatment, and patient suffering. For this reason, a comprehensive algorithm for otolaryngologists will improve resource utilization and efficiency of treatment to ultimately provide improved treatment outcomes for patients.

### Temporomandibular disorders clinical and anatomical outcomes after fat-derived stem cells injection [^fa7de618]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common disorders that usually involve temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory muscles, and other relevant structures. The symptoms may vary limiting the patients' quality of life. Many treatment options were proposed during the last years with the aim to treat the pathology. In this article, we analyze the effect of the injection of the fat-derived stem cell in the joint as a new treatment option.

### Condylar resorption of the temporomandibular joint: how do we treat it? [^cb8f579f]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Condylar resorption (CR) is a common sequela of some temporomandibular joint (TMJ) abnormalities. CR can result in jaw deformities and dysfunction, malocclusion, pain, headaches, and airway obstruction. Most cases can be classified into 1 of 4 categories based on cause: (1) adolescent internal CR; (2) reactive (inflammatory) arthritis; (3) autoimmune and connective tissue diseases; and (4) other end-stage TMJ pathologic abnormality. MRI is helpful in differentiating the cause and defining treatment options. This article presents the nature and progression of the different TMJ CR pathologic abnormalities, clinical and imaging characteristics, and treatment options to produce predictable and stable outcomes.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: therapeutic approaches for oligoarthritis, temporomandibular joint arthritis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^a859c512]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). High credibility.

2021 American College of Rheumatology juvenile idiopathic arthritis guideline — scope, methods, and evidence quality are as follows: Pharmacologic management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) focuses on oligoarthritis, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis, and systemic JIA with and without macrophage activation syndrome, and includes recommendations regarding tapering and discontinuing treatment in inactive systemic JIA. Clinically relevant Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes questions were developed; after a systematic literature review, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to rate the quality of evidence, and a Voting Panel including clinicians and patients/caregivers achieved consensus on recommendation direction and strength. Recommendations are based on clinical phenotypes rather than a specific classification schema; evidence for all recommendations was graded as low or very low in quality, and more than half of the recommendations are conditional.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: therapeutic approaches for oligoarthritis, temporomandibular joint arthritis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^5f33ab13]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide updated guidelines for pharmacologic management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), focusing on treatment of oligoarthritis, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis, and systemic JIA with and without macrophage activation syndrome. Recommendations regarding tapering and discontinuing treatment in inactive systemic JIA are also provided.

Methods

We developed clinically relevant Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes questions. After conducting a systematic literature review, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to rate the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low). A Voting Panel including clinicians and patients/caregivers achieved consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations.

Results

Similar to those published in 2019, these JIA recommendations are based on clinical phenotypes of JIA, rather than a specific classification schema. This guideline provides recommendations for initial and subsequent treatment of JIA with oligoarthritis, TMJ arthritis, and systemic JIA as well as for tapering and discontinuing treatment in subjects with inactive systemic JIA. Other aspects of disease management, including factors that influence treatment choice and medication tapering, are discussed. Evidence for all recommendations was graded as low or very low in quality. For that reason, more than half of the recommendations are conditional.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline complements the 2019 American College of Rheumatology JIA and uveitis guidelines, which addressed polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, enthesitis, and uveitis. It serves as a tool to support clinicians, patients, and caregivers in decision-making. The recommendations take into consideration the severity of both articular and nonarticular manifestations as well as patient quality of life. Although evidence is generally low quality and many recommendations are conditional, the inclusion of caregivers and patients in the decision-making process strengthens the relevance and applicability of the guideline. It is important to remember that these are recommendations. Clinical decisions, as always, should be made by the treating clinician and patient/caregiver.

### Pharmacologic treatment for temporomandibular and temporomandibular joint disorders [^0a1a039a]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular joint disorder is defined by pain and/or loss of function of the temporomandibular joint and its associated muscles and structures. Treatments include noninvasive pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive muscular and articular injections, and surgery. Conservative therapies include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. Minimally invasive injections include botulinum toxin, corticosteroids, platelet-rich plasma, hyaluronic acid, and prolotherapy with hypertonic glucose. With many pharmacologic treatment options and modalities available to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon, mild to moderate temporomandibular joint disorder can be managed safely and effectively to improve symptoms of pain and function of the temporomandibular joint.

### Management of chronic pain associated with temporomandibular disorders: a clinical practice guideline [^7ff6b177]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the comparative effectiveness of available therapies for chronic pain associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMD)?

Current Practice

TMD are the second most common musculoskeletal chronic pain disorder after low back pain, affecting 6–9% of adults globally. TMD are associated with pain affecting the jaw and associated structures and may present with headaches, earache, clicking, popping, or crackling sounds in the temporomandibular joint, and impaired mandibular function. Current clinical practice guidelines are largely consensus-based and provide inconsistent recommendations.

Recommendations

For patients living with chronic pain (≥ 3 months) associated with TMD, and compared with placebo or sham procedures, the guideline panel issued: (1) strong recommendations in favour of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with or without biofeedback or relaxation therapy, therapist-assisted mobilisation, manual trigger point therapy, supervised postural exercise, supervised jaw exercise and stretching with or without manual trigger point therapy, and usual care (such as home exercises, stretching, reassurance, and education); (2) conditional recommendations in favour of manipulation, supervised jaw exercise with mobilisation, CBT with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), manipulation with postural exercise, and acupuncture; (3) conditional recommendations against reversible occlusal splints (alone or in combination with other interventions), arthrocentesis (alone or in combination with other interventions), cartilage supplement with or without hyaluronic acid injection, low level laser therapy (alone or in combination with other interventions), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, gabapentin, botulinum toxin injection, hyaluronic acid injection, relaxation therapy, trigger point injection, acetaminophen (with or without muscle relaxants or NSAIDS), topical capsaicin, biofeedback, corticosteroid injection (with or without NSAIDS), benzodiazepines, and β blockers; and (4) strong recommendations against irreversible oral splints, discectomy, and NSAIDS with opioids.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international guideline development panel including patients, clinicians with content expertise, and methodologists produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. The panel approached the formulation of recommendations from the perspective of patients, rather than a population or health system perspective.

The Evidence

Recommendations are informed by a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis summarising the current body of evidence for benefits and harms of conservative, pharmacologic, and invasive interventions for chronic pain secondary to TMD.

Understanding The Recommendation

These recommendations apply to patients living with chronic pain (≥ 3 months duration) associated with TMD as a group of conditions, and do not apply to the management of acute TMD pain. When considering management options, clinicians and patients should first consider strongly recommended interventions, then those conditionally recommended in favour, then conditionally against. In doing so, shared decision making is essential to ensure patients make choices that reflect their values and preference, availability of interventions, and what they may have already tried. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future.

### Nonsurgical management of pediatric temporomandibular joint dysfunction [^7a3b9b3a]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a subgroup of craniofacial pain problems involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory muscles, and associated head and neck musculoskeletal structures. These disorders are subclassified into TMJ articular disorders and masticatory muscle disorders. Patients with TMD most commonly present with pain, restricted or asymmetric mandibular motion, and TMJ sounds during mandibular movements. The prevalence tends to increase with age. Management of TMJ articular disorders consists of a combination of patient education, home-care plan, biobehavioral therapy, physical therapy, orthotic jaw appliance therapy, pharmacotherapy, and/or surgery. The goal is to increase function, reduce pain, and improve quality of life.

### Animal models of temporomandibular disorder [^ddc60272]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a group of diseases involving the masticatory muscles, temporomandibular joint (TMJ), associated structures, and are characterized by orofacial pain, joint sounds and restricted mandibular movement. TMD is one of the major causes of non-dental pain in the orofacial region. Besides, TMD commonly occurs in young and middle-aged people, with the highest prevalence and consultation rate at the age of 20–30 years. Additionally, TMD has a higher prevalence in women, especially those in childbearing age. It has been shown that the prevalence of TMD varies from 21.1% to 73.3%, and painful signs or symptoms range from 3.4% to 65.7%, while the frequency of non-painful TMD signs or symptoms varies from 3.1% to 40.8%. However, TMD is poorly managed in the dental clinical practice due to the multifactorial etiology and complicated clinical manifestations, yet the effective mechanism-based therapy for TMD is still under investigation.

### Temporomandibular joint syndrome from an ear versus dental-related standpoint [^00ca4d80]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a prominent reason for visits to medical providers. The presentation of headaches within this population remains a challenging diagnosis, given the prevalence and overlap of symptomatology of both conditions. The literature demonstrates an undeniable association between headaches and TMD. Regardless of causality and etiology, the literature supports that prompt diagnosis and treatment results in improvement or resolution of symptoms, including headaches. Treatment of TMD headaches should begin with conservative measures, including medical management with NSAIDs, heat therapy, and muscle-stretching exercises.

### Nonsurgical treatment as an adjunct to surgery [^b2d6c7ea]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Although some temporomandibular joint problems require surgical intervention, nonsurgical modalities are essential in the treatment of most joint afflictions, including internal derangements, inflammatory conditions, and arthritides. These approaches are crucial for presurgical management of these conditions and are an important adjunct in postsurgical care.

Therapeutics of TMD

Currently, despite a large number of patients suffer from TMD, the clinical treatments for these patients are largely insufficient since the etiology and pathogenesis of this condition are poorly understood. Generally, treatments for TMD can be summarized into two aspects: conservative and surgical treatments. Medication, physiotherapy, occlusal splints, self-management strategies, and interventions based on cognitive behavioral approaches have been considered conservative treatments. Simultaneously, surgical treatments involve arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis, etc. Compared with surgical approaches, conservative treatments create satisfactory clinical outcomes without invasive damage, while they seem to be ineffective for some patients with severe symptoms. Therefore, the effective therapeutics for TMD is still controversial and urgently needed in the clinical practice, as well as the underlying mechanisms leading to TMD require further investigation.

### Bibliometric analysis of research on temporomandibular joint and occlusion from 2000 to 2022 [^75d980c1]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As one of the most complex joints in the human body, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) plays an important role in breathing, speaking, chewing and many other vital activities. However, many associated diseases would affect the normal physiological structures and functions of TMJ, the most prevalent among which are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). As the third most common oral illness in society, TMDs are considered a heterogeneous collection of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular diseases involving the TMJ, muscles of mastication and/or related issues. Nevertheless, many patients suffered from excessive or even detrimental therapy and high expense on account of lacking accurate diagnosis and treatment for TMDs. To date, the high complexity, high prevalence and high cost of TMDs have attracted numerous scholars to research on fields related to TMDs. The correct ways to diagnose and cure TMDs still need to be explored and clarified.

### Stabilisation splint therapy for temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome [^673c8aaa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Pain dysfunction syndrome (PDS) is the most common temporomandibular disorder (TMD). There are many synonyms for this condition including facial arthromylagia, TMJ dysfunction syndrome, myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome, craniomandibular dysfunction and myofacial pain dysfunction. The aetiology of PDS is multifactorial and many different therapies have been advocated.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness of stabilisation splint therapy in reducing symptoms in patients with pain dysfunction syndrome.

Search Strategy

Electronic databases (including the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2003; MEDLINE (1966 to June 2001); EMBASE (1966 to June 2001)) were searched. Handsearching of relevant journals was undertaken and reference lists of included studies screened. Experts in the field were contacted to identify unpublished articles. There was no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in which splint therapy was compared concurrently to no treatment, other occlusal appliances, or any other active intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently and in duplicate. Validity assessment of the included trials was carried out at the same time as data extraction. Discrepancies were discussed and a third reviewer consulted. The author of the primary study was contacted where necessary. The studies were grouped according to treatment type and duration of follow up.

Main Results

Twenty potentially relevant RCTs were identified. Eight trials were excluded leaving 12 RCTs for analysis. Stabilisation splint therapy was compared to: acupuncture, bite plates, biofeedback/stress management, visual feedback, relaxation, jaw exercises, non-occluding appliance and minimal/no treatment. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of stabilisation splint therapy (SS) in reducing symptoms in patients with pain dysfunction syndrome compared with other active treatments. There is weak evidence to suggest that the use of SS for the treatment of PDS may be beneficial for reducing pain severity, at rest and on palpation, when compared to no treatment.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of stabilisation splint therapy for the treatment of temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome. This review suggests the need for further, well conducted RCTs that pay attention to method of allocation, outcome assessment, large sample size, and enough duration of follow up. A standardisation of the outcomes of the treatment of PDS should be established in the RCTs.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^aa922103]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

This process generated 3 overarching principles and 12 recommendations pertaining to the 5 following domains: domain I (diagnosis); domain II (treatment of TMJ arthritis, defined as active TMJ inflammation); domain III (treatment of TMJ dysfunction and symptoms); domain IV (treatment of arthritis‐related dentofacial deformity); and domain V (other related aspects) (Table 3). A full reference list for articles supporting the generation of each of the 12 recommendations is available in the Supplementary Material on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at.

Table 3
Recommendations for the management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis and the related orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)

Level of evidence

The LoEs provided in the available literature with regard to support of these principles and recommendations varied, falling at either steps 2, 3, or 4 on the OCEBM level of evidence table (ranging from step 1 [highest LoE] to step 5 [lowest LoE]); in general, the LoEs were low. Hence, this proposal should be regarded as conditional where the voting panel finds that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, but the members of the panel appreciate that uncertainties exist related to resources, settings, and costs.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^09a536da]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Thanks to advances in neuroscience, biopsychosocial models for diagnostics and treatment (including physical, psychological, and pharmacological therapies) currently have more clinical support and scientific growth. At present, a conservative treatment approach prevails over surgery, given it is less aggressive and usually results in satisfactory clinical outcomes in mild–moderate temporomandibular disorder (TMD). The aim of this review is to evaluate the recent evidence, identify challenges, and propose solutions from a clinical point of view for patients with craniofacial pain and TMD. The treatment we propose is structured in a multi-modal approach based on a biobehavioral approach that includes medical, physiotherapeutic, psychological, and dental treatments. We also propose a new biobehavioral model regarding pain perception and motor behavior for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with painful TMD.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^0091bedc]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is common in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). TMJ arthritis can lead to orofacial symptoms, orofacial dysfunction, and dentofacial deformity with negative impact on quality of life. Management involves interdisciplinary collaboration. No current recommendations exist to guide clinical management. We undertook this study to develop consensus-based interdisciplinary recommendations for management of orofacial manifestations of JIA, and to create a future research agenda related to management of TMJ arthritis in children with JIA. Recommendations were developed using online surveying of relevant stakeholders, systematic literature review, evidence-informed generation of recommendations during 2 consensus meetings, and Delphi study iterations involving external experts. The process included disciplines involved in the care of orofacial manifestations of JIA: pediatric rheumatology, radiology, orthodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orofacial pain specialists, and pediatric dentistry. Recommendations were accepted if agreement was > 80% during a final Delphi study. Three overarching management principles and 12 recommendations for interdisciplinary management of orofacial manifestations of JIA were outlined. The 12 recommendations pertained to diagnosis (n = 4), treatment of TMJ arthritis (active TMJ inflammation) (n = 2), treatment of TMJ dysfunction and symptoms (n = 3), treatment of arthritis-related dentofacial deformity (n = 2), and other aspects related to JIA (n = 1). Additionally, a future interdisciplinary research agenda was developed. These are the first interdisciplinary recommendations to guide clinical management of TMJ JIA. The 3 overarching principles and 12 recommendations fill an important gap in current clinical practice. They emphasize the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management of orofacial manifestations of JIA.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: therapeutic approaches for oligoarthritis, temporomandibular joint arthritis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^ab644c5e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). High credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis guideline — scope and conclusions states that this clinical practice guideline complements the 2019 American College of Rheumatology JIA and uveitis guidelines, which addressed polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, enthesitis, and uveitis, and it serves as a tool to support clinicians, patients, and caregivers in decision-making. The recommendations take into consideration the severity of both articular and nonarticular manifestations as well as patient quality of life, and although evidence is generally low quality and many recommendations are conditional, the inclusion of caregivers and patients in the decision-making process strengthens the relevance and applicability of the guideline. It is important to remember that these are recommendations, and clinical decisions, as always, should be made by the treating clinician and patient/caregiver. Recommendations were intended to be complementary to the 2019 guidelines and are grouped based on disease phenotype and severity, not by specific classification criteria, reflecting decision-making in clinical practice, and the second part covers oligoarthritis, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis, systemic JIA, and JIA-associated macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), lung disease, growth, nutrition, immunizations, and psychosocial issues.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^0358d904]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

TMD

"TMD" defines a number of clinical problems that involve the masticatory musculature, the TMJ, and associated structures.TMD is considered to be a subclassification of musculoskeletal disordersand is the most prevalent condition for which patients seek treatment. The careful evaluation of these facial structures in conjunction with clinical symptoms is crucial in forming a proper differential diagnosis. The patient may present with jaw ache, earache, toothache, facial pain, and/or headache; however, the complaint may be as benign as general facial fullness or pressure. Treatment planning depend on various factors, including the chief complaint, medical history, presenting symptoms, examination, and diagnosis. In the past, TMD cases have sometimes been considered to be difficult to diagnose and problematic to treat; however, thanks to ongoing research in orofacial pain and pain management, clinicians are able to use a more standardized classification and better diagnostic and therapeutic methods to offer patients a wide range of treatment modalities with higher success rates.

Natural history and epidemiology of TMD

Most epidemiological studies clearly demonstrate that TMD symptoms are more commonly seen in women than in men, and that many symptoms seem to arise in adolescence or the early twenties and may continue intermittently, well into middle age; however, TMD symptomatology does get better with time, supporting a conservative management approach. In a study by Solberg et al,76% of subjects aged 18–25 years had one or more signs associated with TMD and 26% had at least one symptom associated with TMD. Of this group, only 10% had symptoms that were considered by the subjects to be severe enough to seek treatment. Rasmussenfound that most cases of a clicking TMJ did not evolve into an open or closed locking state. Rasmussen noted that, in the natural progression of internal derangement, acute TMD symptoms lasted a mean of 5.5 years and that, although joint noises generally did not disappear, most painful and disabling symptoms subsided in time. Similar results were shown by Könönen et al, who followed 128 Finnish adults over 9 years, in whom the incidence of clicking increased with age. None of the patients, however, developed locking. In a more recent study, the presence of degenerative joint disorders was found to be the discriminating factor in two different age subgroups: patients with a mean age range of 52 years presented a prevalence of crepitus, while patients with a mean age range of 38 years did not.

### Temporomandibular disorders: rapid evidence review [^44243b2c]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders affect between 5% and 12% of the population and present with symptoms such as headache, bruxism, pain at the temporomandibular joint, jaw popping or clicking, neck pain, tinnitus, dizziness, decreased hearing, and hyperacuity to sound. Common signs on physical examination include tenderness of the pterygoid muscles, temporomandibular joints, and temporalis muscles, and malocclusion of the jaw and crepitus. The diagnosis is based on history and physical examination; however, use of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is recommended if the diagnosis is in doubt. Nonpharmacologic therapy includes patient education (e.g., good sleep hygiene, soft food diet), cognitive behavior therapy, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclobenzaprine, tricyclic antidepressants, and gabapentin. Injections of the temporomandibular joints with sodium hyaluronate, platelet-rich plasma, and dextrose prolotherapy may be considered, but the evidence of benefit is weak. A referral to oral and maxillofacial surgery is indicated for refractory cases.

### Pharmacological interventions for pain in patients with temporomandibular disorders [^d546eaba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a group of disorders affecting the temporomandibular joints and the muscles of mastication. TMDs are treated with a wide range of drugs. The extent to which the use of these drugs is based upon evidence is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions both alone and in combination with non-pharmacological therapy in relieving pain in patients with chronic TMD.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (2 August 2010), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 2 August 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 2 August 2010) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1981 to 2 August 2010) were conducted. Reference lists of articles and previous reviews were scanned for relevant articles and authors were contacted for further information where appropriate.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which a pharmacological agent was compared with placebo for the management of pain in patients with TMD. Parenteral routes of administration were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Duplicate data extraction and assessment of risk of bias in included studies was performed.

Main Results

Eleven studies were included with a total of 496 participants. The primary outcome of most of the studies was pain. The risk of bias in the included studies was variable. Whilst four studies showed significant pain relief for the active treatment, three were of poor quality. Most adverse effects were mild to moderate in severity. Four studies reported withdrawals due to severe adverse reactions, but insufficient information was provided regarding the trial groups from which the withdrawals occurred. No meta-analysis was conducted due to lack of similarities across the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support or not support the effectiveness of the reported drugs for the management of pain due to TMD. There is a need for high quality RCTs to derive evidence of the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions to treat pain associated with TMD.

### Imaging of the temporomandibular joint [^06cf26b3]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders are common, especially in young to middle-aged women, and most settle with supportive treatment. Imaging is indicated for the small percentage of cases that do not respond to conservative management and when the diagnosis is no doubt. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a bilateral synovial articulation between the mandible and skull base. It has an intra-articular disc dividing the joint into superior and inferior compartments and the articular surfaces are lined with fibrocartilage. The normal imaging anatomy of the TMJ is described and illustrated. Different movements occur in each joint compartments: a hinge movement in the inferior joint space and translation or gliding in the superior joint space. Internal derangement is the commonest disorder affecting the TMJ and is most commonly due to disc displacement, followed by osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritides. The imaging findings, primarily on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), of internal derangement and less common disorders of the joint, are reviewed and illustrated. Optimal imaging protocols are discussed with detailed reporting guidelines.

### Results of a multinational survey regarding the diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^c7da2bb1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

TMJ arthritis is common among children with JIA. We surveyed 87 pediatric rheumatologists demonstrating a wide array of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for TMJ involvement in JIA. We are aware that as participation in the survey was voluntary it is likely that physicians more interested in TMJ involvement participated. Due to a lack of agreement in how to diagnose and treat TMJ arthritis in JIA as demonstrated in this survey, we believe that an expert opinion/consensus statement regarding TMJ arthritis in JIA will likely benefit patients worldwide.

### Management of chronic pain secondary to temporomandibular disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^9df713cd]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

We explored the comparative effectiveness of available therapies for chronic pain associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS were searched to May 2021, and again in January 2023.

Study Selection

Interventional RCTs that enrolled patients presenting with chronic pain associated with TMD.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers independently identified eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We captured all reported patient-important outcomes, including pain relief, physical functioning, emotional functioning, role functioning, social functioning, sleep quality, and adverse events. We conducted frequentist network meta-analyses to summarise the evidence and used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence and categorise interventions from most to least beneficial.

Results

233 trials proved eligible for review, of which 153-enrolling 8713 participants and exploring 59 interventions or combinations of interventions-were included in network meta-analyses. All subsequent effects refer to comparisons with placebo or sham procedures. Effects on pain for eight interventions were supported by high to moderate certainty evidence. The three therapies probably most effective for pain relief were cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) augmented with biofeedback or relaxation therapy (risk difference (RD) for achieving the minimally important difference (MID) in pain relief of 1cm on a 10cm visual analogue scale: 36% (95% CI 33 to 39)), therapist-assisted jaw mobilisation (RD 36% (95% CI 31 to 40)), and manual trigger point therapy (RD 32% (29 to 34)). Five interventions were less effective, yet more effective than placebo, showing RDs ranging between 23% and 30%: CBT, supervised postural exercise, supervised jaw exercise and stretching, supervised jaw exercise and stretching with manual trigger point therapy, and usual care (such as home exercises, self stretching, reassurance). Moderate certainty evidence showed four interventions probably improved physical functioning: supervised jaw exercise and stretching (RD for achieving the MID of 5 points on the short form-36 physical component summary score: 43% (95% CI 33 to 51)), manipulation (RD 43% (25 to 56)), acupuncture (RD 42% (33 to 50)), and supervised jaw exercise and mobilisation (RD 36% (19 to 51)). The evidence for pain relief or physical functioning among other interventions, and all evidence for adverse events, was low or very low certainty.

Conclusion

When restricted to moderate or high certainty evidence, interventions that promote coping and encourage movement and activity were found to be most effective for reducing chronic TMD pain.

Registration

Active temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis — treatment initiation principle states that treatment of TMJ arthritis is recommended regardless of presence of clinical symptoms, and while NSAIDs and/or intra-articular glucocorticoids (IAGCs) may suffice for some, rapid escalation to bDMARDs (potentially with csDMARDs) is often appropriate given disease impact and destructiveness; TMJ disease may be isolated or part of generalized arthritis.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^856d3736]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Tasks relevant to the management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) addressed by the working groups after the 2017 Rostock meeting *

The results of the working group were combined to guide the proposal of preliminary recommendations for diagnosis and management of TMJ arthritis. Three overarching consensus‐based principles were created. Additionally, specific preliminary recommendations were formulated for each of 5 relevant domains, including domains for diagnosis (domain I; n = 4), treatment of TMJ arthritis (domain II; n = 2), treatment of TMJ dysfunction and symptoms related to JIA (domain III; n = 3), treatment of arthritis‐related dentofacial deformity (domain IV; n = 2), and other orofacial aspects related to JIA (domain V; n = 1).

The preliminary recommendations were discussed at a subsequent task force meeting in Oslo, Norway in April 2018. The task force consisted of 17 participants representing 5 specialties (Figure 1). Subsequently, the overarching principles and provisional recommendations were refined using a task force–driven consensus process involving nominal group techniques and 2 Delphi iterations.

Following the Oslo meeting, external experts (n = 13) who were previously not involved in the process were invited to assess the content validity of the provisional recommendations. These experts were identified based on internationally recognized clinical expertise and general contribution to research and publications related to TMJ arthritis in JIA. The external experts were asked to comment on the provisional recommendations and suggest improvements. Feedback from this exercise was incorporated into the next round of recommendations.

As a final step, the participants from the Oslo meeting (n = 17) and the external experts (n = 13) formed a voting panel which completed 3 online Delphi iterations and agreed upon a final set of recommendations. Characteristics of the voting panel are in Figure 1. The members of the voting panel assessed the perceived strength of each recommendation (SoR) based on a visual analog scale (VAS) scale (0 = no SoR, 10 = great SoR). Recommendations receiving agreement from ≥ 80% of the voting panel members were accepted. The level of evidence (LoE) of each recommendation was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence‐Based Medicine (OCEBM) level of evidence table.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for active temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis are addressed as follows: A trial of scheduled NSAIDs is conditionally recommended as part of initial therapy for active TMJ arthritis, the initial NSAID trial should be brief due to potential adverse effects and limited efficacy (unless inactive disease is achieved), and voting panelists could not agree on the appropriate duration before escalation, with some preferring that NSAIDs be avoided altogether.

### Is hyaluronic acid injection effective for the treatment of temporomandibular joint disc displacement with reduction? [^39464c8b]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hyaluronic acid (HA) injections and occlusal splints have been suggested in the treatment of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) derangements, but no sufficient data are available from controlled clinical trials comparing HA injection with another treatment modality. This study compared the effectiveness of a single HA injection, a double HA injection, and splint therapy for the treatment of TMJ disc displacement with reduction (DDR).

Materials and Methods

A prospective clinical trial was designed. The study sample included patients with TMJ DDR. The primary predictor variable was treatment method. Patients were divided into 4 groups: control, single HA injection, double HA injection, and stabilization splint therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. The control group was self-selected. The primary outcome variable was pain at rest and during mastication. The secondary outcome variables were TMJ noise, quality of life, and level of jaw movements. Clinical symptoms and jaw movements were evaluated at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Descriptive, comparative, correlation, and multivariate analyses were conducted.

Results

The sample included 51 patients (66 TMJs) 18 to 48 years old. All treatment groups showed significant improvement compared with baseline values for pain, TMJ noise, quality of life, and maximum mouth opening (MMO) at 6-month follow-up (P < .05). However, the 2 HA injection groups indicated superior improvement for pain, MMO, and quality of life compared with the stabilization splint group (P < .05).

Conclusions

The results of this study showed that HA injection and stabilization splinting are acceptably successful treatment modalities to alleviate the clinical signs and symptoms of TMJ DDR.

### Bibliometric analysis of research on temporomandibular joint and occlusion from 2000 to 2022 [^4967259e]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Treatments for TMDs

Three of the most recent references with burst, Ohrbach R (2016), Pficer JK (2017) and Gil-Martinez A (2018) were all related to the diagnosis and treatments for TMDs.

The most cited reference related to the diagnosis and treatments for TMDs mentioned Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) and imaging for diagnosis, echoing two of the most recent keywords with burst, "diagnostic criteria" and "cone beam computed tomography".RDC/TMD is one of the most commonly used tools to classify, diagnose and evaluate TMDs. Based on the biopsychosocial model for TMDs, RDC/TMD system consists of two axes, of which one is for clinical symptoms and another is for psychosocial and disability factors. In 2014, an updated version of RDC/TMD, Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) was published. According to the presence or absence of pain and specific clinical findings, DC/TMD includes the twelve most common diagnoses of TMDs. For example, TMD patients with familiar and located pain in the masseter or temporalis upon the site of palpation could be diagnosed as local myalgia. After expansion, DC/TMD has become a more valid and evidence-based system for clinical practice. However, patients usually have several disorders and symptoms of pain-related disorders could vary in different individuals, which adds difficulty to the accurate diagnosis by DC/TMD. Also, DC/TMD showed low validity for diagnosing some types of disc displacements and degenerative joint diseases, where the imaging might be necessary as supplementary.

Evaluation of the muscles of mastication

The muscles of mastication should be palpated bilaterally for firmness and tenderness, utilizing approximately 2–3 lbs of pressure, or the amount of pressure needed to cause blanching of the fingernail. Upon muscular palpation, the patient should be asked to report the severity of the tenderness, pain referral to multiple sites or single-site pain localization, and replication of the chief complaint upon palpation. It may be pertinent to ask the patient about their use of analgesics prior to palpation in order to account for reduced symptoms upon examination.

Management of TMD

Most of the time, patients will visit the clinician when pain and dysfunction, such as limitation of opening, episodes of joint locking (open lock/TMJ subluxation), pain with mandibular function (chewing), facial pain, or headache are present.

The treatment goals for TMD are decreasing pain, restoring normal ROM, and restoring normal masticatory and jaw function. Many TMDs can be cyclical and self-limiting, with periods of complete remission of symptoms.

In the case of disc-condyle incoordinations, studies suggest that for some patients even though they may be progressive (for example, a disc displacement with reduction may progress to a disc displacement without reduction), they are self limiting, suggesting an adaptation of the condition and with no significant disability. It is very important to emphasize that patients have no recurrence of symptoms with the use of conservative, reversible treatments, thus conservative treatment is the modality that needs to be used at all times. Initial treatment should therefore stress a conservative and reversible approach. Primary treatment options include home care (self-care program), medical care (non-surgical care), and surgical care.

Oral and topical pharmacotherapy

The pharmacological treatment of the patients with TMD is usually empirical. Although several medications are typically prescribed for the treatment of TMD, many lack evidence for this specific pathology; however, they have proven their effects in other musculoskeletal conditions. The most commonly used drugs include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticoids, analgesics, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, opiates, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gabapentin, and lidocaine patches.–Some of these medications are used to treat the joint pain of the TMD, and others are more effective for treating muscle pain.

NSAIDs have proven their effect in reducing pain in the TMJ. One of the most frequently used NSAIDs is sodium diclofenac, which can reduce joint pain at a dose of 50 mg twice/thrice daily. Another NSAID used is naproxen sodium, which has been demonstrated to reduce joint pain compared with placebo. Significant differences have been shown after 3 weeks of treatment (500 mg twice a day), and a significant improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of TMD was obtained compared with celecoxib and placebo. Piroxicam 20 mg once a day for 10 days results in greater TMJ pain reduction at 30-day follow-up. Another substance not very well known but well tolerated is palmitoylethanolamide (300–1,200 mg daily up to 120 days), which appears to have an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in patients with TMD.

These results suggest that long-term treatment is needed to obtain the maximal effects of all these drugs, which sometimes become evident only after several weeks of treatment. NSAIDs have-well known adverse effects, however, such as exacerbation of hypertension, gastrointestinal effects ranging from dyspepsia to ulceration, and worsening of renal function, which makes analyzing the clinical situation of each patient extremely important to establish the best individual treatment.

A different approach to NSAID intake for avoiding its systemic absorption is its topical administration in creams or ointments over the TMJ to reduce pain. The application of four doses a day of topical diclofenac combined with dimethyl sulfoxide to improve its absorption is recommended. Topical diclofenac has been suggested to achieve local concentrations significant enough to inhibit proinflammatory prostaglandin E 2 production and also competitively inhibit the NMDA subtype of the glutamate receptor found in TMJ nociceptors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular disorders… [^b7024e4c]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Evaluation DIAGNOSIS The diagnosis of TMD is based largely on history and physical examination findings. The symptoms of TMD are often associated with jaw movement and pain in the preauricular, masseter, or temple region. Another source of orofacial pain should be suspected if pain is not affected by jaw movement. Adventitious sounds of the jaw may occur with TMD, but also occur in up to 50% of asymptomatic patients. 1 A large retrospective study conducted by a single examiner over 25 years noted that the most common presenting signs and symptoms were facial pain, ear discomfort, headache, and jaw discomfort or dysfunction. 13 Other symptoms may include dizziness or neck, eye, arm, or back pain. Chronic TMD is defined by pain of more than three months' duration.

Physical examination findings that support the diagnosis of TMD may include — but are not limited to — abnormal mandibular movement, decreased range of motion, tenderness of masticatory muscles, pain with dynamic loading, signs of bruxism, and neck or shoulder muscle tenderness. Clinicians should assess for malocclusion, which can contribute to the manifestation of TMD. Cranial nerve abnormalities should not be attributed to TMD. Reproducible tenderness to palpation of the TMJ is suggestive of intra-articular derangement. Tenderness of the masseter, temporalis, and surrounding neck muscles may distinguish myalgia, myofascial trigger points, or referred pain syndrome. Deviation of the mandible toward the affected side during mouth opening may indicate anterior articular disk displacement.
15.

Referral Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon is recommended if the patient has a history of trauma or fracture to the TMJ complex, severe pain and dysfunction from internal derangement that does not respond to conservative measures, or pain with no identifiable source that persists for more than three to six months. 10, 14, 62 Surgery is rarely required for treatment of TMD and is usually reserved for correction of anatomic or articular abnormalities. 1 Surgical options include arthrocentesis, arthroscopy, diskectomy, condylotomy, and total joint replacement.

### Temporomandibular joint arthritis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, now what? [^ee2a68a2]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

This was not a systematic review. However, one of the authors (RQC) performed a PubMed search for all articles with keywords "temporomandibular" and "arthritis", covering the dates 2002 to the present. For the review of the studies on intraarticular therapy to the TMJ, a different author (MLS) performed a PubMed search for "temporomandibular joint", "arthritis", and "treatment" covering the same dates.

Anatomy and function

The TMJ is a synovial joint composed of 4 articulating surfaces: glenoid fossa of the temporal bone, the upper and lower surfaces of the articular disc, and the mandibular condyle. The disc divides the joint into the superior and inferior compartments. As it can move independently of the condyle, there is a potential for disc displacement, which results in pain, joint noises, and limited range of motion. The TMJ is a complex joint termed ginglymoarthrodial, meaning that it has both hinge and sliding motion. Specifically, motion at the inferior compartment consists of rotation (ginglymoid joint) and manifests as moving the chin, while motion at the superior compartment consists of sliding or translation and manifests as protrusion of the mandible. Both movements are very important for maximum mouth opening and function. A unique aspect of the joint is that both right and left must work in synchrony with partial dislocation. Additionally, the jaw works to maximize intercuspation of the teeth, so any dental anomalies can alter TMJ function and consequently result in condylar or disc abnormalities. The fact that teeth create an abrupt stop and that malocclusion causes complex neuromuscular feedback with altered proprioception leads to a variety of symptoms, presenting as articular and myofascial pain and dysfunction.

### Arthrocentesis for temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome [^47f99c79]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The management of refractory temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain is both challenging and controversial. A number of simple, noninvasive approaches have been used in the management of this condition with variable success. In patients who fail to respond to conventional conservative measures, in a joint that is not deemed to be grossly mechanically deranged, we advocate the use of TMJ arthrocentesis. In our practice, this is followed by intra-articular morphine infusion in an attempt to give long-term pain relief. Arthrocentesis is a simple technique with minimal morbidity that can be tried instead of more invasive procedures. To date we have used arthrocentesis of the upper joint space, with intra-articular morphine injection in over 500 TMJs. Approximately 90% of patients have found the procedure beneficial, with pain often being reduced 1 year after the procedure. We recommend arthrocentesis as an effective, minimally invasive technique in patients with continuing pain in the TMJ that is unresponsive to conservative management. We additionally advocate the use of intra-articular morphine as a long acting analgesic in these patients. Although arthrocentesis is a well documented technique and there have been many studies published in relation to the use of intra-articular morphine in orthopedic surgery, further research is required, to delineate its use in the TMJ more fully.

### Treatment of painful temporomandibular joints with a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor: a randomized placebo-controlled comparison of celecoxib to naproxen [^1cd5f084]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy and adverse effects of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, with naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and placebo in the treatment of painful temporomandibular joints (TMJs). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 68 subjects with painful TMJs secondary to disc-displacement with reduction, received celecoxib 100 mg twice a day; naproxen, 500 mg twice a day; or placebo for 6 weeks. Subjects were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy: pain intensity measured by visual analogue scale, maximal comfortable mandibular opening, and quality of life (SF-36), at baseline (1 week after discontinuing previous analgesic therapy) and again after 6 weeks of drug treatment. Naproxen significantly reduced the symptoms of painful temporomandibular joint disc-displacement (TMJ DD) with reduction as determined by most efficacy measures. Significant improvement in pain intensity occurred within 3 weeks of treatment, and was sustained throughout the 6-week study. Clinically significant improvement in mandibular range of motion was observed for naproxen compared to celecoxib and placebo. Celecoxib showed slightly better pain reduction than placebo, but was not significantly effective for temporomandibular disorder pain. Celecoxib and naproxen were well tolerated, with similar number of reported adverse effects. Dual COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition with naproxen was demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of painful TMJs, as seen by significant improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of TMJ DD with reduction compared to celecoxib and placebo. Inhibition of both COX isozymes is needed to achieve effective analgesia for this type of musculoskeletal pain.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^c0ce3345]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Dental management

Two approaches are usually proposed by odontologists to treat their TMD patients: orthopedic stabilization therapy and occlusal therapy. Splint therapy is frequently used for the first method group; in the second method, orthodontics and occlusal adjustment are commonly used to achieve a definite correct stable occlusion. According to Varga, signs and symptoms of TMD could not be associated with specific types of malocclusion. This statement, together with published reports stating insufficient evidence, precludes us from recommending to our patients an orthodontic intervention or occlusal adjustment to treat TMD.

On the other hand, splint therapy is one of the most commonly proposed conservative treatments for TMD pain associated with bruxism and also for internal derangements. It is not clear whether the use of a stabilization splint can be beneficial for reducing pain in TMD, given its therapeutic effect remains controversial; however, it appears to have an undeniable placebo effect for pain management. A transient effect of reduction in electromyographic activity of the masticatory muscles has been demonstrated, which did not last more than 2 weeks. Occlusal splints are recommended to prevent dentition damage from tooth grinding.

### Temporomandibular joint herniation: review of the literature [^84e01580]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To define clear clinical characteristics and management strategies of herniation of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) into the external auditory canal (EAC).

Data Source

MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases.

Study Selection

A search was conducted using the keywords "temporomandibular joint" and "herniation" with all of their synonyms. Literature selection criteria included articles published in English, and articles dating back no further than 1970.

Results

Forty articles regarding 51 cases were eligible for critical appraisal. According to the previously published papers, TMJ herniation has following characteristics; symptoms are nonspecific, but a distinguishable feature is a protruding mass into the EAC that can be seen to appear and disappear as the mouth opens and closes. High-resolution computed tomography scans are sensitive to the bony defect and are helpful in diagnosing TMJ herniation. In the surgical treatment of TMJ herniation, wall reconstruction rather than simple mass excision could be a safe and long-lasting strategy.

Conclusions

Herniation of TMJ into the EAC is a rare condition, but can be encountered in the clinic at any time. This literature review could be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of TMJ herniation into the EAC.

3.4 Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors

A sedentary lifestyle significantly increases the risk of developing MPS, as prolonged inactivity contributes to muscle stiffness and reduced flexibility. Individuals who do not engage in regular physical activity are more prone to muscle deconditioning, which can exacerbate MTrP formation and prolong the duration of symptoms. Regular exercise, on the other hand, helps maintain muscle health by improving flexibility, strength, and endurance, thereby reducing the likelihood of MPS.

Oral parafunctional behaviors, such as teeth grinding (bruxism) and jaw clenching, are particularly common in patients with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJD) and are known to contribute to MPS, especially in the orofacial and neck regions. Bruxism creates chronic tension in the masticatory muscles, leading to the activation of MTrPs in the jaw and face. This can result in referred pain patterns that exacerbate temporomandibular joint‐related symptoms and complicate diagnosis and treatment.

Sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia, are another critical risk factor for MPS. Poor sleep quality has been linked to heightened pain sensitivity and reduced muscle recovery, both of which contribute to the persistence of MTrPs. A longitudinal population‐based study demonstrated that individuals with insomnia had a significantly higher risk of developing MPS than those with healthy sleep patterns, underscoring the importance of addressing sleep hygiene in the management of chronic pain.

### Ultrasound is effective to treat temporomandibular joint disorder [^ee701c02]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After odontogenic pain, temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is one of the most common causes of pain in the mouth and face, affecting millions of people. It often leads to persisting (chronic) pain that lasts for years. The conditions affect the masticatory musculature, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and associated structures. The most common and typical symptoms of TMD include clicking of joint, mouth opening limitation, muscle and joint pain. The pain can be myogenic, arthrogenic or mixed types, and can be associated with other chronic pain conditions, including migraine, fibromyalgia, and widespread pain. The disorders are also known to be comorbid with bruxism, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue, leading to considerably reduced quality of life.

A number of studies have investigated the efficacy of physical therapies for TMJ pain. These therapies include massage, electrotherapy, physical and exercise therapiesas well as biobehavioral intervention. Among them, extracorporeal shockwave (ESW) therapy is demonstrated to be effective to reduce the pain and improve the mouth function. However, this treatment is relatively slow in relieving pain for patients and needs additional functional therapy to preserve the long-term therapeutic result.

Ultrasound (US) has been studied for treating temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA)and hypoxia-induced chondrocyte damage in temporomandibular disorders, since it is recognized as a stimulator if used at low-intensity level, and would promote neovascularization, differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and local release of angiogenic factors that action on ischemic tissues due to improved blood flow. Some preliminary studies show that US is effective in treating TMJ disorders and relieving pain, particularly if it is used in combination with an ice bath. However, a better understanding of the therapeutic effects is still required for rational and effective use of this therapy for TMD.

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of US on pain and the findings may provide better management of the disease.

### The effectiveness of exercise therapy for temporomandibular dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6e893ef2]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of exercise therapy on pain, function, and mobility outcomes in patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

Study Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis undertaken following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies that met the inclusion criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials; (2) a population with the diagnosis of temporomandibular joint dysfunction; and (3) interventions that included exercise therapy were considered for review. When studies demonstrated homogeneity on outcome measures, the mean differences or standardized mean differences with 95% confidence interval were calculated and pooled in a meta-analysis for pooled synthesis.

Results

Six articles with a total of 419 participants were included in the review and only four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Mobility and mixed exercise therapy approaches appear to be the most common exercise approaches utilized for management of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Exercise therapy and the associated dosage provide moderate short-term and varying long-term benefits in reduction of pain and improvement of range of motion of the in patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

Conclusion

Included studies suggest a mobility or a mixed approach to exercise therapies have impact on reducing pain, significant impact for increasing range of motion, but lack a significant impact for functional improvement.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^b4ff4bea]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Some of the most prevalent and debilitating pain conditions arise from the structures innervated by the trigeminal system (head, face, masticatory musculature, temporomandibular joint and associated structures). Orofacial pain (OFP) can arise from different regions and etiologies. Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are the most prevalent orofacial pain conditions for which patients seek treatment. Temporomandibular disorders include a number of clinical problems that involve the masticatory musculature, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or both. Trigeminal neuropathic pain conditions can arise from injury secondary to dental procedures, infection, neoplasias, or disease or dysfunction of the peripheral and/or central nervous system. Neurovascular disorders, such as primary headaches, can present as chronic orofacial pain, such as in the case of facial migraine, where the pain is localized in the second and third division of the trigeminal nerve. Together, these disorders of the trigeminal system impact the quality of life of the sufferer dramatically. A multidisciplinary pain management approach should be considered for the optimal treatment of orofacial pain disorders including both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities.

### Relationship between temporomandibular joint effusion, pain, and jaw function limitation: a 2D and 3D comparative study [^404a28de]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) refers to a group of conditions that affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and its surrounding structures, including muscles, ligaments, and bony components serving for the movement and function of the jaw. It presents as a range of symptoms, such as joint and muscle tenderness, difficulty chewing or opening mouth, audible joint sounds during jaw movements (clicking or crepitus) and may often lead to orofacial pain. As one of the most common symptoms associated with TMD, TMJ pain is characterized by discomfort in the joint and surrounding muscles, which can be intermittent or chronic and radiate to regions like dental arches, temples and forehead. In most cases, conservative therapies, such as occlusal splint treatment, massage and manual therapy are considered to be the first-choice strategy for managing TMJ pain, while invasive procedures would be adopted in severe cases. It has been accepted that the treatment methods selected for TMJ pain management should be conformable to the origin and contributing factors of the dysfunction.

Another pathological change that can result from TMD is TMJ effusion, an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the joint space. The etiology of TMJ effusion is multifactorial and may be attributed to secondary reactions to inflammation caused by trauma, injury, or degenerative changes in the joint. Several studies have reported that TMJ effusion is frequently observed in TMD patients and could serve as an important indicator for inflammatory processes or potential joint disease. In addition, patients with TMD who experience TMJ effusion may also experience joint pain. To date, considerable effort has been devoted to investigating the influence of TMJ effusion on TMJ pain and the underlying relationship between them. For instance, previous researchers claimed that there was an association between the risk of effusion formation and pain, along with structural changes in the temporomandibular joint disc and disc displacement. Conversely, some studies suggested that there is no direct relationship between joint effusion and TMJ pain as a predictor. Moreover, Guarda-Nardini et al suggested that there might be limited therapeutic benefit from eliminating joint effusion in their research on the treatment efficacy of TMJ arthrocentesis. Therefore, the association between TMJ effusion and pain, alongside TMJ disc displacement, is still a matter of debate, and more research is necessary to further validate the controversy.

Background

Forty to ninety-six percent of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) develop arthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ); all JIA categories are at risk. There are several features of this joint that warrant particular attention, including its importance for everyday function, potential cosmetic implications of altered dentofacial growth, and the challenges in the evaluation and management of TMJ arthritis. Detailed discussion of the functional implications of TMJ arthritis are available, but briefly include pain with talking, difficulty eating, and obvious and potentially embarrassing alterations to the normal facial appearance. This review will focus on the diagnosis and management of TMJ arthritis in children with JIA.

### Thread embedding acupuncture for temporomandibular disorder: protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial [^e0399019]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a collective term including clinical problems that involve the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory muscles, and associated structures.TMD include both functional disturbances and orofacial pain, in addition to various disorders affecting multiple tissues of the TMJ complex.

In 2018, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States reported that TMD patients comprise an estimated 5% to 12% of the overall population. Moreover, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in South Korea reported that the number of patients who visited the hospital due to TMD (K076 in Korean Standard Classification of Diseases) increased by 78% between 2011 and 2020, from 244,708 to 436,722.

The clinical symptoms of TMD include joint noises; pain in the head, neck, and shoulder; inability to fully open/close the jaw; muscular tenderness; ear complaints; and psychosocial effects.

Most patients improve with a combination of non-invasive therapies, including education, self-care, cognitive behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and occlusal devices. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants are initially recommended, and benzodiazepines or antidepressants may be added for chronic cases.

The prognosis of TMD is usually good since symptoms slowly improve and resolve over time. However, despite the conventional treatments mentioned above, persistent pain symptoms and physical disability can decrease patient quality of life.

Therefore, alternative traditional Korean treatments have been applied for the treatment of TMD, mainly acupuncture, Chuna manual treatment, and electroacupuncture. Thread embedding acupuncture (TEA) has also been used in clinical practice.

Various studies have been performed to assess the effect of acupuncture on TMD. Several randomized controlled trials have shown positive results such as reduced pain, improved masticatory function, and increased maximum interincisal opening. However, no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of TEA on TMD.

### Impact of physiotherapy on orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^f523bb46]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Physiotherapy appears as a promising therapy option for patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), but the effects of physiotherapy and jaw exercises on JIA-related orofacial symptoms remain unknown. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the impact of orofacial physiotherapy and home-exercise programs in patients with JIA and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement.

Methods

Twelve patients with JIA and TMJ involvement received a treatment of physiotherapy, complemented by prescribed home exercises spanning over eight weeks. Orofacial symptoms and dysfunction were monitored pre-treatment, during treatment, after treatment, and at a three-months follow-up.

Results

Orofacial pain frequency and intensity significantly decreased during the course of the treatment (p = 0.009 and p = 0.006), with further reductions observed at the three-month follow-up (p = 0.007 and p = 0.002). During treatment, the mandibular function improved significantly in terms of maximal mouth opening capacity, laterotrusion, and protrusion.

Conclusions

This proof-of-concept study shows favourable effects of physiotherapy and home excercises in the management of JIA-related orofacial symptoms and dysfunctions.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^4515b89b]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Injected pharmacotherapy

In a recent review, results supported the use of injections of the corticosteroid β-methasone or sodium hyaluronate for TMJ pain. The corticosteroid might have an anti-inflammatory effect on the joint, and the hyaluronate could improve the joint's lubrication, but both could also help to dilute local inflammatory substances. Inferior or double TMJ-space injection is recommended over the superior-space injection technique.

Regarding botulinum toxin (BTX) injections to the masticatory muscles, a systematic review revealed controversial results for BTX therapy. Of the five studies included, two obtained a significant reduction in pain, one showed equal effects compared with masticatory manual therapy, and two showed no significant differences for BTX compared with placebo. More research is needed to assess the possible long-term negative effects of BTX on the infiltrated muscles. Basic research has shown that the size of the muscle recovered, but not the contractile function, after 1 year of BTX injections. Also, when comparing BTX with placebo injection for trapezius muscle pain, there were no differences in pain-intensity measurement.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^1e9f5179]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 7

Occlusal splints and/or physical therapy may be beneficial in patients with orofacial symptoms and/or TMJ dysfunction (LoE 4, mean ± SD SoR 8.3 ± 2.2). Data from longitudinal observational case series have documented significant improvement in JIA‐related orofacial dysfunction and symptoms after treatment with oral splints, although the complete resolution of pain is rare. The design of the oral splint varied between studies (e.g. activators and flat stabilizing splints). Regardless of splint design, this treatment modality is considered reversible, safe, and of low cost in most healthcare settings. Oral splints also play a role in the treatment of dentofacial deformity (see recommendation 10).

No data exist regarding the effect of physiotherapy on JIA‐related orofacial signs and symptoms. Physiotherapy and jaw exercises are evidence‐based treatments for related conditions such as other temporomandibular dysfunctions, and can reasonably be extrapolated to patients with JIA‐related orofacial symptoms. The recommendation for the use of orofacial physiotherapy for JIA is solely based on empirical evidence and mechanism‐based reasoning (LoE 5). This is a subject of further study. In summary, splint therapy and physiotherapy are considered safe and reversible modalities for the management of orofacial signs and symptoms in JIA patients, and are therefore recommended despite a low level of evidence.

### Optimising combined treatment for migraine and temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) [^79d04f76]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and migraine are highly prevalent, overlapping pain conditions that cause considerable burden in the population. These two disorders are of different etiology and pathophysiology, but both are mediated by the trigeminal system. Due to the interrelated anatomy and physiology of the craniofacial and cervical structures, shared molecular links and mutual feedback, there is an inherent potential for exacerbation of symptomatology, perpetuation and progression; however, on a positive note, there is good potential for developing integrated, mutually beneficial management protocols when migraine and TMDs are comorbid. Currently, there are no established protocols of management, and the literature is limited in studies exploring dual therapeutic protocols. So, the question is, how can management be optimized with the evidence available? We should start by recognizing the need for multidisciplinary management to improve patient outcomes and we must highlight the importance of the dialogue between headache medicine and dentistry. The meeting point is where the dental discipline and the specialty of orofacial pain reside. The underlying pathophysiology of this comorbidity points to the need to decrease mutual exacerbation inputs. Therefore, it is fundamental to identify contributing factors of potential sensitization, such as the presence of parafunctional behaviors, cervical spine contributors, the presence of other comorbidities and headache hygiene. Current evidence supports management recommendations that should be developed by a multidisciplinary team as an integrated plan with combination therapy including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to optimize management. This multidisciplinary team should include the medical provider (neurologist/headache medicine expertise), the dentist specialized in orofacial pain, the physical therapist and the behavioral medicine specialist. Research is needed to support evidence-based integrated protocols for the management of comorbid migraine and TMDs. Evidence has shown that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is also involved in TMDs. CGRP-targeting therapies may hold future opportunities for pharmacological monotherapy addressing this comorbidity.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^054ec566]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis is a frequent manifestation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). TMJ arthritis often occurs early in the JIA disease course, and the inflammatory process and related orofacial signs and symptoms can persist into adulthood. Occasionally, TMJ arthritis is the only manifestation of JIA. Early TMJ arthritis may be asymptomatic, but many patients experience orofacial symptoms, orofacial dysfunction, and a decrease in quality of life as the disease progresses. In skeletally immature patients, TMJ arthritis can interfere with facial growth and development, resulting in dentofacial deformity.

Management of the orofacial manifestations of TMJ arthritis requires an interdisciplinary care team which includes pediatric rheumatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthodontics, radiology, pediatric dentistry, specialists in orofacial pain and jaw function, and others. In 2019, consensus‐based terminology specific to JIA‐associated TMJ arthritis was introduced. Standardization of terminology provides a platform for communication among the many healthcare providers involved in the integrative care of this condition, facilitates research, and may improve outcomes.

Management of TMJ arthritis varies widely in different regions and healthcare systems; interdisciplinary consensus‐based recommendations to guide clinical decision‐making and standardize care are necessary. The objectives of this project were to develop interdisciplinary recommendations for management of orofacial manifestations of JIA and to create a future research agenda related to TMJ arthritis management in JIA.

### Management of surgical failures [^2ae78d69]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention is appropriate in a small percentage of patients with temporomandibular joint disorders when it is based on a specific diagnosis of intracapsular pathology not amenable to nonsurgical modalities. Expected advances in our understanding of the complex molecular, biochemical, and genetic factors that influence these disease states clearly will allow less invasive techniques and even obviate the need for some open arthroplastic interventions altogether in the future. In the meantime, reasonable, well-intentioned surgeons must rely on the current body of surgical knowledge to use surgery as judiciously as possible.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^46bf33c1]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical care

TMJ surgery is only indicated when non-surgical therapy has been ineffective, and it is not indicated in patients who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic or as a preventive measure. Surgical recommendations, such as arthrocentesis and arthroscopy, depend on the degree of internal derangement as well as previous TMJ treatment history in addition to moderate-to-severe pain and disabling dysfunction. It is important to discourage patients from undergoing surgical procedures if physical medicine, pharmacological management, and splint therapy have not been attempted. Working closely with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon who has expertise in TMJ surgery is highly advisable in dealing with this particular group of patients.

Arthrocentesis is a conservative treatment that involves an intra-articular lavage with or without deposit of corticosteroids that is useful when there are intra-articular restrictions to movement, as in disc displacement without reduction. This procedure is often used with mandibular manipulation and is recommended for patients who have joint restrictions and for those individuals who have developed an acute or chronic closed lock.

Arthroscopy is a closed surgical procedure that allows direct observation and sampling of joint tissue, useful in hypomobility due to joint derangementas well as fibrosis. It is performed mainly in the upper joint space and is utilized primarily for lysis and lavage but also for ablation of adhesions and biopsy.

Arthrotomy is an open surgical procedure that modifies joint anatomy, such as total or partial joint reconstruction or replacement, which is required for the patient who has advanced TMD that meets the surgical criteria and has been refractory to other modalities. It is used in cases of neoplasia, bony or fibrous ankylosis, severe chronic arthritis, and severe chronic dislocations. It is important to work closely with an experienced TMJ surgeon to assess the necessity of this procedure if other conservative treatments have not produced positive results.

### Challenges in treating juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^46bbfb46]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) diagnosis and classification is currently still based on clinical presentation and general laboratory tests. Some joints such as the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and sacroiliac (SI) are hard to assess and define as actively inflamed based on clinical examination. This review addresses these difficult to assess joints and provides the latest evidence for diagnosis and treatment.

Recent Findings

Recommendations on clinical examination and radiological examination are available. Recent 2021 ACR recommendations were made for TMJ arthritis and in 2019 for sacroiliitis.

Summary

New evidence to guide clinical suspicion and need for further investigations are available for these hard to assess joints. These guidelines will help healthcare providers in diagnosis and treatment assessment.

### The contemporary management of temporomandibular joint intra-articular pain and dysfunction [^924313ca]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The understanding of the causes of temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction has evolved over 50 years. Historically, the term internal derangement has been used to describe the abnormal relationship between the articular disc, condyle, and glenoid fossa, which was thought to correlate with patient symptoms. It is now known that the pathophysiology of intra-articular pain and dysfunction (IPD) involves synovitis, capsular impingement, symptomatic disc displacement, or a combination of these. Symptomatic disc displacement should only be considered to be a potential source of IPD after synovitis and capsular impingement have been treated. This philosophy provides the opportunity for most patients with IPD to be initially treated nonsurgically or with minimally invasive procedures such as arthrocentesis or arthroscopy.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^bbd455b6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 8

Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection may be indicated in arthritis‐induced refractory and symptomatic TMJ dysfunction, but is not recommended as first‐line management in skeletally immature patients (LoE 2, mean ± SD SoR 7.4 ± 2.7). Recommendation 8 relates to the role of TMJ intraarticular glucocorticoid injections in the management of TMJ symptoms and dysfunction in patients with refractory (active) TMJ arthritis, as opposed to recommendations 6a and b which relate to the management of TMJ inflammation. Longitudinal observational studies have demonstrated pain relief and improvement in TMJ function after intraarticular glucocorticoid injection to the TMJ. Likewise, intraarticular glucocorticoid injection has been shown to decrease short‐term TMJ inflammation based on MRI. However, as discussed earlier, the effects and the duration of the benefits of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections on the signs and symptoms of TMJ dysfunction are highly variable and temporary. The risk of side effects has been discussed above (see recommendations 6a and b).

Despite controversy regarding the use of TMJ intraarticular glucocorticoid injections, they are still indicated in specific circumstances (e.g. arthritis‐induced refractory and symptomatic TMJ dysfunction). The use of this treatment modality calls for special attention to the risks and benefits of the technique and to the level of skeletal maturity of the patient. Further study may help to clarify the role of this technique.

### Occlusal interventions for managing temporomandibular disorders [^5f03f7af]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are conditions related to the musculoskeletal structure of the temporomandibular joint, which may lead to muscle or joint pain and other health issues. TMD may present in muscles only (myogenous), joints only (arthrogenous), or both (mixed), and may affect one side or both sides of the face. Myogenous TMD may present with or without limited mouth opening. Arthrogenous TMD may present as disc displacement with or without reduction ('reduction' meaning the articular disc resumes its normal position when the jaw is moving). Occlusal interventions change the occlusal relationship of maxillary and mandibular teeth to improve the alignment of the tooth contact, with the aim of relieving pain, and improving psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Occlusal interventions include splints and adjustments. Occlusal splints are specially designed mouth guards; they are generally classified as stabilisation, reflex or repositioning splints. Occlusal adjustment is the grinding down of teeth to improve occlusion.

Objectives

To assess the effects of occlusal interventions in people diagnosed with temporomandibular disorders (TMD), compared to other interventions or no treatment, on joint pain, muscle pain at rest and when chewing, quality of life, discomfort, and recurrence.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched following sources up to 9 August 2022: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase via Ovid, and two trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of occlusal interventions (splints or adjustment) for managing TMD compared with no treatment, placebo, occlusal splint with a different mechanism of action, or other active treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We adopted standard Cochrane methods to select studies, extract and analyse data, assess the risk of bias in the studies, and judge the certainty of the evidence. We reported outcomes as short term (three months or less) or long term (more than three months).

Main Results

We included 57 studies (2846 participants) that compared occlusal splints with no treatment, placebo, or another treatment. Most of the studies evaluated full hard stabilisation splint (FHSS) as the occlusal splint. We judged only one study to be at low risk of bias. Our key outcomes of interest were self-reported joint pain when chewing, muscle pain at rest and when chewing, discomfort, severity and frequency of joint noise, and recurrence rate. The duration of the studies ranged from 5 weeks to 84 months. The key results presented below were measured between 4.4 weeks and 4 months. It is important to note that we have very low certainty in the evidence for all comparisons and outcomes assessed. There may be little to no difference in self-reported joint pain when chewing between occlusal splint (FHSS) and placebo (non-occlusal splint) (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.75; 1 study, 60 participants with mixed TMD), or pharmacological therapy (diclofenac) (RR 2.10, 95% CI 0.83 to 5.30; 1 study, 29 participants with osteoarthritis), but the evidence is very uncertain. Occlusal splint (FHSS) may reduce muscle pain when chewing compared to no treatment (MD -1.97, 95% CI -2.37 to -1.57; 1 study, 84 participants with disc displacement without reduction), but may have little to no effect when compared to physical therapy (low-level laser) (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants) or acupuncture (with needles) (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.80 to 1.00, 1 study, 40 participants) in people with myofascial pain TMD, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in muscle pain at rest when occlusal splint (FHSS) is compared to no treatment (MD -11.63, 95% CI -29.37 to 6.11; 1 study, 37 participants) or physical therapy (physiotherapy) (MD -0.19, 95% CI -1.25 to 0.87; 1 study, 72 participants) in myofascial pain TMD, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little to no difference in severity of joint noise when occlusal splint (FHSS) is compared to no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -0.58, 95% CI -7.09 to 5.93; 1 study, 20 participants). When FHSS is compared to physical therapy (specifically, orofacial myofunctional therapy), physical therapy may reduce severity of joint noise, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 5.92, 95% CI 0.18 to 11.66; 1 study, 20 participants with mixed TMD). There may be little to no difference in frequency of joint noise when occlusal splint (FHSS) is compared to placebo (non-occlusal splint) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.20; 1 study, 60 myofascial pain TMD participants), occlusal splint with a different mechanism of action (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.07 to 9.18; 1 study, 9 participants with disc displacement with reduction), or physical therapy (jaw exercise) (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.32 to 6.94; 1 study, 18 participants with myofascial pain TMD), but the evidence is very uncertain. Discomfort and recurrence rate were not reported in any study. We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low for all outcomes in all comparisons due to limitations in study design and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

This review included 57 RCTs with 2846 participants, but the final results are inconclusive, so the research questions remain unanswered. Occlusal splints of the FHSS type may reduce muscle pain when chewing compared to no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. Orofacial myofunctional therapy may reduce severity of joint noise compared to occlusal splint (FHSS), but the evidence is very uncertain. For all other comparisons and outcomes, there may be little or no difference between groups, although the evidence is also very uncertain for these findings. Overall, we found insufficient evidence to reach conclusions regarding the effectiveness of occlusal interventions for managing symptoms of TMD, despite the available studies including almost 3000 participants. To make a useful contribution to the debate about the best way to treat TMD, any further research must be well-designed, with enough participants to reach the optimal information size for meaningful results; it requires recruitment from primary care, consensus around key outcomes and measures, and, ideally, long-term follow-up of three to five years, plus inclusion of a cost-effectiveness component.

### Unlocking the temporomandibular joint: CT, MRI, and arthroscopic correlation [^dcb083ec]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

The temporomandibular joint constitutes a synovial connection between the mandible and the skull base and plays a pivotal role in functions such as jaw movement, chewing, and verbal and emotional expression. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is observed in about 30% of the population, with a higher prevalence in young to middle-aged women. Interestingly, a majority of individuals affected do not report pain, and only 5%-10% of symptomatic cases necessitate therapeutic intervention. The most common temporomandibular joint disorder manifests as pain in the masticatory muscles and is referred to as myofascial syndrome. However, articular disorders are also very common, usually due to disk displacement and degenerative or inflammatory arthropathies. Less frequently, the temporomandibular joint may be affected by a range of congenital and acquired conditions such as trauma and neoplasms. Imaging becomes necessary for the small percentage of patients who do not respond to conservative management or when there is uncertainty in the diagnosis. A comprehensive understanding of the normal imaging appearance of the temporomandibular joint as well as the wide range of potential pathologic conditions is essential for conducting an accurate radiologic assessment. Moreover, collaboration among multidisciplinary teams and the correlation of imaging findings with arthroscopic observations are crucial to advancing the diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Psychological therapies for temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) [^60cf9da2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the jaw. They are frequently associated with pain that can be difficult to manage and may become persistent (chronic). Psychological therapies aim to support people with TMDs to manage their pain, leading to reduced pain, disability and distress.

Objectives

To assess the effects of psychological therapies in people (aged 12 years and over) with painful TMD lasting 3 months or longer.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched six bibliographic databases up to 21 October 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any psychological therapy (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), behaviour therapy (BT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness) for the management of painful TMD. We compared these against control or alternative treatment (e.g. oral appliance, medication, physiotherapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We reported outcome data immediately after treatment and at the longest available follow-up. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias in included studies. Two review authors independently assessed each included study for any risk of bias in sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting of outcomes, and other issues. We judged the certainty of the evidence for each key comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified 22 RCTs (2001 participants), carried out between 1967 and 2021. We were able to include 12 of these studies in meta-analyses. The risk of bias was high across studies, and we judged the certainty of the evidence to be low to very low overall; further research may change the findings. Our key outcomes of interest were: pain intensity, disability caused by pain, adverse events and psychological distress. Treatments varied in length, with the shortest being 4 weeks. The follow-up time ranged from 3 months to 12 months. Most studies evaluated CBT. At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a benefit of CBT on pain intensity when measured against alternative treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, confidence interval (CI) -0.21 to 0.28; P = 0.79; 5 studies, 509 participants) or control (SMD -0.09, CI -0.30 to 0.12; P = 0.41; 6 studies, 577 participants). At follow-up, there was evidence of a small benefit of CBT for reducing pain intensity compared to alternative treatment (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.08; 5 studies, 475 participants) and control (SMD -0.30, CI -0.51 to -0.09; 6 studies, 639 participants). At treatment completion, there was no evidence of a difference in disability outcomes (interference in activities caused by pain) between CBT and alternative treatment (SMD 0.15, CI -0.40 to 0.10; P = 0.25; 3 studies, 245 participants), or between CBT and control/usual care (SMD 0.02, CI -0.21 to 0.24; P = 0.88; 3 studies, 315 participants). Nor was there evidence of a difference at follow-up (CBT versus alternative treatment: SMD -0.15, CI -0.42 to 0.12; 3 studies, 245 participants; CBT versus control: SMD 0.01 CI - 0.61 to 0.64; 2 studies, 240 participants). There were very few data on adverse events. From the data available, adverse effects associated with psychological treatment tended to be minor and to occur less often than in alternative treatment groups. There were, however, insufficient data available to draw firm conclusions. CBT showed a small benefit in terms of reducing psychological distress at treatment completion compared to alternative treatment (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.15; 6 studies, 553 participants), which was maintained at follow-up (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.13; 6 studies, 516 participants). For CBT versus control, only one study reported results for distress and did not find evidence of a difference between groups at treatment completion (mean difference (MD) 2.36, 95% CI -1.17 to 5.89; 101 participants) or follow-up (MD -1.02, 95% CI -4.02 to 1.98; 101 participants). We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low or very low for all comparisons and outcomes. The data were insufficient to draw any reliable conclusions about psychological therapies other than CBT.

Authors' Conclusions

We found mixed evidence for the effects of psychological therapies on painful temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). There is low-certainty evidence that CBT may reduce pain intensity more than alternative treatments or control when measured at longest follow-up, but not at treatment completion. There is low-certainty evidence that CBT may be better than alternative treatments, but not control, for reducing psychological distress at treatment completion and follow-up. There is low-certainty evidence that CBT may not be better than other treatments or control for pain disability outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about alternative psychological therapeutic approaches, and there are insufficient data to be clear about adverse effects that may be associated with psychological therapies for painful TMD. Overall, we found insufficient evidence on which to base a reliable judgement about the efficacy of psychological therapies for painful TMD. Further research is needed to determine whether or not psychological therapies are effective, the most effective type of therapy and delivery method, and how it can best be targeted. In particular, high-quality RCTs conducted in primary care and community settings are required, which evaluate a range of psychological approaches against alternative treatments or usual care, involve both adults and adolescents, and collect measures of pain intensity, pain disability and psychological distress until at least 12 months post-treatment.

### Surgical treatment of temporomandibular joint ankylosis: our experience with 36 cases [^53294b1e]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) is a debilitating mandibular hypomobility disorder characterized by a fusion of the condyle to the fossa by bony or fibrotic tissues. Temporomandibular joint ankylosis may be associated with serious functional and esthetic deformities, including limited mouth opening (MO), impaired mastication, malnutrition, poor oral hygiene, and disturbances of facial and mandibular growth. Mandibular hypomobility and subsequent retrognathia can produce oropharyngeal airspace narrowing, leading to signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

Temporomandibular joint ankylosis may be acquired or congenital. Acquired TMJA is most commonly associated with trauma, local/systemic infections, previous TMJ surgery or systemic diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. –

The ultimate treatment goal of TMJA is to restore altered joint mechanics, correct the associated dentofacial deformities, facilitate maintenance of good oral hygiene, and prevent reankylosis. Various treatment modalities for TMJA have been described, and these include gap arthroplasty (GA), interpositional gap arthroplasty, and reconstructive arthroplasty (RA) (total joint reconstruction with autogenous grafts or alloplastic materials) and distraction osteogenesis. Interpositional gap arthroplasty involves resection of the osseous mass followed by interpositioning of a biological or alloplastic material in the ensuing gap. – In RA, the ankylosed mass is resected and the joint is reconstructed by autogenous bone grafts or a total alloplastic joint prostheses.,

However, there is no accepted standard surgical protocol in TMJA surgery that has produced consistent results, and the measurement of outcomes is often not clear or standardized.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare outcomes of patients with TMJA treated by 2 surgical modalities: GA and RA. The specific aims of the present study were to compare the preoperative and postoperative MO, and to determine complications associated with each treatment modality.

### Surgical versus nonsurgical management of degenerative joint disease [^a509b55c]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

As knowledge of the complexity of myofascial pain and its interaction with temporomandibular joint disorders has increased, the use of surgical procedures to treat degenerative joint disease has decreased. The focus has moved from a "surgery-first" approach toward a more cautious one that involves nonsurgical treatment as the primary modality, then minimally invasive treatments, followed by open surgical modalities, when indicated. This article examines the current literature regarding the effectiveness of nonsurgical and surgical treatments for the management of degenerative joint disease.

### Management of pain in patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD): challenges and solutions [^dd01effe]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Therapeutic exercise

Exercise focused on improving motor control and endurance of masticatory muscles is effective in alleviating the symptoms of patients with TMD. However, exercise does not produce greater pain relief than other interventions, such as TENS, occlusal splints,–patient education, and acupuncture. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the exercises used in randomized controlled trials have been heterogeneous, including stretching, lingual and masticatory relaxation, and coordination exercises, among others. This aspect, added to the lack of a clear dosage regarding intensity, duration, and frequency, and the low methodological quality of the randomized controlled trials makes it difficult to draw conclusions. Nevertheless, although the superiority of the exercises cannot be assured, there is a favorable tendency when compared with other active treatments, which might justify its use.

Therefore, we consider that therapeutic exercise could obtain superior results to other treatments if a program with motor-control exercises and endurance of the cervical and masticatory muscles is applied. Although some studies included cervical exercises, most were aimed at increasing the ROM (mobility and stretching exercises), but none intended to improve the resistance of cervical spine stabilizers. Stabilizing muscles are essential to maintaining good postural control and helping to prevent the adoption of a forward head position.–

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) oligoarthritis — risk stratification and disease activity assessment: Consideration of risk factors for poor outcome (e.g., involvement of ankle, wrist, hip, sacroiliac joint, and/or TMJ, presence of erosive disease or enthesitis, delay in diagnosis, elevated levels of inflammatory markers, symmetric disease) is conditionally recommended to guide treatment decisions. Use of validated disease activity measures is conditionally recommended to guide treatment decisions, especially to facilitate treat-to-target approaches, and treatment for oligoarthritis can and should be modified based on the involvement of specific joints or disease features, including rapid escalation of treatment or alternative medication choice. Voting panelists conditionally recommended formal assessment of disease activity using validated measures, and measures that can be considered include Wallace preliminary criteria for Clinical Remission, ACR provisional criteria for inactive disease, Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS), and clinical JADAS.

### Orofacial pain management: current perspectives [^0d4257c1]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Disorders of the TMJ

Disorders of the TMJ are a result of a disc–condyle incoordination that influences the TMJ biomechanics. These disorders comprise the disc interference disorders or internal derangements, such as disc displacements with and without reduction, that can be asymptomatic or symptomatic due to inflammation (eg, capsulitis/synovitis). Disc displacements with reduction may present as a painful or non-painful click. Disc displacements without reduction may present with a painful limitation at opening. Retrodiscitis and TMJ subluxation may present symptomatology when the pain is a result of inflammation arising from the retrodiscal tissues or capsulitis or synovitis processes. Osteoarthritic changes can originate in the TMJ articular surfaces and, when they are influenced by a systemic disease, can become aggressive and progressive, such as in the case of polyarthritis.

Muscular disorders

Myalgia usually presents as a dull aching pain due to muscle injury or strain. It is commonly seen in acute forms, though, with continued muscle tension, can present for longer periods of time. Treatment may include, rest, hot or cold compresses, stretching exercises, and muscle relaxants. Myofascial pain (MFP) also presents as a dull, continuous aching pain that varies in intensity. MFP produces pain upon palpation that is local and may refer to other sites, as mapped out by Simons et al.MFP tends to be seen in muscle pain conditions of a more chronic nature, in which the tension is unremitting. Trigger points can often be seen in MFP and may be localized to a taut band of muscle. In addition, trigger points are associated with decreased muscle length and, when stimulated, can result in a local twitch response. Palpation of the trigger points should duplicate the patient's pain complaint, thus confirming diagnosis. Blocking the source of the pain (ie, masseter muscle) by using a vapocoolant spray or local anesthetic injection can also provide a definitive diagnosis.

Myositis is a localized transient swelling involving the muscle and facial tissues. There tends to be increased pain with mandibular movement and localized tenderness, usually following injury or infection.

Patient evaluation

TMD assessment should include a general examination of the head and neck, a detailed examination of the masticatory muscles, an evaluation of the TMJs, an evaluation of mandibular range of motion (ROM), and a detailed intraoral examination.

### High pain intensity is a risk factor of non-resolving TMD: a three-year follow-up of a patient group in a Norwegian interdisciplinary evaluation program [^2bf9d673]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommended treatment of TMD includes jaw muscle exercises, relaxation exercises, and sometimes an occlusal splint or NSAIDs. The authors of a recent RCT study have concluded that jaw motion exercises are a cost-effective and pain reducing treatment. The most common treatments reported by patients in our study were conservative treatments, including jaw muscle exercises, occlusal splint, and physiotherapy. The fact that only 10 out of 39 patients reported improvement of TMD might be due to different circumstances including the fact that the GMP and not the general dentist had the responsibility for the follow up and treatment. The GMP does normally not treat TMD and the general dentist might lack knowledge of how to treat TMD. Treatment of severe TMD belongs to specialists, both within dentistry and medicine, who ideally should form interdisciplinary teams, however there is a shortage of specialists in rural parts of Norway.

Treatment of chronic pain is a challenge; available treatment options do not necessarily reduce pain intensity or improve psychological and functional variables in an effective manner. However, during the last few decades there has been a switch in the scientific approach to chronic pain, from a direct linear association with tissue damage, to a multifactorial etiology including several biopsychosocial factors. It has reasonably been suggested that psychosocial health care should be involved in treatment of chronic pain and the appropriate goal for the future should be individualized pain management program for each patient.

Limitations to this study include the reliability and validity of the self-reported questionnaires. A previous study on the outcome of treatment for TMD reported a 44% discrepancy between the doctor's evaluation and the patients' answer to a TMJ symptom and function assessing questionnaire in which patients scored their symptoms both better and worse. The Authors had no control over whether the patients followed up with their GMP, in accordance with the suggested treatment plan. The relatively small study population and low response rate, and the fact that the patients were not clinically examined at follow up should also be considered as a limitation. In the drop-out analysis, patients who responded at the three-year follow-up had a longer pain duration and slightly higher age at baseline compared to the non-responders (Table 1) suggesting that a possible selection bias might be that responders were more severely affected than non-responders.

### Management of orofacial manifestations of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: interdisciplinary consensus-based recommendations [^b8dc79a3]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

These are the first interdisciplinary recommendations for the management of JIA‐related TMJ arthritis and the associated orofacial manifestations. Despite a lack of high‐level evidence, we created the 3 overarching principles and 12 recommendations outlined above to try to address the clinical questions clinicians are struggling with when treating patients with JIA‐associated TMJ arthritis. This article is considered to be a working document, with plans for revision as new evidence emerges. The 2021 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of JIA was recently published and included therapeutic approaches for TMJ arthritis. Both the 2021 ACR guideline and the recommendations in this review caution against the use of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections in skeletally immature patients and the use of biologic DMARDs in patients who have had an insufficient response to synthetic DMARDs. In addition to the 2021 ACR treatment guideline, our recommendations include evidence not only for therapeutic approaches, but also for orthopedic devices, orthodontic devices, and surgical interventions for the management of JIA‐associated TMJ arthritis and the related manifestations.

Due to the low quality of available evidence, all recommendations are considered to be conditional to denote the uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms. The proposed research agenda constitutes a framework for future interdisciplinary research efforts to improve the evidence of care. It is presented in the form of specific research questions to make the future research relevant and directly applicable to clinical practice. Future research should also focus on the burden of care and consider the cost‐effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic and treatment modalities. The proposed areas of study are suggestions and are not intended to exclude other research questions.

Optimal management of TMJ arthritis and the associated manifestations requires an interdisciplinary approach and should be recognized as an integrated part of contemporary JIA disease control. Management strategies should be individualized according to the specific JIA‐related orofacial manifestations of each patient. The voting panel highlights the importance of shared decision‐making involving patients, parents, and clinicians in defining targets of treatment and approaches to management. We acknowledge that management may vary by region and healthcare system. The voting panel hopes that the current recommendations help to facilitate a process for specialties to collaborate on local and national strategies for the management of TMJ arthritis and related orofacial manifestations. Furthermore, we hope that the current recommendations will increase attention to this common manifestation of JIA disease.

6.3 Versus Joint Disorders

MPS often overlaps with joint‐related disorders, such as osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendinopathies, and TMJD, as these conditions present with localized musculoskeletal pain. Both MPS and joint disorders may present with pain during movement, making it challenging to differentiate them based solely on pain location. However, MPS is primarily characterized by the presence of discrete MTrPs, which produce referred pain that may not correspond directly to joint involvement. For example, shoulder pain in MPS may originate from MTrPs in the trapezius or infraspinatus muscles rather than from the glenohumeral joint itself. Similarly, TMJD and MPS can both cause pain in the jaw, neck, and facial muscles. However, TMJD pain is typically localized to the temporomandibular joint and is associated with joint‐specific dysfunctions, such as clicking, locking, or reduced jaw movement. In contrast, MPS‐related pain radiating to the jaw and face is often traced back to MTrPs in muscles like the masseter, temporalis, or sternocleidomastoid. Within the TMJD literature, a model for studying chronic pain has been developed that uses repeated intra‐muscular injections of nerve growth factor (NGF) to induce progressively worsening muscle pain, mechanical hyperalgesia, and functional limitations. NGF contributes to these effects by sensitizing peripheral nociceptive terminals, altering nociceptor transcription, and promoting nociceptor sprouting. With future research, the NGF pain model may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of MPS.

A detailed clinical examination is essential to differentiate MPS from joint disorders, including TMJD. In MPS, palpation of MTrPs reproduces the patient's characteristic pain patterns, while in joint disorders, pain is more closely linked to joint movement and loading. Additionally, radiographic evidence of joint degeneration or inflammation is more commonly seen in joint disorders, whereas MPS is associated with muscle activation and the presence of taut bands.

In cases where both MPS and joint pathology coexist, effective pain management requires addressing both the joint dysfunction and myofascial components. For example, TMJD may coexist with MTrPs in the masticatory muscles, requiring targeted treatments for both joint dysfunction and myofascial pain to achieve optimal results. Please refer to Table 3 for a summary of the key characteristics and distinctions used in the differential diagnosis of MPS.

Physical therapy

Physical therapy plays a prominent role in the treatment of TMD. This therapeutic discipline aims to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and restore motor function using a wide range of techniques, including manual therapy (eg, joint mobilization/manipulations, soft-tissue mobilization), therapeutic exercise, electrotherapy (eg, low-level laser therapy [LLLT], transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS], therapeutic ultrasound, shortwave), dry needling (DN), and acupuncture.

Recommendation 3

Clinical examination should be used to diagnose TMJ arthritis–related dysfunction; a standardized approach is recommended to monitor changes over time (LoE 3, mean ± SD SoR 8.5 ± 2.7). Orofacial examination aids timely diagnosis and facilitates longitudinal monitoring of patients with existing TMJ involvement. While the use of orofacial examination alone for the diagnosis of TMJ involvement in JIA is limited, examination remains an important form of screening to inform the need for further diagnostic evaluation and serves as a low‐cost method for serial follow‐up. Additionally, orofacial examination improves the assessment of response to therapy and the evaluation of treatment options. A standardized orofacial examination approach that complies with consensus‐based standards is recommended. A consensus‐based JIA‐specific orofacial examination protocol was recently published.

Recommendation 4

All patients should be evaluated for dentofacial deformity; a standardized approach for evaluation is recommended to monitor changes in facial morphology over time (LoE 3, mean ± SD SoR 8.9 ± 2.0). Dentofacial deformity is a common complication of JIA. This occurs most frequently in patients who experience TMJ arthritis/involvement prior to reaching skeletal maturity. Assessment of facial morphology can be conducted during a clinical examination or by 3‐dimensional imaging and a conventional radiologic examination, in accordance with consensus‐based standards. Progressive deviation in the mandibular morphology and facial profiles (e.g. mandibular asymmetry/retrognathia) of patients with JIA should prompt further radiographic examination and/or referral.

No protocol exists to guide decision‐making regarding the indications, timing, and frequency of TMJ imaging. Currently, radiologic evaluation of TMJ and facial morphology are variable and provider‐dependent. Assessment of TMJ and dentofacial deformities should adhere to consensus‐based standards.

Treatment ofarthritis (activeinflammation)

Recommendations 5 and 6 (see below) refer to the management of TMJ inflammation (termed "TMJ arthritis") (Table 1). Resolution of TMJ arthritis is considered a key component to optimal TMJ arthritis management.

Oral appliances (OAs) are widely used for treating various types of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs); however, many controversies persist about how they should be designed, how they should be used, and even what their ultimate purpose might be. This article discusses 6 of the current controversies, with a focus on the evidence available to support reasonable practice guidelines for the clinical use of OAs in treating certain TMDs.

Cognitive behavioral therapy

Patients with chronic TMD usually present associated psychological factors that should be managed with specific interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy is one of the treatments proposed to manage patients' thoughts, behaviors, and/or feelings that might exacerbate pain symptoms. It is a noninvasive therapy and unlikely to have adverse effects. The literature reports that cognitive behavioral therapy alone is not better than other interventions, but it is a good complement, especially when adapting the treatment to the psychological characteristics of the patient.–

Recommendation 5

The optimal systemic treatment should be considered for active TMJ arthritis in patients with JIA (LoE 4, mean ± SD SoR 7.9 ± 2.4). Longitudinal observational studies have reported a beneficial effect of systemic immunosuppressive therapy on TMJ arthritis, mandibular growth, and the progression of TMJ deformity. The term "optimal" in this recommendation reflects the fact that the current level of evidence is insufficient to direct the administration of specific modalities. Empiric, early, and aggressive systemic treatment of TMJ arthritis is recommended, as this may reduce TMJ arthritis–related sequelae. Hence, TMJ disease status should be considered when determining the optimal systemic medical therapy to be used to treat all manifestations of JIA.

Recommendation 6a for skeletally immature patients

Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is not recommended as the first‐line treatment for the management of TMJ arthritis in skeletally immature patients. Intraarticular glucocorticoids may be used cautiously in patients with refractory TMJ arthritis and orofacial symptoms. Repeated glucocorticoid injection is not recommended (LoE 2, mean ± SD SoR 8.3 ± 2.5).

### High pain intensity is a risk factor of non-resolving TMD: a three-year follow-up of a patient group in a Norwegian interdisciplinary evaluation program [^4578ed59]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are characterized by pain and dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and the masticatory apparatus. The prevalence of TMD related signs and symptoms has been estimated to be approximately 30% in the general population, predominantly in women. The Orofacial Pain Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) study has reported a 4% incidence per year of first onset of TMD.TMD has been linked to many comorbidities including fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, additionally to trauma and stress symptoms. Significantly higher prevalence of psychosocial factors such as somatic awareness, distress, catastrophizing, pain amplification, and psychosocial stress in subjects with TMD symptoms compared to healthy individuals, was observed in the OPPERA study. Our group have previously reported increased saliva levels of stress hormones together with increased psychometric scoring, decreased pain thresholds and catastrophizing as predictors for TMD.

Several systematic reviews of TMD highlight the lack of evidence on how to base management decisions. In 2013, the Norwegian Ministry of Health established a national interdisciplinary evaluation program for TMD patients at Haukeland University Hospital (HUH) in Bergen, Norway. The missions were to establish an assessment program consisting of several specialists who would characterize the patient group, and establish national guidelines for assessment and treatment of TMD. Chronic oral and facial pain, including TMD has been determined to be multifactorial and therefore should be investigated and treated by an interdisciplinary team in order to arrive at the correct diagnoses and provide appropriate and tailored treatments for the patients. It is preferable that medical specialists, psychologists, physiotherapists, and dental specialists are all included in the team and together assess and treat these patientsto avoid patients being referred from one specialist to another and further subjected to treatment previously tried by other disciplines. The goal of our approach is to evaluate the patient's condition from as many different perspectives as possible and come up with a treatment plan that can be followed up by the patient's GMP. Further, it is important to exclude other diseases, give the patient an explanation of why they are in pain as well as give them different strategies for managing their pain and ensuring the best possible quality of life.

### Bibliometric analysis of research on temporomandibular joint and occlusion from 2000 to 2022 [^81a399c5]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Compared with traditional computed tomography (CT) examination, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has the same accuracy for TMD diagnosis while radiating less and costing less time. However, clinicians are advised to perform CBCT only when the results are quite significant for them to choose treatments due to its poor specificity. A systematic review demonstrated that CBCT may be appropriate for TMD patients with TMJ arthralgia and joint noises.CBCT could be used to assess degenerative joint diseases by detecting bony changes of TMJ. Besides clinical examinations, radiological images could assist clinicians to make a definitive diagnosis of degenerative joint lesions such as osteophytes and sclerosis. Torre A. et al reviewed that CBCT was widely used for TMJ diagnosis, but studies assessing diagnostic thinking efficacy and therapeutic efficacy of CBCT were needed. As for disc displacement disorders, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recognized as the gold standard now. Notably, high-quality MR images, open-mouth images and consistent definition of normal disc position could positively affect observers' performances.

Treatments for TMDs are various, yet no common sense and no convincing clinical practice guidelines based on evidence exist at present. The most cited reference on the diagnosis and treatments for TMDs and Pficer JK (2017) both mentioned occlusal splints as a conservative treatment for TMDs. It was revealed that occlusal stabilization splints had more significant effects in short term than other control groups and recommended that more well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on long-term effects were needed. Significantly, a much-referenced publication about oral splints referred to the placebo theory of oral splints. Occlusal splints might improve TMDs by placebo effects because non-occluding/placebo splints could also positively affect TMD patients in most cases. However, TMD patients with occlusal splints showed greater treatment satisfaction, although placebo splints seemed to work as well as occlusal ones in reducing TMD pain. Moreover, a recent study found that the efficacy of placebo splints might not maintain for long. Oral splints were probably more effective than placebo, but the mechanism was still unclear.
