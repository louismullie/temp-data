## Question

What research studies are yet to be done regarding PSMA PET scan?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which research studies are still needed on PSMA PET scans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about evidence gaps that affect clinical outcomes and trial design. Then, I should verify technical and biological uncertainties that influence diagnostic performance and interpretation. Next, I will examine standardization, reporting, and response criteria needs. After that, I should consider scenario-specific applications where data are thin. Finally, I will assess cost-effectiveness, implementation, and AI-enabled workflows, and propose concrete study designs to close the gaps [^116F1rhb] [^113Vi6tC] [^115EGjkJ].

> Let me first confirm the highest-priority gap: robust, prospective trials linking PSMA PET use to patient-relevant outcomes are limited, and stage migration complicates application of legacy trial data built on conventional imaging; we need randomized, multicenter studies comparing PSMA PET to standard imaging or alternative advanced modalities with long-term endpoints, not just diagnostic accuracy or management change rates [^113YzGg7] [^116F1rhb] [^113Vi6tC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about survival benefits simply from better detection; I need to check whether phase 3 or large prospective cohorts have demonstrated overall survival or cancer-specific mortality improvements when management is guided by PSMA PET, and the emerging umbrella reviews still call for expansive, multicenter validation with hard endpoints and longer follow-up to substantiate outcome impact [^115EGjkJ] [^115zT8gv].

> I should confirm the prognostic and predictive utility of PSMA PET metrics; current high-level reviews emphasize that prognostic implications of PSMA PET have not been studied systematically, and although higher PSMA expression often correlates with adverse biology, prospective trials embedding PSMA PET as a stratification biomarker with validated oncological endpoints remain a key unmet need [^117UgZrP] [^115rC7Ay].

> Next, I will examine technical optimization and tracer comparative effectiveness; head-to-head prospective studies across widely used ligands with harmonized protocols and histopathological reference standards are sparse, cost-effectiveness analyses caution that results may vary by tracer choice and health system, and the translational pipeline is crowded with "me-too" agents without definitive superiority data, underscoring the need for rigorous comparative studies [^112fvyuD] [^113m3hez] [^1123Do3R].

> Wait, let me verify the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on PSMA expression and uptake; short-term ADT can cause a transient "PSMA flare", whereas long-term ADT tends to reduce uptake and potentially yield false negatives, yet standardized imaging windows and prospective serial-imaging protocols aligned with PSA and testosterone kinetics are not established, creating a critical gap in response assessment and timing of scans [^113Vi6tC] [^111F3Tdc] [^116pWY8R].

> I will now examine unspecific bone uptake with particular tracers; systematic reviews show UBUs are common, especially with 18F-PSMA-1007, but mechanisms remain elusive and histopathological validation versus true metastases is lacking, risking over-staging if misclassified; hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the "18F > 18F > 99… " sequence in the earlier trace reflected a comparative prevalence pattern, but that appears to be a transcription artifact rather than data, so I should correct that and emphasize the validated finding that UBU prevalence and topography vary by tracer and require careful adjudication and confirmatory workup [^114mMTS4] [^114XxtgS].

> Next, I should review standardization, validation, and quality assurance needs; despite growing guideline consensus, we still need harmonized acquisition parameters, structured reporting systems with demonstrated inter- and intra-reader reproducibility, and validated PET-based response criteria that integrate with clinical endpoints; PSMA-RADS and expert templates are promising, but broader adoption, training, and external validation remain necessary [^117URmQS] [^116ppqZP] [^116Zxa5F] [^115ZdMv9].

> Let me consider specific clinical scenarios where evidence remains preliminary; in active surveillance selection, small retrospective series suggest management influence but larger prospective cohorts are needed to define when and how PSMA PET meaningfully reclassifies risk; similarly, proPSMA-informed management changes and bone scan discordance highlight diagnostic advantages, yet pathways that translate these findings into improved survival or quality-of-life outcomes still require prospective validation [^113NyLgZ] [^1116ixAe] [^113VF3Nd] [^112x1QtZ] [^111QxxTv].

> I should double-check health-economic and implementation questions; cost-effectiveness is sensitive to tracer, price, workflow, and health-system context, and concerns persist about overuse without outcome data, so pragmatic trials and real-world implementation studies that capture downstream costs, access, and equity are essential to guide adoption [^112fvyuD] [^114SttK2].

> I need to ensure we do not overlook foundational biology; deepening our understanding of PSMA biology, off-target expression, and ligand pharmacokinetics could clarify false-positive patterns, heterogeneity of uptake, and opportunities to personalize theranostics across disease states and possibly beyond prostate cancer [^113SUvFQ] [^1149UXSm].

> Next, I should review interpretation variability and AI augmentation; although expert interobserver agreement can be high with structured frameworks, reader variability persists for small or low-uptake lesions, and most AI tools lack external validation and prospective impact data, so carefully designed multicenter studies must test whether AI measurably improves diagnostic accuracy, workflow, and outcomes [^115ZdMv9] [^1139oU8S].

> Hold on, I should verify that the proposed research roadmap is aligned with consensus trial-design guidance; priority studies include randomized comparisons of PSMA PET–guided versus standard imaging–guided management with survival and patient-reported outcomes, prospective head-to-head tracer evaluations with histopathology and harmonized protocols, longitudinal ADT-timing cohorts with serial PET and biochemical markers, standardized response-criteria validation linked to clinical endpoints, and implementation science with cost-effectiveness across systems, all underpinned by structured reporting and central reads to mitigate stage-migration bias and ensure reproducible interpretation [^116F1rhb] [^117URmQS] [^115zT8gv].

Key research gaps for PSMA PET include: **prospective trials on survival and quality of life** [^113YzGg7] to confirm outcome benefits, and **standardized response criteria** (e.g. RECIP 1.0) [^111gBdJe] validated in large cohorts. Additional priorities are head-to-head comparisons with WB MRI [^113Vi6tC], cost-effectiveness across healthcare systems [^112fvyuD], and studies on ADT timing effects [^111F3Tdc] and unspecific bone uptakes [^114mMTS4]. Research is also needed on PSMA PET's role in active surveillance [^113NyLgZ], **AI-assisted interpretation** [^1139oU8S], and integration into clinical trials [^116F1rhb] and guidelines [^117URmQS].

---

## Clinical impact and patient outcomes

Prospective trials on **survival and quality of life** [^113YzGg7] remain lacking to determine how PSMA PET-guided management affects overall survival, progression-free survival [^115EGjkJ], and quality of life in prostate cancer patients [^112qYPvv]. In addition, **active surveillance** [^113NyLgZ] requires larger-scale prospective studies to define how PSMA PET can aid in selecting and monitoring patients within surveillance protocols [^113VF3Nd].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and comparative studies

Head-to-head comparisons are still needed — specifically **prospective, randomized, multicenter trials** comparing PSMA PET/CT with whole-body MRI (WB MRI) [^113Vi6tC] for pelvic nodal and metastatic disease detection. In addition, **unspecific bone uptakes (UBUs)** [^114mMTS4] warrant research to clarify their pathophysiology and to establish strategies for distinguishing them from true metastases [^114XxtgS].

---

## Standardization and response assessment

Standardized response criteria such as **RECIP 1.0** [^111gBdJe] should be validated in larger prospective cohorts to enable consistent interpretation and clinical decision-making. Additionally, **interobserver variability** [^116ppqZP] needs further study to measure the reproducibility of PSMA PET interpretations across varied clinical settings and experience levels [^115ZdMv9].

---

## Cost-effectiveness and healthcare integration

Cost-effectiveness analyses across diverse healthcare systems are required to justify **widespread adoption and reimbursement** of PSMA PET imaging [^112fvyuD] [^114SttK2]. Research on **integration into clinical trials** [^116F1rhb] should address stage migration, response assessment, and statistical considerations when incorporating PSMA PET [^117HrACB].

---

## Technological advancements and artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) requires prospective studies to evaluate the clinical impact, utility, and external validation of **AI tools** [^1139oU8S] in PSMA PET interpretation. In parallel, **novel tracers and radiopharmaceuticals** [^115bDjmv] need continued investigation to improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic outcomes.

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and patient populations

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) merits studies to determine the **optimal timing** [^111F3Tdc] of PSMA PET imaging relative to ADT initiation or cessation, including consideration of the potential "flare" phenomenon [^113Vi6tC]. Additionally, **non-prostatic malignancies** [^113SUvFQ] require further research to define PSMA PET's role in cancers such as renal cell carcinoma and its impact on clinical management [^11434H7G].

### Considerations on integrating prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography imaging into clinical prostate cancer trials by national clinical trials network cooperative groups [^116F1rhb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

As prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) becomes increasingly available in the United States, the greater sensitivity of the technology compared to conventional imaging poses challenges for clinical trials. The NCI Clinical Imaging Steering Committee (CISC) PSMA PET Working Group was convened to identify these challenges in various clinical scenarios and to develop consensus recommendations on how best to integrate PSMA PET into ongoing and upcoming National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) trials.

- **Methods**: NCI CISC and NCI Genitourinary Steering Committee members and leadership nominated clinicians, biostatisticians, patient advocates, and other imaging experts for inclusion in the PSMA PET Working Group. From April to July 2021, the working group met independently and in conjunction with the CISC to frame challenges, including stage migration, response assessment, trial logistics, and statistical challenges, and to discuss proposed solutions. An anonymous, open-ended survey was distributed to members to collect feedback on challenges faced. Representatives from each NCTN group were invited to present an overview of affected trials. From these discussions, the consensus document was developed and circulated for multiple rounds of feedback from both the Working Group and CISC.

- **Results**: The consensus document outlines the key challenges for clinical prostate cancer trials resulting from the increasing availability of PSMA PET. We discuss implications for patient selection and [the document continues].

Even though prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) is more accurate than conventional imaging in prostate cancer patients, its impact on patient-relevant outcomes is unknown. We argue that more evidence is required before using PSMA-PET-CT as the standard of care for staging.

### The future of PSMA PET and WB MRI as next-generation imaging tools in prostate cancer [^113Vi6tC]. Nature Reviews Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Radiolabelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based PET-CT has been shown in numerous studies to be superior to conventional imaging in the detection of nodal or distant metastatic lesions. 68 Ga-PSMA PET-CT is now recommended by many guidelines for the detection of biochemically relapsed disease after radical local therapy. PSMA radioligands can also function as radiotheranostics, and Lu-PSMA has been shown to be a potential new line of treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Whole-body (WB) MRI has been shown to have a high diagnostic performance in the detection and monitoring of metastatic bone disease. Prospective, randomized, multicentre studies comparing 68 Ga-PSMA PET-CT and WB MRI for pelvic nodal and metastatic disease detection are yet to be performed.

Challenges for interpretation of PSMA include tracer trapping in non-target tissues and also urinary excretion of tracers, which confounds image interpretation at the vesicoureteral junction. Additionally, studies have shown how long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) affects PSMA expression and could, therefore, reduce tracer uptake and visibility of PSMA+ lesions. Furthermore, ADT of short duration might increase PSMA expression, leading to the PSMA flare phenomenon, which makes the accurate monitoring of treatment response to ADT with PSMA PET challenging.

Scan duration, detection of incidentalomas, and presence of metallic implants are some of the major challenges with WB MRI. Emerging data support the wider adoption of PSMA PET and WB MRI for diagnosis and staging.

### A cost-effectiveness study of PSMA-PET/CT for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer [^112fvyuD]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, despite utilizing different input models, the PSMA-PET/CT outcomes are based on a limited patient sample. Therefore, the exact numbers may change using a larger cohort, and the phase 3 data is highly anticipated to support the present findings. Second, our initial study and the external PRIMARY1 trial used different tracers ([18 F]PSMA-1007 vs. [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11), which could lead to different scan results. Third, the model used Dutch healthcare costs, and since intervention costs vary by country, this can impact cost-effectiveness outcomes. Moreover, at €1129 per PSMA-PET/CT, we are at the lower price range. To expand PSMA-PET/CT use in earlier settings, strategies to further reduce costs, such as using one bed position scans and lower injected activities, are needed.

### Applications of artificial intelligence in PSMA PET/CT for prostate cancer imaging [^1139oU8S]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has emerged as an important imaging technique for prostate cancer. The use of PSMA PET/CT is rapidly increasing, while the number of nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists to interpret these scans is limited. Additionally, there is variability in interpretation among readers. Artificial intelligence techniques, including traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms, are being used to address these challenges and provide additional insights from the images. The aim of this scoping review was to summarize the available research on the development and applications of AI in PSMA PET/CT for prostate cancer imaging. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 26 publications were included in the synthesis.

The included studies focus on different aspects of artificial intelligence in PSMA PET/CT, including detection of primary tumor, local recurrence and metastatic lesions, lesion classification, tumor quantification, and prediction/prognostication. Several studies show similar performances of artificial intelligence algorithms compared to human interpretation. Few artificial intelligence tools are approved for use in clinical practice. Major limitations include the lack of external validation and prospective design. Demonstrating the clinical impact and utility of artificial intelligence tools is crucial for their adoption.

### Novel framework for treatment response evaluation using PSMA PET/CT in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (RECIP 1.0): An international multicenter study [^111gBdJe]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In metastatic prostate cancer, treatment response is typically evaluated using conventional imaging (CT and bone scanning) according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG3) guidelines. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)–targeted PET/CT is a novel imaging technique that showed greater detection accuracy than conventional imaging in patients with high-risk primary prostate cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for different clinical settings in men with prostate cancer. However, there is little evidence for the prognostic value of PSMA PET/CT for response assessment in men with advanced prostate cancer.

In our clinical experience using PSMA PET/CT for response evaluation of systemic metastatic castration-specific prostate cancer (mCRPC) treatments, a decrease in total disease burden can coincide with the appearance of new lesions. This scenario, referred to as heterogeneous response, often leaves the treating physician in a clinical dilemma. Considering the rapidly evolving era of targeted treatments for mCRPC, accurate and early response assessment is urgently needed, but standardized response evaluation criteria for PSMA PET imaging have not been developed yet.

[177 Lu]Lu-PSMA (177 Lu-PSMA) is a small-molecule inhibitor that binds with high affinity to PSMA and delivers β-radiation. The randomized TheraP trial demonstrated superior prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses and progression-free survival for 177 Lu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel. In the phase III VISION trial, 177 Lu-PSMA-617 prolonged overall survival.

### Impact of long-term androgen deprivation therapy on PSMA ligand PET/CT in patients with castration-sensitive prostate cancer [^111F3Tdc]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The detection of recurrent prostate cancer (PC) has always been challenging using conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Consequently, there has been a need for new imaging tools with improved sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis. In this context, nuclear imaging targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has received increased attention. PSMA is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in the majority of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinomas.

In May 2011, the PSMA ligand 68 Ga-PSMA-11 was introduced for the clinical imaging of PC at our institution. Since then, positron emission tomography (PET) using 68 Ga-PSMA-11 and alternative PSMA ligands has been regarded as a significant step forward in the diagnosis of recurrent PC. The first studies indicated that this novel method is superior to alternative imaging modalities used for the detection of recurrent PC. Later studies, including larger patient cohorts, confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.

One of the most important questions in PSMA imaging concerns the role of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). It is known from preclinical experiments that short-term ADT can quantitatively increase PSMA expression in castration-sensitive PC cells. This effect was shown with analogues of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) as well as with antiandrogen agents such as bicalutamide and enzalutamide. In addition, Hope et al. demonstrated in one patient that PSMA ligand uptake in PC lesions significantly increased with ADT.

### The homunculus of unspecific bone uptakes associated with PSMA-targeted tracers: A systematic review-based definition [^114mMTS4]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). High credibility.

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-targeted Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has revolutionized prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and treatment, offering superior diagnostic accuracy over traditional methods and enabling theragnostic applications. However, a significant diagnostic challenge has emerged with identifying unspecific bone uptakes (UBUs), which could lead to over-staging and inappropriate treatment decisions if misinterpreted. This systematic review explores the phenomenon of UBUs in PCa patients undergoing PSMA-PET imaging.

- **Methods**: Studies assessing the prevalence, topographical distribution, and potential clinical implications of UBUs were selected according to the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method, and evaluated with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool.

- **Results**: The percentage of PCa patients with UBUs on PSMA-PET scans ranged from 0 to 71.7%, depending on the radiopharmaceutical used, with [¹⁸F]PSMA-1007 showing the highest incidence. The ribs are the primary site of UBUs across all PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals. The spine is the second most frequent UBU site for [⁶⁸Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, [¹⁸F]DCFPyL, and [¹⁸F]rhPSMA-7, while the pelvic girdle represents the second most frequent site for [¹⁸F]PSMA-1007. The average maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUV max) of UBUs varied from 3.4 to 7.7 and was generally lower than bone metastases.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings underscore the need for heightened awareness and precise interpretation of UBUs to avoid over-staging and inappropriate treatment decisions.

### Utility of PET to appropriately select patients for PSMA-targeted theranostics [^115rC7Ay]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The majority of aggressive prostate cancers overexpress the transmembrane protein prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA is, therefore, an attractive target for drug development. Over the last decade, numerous PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals for imaging and therapy have been developed and investigated in theranostic combination.

PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals for imaging have been primarily developed for PET. PSMA PET provides whole-body evaluation of the degree of PSMA expression on tumors and potentially provides a method to better select patients for PSMA-targeted therapy. Numerous PSMA-targeted therapeutic agents using β- or α-particle emitters are under study in clinical trials. In particular, the β-particle-emitting radioisotope 177Lu bound to PSMA-targeted small molecules have ongoing and completed late-stage clinical trials in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

To define the most appropriate patient group for PSMA-targeted therapeutics, multiple studies have investigated PSMA and FDG PET/CT to establish PET parameters as predictive and prognostic biomarkers. This article discusses recent clinical trials that examine the optimal use of PET for the selection of patients for PSMA-targeted therapeutics and provides an integrative overview of choice of PET tracer(s), targeting molecule, therapeutic radioisotope, nonradioactive therapy, and cancer type (prostate or non-prostate).

### A perspective on the evolving story of PSMA biology, PSMA-based imaging, and endoradiotherapeutic strategies [^113SUvFQ]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, we cover the evolution of knowledge on the biology of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and its translation to therapy. The usual key to discovery is a realistic model for experimentation and for testing a hypothesis. A realistic model is especially needed in the case of the human prostate, which differs significantly from the prostate of species often used as research models.

We will emphasize the genetic characterization of PSMA, the nature of the PSMA protein, and its role as a carboxypeptidase, with differing important substrates and products in different tissues. We give special prominence to the importance of PSMA as a target for imaging and therapy in prostate cancer and its underdeveloped role for imaging and targeting the neovasculature of tumors other than prostate cancer. Lastly, we bring attention to its importance in other nonprostatic tissues.

### The homunculus of unspecific bone uptakes associated with PSMA-targeted tracers: a systematic review-based definition [^114XxtgS]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

The present systematic review highlights the complexity of the UBUs phenomenon in PET/CT scans utilizing PSMA-targeted ligands. Consistent with prior literature, we identified [18 F]PSMA-1007 as the tracer associated with a significantly higher rate of UBUs, especially in rib areas, across all examined settings. This topic is of increasing relevance as the clinical use of [18 F]PSMA-1007 is rising due to several reasons, including cyclotron-based production (which allows synthesizing larger quantities of [18 F]PSMA compared to [68 Ga]Ga generators), the longer half-life, the lower positron range, and the higher signal-to-background ratio. Despite [18 F]PSMA-1007 being the tracer most frequently related to the presence of UBUs, renally excreted radiopharmaceuticals might also be associated with this phenomenon. In the included studies, the percentage of patients with equivocal bony findings ranged from 0 to 23.9%. Similarly, in the OSPREY trial, which included a bone biopsy for 44 patients undergoing restaging for disease recurrence with [18 F]DCFPyL, false-positive findings were observed in about 15% of the patients included.

The precise pathophysiological mechanisms behind UBUs remain elusive. The initial hypothesis of free fluorine involvement has been challenged, with the chemical composition-driven affinity being partially responsible. Nevertheless, PSMA radioligands with hydrophilic compositions also demonstrate false-positive bone findings, suggesting this phenomenon is not unique to [18 F]PSMA-1007. Furthermore, healthy bone marrow lacks PSMA imm

### Standardized template for clinical reporting of PSMA PET/CT scans [^116Zxa5F]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

An independent, multidisciplinary panel of global expert physicians involved in prostate cancer (PCa) patient care, including radiologists, medical oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, radiation oncologists, and urologists from both academic institutions and community practices, convened throughout several meetings to discuss reporting practices across institutions and countries. The panel participants identified gaps and the implementation of PSMA PET guidelines to aid the understanding of practices across settings.

Common themes, data elements, and their relationship to prognostication and relevance to treatment consideration were identified. From these discussions, a concise set of reporting criteria deemed most relevant across a multidisciplinary platform intended to aid patient management decisions was agreed upon in the context of PSMA PET/CT imaging. The main output was the development of an easily implementable, user-friendly, standard PSMA PET/CT reporting template containing the minimum necessary information for radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians to provide to referring physicians. Results from panel participant discussions are presented.

### Expanding the role of small-molecule PSMA ligands beyond PET staging of prostate cancer [^114xsDYf]. Nature Reviews Urology (2020). High credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) is rapidly being established as arguably the leading contemporary imaging modality in the management of prostate cancer. Outside of its conventional use in the de novo staging of localized disease and detection of biochemical recurrence, additional applications for the use of PSMA PET are emerging. Uptake of PSMA tracers in other genitourinary malignancies, particularly renal cell carcinoma, has led to new fields of investigation. Therapeutic delivery of radiolabeled PSMA small molecules has shown considerable promise in advanced prostate cancer.

The ability to use the same molecule for imaging and therapy — known as theranostics — enables a highly personalized approach. PSMA PET can also have a considerable influence in the selection and guidance of radiotherapy fields for high-risk and re-disease. Intriguingly, changes in the intensity of PSMA uptake during systemic therapy might provide early response assessment or novel insight into the biological responses of genitourinary malignancies to treatment. An evolving range of radiolabeled PSMA radiopharmaceuticals is emerging in the multiple facets of modern clinical practice.

### Prostate cancer radioligand therapy: PSMA and beyond, current landscape and future directions [^115whfLz]. Current Oncology Reports (2025).

- **Purpose of review**: There has been a rapid increase in the use and investigation of radioligand therapies for prostate cancer. This review summarizes and synthesizes the prostate cancer radioligand landscape. It highlights the challenges facing optimal radioligand use and outlines approaches to improve the efficacy of this therapeutic class.

- **Recent findings**: The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed radioligand 177 Lu-PSMA-617 improves survival in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after chemotherapy and is now a standard of care treatment option for these patients. Published and ongoing trials promise to expand the use of radioligand therapies in prostate cancer. These trials highlight the potential of novel radioligand targets, alternate radioisotopes, and combination therapy approaches to improve radioligand efficacy. Emerging radioligands, novel combination therapies, optimized patient selection, and dose-personalization promise to improve outcomes and expand the use of radioligand therapies in prostate cancer.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: an umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^115EGjkJ]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). High credibility.

The application of PSMA-PET/CT has expanded significantly since its introduction, particularly in the staging of newly diagnosed prostate cancer, assessment of biochemical recurrence, and evaluation of treatment response. PSMA-PET/CT demonstrates superior accuracy over conventional imaging (CT + bone scan) in detecting pelvic lymph node metastases, with sensitivity rates of 85% versus 38%, and distant metastases, where sensitivity is 95% compared to 74%.

In a multicenter randomized trial (proPSMA), PSMA-PET/CT altered treatment plans in 28% of high-risk patients, such as shifting from curative-intent surgery to systemic therapy due to occult metastases. PSMA-PET/CT identifies lesions at lower PSA levels (0.2–0.5 ng/mL) with a detection rate of 45–58%, far exceeding that of conventional imaging (≤ 20%).

RECIP 1.0 criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in PSMA PET/CT) enable standardized quantification of tumor burden changes. A post-therapy decline in PSMA-positive tumor volume ≥ 30% correlates with improved overall survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Thus, PSMA-PET/CT plays a crucial role in guiding therapeutic decisions and improving patient outcomes.

### Expanding the role of PSMA PET in active surveillance [^1116ixAe]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death after lung cancer. A variety of treatment options are now available for men with localized disease. Active surveillance (AS) has become a widely used strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer. It aims to avoid overtreatment, while maintaining an acceptable risk associated with treatment delay should their cancer necessitate intervention. Patients remain under close surveillance through structured programs with regular follow-up consisting of PSA testing, clinical examination, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and repeat prostate biopsies, with curative treatment being prompted by pre-defined thresholds.

Accurate grading at the time of diagnosis is fundamental to risk stratification and treatment decision-making, particularly for men being considered for AS. With the introduction of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), there has been considerable improvement in sensitivity and specificity for the detection and staging of primary or recurrent prostate cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that tumor uptake, represented by PSMA expression, is strongly correlated with the Gleason Score of the primary prostatic tumor. This emerging imaging modality is a useful diagnostic tool to help identify men with clinically significant prostate cancer and, therefore, has the potential to improve the selection of men suitable for active surveillance.

Multiple studies have investigated cohorts of men on active surveillance.

### Expanding the role of PSMA PET in active surveillance [^113VF3Nd]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Accurate grading at the time of diagnosis is fundamental to risk stratification and treatment decision-making, particularly for men being considered for active surveillance (AS). With the introduction of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), there has been considerable improvement in sensitivity and specificity for the detection and staging of clinically significant prostate cancer. Our study aims to determine the role of PSMA PET/CT in men with newly diagnosed low or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer to better select men for AS.

- **Method**: This is a retrospective single-center study performed from January 2019 to October 2022. The study includes men identified from the electronic medical record system who had undergone a PSMA PET/CT following a newly diagnosed low or favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. The primary outcome was to assess the change in management for men being considered for AS following PSMA PET/CT results based on PSMA PET characteristics.

- **Results**: In total, there were 11 of 30 men (36.67%) who were assigned management by AS, and 19 of 30 men (63.33%) who had definitive treatment. Fifteen of the 19 men that needed treatment had concerning features on PSMA PET/CT results. Of the 15 men with concerning features on PSMA PET, 9 (60%) were found to have adverse pathological features on final prostatectomy features.

- **Conclusion**: This retrospective study suggests that PSMA PET/CT has the potential to influence the management of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who would otherwise be appropriate for AS.

### Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography for staging prostate cancer [^116ELT7G]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Molecular imaging with PET/CT targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor is increasingly utilized in men with prostate cancer (PCa), with clinical indications now expanding beyond biochemical recurrence. PSMA PET/CT often detects sub-centimetre size pathologic nodes and low-volume bone marrow disease that are occult on conventional imaging when the lesion does not cause sclerosis or osteoblastic reaction in surrounding bone. This review focuses on recent evidence for PSMA PET/CT in initial disease staging.

Several recent studies, including a large randomized trial, have evaluated the clinical impact of PSMA PET/CT in the initial staging of PCa. PSMA PET/CT is more sensitive and accurate than the conventional imaging standards of CT and bone scan. A change in treatment plan or modality of therapy occurs frequently when PSMA PET/CT forms part of the diagnostic algorithm. Hybrid PET/MRI also has potential utility, particularly in evaluating pelvic disease, though the evidence base remains very limited.

PSMA PET/CT has emerged as a new standard in the primary staging of PCa. Reimbursement by national funding bodies and incorporation into international clinical guidelines is anticipated within the next few years.

### Psma pet/ct for primary staging of prostate cancer - an updated overview [^115zT8gv]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT for primary staging of prostate cancer is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to simultaneously assess whole-body disease burden with superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastases compared to conventional imaging. PSMA PET, in combination with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), improves the sensitivity of assessing extra-prostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion compared to mpMRI alone. It may serve as a second-line modality for image-guided biopsy in selected patients with negative mpMRI and/or negative primary biopsies. The superior diagnostic accuracy of PSMA PET/CT affects clinical decision-making, resulting in a change of clinical management in one-fourth of patients compared to conventional imaging. However, at present, the effect of implementing PSMA PET/CT for primary staging on patient outcomes is not clear, and prospective studies are warranted.

There are several PSMA tracers with similar performance and minor individual pharmacokinetic differences, such as a higher rate of unspecific bone uptake with 18F-PSMA-1007, but on the other hand, lower urinary excretion, which could provide an advantage in the detection of local recurrence. Proper training of the reporting physicians and knowledge of the pitfalls of the specific PSMA tracer used is of utmost importance for high-quality reading. This article aims to offer an overview of the literature and an update on the status of PSMA PET/CT for primary staging of prostate cancer.

### European association of nuclear medicine focus 5: Consensus on molecular imaging and theranostics in prostate cancer [^117URmQS]. European Urology (2024). Low credibility.

In prostate cancer (PCa), questions remain on indications for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and PSMA radioligand therapy, integration of advanced imaging in nomogram-based decision-making, dosimetry, and development of new theranostic applications.

We aimed to critically review developments in molecular hybrid imaging and systemic radioligand therapy to reach a multidisciplinary consensus on the state of the art in PCa.

The results of a systematic literature search informed a two-round Delphi process with a panel of 28 PCa experts in medical or radiation oncology, urology, radiology, medical physics, and nuclear medicine. The results were discussed and ratified in a consensus meeting.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Forty-eight statements were scored on a Likert agreement scale, and six as ranking options. Agreement statements were analysed using the RAND appropriateness method. Ranking statements were analysed using weighted summed scores.

- **Results and limitations**: After two Delphi rounds, there was consensus on 42/48 (87.5%) of the statements. The expert panel recommends PSMA PET to be used for staging the majority of patients with unfavourable intermediate and high risk, and for restaging of suspected recurrent PCa. There was consensus that oligometastatic disease should be defined as up to five metastases, even using advanced imaging modalities. The group agreed that [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-PSMA should not be administered only after progression.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: an umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^112s9VdC]. Current Oncology Reports (2025).

PSMA-PET/CT imaging has revolutionized the approach to diagnosing and staging prostate cancer. Traditional imaging modalities, such as bone scans and CT scans, have limitations in sensitivity, particularly for detecting metastatic disease. For example, PSMA-PET/CT can more accurately identify locoregional lymph node metastases and distant metastases, thereby optimizing clinical staging and treatment planning for patients.

PSMA-PET/CT utilizes a radioligand that specifically targets the PSMA, which is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells, enhancing the detection of both local and distant metastases. Studies have shown that PSMA-PET/CT can identify metastatic lesions that may be missed by conventional imaging techniques, leading to changes in treatment strategies for a significant proportion of patients. PSMA-PET/CT achieves high-sensitivity imaging through radioligands targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a mechanism widely supported in the literature.

PSMA is highly expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells, and radioligands (e.g. 68 Ga- or 18 F-labeled PSMA inhibitors) specifically bind to this antigen, enhancing the detection of both local and distant metastatic lesions. For example, a study in high-risk prostate cancer patients demonstrated that [18 F] PSMA-PET/CT exhibited superior sensitivity compared to conventional bone scans (BS) in detecting bone metastases, altering the CHAARTED risk stratification in 12.8% of patients and subsequently influencing treatment decisions.

### Radiotheranostics in advanced prostate cancer: Current and future directions [^115bDjmv]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The discovery of small molecules that target the extracellular domain of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has led to advancements in diagnostic imaging and the development of precision radiopharmaceutical therapies. In this review, we present the available existing data and highlight the key ongoing clinical evaluations of PSMA-based imaging in the management of primary, biochemically recurrent, and metastatic prostate cancer. We also discuss clinical studies that explore the use of PSMA-based radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) in metastatic prostate cancer and forthcoming trials that investigate PSMA RPT in earlier disease states. Multidisciplinary collaboration in clinical trial design and therapeutic administration is critical to the continued progress of this evolving radiotheranostics field.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: An umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^111CVtSU]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

In summary, the advent of PSMA-PET/CT imaging for patients with high-risk prostate cancer marks a noteworthy evolution in the areas of staging, treatment modification, and the associated survival advantages of this ailment. This review emphasizes the clinical significance of PSMA-PET/CT, highlighting its capacity to refine the management of prostate cancer through precise detection of disease dissemination and informed treatment planning. This pioneering imaging technique supports a more tailored therapeutic approach, which is increasingly crucial in an era characterized by personalized medicine.

Nonetheless, in light of these encouraging results, it is vital to recognize the limitations and barriers to the integration of PSMA-PET/CT into everyday clinical practice. Challenges such as the necessity for standardized imaging protocols, discrepancies in the availability of radiotracers, and the urgent need for thorough training of healthcare professionals in interpreting these sophisticated imaging findings must be addressed. Furthermore, while the existing evidence is compelling, it requires further validation through expansive, multicenter trials that can offer a more profound insight into the long-term survival benefits linked to PSMA-PET/CT-guided management.

From a professional standpoint, it is essential to strike a balance among the varied research findings and viewpoints regarding PSMA-PET/CT. While the technology presents significant benefits, it is equally important to contextualize these results within the broader framework of prostate cancer treatment.

### Identifying and navigating bottlenecks in the translation of novel radiopharmaceuticals: A perspective [^1123Do3R]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

The proliferation of "me-too" tracers, particularly in areas like PSMA and FAP targeting, has led to an oversaturation of the scientific and publication landscape. A plethora of tracers with nearly identical characteristics are clogging the translational pipeline without offering true advances over clinically implemented targeting concepts. Such radiopharmaceuticals are often developed in pursuit of proprietary IP via incremental structural changes compared to the established gold standards, aiming to capture a share of the booming theranostics market. However, this mindset risks not truly contributing to scientific advancement or the improvement of patient care.

True innovation solves an unsolved problem and provides substantial improvement in tracer characteristics, such as specificity, stability, tumor targeting, diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. One example of groundbreaking innovation has recently been published and should encourage the scientific community to set a higher bar. The self-assessment should determine whether a tracer demonstrates unique biological, diagnostic, or therapeutic benefits over established agents, thus justifying the resources for development and translation.

- **Publication perspective**: Journals and reviewers should vigilantly differentiate incremental improvements from significant advancements. Comparative data of "promising new tracers" with gold-standard tracers is essential to ensure that the resources for development and translation are justified.

### Highlights of the 30th annual congress of the EANM, Vienna 2017: "Yes we can - make nuclear medicine great again" [^112ZGYTi]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer imaging and therapy, driven by the success of PSMA ligands, has been a well-represented topic throughout all EANM meetings over recent years. The high interest and scientific focus are exemplified by a number of excellent presentations dealing with RT planning, use of PET/MRI, and novel prostate cancer targeting radiopharmaceuticals.

An excellent study was presented by Calais et al. in collaboration between the US and Germany, reviewing 252 patients with early biochemical relapse after prostatectomy who had been scanned with 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT to define the impact on RT planning. The 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT affected salvage radiation therapy planning in 55% of patients with early biochemical recurrence (PSA < 1 ng/ml) after radical prostatectomy.

Schwarzenboeck et al. (Rostock, Germany) analyzed the use of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT in 38 patients with prostate cancer at high risk or persistence of biochemical recurrence who were candidates for radiation therapy. In about 70% of these patients, there was a clear direct impact on radiation therapy in terms of a change in the planning target volume and the addition of booster doses. Another interesting study was presented by Freitag et al. (Munich, Germany) on the use of 18 F-PSMA-1007 PET/MRI combined with integrated multiparametric PET/MRI for imaging prostate.

### Bridging the imaging gap: PSMA PET/CT has a high impact on treatment planning in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence-a narrative review of the literature [^115XNgAP]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

68 Ga- and 18 F-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) molecules have created new opportunities for addressing unmet diagnostic needs in prostate cancer. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of studies examining the role of PSMA PET in treatment planning for prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR).

Methods involved searching Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central for relevant articles. After excluding those that did not meet the required criteria, we included 12 publications that reported on the impact of PSMA PET on the treatment plan for prostate cancer patients with BCR.

Results: All studies in our review emphasized the impact of PSMA PET images on therapy management in prostate cancer patients with BCR. The overall impact of PSMA PET/CT on therapy management varied between 30% and 76% among the 1,346 patients included in the review. Upstaging was reported in 32%-67% of the patients. Patients with low prostate-specific antigen values (< 0.5 ng/mL) also demonstrated positive lesions, which could not have been detected using conventional imaging techniques.

Important modifications to the original treatment plan included the avoidance of systemic therapy (17%-40%) and the application of PET-directed local therapy (in ≤ 60% of the patients). PSMA imaging demonstrated a high clinical impact in patients with BCR, with modifications to the original treatment plan occurring among half the patients. Detecting recurrence in BCR can prevent unnecessary toxicity and lead to individualized therapy.

### High interobserver agreement on PSMA PET/CT even in the absence of clinical data [^115ZdMv9]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

We observed high concordance rates among multiple observers when applying a structured framework for interpreting 68 Ga-labeled PSMA PET. Of note, scan findings remained nearly identical when clinical data were not presented, supporting the notion that even in the absence of relevant patient characteristics, expert readers still achieve a high concordance rate when interpreting PSMA-targeted scans. These observations may be of relevance in a busy PET practice with a high volume of men scanned with PSMA PET/CT or in the context of central imaging review in clinical trials with readers who are blinded to clinical data. Nonetheless, in clinical routine, readers should ensure that patient data are available at the time of scan interpretation.

### Consensus statements on PSMA PET/CT response assessment criteria in prostate cancer [^116pWY8R]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

All consensus statements were developed following the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESRO) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) consensus recommendations for classification of oligometastatic disease.

- **General statements**: Regarding the use of PSMA PET/CT for assessing response to therapy, it was confirmed that such an approach should be used only if a change of clinical management is expected from the results (statements 1.2 and 2.4) as already emphasized in European Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines. Thus, in cases of good PSA response after salvage treatment, there is no indication for performing PSMA PET/CT (statement 1.4). Additionally, in cases of late-stage disease where no further therapies can be initiated or when hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (PCa) demonstrates a favorable PSA response under systemic therapy, there is no role for PSMA PET/CT (statements 1.5 and 1.6).

Asking whether PSMA PET/CT can be used before, after, and during treatment is an important question because there are concerns regarding how to interpret uptake of tracer, especially in hormone-naive patients starting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Consensus was reached on the statement that, in principle, PSMA PET/CT can be used before and after any local and systemic treatment in patients with metastatic disease (including N1 disease). PSMA PET/CT is actually the most sensitive technique to detect metastases, and thus, it is likely that the prognosis of M0 and M+ patients based on PSMA PET/CT will be changed compared to the prognosis of M0 and M+ patients based on standard work-up.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: An umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^113vKUuH]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Despite the advantages of PSMA-PET/CT, challenges remain in its widespread adoption in clinical practice. Variability in access to this advanced imaging modality, along with the need for standardized protocols for interpretation and reporting, can hinder its implementation. Studies highlight significant disparities in accessibility to PSMA-PET/CT across healthcare institutions, particularly in resource-limited regions where this technology has not yet been incorporated into routine clinical pathways. This study reports the review of 26 studies which revealed substantial heterogeneity in defining PSMA-PET/CT-positive lesions, with interobserver variability reaching 15–30% for small lesions (< 5 mm) and those with low PSMA expression. Furthermore, the interpretation of PSMA-PET/CT results can be complicated by the potential for false positives due to PSMA expression in non-prostatic tissues, necessitating careful consideration and additional diagnostic workup in certain cases. To address these challenges, ongoing efforts to develop standardized reporting frameworks, such as the PSMA Reporting and Data System (PSMA-RADS), aim to improve communication between radiologists and referring physicians, ensuring that the information derived from PSMA-PET/CT is utilized effectively in clinical decision-making.

The integration of PSMA-PET/CT into clinical pathways for prostate cancer is not merely a diagnostic advancement; it represents a paradigm shift in how patients are managed throughout their treatment journey. By facilitating more accurate staging, guiding treatment selection, and optimizing overall patient management, this technology holds the potential to significantly impact prostate cancer treatment outcomes.

### A practical guide to the pearls and pitfalls of PSMA PET imaging [^116aFg2k]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted PET agents have revolutionized the care of patients with prostate cancer, supplanting traditional methods of imaging prostate cancer and improving the selection and delivery of therapies. This has led to a rapid expansion in both the number of PSMA PET scans performed and the imaging specialists required to interpret those scans.

To aid imagers and clinicians who are new to the interpretation of PSMA PET, this review provides an overview of the interpretation of PSMA PET/CT imaging and pearls for overcoming commonly encountered pitfalls. We discuss the physiologic distribution of clinically available PSMA-targeted radiotracers, the commonly encountered patterns of prostate cancer spread, and the benign and malignant mimics of prostate cancer. Additionally, we review the standardized PSMA PET reporting systems and the role of PSMA in selecting appropriate patients for PSMA-targeted therapies.

### Sensitivity, specificity, and predictors of positive Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in advanced prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Dun8T]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Positron emission tomography (PET) of 68 Ga-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (68 Ga-PSMA) is an emerging imaging modality introduced to assess the burden of prostate cancer, typically in biochemically recurrent or advanced disease. The 68 Ga-PSMA PET provides the ability to selectively identify and localize metastatic prostate cancer cells and subsequently change patient management. Owing to its limited history, robust sensitivity and specificity data are not yet available for 68 Ga-PSMA PET-positive scans.

- **Objective**: A systematic review and meta-analysis of reported predictors of positive 68 Ga-PSMA PET and corresponding sensitivity and specificity profiles.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We performed critical reviews of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases in April 2016 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Meta-analysis and meta-regression of proportions were performed using a random-effects model with pre-PET prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as the dependent variable. Summary sensitivity and specificity values were obtained by fitting bivariate hierarchical regression models.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Sixteen articles involving 1309 patients were analyzed. The overall percentage of positive 68 Ga-PSMA PET among patients was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19–64%) for primary staging and 76% (95% CI 66–85%) for biochemical recurrence (BCR).

### Comparison of F-based PSMA radiotracers with [Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113m3hez]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Studies were assessed for quality using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). The risk of bias in patient selection was generally acceptable but high in a few studies that involved retrospective head-to-head analyses. In these cases, non-consecutive patients with specific clinical indications that required scans with two types of tracers were selected, raising concerns regarding applicability. Furthermore, several studies were matched pair comparisons, leading to additional applicability concerns. The risk of bias for the index test was high in some studies that did not report blinding of the tracer type. Moreover, there was a high risk of application concerns in studies that did not encourage voiding before the imaging.

In terms of the reference standard, the risk of bias was high in studies that did not verify all suspicious lesions with histology. Additionally, the risk of bias for timing and flow was high in several studies that did not follow up on suspicious lesions with sufficient time. Summary findings for the QUADAS-2 appraisal are illustrated in the supplementary material (Supplementary Fig. 1). The quality of each article was assessed by two independent evaluators, S.H. and S.O., and any discrepancies were resolved by a third evaluator, N.L.

The basic information extracted from the studies included the study nature and design, year of the study, country where the study was conducted, the indication for the scan, the sample size, and imaging protocols, including the time to acquisition and the injection dose. Patient characteristics were extracted when available, including the patient age and background.

### Current and emerging clinical applications of PSMA PET diagnostic imaging for prostate cancer [^114tcK4o]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed on most prostate cancer (PCa) cells, and several PSMA ligands for PET imaging are now available worldwide. 68 Ga-PSMA-11 has already received U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approval, and the use of PSMA PET is currently suggested by several international guidelines for investigating PCa in different clinical settings.

In primary PCa, PSMA PET has been shown to be superior to cross-sectional imaging for the detection of pelvic lymph nodes and distant metastases, leading to subsequent clinical management changes. Additionally, it might also have a role in intraprostatic tumor localization, especially when combined with multiparametric MRI. In a setting of PCa recurrence, higher detection rates have been observed than for any other available imaging techniques, especially at low prostate-specific antigen values. Furthermore, PSMA PET consistently led to a shift in clinical management, thus increasing the proportion of radiotherapy, surgery, or other focal therapies at the expense of systemic options or no treatment.

In oligometastatic disease after radical surgery, PSMA PET may be relevant in guiding a metastasis-directed therapy approach. Preliminary data suggest a benefit in terms of progression-free survival after treatment of PSMA PET-positive lesions. As a staging and gatekeeping technique, PSMA PET represents a reliable whole-body imaging procedure in combination with second-line therapy for castration-resistant PCa, and is pivotal when assessing patients eligible for further therapeutic interventions.

### Do bone scans overstage disease compared with PSMA PET at initial staging? An international multicenter retrospective study with masked independent readers [^111QxxTv]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET has a higher accuracy than CT and bone scans to stage patients with prostate cancer. We do not understand how to apply clinical trial data based on conventional imaging to patients staged using PSMA PET. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the ability of bone scans to detect osseous metastases using PSMA PET as a reference standard.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter retrospective diagnostic study, 167 patients with prostate cancer, who were imaged with bone scans and PSMA PET performed within 100 days, were included for analysis. Each study was interpreted by three masked readers, and the results of the PSMA PET were used as the reference standard. Endpoints were positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and specificity for bone scans. Additionally, interreader reproducibility, positivity rate, uptake on PSMA PET, and the number of lesions were evaluated.

- **Results**: In total, 167 patients were included, with 77 at initial staging, 60 in the biochemical recurrence and castration-sensitive prostate cancer setting, and 30 in the castration-resistant prostate cancer setting. In all patients, the PPV, NPV, and specificity for bone scans were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.61–0.82), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74–0.88), and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74–0.88), respectively. In patients at initial staging, the PPV, NPV, and specificity for bone scans were 0.43 (95% CI, 0.26–0.63), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.85–0.98), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68–0.88), respectively. Interreader agreement for bone disease was moderate for bone scans (Fleiss κ, 0.51) and substantial for the PSMA PET.

### The evolving role of PSMA-PET/CT in prostate cancer management: An umbrella review of diagnostic restaging, therapeutic redirection, and survival impact [^111z5VL9]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The timing of intervention in prostate cancer management is critical, as early treatment has been associated with improved patient prognosis. Evidence suggests that survival benefits from early intervention are primarily observed in intermediate- to high-risk patient subgroups, with limited overall strength of evidence and potential treatment-related risks. The latest clinical decision aids (e.g. the Navigate platform) recommend integrating personalized risk assessments (such as PSA kinetics and genetic testing) and patient quality-of-life preferences, rather than relying solely on early treatment timing.

Large-scale randomized trials (e.g. the ProtecT trial) have shown comparable 10-year overall survival rates (~98–99%) between active surveillance and immediate treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) for localized prostate cancer. However, in high-risk patients (e.g. PSA > 20 ng/ml or Gleason score ≥ 8), radical therapies may reduce cancer-specific mortality by 5–10%. Early intervention strategies, particularly in high-risk populations identified through PSMA-PET/CT imaging, can lead to favorable outcomes by addressing the disease before it progresses to advanced stages where treatment options become limited and less effective. Studies have shown that early treatment can reduce the risk of metastasis and improve the likelihood of achieving long-term remission. For instance, patients with high-risk features detected via PSMA-PET/CT may benefit from immediate systemic therapy, which can prevent the progression to castration-resistant stages.

### Evolving paradigms in prostate cancer: The integral role of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography in primary staging and therapeutic decision-making [^1131MB7E]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2025). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography or computed tomography (PET/CT) has emerged as a superior imaging option compared to conventional imaging for prostate cancer. The majority of early evidence and prospective trials evaluated PSMA PET/CT in the biochemical recurrence or metastatic setting. However, there has been an increasing number of prospective trials in the primary setting. The purpose of this narrative review is to describe the role of PSMA PET/CT in localized primary prostate cancer. This review focuses on the prospective evidence available in this setting, detailing the practice and future potential for PSMA PET/CT to be used in multiple stages of localized primary prostate cancer.

The most common practice currently for PSMA PET/CT is in the primary nodal and metastatic staging of high-risk prostate cancer. Other roles of PSMA PET/CT include intermediate-risk prostate cancer, as well as local staging and its impact on radiation therapy and surgical management. Additionally, potential future roles of PSMA PET/CT in prediagnosis, such as risk stratification for biopsy, prognosis, and specific surgical roles, are discussed. Potential pitfalls of PSMA PET/CT are also addressed. PSMA PET/CT has already had a significant influence on prostate cancer, and there will continue to be a greater role for this imaging modality in localized primary prostate cancer.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: Could we ask for more [^111vUGB6]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Thanks to the development of novel PSMA-based peptides, molecular imaging, such as PET/CT paired with theranostic-based approaches, has recently been proposed for the treatment of prostate cancer. Patient selection, however, remains challenging due to the absence of strong prospective data to interpret and translate imaging scans into effective and well-tolerated treatment regimens.

In this review, we discuss the latest findings in PSMA imaging in prostate cancer patients, particularly detailing the impact of PSMA imaging on treatment management in the contexts of primary staging, biochemical recurrence, and advanced prostate cancer.

For primary prostate cancer staging, PSMA PET/CT appears crucial for primary therapy assessment, sometimes detecting lesions outside the surgical template and thus permitting a change in management. Additionally, the N+ condition at PSMA has been correlated with worse biochemical recurrence-free and therapy-free survival. The early detection of PSMA-positive findings in prostate cancer is associated with improved time to relapse survival. Similarly, for advanced prostate cancer patients, accurate restaging with PSMA imaging is becoming important for the early prediction of response to systemic therapies and to ensure the best possible outcomes. Regarding theranostics, the appropriate selection of patients eligible for ¹⁷⁷Lu-PSMA requires PSMA imaging, while the role of added FDG-PET for distinguishing those with PSMA/FDG discordance needs further evaluation.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: Could we ask for more [^115nS3A4]? Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Up until recent years, conventional imaging modalities (i.e. bone scan, CT, and mpMRI) were considered the standard of care for the primary staging of prostate cancer. These methods revealed poor sensitivity and specificity and were gradually overtaken by PET/CT with PSMA tracers. PSMA is a type II trans-membrane glycoprotein, normally expressed in some epithelia (such as salivary and lacrimal glands, duodenum, liver, and spleen) and highly expressed on the cell surfaces of almost 90% of prostate cancer cases. Moreover, PSMA expression is also correlated with tumor grade, higher PSA values, and prognosis. PET/CT with Ga or F-labeled PSMA tracers has provided a significant increase in the primary staging of prostate cancer.

A recent comparison between mpMRI and PSMA PET/CT in the primary index lesion and pelvic lymph node metastasis staging of intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer patients has been studied by Szigeti et al. A total of 81 patients were included; the index lesion was detected by PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI in 87% and 98% of them, respectively. However, concerning N staging, 60% of patients with histology-proven pelvic lymph node metastasis were detected by PSMA PET/CT, whereas only 50% were detected on mpMRI. Bone and distant lymph node metastasis were found by PSMA PET/CT in 17% of patients, of which 39% of bone metastasis appeared without any morphological correlation on CT.

### Lu-PSMA (r)evolution in cancer care: is it really happening [^113BRcTg]? Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The field of theranostics holds enormous promise for the future of cancer management. The significant growth seen in the global theranostics market can be attributed to multiple factors, including the proven clinical value of approved RPT agents and their impact on patients' lives, alongside their successful commercialization. The investigation of different therapeutic targets across multiple disease areas, the use of combination therapies, and the exploration of different nuclides are only some of the areas that could lead to further advancements. Several challenges have been mentioned, including improving education and awareness, implementing successful referral systems, harmonizing regulations, and expanding infrastructure.

To conclude, in the background of continued strategic investment due to the striking potential for patients, the 177 Lu-PSMA (r)evolution in cancer care must happen and will happen, but key stakeholders must closely collaborate to ensure that HCSs can allow timely and equitable access to treatment.

### Update on PSMA-based prostate cancer imaging [^117HrACB]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The increased use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) based PET imaging for prostate cancer (Pca) detection has revolutionized the clinical management of Pca, offering higher diagnostic sensitivity for extraprostatic disease and increasing clinical utility across different stages of the disease. The integration of PSMA PET imaging into clinical guidelines and consensus documents reflects its growing importance in the personalized management of Pca.

This review of recent literature highlights the rapid evolution of PSMA PET into the mainstream of staging and restaging, and the decreasing reliance on conventional imaging modalities. This comprehensive review serves as a resource for clinicians and researchers involved in the domains of Pca diagnosis and management.

### Clinical impact of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PET) on intensification or deintensification of advanced renal cell carcinoma management [^11434H7G]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). High credibility.

There is an emerging role for the use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) in renal cell carcinoma. Herein, we report our experience with the use of PSMA PET in recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients who underwent PSMA PET for suspected recurrent or de-novo metastatic RCC between 2015 and 2020 across three institutions. The primary outcome measured was the change in management, specifically whether there was an intensification or de-intensification following the PSMA PET scan. Secondary outcomes included histopathological correlation of PSMA avid sites, comparison of disease sites on PSMA PET to diagnostic CT, and time to systemic treatment.

### The accuracy and intra- and interobserver variability of PSMA PET/CT for the local staging of primary prostate cancer [^111MYZPx]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

PSMA PET/CT is increasingly used as a metastatic screening tool in patients with a primary diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) and may be valuable for assessing the local extent of the primary prostate tumor as well. Woo et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that included twelve studies: ten prospective single-center studies, one prospective single-center study, and one dual-center study on the PET assessment of local staging. The reported pooled sensitivity and specificity of PSMA PET, using exclusively 68 Ga-based PSMA PET tracers, were 72% (95% CI 0.56–0.84) and 87% (95% CI 0.72–0.94) for pT3a-stage disease, and 69% (95% CI 0.53–0.81) and 94% (95% CI 0.90–0.96) for pT3b-stage disease, respectively. The number of patients in these studies ranged from 21 to 140 and therefore was relatively small.

The authors further indicated that PSMA PET/MRI might have improved diagnostic performance for local tumor staging compared to PSMA PET/CT imaging, although the number of studies using PSMA PET/MRI was limited. It is reasonable to consider that combining different imaging modalities enhances diagnostic performance over a single imaging modality. However, this meta-analysis does not address which imaging modality contributed preferentially to the observed improved diagnostic performance for predicting local tumor stage compared to each of the two single imaging modalities alone.

A further limitation of the included studies in the meta-analysis is that PSMA PET/CT scans were often assessed by a single observer only, and observer agreement scores were not provided.

### Consensus statements on PSMA PET/CT response assessment criteria in prostate cancer [^114Gpc2Y]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

While these criteria are ready to be used in most situations and should be evaluated in future studies, some specific clinical scenarios deserve special consideration. The definition of progression indicated by the panel is largely in line with the proposal of PSMA PET progression, which is largely based on the appearance of ≥ 2 new lesions and is adequate in many cases. Nonetheless, the panelists agreed that in early rePCa, the appearance of any new lesion with high suspicion should be regarded as progressive disease (statement 3.5). The rationale was to maximize the sensitivity of the approach in such settings, where additional local therapies may still be proposed.

Conversely, in polymetastatic PCa, an increase of uptake or tumor PET volume > 30% was regarded as progression; the appearance of two or more new lesions should not necessarily be regarded as progressive disease if total tumor PET volume or uptake does not increase by > 30% (statements 3.6 and 3.7). For the purpose of this project, the definition of a new lesion is based on the appearance of a new focal area of PSMA uptake at PET, with or without CT change. Disease progression should not be based solely on PET/CT. The rationale here was to avoid misinterpretation of progressive disease in the case of an overall good response of known lesions to systemic therapy, with only the appearance of a few minor lesions. It would be a mistake to switch an active treatment too early in polymetastatic situations.

Semi-quantitative evaluation of radiolabeled PSMA PET/CT scans could be very useful when assessing response to treatment.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: Could we ask for more [^114tQkND]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

The combination of PSMA PET/CT and MRI seems to be superior to MRI alone in diagnostic performance for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC), thus potentially allowing better selection and even a reduction in the number of prostate biopsies. In a recent prospective multicenter phase II imaging trial by Emmett et al, almost 300 men underwent both PSMA PET/CT and MRI prior to biopsy. Combined PSMA and MRI imaging improved NPV compared to MRI alone [91% vs. 72%, test ratio = 1.27 (1.11–1.39), P < 0.001]. Sensitivity also improved, despite a slightly reduced specificity.

The performance of PSMA PET/CT in detecting lymph node metastasis in the primary staging of prostate cancer patients is highlighted in a recent review by Stabile et al. They found moderate heterogeneity among the studies. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of PSMA PET/CT for LNI were 58% [95% confidence interval (CI) 50–66%], 95% (95% CI 93–97%), 79% (95% CI 72–85%), and 87% (95% CI 84–89%), with overall moderate heterogeneity between studies. Similar results were confirmed by Moreira et al, with specificity and accuracy of 75%, 96%, and 91% respectively for lymph node involvement, and 91%, 50%, and 76% respectively for metastatic bone lesions.

### Impact of Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on staging and management of prostate cancer patients in various clinical settings: A prospective single-center study [^111ap93g]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The impact of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT on the management of prostate cancer (PCa) patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) is well established. However, whether and how PSMA PET/CT affects the management of patients undergoing scans for other clinical indications remains unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on initial and subsequent management decisions in a cohort of PCa patients referred for various indications, excluding the two main classic indications: BCR and presurgical staging.

This prospective study involved 197 patients and aimed to determine the impact of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on PCa stage and management. The indications for PSMA PET/CT included:

- **Initial staging of nonsurgical candidates**: 30 patients.

- **Restaging after definitive treatment**: 167 patients.
	- **Restaged with known advanced metastatic disease**: 103 patients.
	- **After androgen deprivation therapy only**: 16 patients.
	- After surgery, with serum prostate-specific antigen levels lower than 0.2 ng/mL: 13 patients.
	- **After radiation therapy, not meeting the Phoenix criteria**: 22 patients.
	- After other primary local treatments (high-intensity focused ultrasound, focal laser ablation, cryoablation, hyperthermia, or irreversible electroporation): 13 patients.

Patients with BCR and candidates for curative surgery were excluded. The impact on management was assessed using pre- and post-PET questionnaires completed by referring physicians, electronic chart review, or patient telephone calls.

### Psma as a target for radiolabelled small molecules [^1149UXSm]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in Europe. When detected early and localized to the prostate gland, the 5-year survival rate is nearly 100%. However, once the cancer has spread beyond the prostate, survival rates fall dramatically. In recent years, there has been a significant decrease in mortality mainly due to early detection. However, this early detection has led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, impacting the quality of life for men with PCa. These issues arise from the variability of the disease's clinical course and the high prevalence of microscopic disease. Therefore, a risk-adapted strategy is needed to choose from a wide variety of treatment options, ranging from active surveillance to aggressive treatment.

In the face of such broadly differing options that impact survival and quality of life, it follows that patient-specific staging is essential for optimizing individual outcomes. Patient-specific staging drives the demand for sensitive and specific imaging of PCa, including intraprostatic disease as well as local and distant metastases. Furthermore, as active surveillance becomes a more widely considered management option in low-grade disease, a sensitive method for monitoring changes in tumor volume and location would potentially eliminate the need for repetitive biopsies and enable a more advanced temporal evaluation.

### Incorporating prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in management decisions for men with newly diagnosed or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer [^111yx7wT]. European Urology (2023). High credibility.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising molecular target for prostate cancer (PCa) that has allowed the development of a novel diagnostic approach to PCa settings.

- **Objective**: To summarize available data and recommendations regarding the use of PSMA in newly diagnosed and recurrent PCa via a narrative review.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A literature review was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Scopus. The search strategy included meta-analyses, reviews, and original studies on staging and restaging with 68 Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).

- **Evidence synthesis**: Studies comparing PSMA-targeted imaging and conventional imaging suggest superior performance of PSMA-targeted imaging in primary and recurrent PCa, albeit with several clinically relevant limitations. Pretreatment 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT allowed more accurate PCa staging compared to routine practice for high-risk cases and identified a number of otherwise unknown metastatic lesions. In biochemically recurrent PCa, PSMA PET can reveal sites of recurrence with greater sensitivity and specificity than conventional imaging, potentially detecting a major proportion of occult disease. This review will help providers apply the most up-to-date and relevant literature to: (1) determine which patients truly have oligometastatic disease and (2) ascertain who is most likely to experience a meaningful response to local consolidation in the biochemical recurrence setting.

Conclusions suggest that data on PSMA diagnostic studies in primary and recurrent cases demonstrate enhanced effectiveness.

### Using PSMA imaging for prognostication in localized and advanced prostate cancer [^117UgZrP]. Nature Reviews Urology (2023). High credibility.

Use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed applications in modern prostate cancer management has evolved rapidly over the past few years, establishing new treatment pathways and providing further insights into prostate cancer biology. However, the prognostic implications of PSMA-PET have not been studied systematically, due to rapid clinical implementation without long follow-up periods to determine intermediate-term and long-term oncological outcomes. Currently available data suggest that traditional prognostic factors and survival outcomes are associated with high PSMA expression (both according to immunohistochemistry and PET uptake) in men with localized and biochemically recurrent disease. Treatment with curative intent (primary and/or salvage) often fails when PSMA-positive metastases are present; however, the sensitivity of PSMA-PET in detecting all metastases is poor. Low PSMA-PET uptake in recurrent disease is a favorable prognostic factor; however, it can be associated with poor prognosis in conjunction with high 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Clinical trials embedding PSMA-PET for guiding management with reliable oncological outcomes are needed to support ongoing clinical use.

### Reliability and practicability of PSMA-RADS 1.0 for structured reporting of PSMA-PET/CT scans in prostate cancer patients [^116ppqZP]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Several reporting frameworks have been proposed for PSMA-PET/CT examinations to support image interpretation, including therapy response evaluation, and their use is generally recommended by international guidelines. When interpreting PSMA-directed PET/CT scans, the reader must navigate certain pitfalls, such as the normal biodistribution of different PSMA-directed PET radiotracers and the varying uptake of radiotracers in numerous types of both benign and malignant lesions, which could lead to false-positive and false-negative findings.

Rowe et al. introduced a reporting and data system (RADS) for PSMA-PET/CT imaging, termed PSMA-RADS version 1.0. This system uses a 5-point scale for classifying every single lesion and the overall report: PSMA-RADS-1, benign; PSMA-RADS-2, likely benign; PSMA-RADS-3, equivocal; PSMA-RADS-4, prostate cancer highly likely; and PSMA-RADS-5, prostate cancer almost certainly. PSMA-RADS 1.0 has shown promising results as a simple and effective method to interpret PSMA-targeted PET imaging findings, with high interreader agreement rates, even for less experienced readers.

Considering that in the future more PSMA-PET/CTs will be performed in clinical routines and the reporting burden will significantly increase, there remains a lack of knowledge about interesting sub-issues of PSMA-RADS, such as the intrareader agreement of IR, especially in the absence of clinical data that corresponds to the real clinical workflow in high-volume imaging centers. This study aimed to determine the inter- and intrareader agreement.

### Expanding the role of PSMA PET in active surveillance [^112x1QtZ]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Accurate grading at the time of diagnosis is fundamental to risk stratification and treatment decision-making, particularly for men being considered for active surveillance (AS). With the introduction of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), there has been considerable improvement in sensitivity and specificity for the detection and staging of clinically significant prostate cancer. Our study aims to determine the role of PSMA PET/CT in men with newly diagnosed low or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer to better select men for AS.

- **Method**: This is a retrospective single-center study performed from January 2019 to October 2022. This study includes men identified from an electronic medical record system who had undergone a PSMA PET/CT following newly diagnosed low or favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. The primary outcome was to assess the change in management for men being considered for AS following PSMA PET/CT results based on PSMA PET characteristics.

- **Results**: In total, there were 11 of 30 men (36.67%) who were assigned management by AS and 19 of 30 men (63.33%) who had definitive treatment. Fifteen of the 19 men that needed treatment had concerning features on PSMA PET/CT results. Of the 15 men with concerning features on PSMA PET, 9 (60%) men were found to have adverse pathological features on final prostatectomy features.

- **Conclusion**: This retrospective study suggests that PSMA PET/CT has the potential to influence the management of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer that would otherwise be appropriate for AS.

### Promise of PET imaging in prostate cancer: Improvement or waste of money [^114SttK2]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is a highly prevalent malignancy whose management poses a significant challenge for clinicians worldwide. Molecular imaging, particularly PET with computed tomography (PET/CT), is increasingly gaining importance in the work-up and management of patients with prostate cancer. However, PET/CT remains an expensive imaging modality and is currently not reimbursed.

PSMA-based PET/CT tracers have demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer, outperforming any other PET radioligand available at the time of writing. Regardless of the clinical scenario — whether staging, biochemical recurrence, or therapy response assessment in advanced prostate cancer — PSMA PET/CT scans have become common practice in countries that allow their use outside of controlled clinical trials. This is due to the overwhelming evidence demonstrating the extremely high sensitivity of this imaging modality in identifying prostate cancer lesions, which can make PSMA PET/CT appealing for clinicians and potentially lead to unnecessary scanning with limited supporting evidence.

Our aim is to provide an update on the most recent literature available on PET-based imaging for prostate cancer, particularly PSMA PET/CT. We offer an expert opinion on the data collected to provide clinicians with guidance on the appropriateness and efficacy of PET-based imaging, in order to maximize clinical benefits and avoid waste of resources.

### Standardized template for clinical reporting of PSMA PET/CT scans [^112YVQpx]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

PSMA PET/CT is an imaging modality for prostate cancer (PCa) that can be indicated for primary staging, restaging, targeted biopsies, evaluation for PSMA-targeted therapies, and monitoring treatment response in PCa. Several reporting guidelines have been developed and vary in reporting details; however, none have been officially adopted among radiological or clinical societies and are wholly underutilized by community imaging experts and referring physicians. Here, we have provided a high-level overview of PSMA PET/CT imaging and guidelines, along with the development of a standardized reporting tool by a panel of experts composing both academic and community physicians. This reporting tool is intended to complement the existing international guidelines, help understand the patient's full clinical picture, and facilitate overall patient management. This article extends the existing body of standardized reporting guidelines for PSMA PET/CT imaging, aiming at improving the clarity and quality of reporting, decreasing the ambiguity in communication of findings, and increasing precision, repeatability, and utility of the clinical decision report.

### The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in the management of prostate cancer patients: Could we ask for more [^112qYPvv]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

PSMA PET/CT imaging has rapidly become a fundamental tool for staging and restaging prostate cancer. Its unprecedented sensitivity allows for better customization of treatment for each patient at any stage of the disease. The potential to guide therapy and to identify relapses early, as well as the impact on patient outcomes, is being explored; although, further studies are needed to assess its impact on overall survival. For advanced metastatic prostate cancer, PSMA imaging is critical for selecting patients suitable for RLT, and promising data suggest a possible role as a predictor of response.
