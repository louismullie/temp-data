## Question

How do you interpret: T pal positive, RPR negative, TPPA positive?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret the pattern: treponemal screening test positive (T. pallidum EIA/CLIA), RPR negative, and TPPA positive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each assay measures and the expected serologic kinetics. Then, I should interpret the discordant treponemal-positive/nontreponemal-negative pattern. Next, I need to check clinical context, timing of exposure, and prior treatment. After that, I should verify guideline-directed next steps including repeat testing, reflex quantitative RPR, and lesion-based diagnostics if early disease is possible. Finally, I will consider indications for CSF testing, stage-appropriate treatment if untreated, follow-up serology, and key counseling points, ensuring HIV and pregnancy considerations are addressed.

> Let me first confirm what each test tells us and when it turns positive. Treponemal immunoassays (EIA/CLIA) and TPPA detect antibodies specific to Treponema pallidum; they usually appear early and tend to remain reactive long term, often for life, so they are not useful for monitoring response to therapy. In contrast, nontreponemal tests like RPR reflect disease activity and typically rise with active infection and decline after effective treatment; importantly, RPR can be negative in very early primary syphilis for several weeks after a chancre appears. I should double-check that this kinetic profile fits the current pattern, and it does: treponemal tests positive with a negative RPR could represent past treated infection, late/latent infection, or very early infection before RPR seroconversion [^115QC6bc] [^113eqBje].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to interpret the specific pattern: treponemal-positive on screening, RPR-negative, TPPA-positive as a confirmatory treponemal test. When two different treponemal assays are reactive, that strongly supports true syphilis exposure at some point, reducing the likelihood of a false-positive screen. However, the nonreactive RPR means there is no serologic evidence of current activity at this moment, though early infection remains possible if exposure was recent. This discordant pattern is well-described in reverse algorithms and can reflect prior treated infection, latent infection, or early primary prior to RPR seroconversion; discordant rates are higher in low-prevalence settings, but a positive second treponemal test, as here, argues against a false-positive screen. So, I should proceed based on clinical history and timing rather than the serology alone [^114L4tPy] [^113ALSqd].

> Next, I should review clinical context methodically. I will now examine for current symptoms and signs suggesting stage: primary chancre, secondary rash or mucocutaneous lesions, and any neurologic, ocular, or otologic features. I need to check exact timing of potential exposure and symptom onset to estimate the window for seroconversion. I should confirm prior treatment history with regimen and dates, because the same pattern is expected after successful therapy. I also need to ensure HIV status and pregnancy status are assessed since these affect screening frequency and urgency of management, even though HIV coinfection does not fundamentally change the treponemal/nontreponemal serologic pattern. Let me verify guideline prompts for antenatal and HIV screening intervals to anchor this step in best practice [^111i73Jg] [^111r7gSV] [^114XDoqo].

> But wait, what if this is very early primary syphilis? If there is a recent high-risk exposure or a compatible lesion, RPR may lag and be falsely negative. In that case, I should arrange repeat serology in 2–4 weeks to capture seroconversion, and, if a lesion is present, obtain direct detection with dark ground microscopy or PCR where available. BASHH specifically advises repeating negative serology two weeks after a suspected chancre when dark ground or PCR are negative, which supports a low threshold to retest early. This approach reduces missed early cases while avoiding premature assumptions based on a single negative RPR [^115QC6bc] [^117WW5ap] [^116WcRNP] [^113ALSqd].

> If early infection is not suspected clinically, I should confirm the stability of this discordant pattern with repeat testing. I need to ensure a reflex quantitative RPR is obtained as the baseline even if initially nonreactive, because guidelines advise quantitative non-treponemal testing for confirmation and follow-up. IUSTI recommends repeating both treponemal and nontreponemal tests at about one month when treponemal is positive and RPR is negative without clinical suspicion of very early disease; BASHH also emphasizes obtaining a quantitative RPR when screening tests are positive. Wait, let me verify the reflex testing details: IUSTI advises reflex quantitative non-treponemal titration on the same sample when a treponemal screen is positive, and a second treponemal assay resolves discordance as was done here with TPPA [^1175xqBw] [^113xSb8X] [^111mVdU3] [^114L4tPy].

> Now to the critical decision point: treatment history. If the patient was previously and adequately treated and has no new risk exposures, this pattern is consistent with past treated syphilis, and no retreatment is indicated; documentation and routine care suffice. Wait, I should double-check my own statement here: I initially thought "no further action", but I need to ensure there has truly been no recent exposure and no evolving symptoms; if risk is ongoing, I should repeat serology to exclude early reinfection despite a negative RPR today. If there is no documented prior treatment, I should treat as latent syphilis (unknown duration) unless evidence supports early latent within the last year based on seroconversion timing or clear exposure history; stage-based benzathine penicillin G regimens remain standard per European and UK guidelines. I need to ensure partner notification and testing are arranged in accordance with local protocols and guideline recommendations [^114XDoqo] [^113zggNi].

> Let me consider whether lumbar puncture is warranted. I should confirm that CSF examination is not recommended routinely in asymptomatic individuals regardless of HIV status. Indications are restricted to neurologic, ocular, or otologic symptoms, or concern for treatment failure with persistently high non-treponemal titers. Here, with a negative RPR and no neurologic/ocular/otologic signs, CSF testing would not be indicated. Hold on, I should verify that both IUSTI and BASHH align on this point, and they do [^116gKjft] [^113zggNi] [^114XDoqo].

> I will now outline follow-up. After treatment for latent syphilis or early disease, quantitative RPR should be repeated at defined intervals, typically 6 and 12 months, to document appropriate serologic response; a fourfold decline is expected if the RPR was initially reactive, and some patients will become nonreactive over 1–2 years. If RPR remains low and stable (serofast ≤ 1:4) without ongoing risk or clinical signs, strict follow-up is advised but this can still represent successful treatment. Treponemal tests like TPPA should not be used to monitor response since they usually remain positive indefinitely. I need to ensure I am anchoring these monitoring statements to guideline language, which they are [^114XDoqo] [^113zggNi] [^115QC6bc].

> Finally, I should document and communicate clearly. I need to record the serologic profile, prior therapy verification, clinical staging, and the management plan including retesting, treatment if indicated, and follow-up intervals. I should explain to the patient that two different treponemal positives confirm past or present syphilis exposure, the negative RPR suggests no measurable activity today, but timing matters; thus, we may repeat tests if recent exposure is possible. I should ensure HIV testing and pregnancy-specific considerations are addressed per guidelines, and report the case to public health per local regulations, while arranging partner services when indicated. Let me reconsider if any step is missing; the plan's components map to current European and UK guidance and address the key branching points in this discordant serology scenario [^111i73Jg] [^114XDoqo] [^113zggNi].

The combination of **TPPA positive, RPR negative** indicates past or treated syphilis, not active infection. Treponemal antibodies **persist for life** [^113eqBje] [^115QC6bc], while nontreponemal antibodies wane after treatment or in late latent disease [^114XDoqo]. This pattern is common in previously treated patients or late latent syphilis, and does not require treatment unless there is clinical suspicion of early infection, reinfection, or neurosyphilis. If early infection is suspected, **repeat RPR in 2–4 weeks** [^1175xqBw] [^115QC6bc]; if neurosyphilis is suspected, perform CSF analysis [^113zggNi] [^116gKjft].

---

## Clinical interpretation of TPPA positive, RPR negative results

### Treponemal tests (TPPA)

Treponemal tests (TPPA) show **persistence**: treponemal antibodies persist for life after infection or treatment [^113eqBje], so a positive TPPA indicates current or past infection [^115QC6bc]. They also have **high specificity**, with TPPA rarely yielding false-positive results [^114FJYdw].

---

### Nontreponemal tests (RPR)

Nontreponemal tests (RPR) show **waning**: RPR detects antibodies that decline after treatment or in late latent disease [^114XDoqo], so a negative RPR with a positive TPPA usually indicates past or treated infection [^115QC6bc]. False negatives can also occur in **early primary syphilis** (before seroconversion), late latent syphilis, or after successful treatment [^113eqBje] [^115QC6bc].

---

## Clinical scenarios associated with TPPA positive, RPR negative results

| **Clinical scenario** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Previously treated syphilis | - Most common <br/> - Treponemal antibodies persist <br/> - Nontreponemal antibodies wane after treatment [^114XDoqo] [^115QC6bc] |
| Late latent syphilis | Nontreponemal antibodies may be absent or low in late latent disease [^114XDoqo] [^112gTG3m] |
| Early primary syphilis | - RPR may be negative before seroconversion <br/> - Repeat testing recommended [^113eqBje] [^115QC6bc] |
| False-positive TPPA | - Rare <br/> - TPPA is highly specific [^113eqBje] [^114FJYdw] |

## Clinical management and follow-up recommendations

### Previously treated syphilis

In previously treated syphilis, **no retreatment** is recommended unless there is clinical suspicion of reinfection or treatment failure [^114XDoqo]. Clinicians should **monitor** the patient clinically and with serology if indicated.

---

### Late latent syphilis

In late latent syphilis, **treat if untreated** — initiate therapy when there is no documented prior therapy [^114XDoqo]. No routine **CSF analysis** is recommended without neurological symptoms [^116gKjft] [^113zggNi].

---

### Early primary syphilis

In early primary syphilis, **repeat RPR** in 2–4 weeks [^1175xqBw] [^115QC6bc] if early infection is suspected, and **treat if seroconversion occurs** or if clinical suspicion remains high.

---

### Neurosyphilis suspicion

When neurosyphilis is suspected, perform **CSF analysis** if neurological symptoms are present [^113zggNi] [^116gKjft].

---

## Summary of clinical interpretation

- **Past or treated infection**: TPPA positive, RPR negative most often reflects past or treated syphilis [^115QC6bc].

- **No routine retreatment**: Do not retreat unless reinfection or treatment failure is suspected [^114XDoqo].

- **Repeat if early suspected**: If early infection is possible, repeat RPR in 2–4 weeks [^1175xqBw] [^115QC6bc].

- **CSF if neurological**: Perform CSF analysis if neurological symptoms are present [^113zggNi] [^116gKjft].

---

The TPPA positive, RPR negative pattern most often reflects **past or treated infection**, not active disease. Management should be **guided by clinical context**, with repeat RPR if early infection is suspected [^1175xqBw] and CSF analysis only if neurological symptoms are present [^113zggNi] [^116gKjft].

Nontreponemal tests, such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, are based on anticardiolipin antibody detection and are helpful in monitoring the stage of infection and treatment. They are easy to perform, inexpensive, and provide a rapid diagnostic result. However, they have low specificity because of cross-reactivity with antibodies produced in various autoimmune diseases or during pregnancy. Additionally, nontreponemal tests may not reliably detect early primary syphilis due to their lower sensitivity.

On the other hand, treponemal tests such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, the ELISA, and the chemiluminescent magnetic microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) detect anti-T. pallidum IgG or IgM. These tests are used for screening or as confirmatory tests to exclude false-positive results in nontreponemal tests. Moreover, they prove valuable in detecting early syphilis cases that nontreponemal tests may overlook. In comparison with nontreponemal tests, treponemal tests are costly, cumbersome, automated, require a trained team to perform, and are not recommended for monitoring treatment progress, relapse, or reinfection in individuals previously treated, as they remain reactive for years regardless of treatment.

In light of this scenario, we endeavored to perform a systematic evaluation of the performance of commercial kits for diagnosing acquired syphilis. Statistical tools were used to obtain a robust assessment of the performance of each serological test by determining the following diagnostic test parameters: sensitivity (the probability that a test is positive in the presence of disease).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for syphilis, particularly in the context of managing treatment failure or reinfection, IUSTI 2021 guidelines recommend recognizing that a negative non-treponemal test can be obtained in a substantial number of, but not all, patients treated for early syphilis after 1–2 years. Consider a negative non-treponemal test after treatment as the best confirmation of cure. Conduct strict follow-up in patients with persistent low titers (≤ 4) in a non-treponemal test, known as the serofast state, but consider these patients successfully treated in the absence of ongoing risk. Evaluate the need for CSF assessment to detect asymptomatic neurosyphilis in patients with persistent high titers of non-treponemal test (≥ 8).

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^114zCwrd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

The primary outcome of the clinical validation study was the performance characteristics — positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) — of each alternative treponemal serological assay compared to the TPPA. Equivocal results were counted as positive for analysis. Any discrepancies between TPPA and the alternative treponemal serological assay were further investigated by reviewing the clinical syphilis stage, T. pallidum PCR, and repeat serology results for the patient over a six-month period to determine the true clinical status of the individual.

Post hoc sensitivity analyses were also performed to assess the performance characteristics of each assay if equivocal results were excluded or counted as negative. In addition, predefined subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the performance of these assays by:

- **HIV infection status**: The presence or absence of HIV infection.
- **Pregnancy status**: Whether individuals were pregnant.
- **Clinical syphilis stage**: Different stages of syphilis.

Finally, sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were calculated for each alternative treponemal serological assay and the Serodia TPPA, compared to the overall clinical syphilis status of the individual (active untreated syphilis compared to no syphilis). Sensitivity of the alternative treponemal serological assays was also determined for the prior syphilis subgroup.

Currently, the NewBio TPHA (Newmarket Biomedical, Kentford, UK) assay is the only commercially available assay with regulatory approval for use in clinical laboratories.

### Clinical development and performance of the First to Know Syphilis Self-Test for over-the-counter usage: A rapid test for treponemal antibody [^111yjXLM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

The overall test results for the various laboratory comparator tests and the First to Know Syphilis test are summarized in Table S1. Among the 106 true positives determined by the composite reference standard, 99 tested positive with the First to Know Syphilis Test. Of the 41 participants who tested positive on all three reference tests (Bioplex +, RPR +, TPPA +), 40 (97.6%) tested positive with the First to Know test. Additionally, of the 64 participants who were positive for both treponemal tests (Bioplex and TPPA) but negative for RPR, 59 (92.2%) tested positive with the First to Know test. There was no significant difference in First to Know test positivity between those positive by both treponemal and non-treponemal tests (40/42, 95.2%) and those positive only on the two treponemal tests (59/64, 92.2%).

The seven false negatives included five positives by both Bioplex and TPPA, one positive across all laboratory comparator tests, and one positive by TPPA and RPR. We speculate that the false negatives could be due to low antibody levels in early or low-level infections. The Instructions for Use (IFU) recommend that individuals who test negative but still suspect infection should retest 10 days after symptom onset or consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation. Additionally, differences in specimen types, such as purified serum or plasma used for the laboratory comparator tests versus whole blood specimens tested by the First to Know test, could also have contributed to missed detections.

For each study identified from the literature review, and based on the reported data, we manually retrieved or calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal (Category 2) and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal (Category 3) tests, along with the corresponding 95% CIs for the assessed outcomes. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models, which take into account the presence of between-study heterogeneity in the calculations. This approach was chosen over a fixed effects model since the underlying syphilis prevalence and other factors were different in each population studied.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: The development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^114USEFq]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). High credibility.

Point-of-care tests (POCT) for syphilis, based on the detection of Treponema pallidum (TP) total antibodies, have limited capacity in distinguishing between active and past/treated syphilis. We report the development and early evaluation of a new prototype POCT based on the detection of TP-IgA antibodies, a novel biomarker for active syphilis.

- **Methods**: The TP-IgA POCT (index test) was developed in response to the World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) for a POCT for confirmatory syphilis testing. Two sub-studies were conducted consecutively using 458 pre-characterized stored plasma samples in China (sub-study one, addressing the criteria for the WHO TPP), and 503 venous blood samples collected from pregnant/postpartum women in South Africa (sub-study two, addressing potential clinical utility). Performance of the index test was assessed against standard laboratory-based serology using a combination of treponemal (TPHA) and non-treponemal (rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) tests.

- **Findings**: In sub-study one, the index test demonstrated 96.1% (95% CI = 91.7%-98.5%) sensitivity and 84.7% (95% CI = 80.1%-88.6%) specificity for identification of active syphilis (TPHA positive, RPR positive). It correctly identified 71% (107/150) samples of past-treated syphilis (TPHA positive, RPR negative). In sub-study two, the index test achieved 100% (95% CI = 59%-100%) sensitivity for active syphilis and correctly identified all nine women with past syphilis.

The TP-IgA POCT has met the WHO TPP for a POCT for diagnosis of active syphilis and demonstrated substantial potential clinical utility.

### An evaluation of a novel dual treponemal/nontreponemal point-of-care test for syphilis as a tool to distinguish active from past treated infection [^112kwTiW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Most syphilis point-of-care (POC) tests detect treponemal antibodies, which persist after successful treatment. Subsequent POC tests are positive, despite no active infection, and can lead to unnecessary treatment. We evaluated a new POC test, incorporating a nontreponemal component, to distinguish active from past infection.

- **Methods**: Sera stored at two Australian laboratories were tested with the DPP Screen and Confirm Assay. Treponemal and nontreponemal test lines were compared to corresponding conventional treponemal and nontreponemal reference test results: immunoassays and rapid plasma reagin (RPR), respectively, with RPR quantification by endpoint titration. POC test outcome concordance with conventional test results was assessed according to serological and clinical categories.

- **Results**: Among 1005 serum samples tested, DPP treponemal line sensitivity was 89.8% (95% confidence interval, 87.3%-91.9%) and specificity was 99.3% (95% CI, 97.0%-99.9%). DPP nontreponemal line sensitivity was 94.2% (95% CI, 91.8%-96.0%) and specificity was 62.2% (95% CI, 57.5%-66.6%). DPP test outcome (pair of test lines) was concordant with both reference test results for 94.3% of 404 high-titer infections, 90.1% of 121 low-titer infections, 27.5% of 211 past/treated infections, and 78.1% of 242 infections classified as not syphilis. Among 211 past/treated infections, 49.8% were incorrectly identified as active infection, and a further 22.8% as not syphilis.

- **Conclusions**: DPP test use would result in identification of over 93% of active syphilis infections, whereas just over half of the past/treated infections were incorrectly identified.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114fyBdF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

"Probable active syphilis" is defined as seroreactivity in both non-treponemal and treponemal tests. A correction factor of 65%, namely the proportion of pregnant women reactive in one syphilis test type that were likely reactive in the second, was applied to reported syphilis seropositivity data reported to WHO for global estimates of syphilis during pregnancy.

- **Objectives**: To identify more accurate correction factors based on test type reported.

- **Search strategy**: Medline search using: "Syphilis [Mesh] and Pregnancy [Mesh]", "Syphilis [Mesh] and Prenatal Diagnosis [Mesh]", and "Syphilis [Mesh] and Antenatal [Keyword]".

- **Selection criteria**: Eligible studies must have reported results for pregnant or puerperal women for both non-treponemal and treponemal serology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We manually calculated the crude percent estimates of subjects with both reactive treponemal and reactive non-treponemal tests among subjects with reactive treponemal and among subjects with reactive non-treponemal tests. We summarized the percent estimates using random effects models.

- **Main results**: Countries reporting both reactive non-treponemal and reactive treponemal testing required no correction factor. Countries reporting non-treponemal testing or treponemal testing alone required a correction factor of 52.2% and 53.6%, respectively. Countries not reporting test type required a correction factor of 68.6%.

- **Conclusions**: Future estimates should adjust reported maternal syphilis seropositivity by test type to ensure accuracy.

### Syphilis [^115QC6bc]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Treponema pallidum may be visualized from lesions using dark field microscopy (DFM), direct fluorescent antibody stain (DFA), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Because these tests are not widely available, diagnosis predominantly relies on serology. While serologic tests and laboratory algorithms vary, testing usually begins with a screening treponemal test, such as an enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (EIA or CLIA), to detect treponemal antibodies. A positive screening test should be followed by a confirmatory treponemal test, typically the T. pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test. If both tests are positive, infection with syphilis is confirmed. Thereafter, the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, which is a quantitative non-treponemal test, should be used to measure disease activity and track response to treatment, although 15–41% of patients remain reactive even after successful treatment.

- **Test timing**: Screening treponemal tests (EIA or CLIA) usually become reactive first, often within two weeks of the chancre. However, patients with negative results who have syphilis-like symptoms or who report a high-risk contact should be retested following a further two to four weeks. The RPR test may remain non-reactive for up to four weeks after the chancre, so it is often negative in primary syphilis, but it is 98–100% sensitive in secondary syphilis cases.

### Metaanalysis of the performance of a combined treponemal and nontreponemal rapid diagnostic test for syphilis and yaws [^114sT84v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for treponemal infections are a relatively recent development; they allow broader access to diagnostic testing, particularly for communities with limited laboratory facilities. RDTs facilitate improved screening, diagnosis, and treatment of syphilis in women attending antenatal clinics in low-resource settings, thus reducing morbidity and mortality associated with mother-to-child transmission of syphilis. For yaws, an RDT would be valuable due to the low positive predictive value of clinical diagnosis alone. Validation and roll-out of an RDT would lead to improved epidemiological data on yaws worldwide, aiding in its eradication.

A major limitation of most treponemal RDTs is that they detect only treponemal-specific antibodies, making it difficult to distinguish between active and past infections. This can result in false positives, leading to the overtreatment of syphilis and complicating the interpretation of epidemiological data for both syphilis and yaws. The Dual Path Platform (DPP-RDT) Syphilis Screen & Confirm test kit (Chembio, Medford, New York) is the first commercial RDT providing both a "treponemal" and a "nontreponemal" result, which helps distinguish between active and past infections. This functionality makes it a potentially more useful test in clinical practice. The kit utilizes a lateral flow assay to detect both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies against a recombinant T. pallidum antigen and a nontreponemal antigen. Several recent publications have highlighted the good performance of this assay.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112oyrsU]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

For this meta-analysis, we reviewed the published literature to identify country-level studies reporting maternal syphilis seropositivity results for both treponemal and non-treponemal tests on all patients. This approach was used to estimate the likelihood that a single unconfirmed syphilis test would also be positive for the alternative test type, had it been conducted.

To identify studies, we conducted a systematic Medline search using the terms: "Syphilis [Mesh] and Pregnancy [Mesh]", "Syphilis [Mesh] and Prenatal Diagnosis [Mesh]", and "Syphilis [Mesh] and Antenatal [Keyword]". This included observational studies (trials, cross-sectional serosurveys, cohort, and case-control studies) published between January 2000 and November 2013, and reporting both non-treponemal and treponemal syphilis testing results of any type in pregnant or puerperal women. We also examined the three studies used in the original WHO correction factor estimate.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^113jhsct]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

There are limited studies of the clinical and laboratory performance of commercial TPHAs; however, our results are consistent with those observed in a study by Cole et al. In this study, 235 treponemal positive samples, 250 negative blood donor samples, and 3 QC sera were included in an independent laboratory evaluation of four commercial TPHAs compared to the Serodia TPPA. The sensitivity of the commercial TPHAs ranged between 91.7% and 98.3% and specificity 99.6% and 100% in this study.

The somewhat higher sensitivity of the TPHAs included in our study (95.8–97.2%) may be explained by the inclusion only of individuals with active untreated syphilis in our analysis, compared to the inclusion of 121 positive specimens with unknown disease and treatment categories in the study by Cole et al. The slightly lower specificity observed in our study is likely explained by the difference in the negative cohort included in these studies. Blood donors are a much less challenging cohort than the STI clinic/tertiary health care/pregnancy samples included in our study. The negative samples included in our study comprised a large proportion of samples with a high CLIA s/co index consistent with the indication for TPPA and RPR testing of these samples. Importantly, the data set used in this study more closely mimics the sample types that undergo confirmatory treponemal testing when the reverse screening algorithm is used.

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114D2fhV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature and conducted a meta-analysis to address the question, "What is the sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check, a rapid qualitative test for the detection of human antibodies to Treponema pallidum?" The Syphilis Health Check is the only rapid syphilis test currently cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis using Bayesian bivariate random-effects and fixed-effect models to create pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the Syphilis Health Check. We identified five test evaluations published in the literature and ten studies submitted to the FDA and for a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waiver application.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**:
	- The pooled sensitivity (95% CI) from the laboratory evaluations (n = 5) was 98.5% (92.1–100%), while pooled specificity was 95.9% (81.5–100.0%).
	- The pooled sensitivity for prospective studies (n = 10) was 87.7% (71.8–97.2%), while pooled specificity was 96.7% (91.9–99.2%).
	- Using nontreponemal supplemental testing, the sensitivity improved to a pooled sensitivity of 97.0% (94.8–98.6%).

The Syphilis Health Check may provide accurate detection of treponemal antibody.

### Which algorithm should be used to screen for syphilis [^116KA5EF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

A growing number of laboratories have implemented a reverse screening algorithm for syphilis testing, creating confusion among many healthcare providers. This review focuses on recent data addressing the clinical and economic impact of reverse screening and discusses the advantages and limitations of both traditional and contemporary algorithms.

- **Recent findings**: Screening for syphilis using a treponemal assay detects a higher number of patients with reactive results compared to traditional screening by rapid plasma reagin (RPR). A significant percentage of patients who are reactive by a treponemal screening assay are nonreactive by RPR. These discordant results may occur in patients with past, treated or untreated syphilis; early syphilis; or no syphilis. Recent reports suggest that the reverse screening algorithm may result in increased patient follow-ups, overtreatment, and potentially higher costs. However, other data suggest that reverse screening facilitates the detection of latent and early syphilis while offering an objective and automated screening approach.

- **Summary**: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends syphilis screening with a nontreponemal test. However, as laboratories continue to implement the reverse screening algorithm, it is important that samples with discordant screen-reactive, RPR-nonreactive results be tested by a second treponemal assay to assist in the interpretation of results.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^114FJYdw]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is no longer available in some settings. Here, we report the results of a clinical laboratory evaluation of alternative treponemal assays, including three T. pallidum hemagglutination assays (TPHAs), a T. pallidum IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a detailed laboratory evaluation of the only TPHA with Australian regulatory approval. The clinical laboratory evaluation comprised 300 sera (120 TPPA reactive and 180 TPPA non-reactive) collected from individuals aged 18 years or older between June 1, 2021, and June 1, 2023. The median age was 33 years; 92% were from a sexually transmitted infection clinic, 71% were male, 15.3% were living with HIV, and 5% were pregnant. Twenty-four percent had active untreated syphilis, 25% had prior treated syphilis, and 50.7% had no syphilis.

Positive percent agreement (PPA) compared to TPPA was as follows:

- **Arlington TPHA**: 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 95.4–99.9%)
- **Fortress TPHA**: 100% (95% CI, 96.9–100%)
- **Randox TPHA**: 99.2% (95% CI, 95.4–99.9%)
- **Euroimmun IgG ELISA**: 93.3% (95% CI, 87.4–96.6%)

Negative percent agreement (NPA) was 97.8% (95% CI, 94.4–99.1%) for each TPHA and 98.9% (95% CI, 96.0–99.8%) for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA. The clinical sensitivity of the Arlington and Fortress TPHAs for active untreated syphilis infection was equivalent to TPPA at 97.2% (95% CI, 90.4–99.5%), and the clinical specificity of these assays was 99.3% (95% CI, 96.3–100%).

In the evaluation of the NewBio TPHA, the study comprised 322 clinical serum and plasma samples and 22 quality assurance panel samples.

### Metaanalysis of the performance of a combined treponemal and nontreponemal rapid diagnostic test for syphilis and yaws [^112ohnnk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The human treponematoses are important causes of disease. Mother-to-child transmission of syphilis remains a major cause of stillbirth and neonatal death. There are also almost 100,000 cases of endemic treponemal disease reported annually, predominantly yaws. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) would improve access to screening for these diseases; however, most RDTs cannot distinguish between active and previous infections. The Dual Path Platform (DPP) Syphilis Screen & Confirm test includes both a treponemal (T1) and nontreponemal (T2) component and may improve the accuracy of diagnosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a metaanalysis of published and unpublished evaluations of the DPP-RDT for the diagnosis of syphilis and yaws. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement of the test compared with reference laboratory tests.

- **Results**: Nine evaluations, including 7,267 tests, were included. Sensitivity was higher in patients with higher titer rapid plasma reagin (≥ 1:16) for both the T1 (98.2% vs. 90.1%, P < .0001) and the T2 component (98.2% vs. 80.6%, P < .0001). Overall agreement between the DPP test and reference serology was 85.2% (84.4%-86.1%). Agreement was highest for high-titer active infection and lowest for past infection.

- **Conclusions**: The RDT has good sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal and nontreponemal components, both in cases of suspected syphilis and yaws, although the sensitivity is decreased at lower antibody titers.

### Performance assessment of treponemal and nontreponemal tests for the diagnosis of acquired syphilis [^114LyERa]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Low credibility.

Although numerous treponemal and nontreponemal assays are currently commercially available, a systematic evaluation of the performance of commercial kits for the diagnosis of acquired syphilis is required, because few studies of immunoassays have included clinically characterized samples stratified by stage. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of a nontreponemal assay (VDRL test) and two treponemal assays (ELISA and FTA-ABS test) to detect antibodies in the sera of anti-T. pallidum-positive and -negative individuals.

Performance evaluations were performed using the VDRL test to determine diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for syphilis. Considering all clinical stages of syphilis, the VDRL test showed high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values. In fact, only four anti-T. pallidum-positive samples were falsely classified as negative. Compared with the VDRL test, the treponemal tests evaluated also showed false-negative results. Of 187 tested samples, only seven were classified as negative by the FTA-ABS test, whereas all were correctly classified as positive by the ELISA, with no false-negative results.

As with the VDRL test, similarly high sensitivity values (100%) were found in other studies, whereas specificity ranged from 64.1% to 100%. In contrast, sensitivity (49.4% and 77.1%) and accuracy (71.1%) were lower in other studies. Here, we found high diagnostic sensitivity (> 96%) for all stages when samples were stratified by clinical stage.

### Update on syphilis diagnostics [^111n651Z]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Syphilis is rising globally, with resultant increases in morbidity and mortality that disproportionately impact underserved populations. Appropriate screening and testing for syphilis with accurate, reliable, affordable, and timely assays is crucial for combating this epidemic. This review provides a brief overview of laboratory methods for syphilis diagnosis, focusing on recent updates in diagnostics and directions for future research.

- **Recent findings**: Syphilis can be complex and time-consuming to diagnose and stage appropriately. The historic use of darkfield microscopy for diagnosis has been eclipsed by algorithms that include both nontreponemal and treponemal antibody tests for screening and confirmation of active Treponema pallidum infection. Newer diagnostic modalities include nucleic acid amplification assays (NAATs) and point-of-care testing (POCT), which hold promise for increasing the identification of active syphilis but have notable limitations. More work is needed to develop accurate, reliable, affordable, and expeditious tests to optimize syphilis diagnosis.

- **Summary**: Algorithms utilizing a combination of serological treponemal and nontreponemal assays remain the standard of care for the diagnosis of syphilis, but recently developed NAATs and POCT assays present opportunities to increase syphilis detection. Further research is warranted to improve upon these testing modalities and explore other markers that could aid in syphilis diagnosis.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: The development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^112hXMVX]. eClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

A prospective evaluation was conducted to determine the potential clinical utility of fresh venous blood samples in South Africa. Specimen collection took place between June and December 2018, with venous blood samples consecutively collected from consenting pregnant or peripartum women. Participants were aged 18 years or older and attended the obstetrics and gynecology department at RMMCH in Johannesburg, South Africa. Each participant provided 3 mL of venous blood collected in EDTA tubes for standard syphilis serology (reference) tests, and the index test was performed in duplicate by two independent test operators. Ethics approval was obtained from AHEC (#556/17) and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa (#R14/49), and all participants provided signed informed consent.

- **Reference tests**: A combination of a treponemal test (TPHA) and a non-treponemal test (RPR) was used as standard laboratory-based reference testing for the diagnosis of active syphilis infection. For the treponemal component, the ADVIA Centaur Syphilis assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) was employed, and for the non-treponemal component, the RPR (Omega Diagnostics, UK) test was utilized. As per the standard of care at the study site:
	- A woman who had reactive results for both TPHA and RPR tests (any titre) was defined as having active syphilis.
	- A reactive TPHA and non-reactive RPR indicate past/treated syphilis.
	- A non-reactive TPHA and a reactive RPR is biologically false positive.
	- Non-reactive results to both tests indicate no syphilis.

### Retrospective review of Treponema pallidum PCR and serology results: Are both tests necessary [^111pCp1Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

There has been a resurgence of syphilis diagnoses in Australia. We investigated whether our Treponema pallidum PCR test provides any additional diagnostic information over syphilis serology (chemiluminescence immunoassay [CMIA], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TPPA] assay, and the rapid plasma reagin [RPR] flocculation test). A retrospective audit of all T. pallidum PCR requests that came through our laboratory from January 2010 to June 2017 was conducted; data collected included age, gender, site of swab, and results from T. pallidum PCR, syphilis serology, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 PCRs. A total of 441 T. pallidum PCR tests were performed. On average, 3 T. pallidum PCRs per month were requested in 2011, and this rate increased to 17.2 requests per month in 2017.

A total of 323 patients had both T. pallidum PCR and syphilis serology performed, with 67% of swabs taken from the genitals. T. pallidum PCR gave positive results for 61/323 (19%) patients; of these 61 patients, 59 (97%) also had positive syphilis serology results (T. pallidum PCR sensitivity, 68%; specificity, 99%; positive predictive value, 97%; negative predictive value, 89%). Syphilis serology was positive for 91/323 patients (28%); of these 91 patients, 61 (66%) were also T. pallidum PCR positive (syphilis serology sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 88%; positive predictive value, 60%; negative predictive value, 99%). The Cohen's kappa value was 0.74, indicating substantial agreement between the two tests.

Our results show that most patients with positive T. pallidum PCR results also had positive syphilis serology.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^112PnKQ6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Of the 149 T. pallidum CLIA non-reactive, TPPA, and RPR non-reactive samples, 93 (93 out of 149; 62.4%) had CLIA, TPPA, and RPR testing performed due to an elevated CLIA s/co index (0.7). The median T. pallidum CLIA s/co index value for T. pallidum CLIA, TPPA, and RPR non-reactive samples was 0.7 (IQR: 0.43–0.76). Twenty-one of the 48 (16.0%) concurrently collected swabs for T. pallidum PCR testing (43.8%) were positive for T. pallidum DNA.

- **Performance characteristics of commercially available alternative treponemal assays**: The PPA, NPA, PPV, and NPV for the assays included in the evaluation of commercially available alternative treponemal antibody assays, compared to the Serodia TPPA assay, are described. Of the discordant results (TPPA non-reactive and TPHA reactive/equivocal), several were from individuals with prior treated syphilis, including three out of four from the Arlington TPHA, three out of four from the Fortress TPHA, and two out of four from the Randox. None of the two discordant Euroimmun IgG ELISA results (TPPA non-reactive and ELISA reactive) were from individuals with prior treated syphilis. Performance characteristics of the alternative treponemal serological assays compared to the TPPA among pregnant individuals and PLHIV are also described. No significant difference was detected in these subgroup analyses, noting that the number of pregnant individuals included in the study was limited.

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AUT92]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Most (4/5) of the laboratory-based studies were from the FDA clearance application and all used sera. The pooled sensitivity from the laboratory evaluations was 98.5% (95% CI, 92.1–100%) and the pooled specificity was 95.9% (95% CI, 81.5–100%). The laboratory study identified in the literature had the lowest sensitivity compared with the FDA laboratory evaluations.

Of the prospective studies, four had reference testing algorithms that included or were stratified by nontreponemal test results. Each study used rapid plasma reagin (RPR), a nontreponemal test, in their diagnostic algorithm. Matthias et al. and Nakku-Joloba et al. provided data on RPR reactivity, allowing stratification of results to define positivity as those both RPR and treponemal reference test reactive, and nonreactivity as those both RPR and treponemal reference test nonreactive.

Fakile et al. also defined positivity as both RPR and treponemal reference test reactive. They defined negative as those RPR and treponemal reference test nonreactive, RPR reactive and treponemal reference as nonreactive, or RPR nonreactive and treponemal reference test reactive. The CLIA waiver study used an antitreponemal chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA) as a screening test and confirmed it with RPR. If the RPR was nonreactive, the T. pallidum particle agglutination assay was used as the tiebreaker. With those reference algorithms, sensitivity improved to a pooled sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI, 94.8–98.6%).

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^1114fkEy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from 1960 to June 30, 2017. Following a consultation in November 2017, we updated the literature search from July 2017 to September 2018 using the search terms: (Treponema pallidum OR Neurosyphilis OR Syphilis) AND (sero-diagnos* OR serodiagnos* OR (serolog* AND (test* OR exam* OR assay* OR screen* OR lab* OR diagnos* OR nontreponemal OR treponemal OR algorithm* OR antibody titer) OR serofast)). The search was limited to human studies published in English.

The initial search yielded 4,851 non-duplicated abstracts. We excluded 4,504 abstracts that were not relevant to the key question: studies of nontreponemal testing only, animal studies, direct detection studies, review articles, guidelines, letters to the editor, and other publications that were not primary research studies. We reviewed 347 abstracts and further excluded 230 studies that described obsolete tests only, tests not approved by the FDA, those that used a gold standard based exclusively on non-FDA approved tests, studies of prevalence or laboratory technique only (no test performance), any duplicate publications, and abstracts without a full manuscript. After exclusions, 117 full papers were reviewed for potential inclusion. Eighty-one studies with either descriptive data on the use of treponemal tests or actual test performance data were abstracted into Tables of Evidence (Supplementary Table).

Studies with test performance data were prioritized according to their relevance to the key question.

The median age was 33; 92% were from a sexually transmitted infection clinic, 71% were male, 15.3% were living with HIV, and 5% were pregnant. Twenty-four percent had active untreated syphilis, 25% had prior treated syphilis, and 50.7% had no syphilis.

Compared to TPPA, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 95.4–99.9%), 100% (95% CI, 96.9–100%), 99.2% (95% CI, 95.4–99.9%), and 93.3% (95% CI, 87.4–96.6%), respectively, for the Arlington, Fortress, and Randox TPHAs, and Euroimmun IgG ELISA. Negative percent agreement (NPA) was 97.8% (95% CI, 94.4–99.1%) for each TPHA and 98.9% (95% CI, 96.0–99.8%) for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA.

**Standard laboratory-based and proposed point-of-care testing algorithms**: These are used for the diagnosis of active syphilis among pregnant women. The diagnosis of syphilis infection with a low RPR titre (TPHA/TPPA +, RPR) appears 85% effective for detecting samples with a high RPR titre (≥ 8), which does not seem to reduce overtreatment of syphilis.

### Accelerating worldwide syphilis screening through rapid testing: A systematic review [^113iV7hs]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a persistent public health issue in many low-income countries that have limited capacity for testing, which traditionally relies on a sensitive non-treponemal test followed by a specific treponemal test. However, the development of a new rapid treponemal test provides an opportunity to scale up syphilis screening in many settings where traditional tests are unavailable.

This systematic review of immunochromatographic strip (ICS) syphilis tests describes their sensitivity and specificity in two important clinical settings: sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics and antenatal clinics. Clinical data from more than 22,000 whole blood, plasma, or fingerstick ICS tests obtained at STI or antenatal clinics were retrieved from 15 studies. ICS syphilis tests exhibit a high sensitivity (median 0.86, interquartile range 0.75–0.94) and an even higher specificity (0.99, 0.98–0.99), both comparable with non-treponemal screening test characteristics.

Further research evaluating ICS syphilis tests among primary syphilis cases and among patients infected with HIV will be essential for the effective roll-out of syphilis screening programmes.

### Improved efficiency using sequential automated immunoassays for syphilis screening in blood donors [^113zgMN8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

For over two decades, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (Lifeblood) utilized the TPHA (Beckman Coulter PK TP System) for donor screening, followed by an RPR test. Positive samples were then sent to local reference laboratories for confirmatory testing, where a combination of treponemal and non-treponemal tests was used. Plasma from donations determined to be TPHA-false positive, or from donors with adequately treated past syphilis infection, is accepted for fractionation purposes only.

Following changes in Australian regulations for in vitro diagnostics medical devices in July 2015, Lifeblood was unable to source an appropriately registered RPR test or equivalent test suitable for testing blood donor samples. As a consequence, starting in April 2016, TPHA-reactive samples were sent to the reference laboratory for confirmatory testing. This resulted in increased costs, longer times to obtain results, and plasma wastage, as false-positive results could not be determined internally.

Use of sequential screening immunoassays 1 and 2 (IA1 and IA2) to clarify the antibody status of blood donors is successful in viral antibody testing algorithms but has not been applied to syphilis screening. Blood donors must pass a questionnaire that asks about infectious risks, resulting in a low pre-test probability for various infections screened, which leads to a considerable proportion of false-positive tests in blood donors. Using sequential immunoassays with sufficient differences in detection systems, assay format, and antigens is a cost-effective method to efficiently address these concerns.

### Metaanalysis of the performance of a combined treponemal and nontreponemal rapid diagnostic test for syphilis and yaws [^111tzgqW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The human treponematoses comprise venereal syphilis and the endemic treponematoses yaws, bejel, and pinta. Syphilis, caused by *Treponema pallidum* sp. *pallidum*, remains an important cause of both morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of syphilis is known to be particularly high among women attending antenatal clinics in sub-Saharan Africa, and mother-to-child transmission of syphilis remains a major cause of stillbirth and neonatal death worldwide. It has been estimated that mother-to-child transmission of syphilis results in as many as 300,000 stillbirths and neonatal deaths each year in Africa alone. These adverse pregnancy outcomes are entirely preventable through syphilis screening and appropriate treatment.

Yaws is an endemic treponemal infection caused by *T. pallidum* sp. *Pertenue*. Although closely related to *T. pallidum* sp. *pallidum*, yaws is not sexually transmitted and predominantly affects children living in poor, rural humid communities in the tropics. Untreated yaws progresses to destructive lesions of the bones and soft tissues. Between 2008 and 2012, there were 300,000 cases of yaws reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2012, the WHO launched a global effort to eradicate the disease by 2020, and the development of a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for yaws has been identified as a priority for the eradication program. As yaws is serologically indistinguishable from syphilis, tests developed for syphilis may also be of value in the diagnosis of yaws.

Diagnosis of treponemal infections is based on serological tests that are classified as treponemal.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^112fqciM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

In the initial evaluation, 46 people overall or 45 people in week 1 would have a positive test result, of which 9 or 5 would be false positives, respectively. This corresponds to positive predictive values (PPV) of 81% and 89%. Additionally, 14 people overall and 10 people in week 1 with negative test results would be falsely negative, yielding negative predictive values (NPV) of 98.6% and 99.0%.

Increasing the prevalence to 10% or 20% increases the PPV to 90% or more and slightly decreases the NPV. Due to some heterogeneity in the estimates of sensitivity, the values observed in practice could vary slightly from these figures, as suggested by the confidence intervals for the summary estimates.

For antigen test evaluations in asymptomatic participants, subgroup data were used based on testing availability. When testing was widely available without the need to meet pre-set criteria, the sensitivity was 49.6% (95% CI 42.1% to 57.1%), and the specificity was 99.6% (95% CI 99.5% to 99.7%). When testing was restricted to those reporting epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, the sensitivity increased to 64.3% (95% CI 54.6% to 73.0%) and the specificity to 99.7% (95% CI 99.5% to 99.8%).

Applying the average values to a larger cohort of 10,000 people asymptomatic for COVID-19, with a lower prevalence of 0.5% where 50 people had confirmed infections, illustrates the impact of these figures.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: a retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^1169fQAX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

This study demonstrates that TPHAs perform similarly to the TPPA and provides confidence that these assays are an acceptable alternative in settings that no longer have access to the TPPA. Importantly, three TPHAs had equivalent clinical sensitivity to the Serodia TPPA and two TPHAs had > 99% clinical specificity. This study underscores the importance of including clinical data on syphilis status in the assessment of treponemal serology assays, where prior infection may result in persistent reactivity. Additionally, it demonstrates the value of high-quality, independent laboratory evaluations of new tests performed by clinical laboratories when managing critical assay shortages or withdrawals of high-impact tests from the market.

Recent global shortages in blood culture bottles and critical antibiotics, such as benzathine penicillin for the treatment of syphilis, illustrate the complexity faced by health systems when managing supply-chain and regulatory disruptions. Here, we have demonstrated that commercial TPHAs are an acceptable alternative to the gold-standard TPPA test used for confirmatory treponemal serology testing, and that several TPHAs have high clinical sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of active untreated syphilis.

### Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of eight commercial assays for the detection of rubella virus-specific IgM antibodies [^117Vu8Wc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment of equivocal results involves managing results that fall within an indeterminate or equivocal range, where the result cannot be clearly categorized as either positive or negative. Two approaches were used to assess test performance in these instances: an "always-wrong" approach and a "presumptively positive" approach.

In both scenarios, equivocal results with the non-rubella sera were always considered positive. Thus, only one specificity value was calculated for each method. Sensitivity and accuracy were calculated using both approaches, with the equivocal results for the rubella sera considered either negative (always wrong) or positive (presumptively positive). For the accuracy calculations, equivocal results with the non-rubella sera were consistently treated as positive.

### Improving the coverage and accuracy of syphilis testing: The development of a novel rapid, point-of-care test for confirmatory testing of active syphilis infection and its early evaluation in China and South Africa [^112cYzFg]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The Dual Path Platform (DPP) Syphilis Screen & Confirm test (Chembio Diagnostics, Medford, NY, USA) is the first commercially available rapid point-of-care test (POCT) that provides both treponemal and non-treponemal results to help distinguish between active infection and past infection. However, significant variation in the diagnostic performance of the test has been reported, particularly in the sensitivity and specificity of the non-treponemal component.

A laboratory evaluation in Australia reported that 49.8% (105/211) of presumptive past treated serum samples were misclassified as active syphilis by the DPP test. Conversely, a field evaluation among pregnant women in Burkina Faso showed that 48.4% (44/91) of women with active syphilis would be undiagnosed if the DPP test were used. This difference in test performance can partly be explained by the lot-to-lot variation. A laboratory study in the United States demonstrated a significant difference in the sensitivity of the non-treponemal component of the DPP across two different lots: 65.3% (95% CI: 60.5–69.8) and 80.9% (95% CI: 72.6–87.2), respectively.

Given the re-emergence of a syphilis epidemic among pregnant women and key populations, which is a global health concern, innovative assays using a biomarker that can accurately distinguish between past, treated, and active infection at the point-of-care are needed. Access to such an assay will improve diagnosis and promote appropriate and timely treatment. To encourage research and development of reliable, low-cost POCTs for syphilis, the WHO developed a Target Product Profile (TPP) identifying minimum and preferred characteristics.

### Syphilis [^1146BUgA]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Inconclusive results generally arise in early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common combinations are:

- **RPR results**: A positive RPR with negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA) and confirmatory tests (TPPA) suggests the RPR result is a false positive.

- **Screening results**: A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with a negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR is likely a false positive but could indicate early infection.

- **Waning antibody levels**: A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with an indeterminate confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR could represent waning antibody levels following a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment, and, if early syphilis is possible, retest in two to four weeks. If results remain unchanged, interpretation is based on history. Consider the possibility of late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

### Laboratory assay evaluation demystified: A review of key factors influencing interpretation of test results using different assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis [^114VW5mi]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests are an integral part of the diagnosis and management of patients; however, these tests are far from perfect. Their imperfections can be due to patient health conditions, specimen collection, and/or technological difficulties with performing the assay and/or interpretation. To be clinically useful, testing requires the calculation of positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs). During the global pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), multiple assays with unknown clinical sensitivity and specificity were rapidly developed to aid in the diagnosis of the disease. Due to a lack of surveillance testing, the prevalence of COVID-19 remains unknown. Hence, using this situation as a clinical example, the goal of this article is to clarify the key factors that influence the PPV and NPV yielded by diagnostic testing. By doing so, we hope to offer health care providers information that will help them better understand the potential implications of utilizing these test results in clinical patient management.

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^112gTG3m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020).

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What diagnostic considerations should be taken into account when screening for syphilis using the traditional or reverse algorithm?" Improved laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is an important element of the effort to reduce syphilis rates. Screening for syphilis is performed using either a nontreponemal or treponemal test (part of the traditional or reverse algorithm, respectively). Both syphilis algorithms are used by laboratories; however, there are limited data on the performance and cost-effectiveness of these algorithms. An expert panel generated "key questions" in the laboratory diagnosis of syphilis. This paper pertains to the key factors that should be considered when deciding whether to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or the reverse algorithm. A systematic literature review was performed, and tables of evidence were created to address this question.

### Improving global estimates of syphilis in pregnancy by diagnostic test type: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115KRVXF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2015). Low credibility.

In 2008, the WHO estimated that worldwide, approximately 1.4 million pregnant women had "probable active syphilis" (PAS) or syphilis infections sufficiently active to result in mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and with the potential for subsequent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Syphilis in pregnancy can be devastating and is associated with poor fetal or infant outcomes in the majority of cases, with an estimated 52% of PAS cases resulting in adverse perinatal outcomes attributable to syphilis. PAS, defined as seroreactivity for both non-treponemal and treponemal tests, is used as the reporting measure by WHO since surveillance data typically do not include clinical information.

Currently, no single test or combination of tests accurately predicts the extent to which maternal syphilis infection in pregnancy will affect the fetus. However, serologic tests can be suggestive. The combination of a reactive non-treponemal test (e.g. rapid plasma regain [RPR], venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL]) and a reactive treponemal test (e.g. Treponema pallidum particle agglutination [TP-PA], T. pallidum hemagglutination assay), as defined in the 2008 WHO estimates, is compelling evidence for an infection that may result in MTCT. Neither type of test is both sensitive and specific on its own. A reactive, but unconfirmed, non-treponemal test may represent a biological false-positive result, whereas a reactive treponemal test alone may represent an old or previously treated infection that poses little exposure risk for the fetus.

### Clinical test performance of a rapid point-of-care syphilis treponemal antibody test: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113KXeVN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed prior publications and regulatory data to summarize the performance of the Syphilis Health Check test. We found that the Syphilis Health Check test had over 87% sensitivity and 96% specificity in prospective studies. When using nontreponemal results to inform infection status, the Syphilis Health Check had even higher sensitivity (97%), which is clinically important given that those who require treatment may have both reactive treponemal and nontreponemal results. By combining data from several studies, the precision around sensitivity and specificity estimates increased.

Additionally, we showed how the test performed in multiple settings across different specimen types. The sensitivity of the test tended to be much higher in the FDA trial studies compared with the studies identified in the literature, where the pooled sensitivity was 68.6%. The FDA trials included rigorous training and oversight, while the studies described in the literature did not include methods of quality monitoring. Programs supporting ongoing quality control and quality assurance should be implemented where these rapid tests are used.

Furthermore, the FDA prospective studies used sera for testing on the Syphilis Health Check, while the other prospective studies used whole-blood specimens. This difference may have also contributed to the higher sensitivity observed in most of the FDA trials.

The Syphilis Health Check rapid test is currently the only rapid point-of-care whole-blood test for syphilis that has FDA clearance.

### Serological response to treatment of syphilis according to disease stage and HIV status [^1139g4aE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Our study provides evidence that a combination of the TPPA test and an IgM ELISA is superior to the VDRL test for the diagnosis of syphilis. Furthermore, the syphilis disease stage significantly influences treatment response, whereas HIV coinfection impacts the response only in primary syphilis.

- **Clinical and serological characteristics at time of diagnosis**: We found a high rate of HIV and syphilis coinfection, which agrees with other reports. This patient group presented more often with latent or secondary syphilis, and a substantial proportion were men who have sex with men, as earlier described by the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. As expected, we found significantly lower VDRL and TPPA titers in early stages of syphilis than in later stages. Interestingly, 38 of 90 patients presenting with primary syphilis symptoms had a negative VDRL test result. In 37 of these patients, the initially positive treponemal IgM declined after therapy, proving that the VDRL result was false-negative. Thus, VDRL test sensitivity was only 58% for primary syphilis, which is lower than previously reported sensitivities of between 66% and 87%. Despite this, the VDRL test has been used for first-line screening in the United States and is recommended in textbooks. However, in recent years, a paradigm shift is ongoing in the United States toward using sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and chemiluminescence assays for screening. In Europe, treponemal tests (EIA or TPPA), which have been shown to be more sensitive, are recommended as single screening tests.

### Discordant results from reverse sequence syphilis screening — five laboratories, United States, 2006–2010 [^114L4tPy]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

The CDC recommends syphilis serologic screening with a nontreponemal test, such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, to identify persons with possible untreated infection; this screening is followed by confirmation using one of several treponemal tests. Recently, the availability of automatable treponemal enzyme and chemiluminescence immunoassays (EIA/CIA) has led some laboratories to adopt a reverse sequence of screening in which a treponemal EIA/CIA is performed first, followed by testing of reactive sera with a nontreponemal test. To better understand the performance of reverse sequence screening for syphilis, the CDC analyzed data from five laboratories that used reverse sequence screening during 2006–2010.

This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that among sera reactive on initial screening with a treponemal EIA/CIA, 56.7% had a nonreactive RPR test. Among these discordant sera, 31.6% also were nonreactive by treponemal testing using Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) tests. Among discordant sera, the rate of nonreactive confirmatory treponemal tests was 2.9 times higher in a population with low prevalence of syphilis, suggesting that the low-prevalence population had a higher percentage of false-positive test results. Although the CDC continues to recommend the traditional algorithm with reactive nontreponemal tests confirmed by treponemal testing, in this report the CDC offers additional recommendations if reverse sequence syphilis screening is used.

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^111GzK27]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

A literature review was conducted to determine factors to consider when deciding to screen for syphilis using either the traditional or reverse algorithm. The review involved searching several databases — Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, and Scopus — from January 2000 to June 2017. The query included search terms such as:

- **Pathogen-related terms**: "Treponema pallidum", "neurosyphilis", "syphilis"
- **Diagnostic-related terms**: "sero-diagnose", "serodiagnose", "serology", "test", "exam", "assay", "screen", "lab", "diagnose"
- **Specific testing terms**: "nontreponemal", "treponemal", "algorithm", "antibodytiter", "serofast"

This search yielded 4,702 abstracts. After excluding duplicates, animal models, non-English-language articles, non-FDA-cleared, and non-syphilis abstracts, a total of 1,851 abstracts remained.

These abstracts were then manually curated for potentially relevant papers using the following terms:

- **Diagnosis and serology terms**: "diagnosis", "sero diagnosis", "diagnostics", "serological test", "treponemal"
- **Testing techniques**: "enzyme immunoassay", "CLIA/CIA", "IgG", "IgM", "TPPA", "TPHA", "nontreponemal", "RPR", "VDRL"
- **Laboratory context terms**: "laboratory screening", "algorithm"

From this process, 251 abstracts were obtained. Abstracts related to:

- **Publication types**: meta-analysis, opinion, guidelines, letter to the editor, editorial
- **Content focus**: concepts, trends/new trends, observations, guidance, reviews
- **Testing guidelines**: non-FDA-approved tests, international studies with non-FDA tests

were excluded, resulting in 69 abstracts. All full articles sourced from these abstracts were reviewed. The findings from these articles/data were summarized in a "table of evidence" for the key question.

### Syphilis infection prevalence in the Middle East and North Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115yBfEp]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Another limitation lies in the diverse diagnostic tests used in the identified studies, which may exhibit variations in sensitivity and specificity. Although our analyses were stratified based on broad testing modalities (non-treponemal, treponemal, or a combination of both), we were unable to account for potential individual-test diagnostic biases within each category. Some studies did not explicitly specify the particular biological assay employed for infection ascertainment, and therefore a characterization of the syphilis diagnosis cannot be made. These studies were included for completeness but were analyzed separately. We noted an increase in the use of point-of-care tests in the last decade, which are increasingly recognized as reliable, accessible, and convenient options, particularly in resource-limited settings and in underserved and key populations.

A strong small-study effect was evident and confirmed by the analysis that demonstrated the presence of publication bias. Studies featuring a sample size of at least 200 for populations at high risk and STI clinic attendees, and at least 500 for all other population groups, reported 60% lower prevalence levels. This observation remained consistent in a sensitivity analysis investigating the small study effect separately for programmatic data (ANC and blood donor data) versus all other epidemiological studies among the other population groups (data not shown). However, the majority of studies included in the analyses had large sample sizes, enhancing the precision of the estimates.

### Clinical performance of the BioPlex 2200 syphilis total & RPR assay at a tertiary medical center with a high rate of syphilis [^114r5UWB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Manual treponemal and nontreponemal serologic testing has historically been used for the diagnosis of syphilis. This approach is simple and reproducible but labor-intensive. Recently, the FDA cleared the fully automated BioPlex 2200 syphilis total & RPR assay for the detection of treponemal and nontreponemal antibodies. We evaluated the clinical performance of this assay at a tertiary medical center with a high syphilis prevalence. Prospective consecutively collected (n = 400) and known RPR-positive (n = 100) specimens were compared using predicate manual rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA) methods and the BioPlex 2200 syphilis total & RPR assay. Positive and negative percent agreements (PPA and NPA, respectively) between the assays were calculated.

The PPA and NPA between the manual and BioPlex 2200 RPR results for the prospective population were 85% (17/20; 95% confidence interval, 69% to 100%) and 98% (373/380; 95% CI, 97% to 99%), respectively. The PPA for the manual RPR-positive population was 88% (88/100; 95% CI, 82% to 94%). Overall, the manual and BioPlex 2200 RPR titers demonstrated 78% (99/127) concordance within ± 1 dilution and 94% (120/127) within ± 2 dilutions.

An interpretation of the syphilis serologic profile using the traditional algorithm showed a concordance of 99.5% in the prospective population and 85% in the manual RPR-positive cohort. The performance of the BioPlex 2200 syphilis total & RPR assay is comparable to those of manual methods. The high NPA of this assay combined with the ability to automate a

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^1145sWrh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

We developed a list of key findings in "Summary of findings" tables and determined the certainty in the summary estimates for each test and finding, using the GRADE approach. Starting at high certainty, we downgraded meta‐analyses by one level when at least half of the studies had a high risk of bias in one or more domains. We downgraded for indirectness when at least half of the studies in the meta‐analyses had high concerns regarding applicability in at least one domain. We downgraded for imprecision when fewer people with the target condition were included than would have been needed to achieve the sensitivity estimates listed, with a width of the confidence interval of at most 10 percentage points. We downgraded for inconsistency when study estimates differed more than 20 percentage points from each other. We did not consider publication bias to be a problem.

- **Updating**: We will undertake weekly searches of published literature, preprints, and new test approvals. Depending on the number of new and important studies found, we will consider updating each review with each search if resources allow.

### Sensitivity and specificity of treponemal-specific tests for the diagnosis of syphilis [^116SqG79]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis of syphilis has traditionally involved an algorithm beginning with a nontreponemal test (e.g. rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) followed by a manual Treponema pallidum–specific assay (e.g. T. pallidum particle agglutination assay [TP-PA]) for confirmation of reactive nontreponemal serology. Currently, various treponemal-specific immunoassays are increasingly being used for syphilis screening and diagnosis, including enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), chemiluminescence immunoassays (CIAs), and microbead immunoassays (MBIAs), among others. These assays can be automated, reducing labor and turnaround time. Because some of these assays are relatively nonspecific, a reverse-sequence algorithm has been employed, beginning with a treponemal immunoassay, followed by reflex nontreponemal testing (e.g. RPR) on initially reactive specimens. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends conducting a TP-PA if there are discordant results between the immunoassay and RPR (e.g. EIA-reactive, RPR-nonreactive). Regardless of which algorithm is used, for laboratories to select the most appropriate treponemal test(s), it is important to consider the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in clinically characterized sera, stratified by the stage of syphilis.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the test performance of treponemal-specific tests, and results of this review were presented to a national consultation of experts in November 2017. Our review was based on a single key question: What is the sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal tests?

### Performance characteristics of the reverse syphilis screening algorithm in a population with a moderately high prevalence of syphilis [^112peTo2]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

With the recent introduction of automated treponemal tests, a new reverse syphilis algorithm has been proposed and is now used by many clinical laboratories. We analyzed the impact of instituting the reverse screening syphilis algorithm in a laboratory that serves a geographic area with a moderately high prevalence of syphilis infection.

- **Methods**: Serum samples sent for syphilis testing were evaluated using a treponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as the screening assay. EIA reactive samples were tested by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and titered to the endpoint if reactive. RPR nonreactive samples were further analyzed by the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test (TP-PA). Pertinent medical records were reviewed for false-reactive screens and samples with evidence of past syphilis infection.

- **Results**: Among 10,060 patients tested, 502 (5%) were reactive on the initial EIA screen. The RPR was reactive in 150 (1.5%) of these cases. TP-PA testing determined that 103 (1.0%) were falsely reactive on the initial EIA screen. The reverse screening algorithm, however, identified 242 (2.4%) individuals with evidence of latent, secondary, or past syphilis, 21 of whom had no or unknown prior treatment with antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: Despite a 1.0% false-reactive rate, the reverse syphilis algorithm was able to detect 21 patients with possible latent syphilis that may have gone undetected by traditional syphilis screening.

### Alternative treponemal serology assays for diagnosis and confirmation of syphilis in a diagnostic laboratory: A retrospective evaluation of four agglutination assays and one ELISA [^113Qnqn5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by *Treponema pallidum* subsp. *pallidum*. In 2019, the estimated global prevalence of syphilis was 49.7 million, marking a 61% increase since 1990. Rates of syphilis have risen significantly in many high- and middle-income countries over the past decade. In England, notifications more than doubled between 2013 and 2022, rising from 6.2 to 15.4 per 100,000. Similarly, rates more than tripled in Australia and the United States (US), escalating from 7.6 to 24.3 per 100,000 and from 5.5 to 17.7 per 100,000, respectively. Rates of congenital syphilis have also surged, with a 755% increase reported in the US between 2012 and 2021. Syphilis can present with numerous symptoms and lead to severe conditions including neurosyphilis. In pregnancy, syphilis infection can be transmitted vertically, causing neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Serological testing is the primary method for diagnosing syphilis, involving multiple tests to screen, confirm, and stage the infection. The reverse screening algorithm is commonly used in high-volume laboratories. This algorithm begins with a sensitive treponemal antibody immunoassay. If this assay is positive, it is followed by non-treponemal antibody tests. If the treponemal and non-treponemal results are discordant, a second confirmatory treponemal test is performed. In the United Kingdom and Australia, if the screening treponemal antibody result is positive, national guidelines recommend confirming the performance of non-treponemal and treponemal tests. The Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay is considered the preferred method for confirmation.

### The traditional or reverse algorithm for diagnosis of syphilis: Pros and cons [^113yZW16]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We reviewed relevant syphilis diagnostic literature to address the question, "What diagnostic considerations should be taken into account when screening for syphilis using the traditional or reverse algorithm?" Improved laboratory diagnosis of syphilis is an important element of the effort to reduce syphilis rates.

### Metaanalysis of the performance of a combined treponemal and nontreponemal rapid diagnostic test for syphilis and yaws [^115uRzMR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

There were only minor differences in the performance of the test based on the specimen type used. The sensitivity and specificity of the treponemal component varied depending on the reference treponemal assay used. Compared with the use of TPPA as the reference treponemal test, the sensitivity of the treponemal component was lower when the reference test was ELISA (P < 0.001) and the specificity was lower when TPHA was taken as the reference standard. The sensitivity of both the treponemal and nontreponemal components was higher in individuals with evidence of clinical disease than in asymptomatic cases.

In multivariable logistic regression, a higher RPR titer was significantly associated with an increased sensitivity of both the treponemal and the nontreponemal components (P < 0.001) after controlling for other variables. The sensitivity was lower for both test components in individuals being tested for yaws than in those tested for syphilis and when the test was performed on serum (P < 0.001 in both cases). The specificity of the treponemal component was higher when the reference standard was either TPPA or TPHA compared with EIA or ELISA (P < 0.0001 in both cases). The specificity of the nontreponemal component was significantly associated with the RPR titer after controlling for other variables (P < 0.023).
