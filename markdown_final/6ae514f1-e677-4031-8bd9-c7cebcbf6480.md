## Question

What antibiotics are recommended for a Bartholin cyst?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics are recommended for a Bartholin cyst. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about differentiating cyst from abscess and the core indication, or lack thereof, for antibiotics. Then, I should verify the clinical indications that warrant antibiotics. Next, I will review microbiology to target likely pathogens. After that, I need to select empiric regimens when indicated, including STI coverage when appropriate, and confirm culture, de-escalation, and duration. I should also consider procedure-first management, reconcile the marsupialization nuance, address special populations like pregnancy and penicillin allergy, incorporate stewardship principles, and finally summarize the recommended approach with safeguards like biopsy for malignancy risk in older patients.

> Let me first confirm the distinction, because this drives whether antibiotics are needed at all. A Bartholin duct cyst is usually a sterile mucus collection due to obstruction and does not warrant antibiotics, whereas a Bartholin gland abscess represents infection and requires drainage; even then, antibiotics are not routine unless cellulitis or systemic illness is present, so the default is procedural management without antibiotics for uncomplicated presentations [^113YkcUS].

> Wait, let me verify indications for systemic therapy so we don't over-treat. Antibiotics are indicated when there is surrounding cellulitis or systemic features such as fever or leukocytosis, and culture-positive abscesses correlate with these systemic signs, supporting a targeted approach; in immunocompromised or otherwise high-risk hosts, clinicians often lower the threshold for antibiotics based on general principles of severe infection care and individualized risk, but the core trigger remains cellulitis or systemic illness rather than the mere presence of an abscess [^114jnBr6] [^113YkcUS].

> Next, I should review the microbiology to anchor empiric choices. Most series identify Escherichia coli as the most common pathogen in Bartholin abscesses, with a substantial anaerobic component typical of mixed vulvovaginal abscesses; anaerobes including Bacteroides and Prevotella are frequent, and polymicrobial infection occurs, with occasional extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli reported, so gram-negative and anaerobic coverage is the empiric priority when antibiotics are truly indicated [^114jnBr6] [^111XZvUs].

> Hold on, I should not jump past STI risk. In younger, sexually active patients, gonorrhea and chlamydia may coexist and warrant testing and treatment when risk factors or positive results are present; one ED cohort showed higher gonorrhea rates among patients with Bartholin cysts or abscesses, reminding me to screen and treat per STI guidelines when indicated [^113YJeUL].

> Before antibiotics, I will now examine procedural management because it is the cornerstone. Drainage with Word catheter is the office-first approach that reduces recurrence compared to simple incision and drainage; marsupialization, silver nitrate, and other techniques are alternatives used particularly for cysts or recurrent disease, while simple needle aspiration or I&D alone is discouraged due to recurrence, so procedural selection and secure fistulization come first [^11365H2N] [^113YkcUS].

> Hmm, wait a minute, there is an apparent conflict about marsupialization in abscesses. Older guidance cautioned that marsupialization should not be used to treat a gland abscess, which I initially took at face value; however, more contemporary office management literature reports similar healing and recurrence across fistulization and marsupialization techniques in cysts and abscesses, suggesting marsupialization can be reasonable in selected abscess cases once acute infection is controlled, so I should reconcile this by favoring Word catheter acutely and reserving marsupialization for cysts, recurrent disease, or after inflammation has settled when anatomy permits and expertise is available [^113YkcUS] [^11365H2N].

> Now, for empiric antibiotics when they are actually indicated by cellulitis or systemic illness, I need to ensure we cover gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes while avoiding unnecessary breadth. Reasonable oral choices include amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg twice daily, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength twice daily plus metronidazole 500 mg twice daily to add anaerobic coverage, with selection informed by local susceptibility data and patient factors; in more ill patients, ceftriaxone parenterally plus metronidazole is a pragmatic bridge that mirrors anaerobic-inclusive regimens used for pelvic infections, aiming to narrow once cultures guide therapy [^notfound].

> But wait, I should double-check the resistance thresholds I'm applying. The 20% local resistance cut-off commonly used to gate empiric TMP-SMX for cystitis comes from IDSA/ESCMID UTI guidance; while not written for Bartholin abscesses, the stewardship logic is sound, so if local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds about 20%, I should avoid it as empiric monotherapy and prefer alternatives until culture data allow de-escalation, documenting that this is an extrapolated stewardship principle rather than a Bartholin-specific rule [^117Lu3fS].

> If STI risk is present or tests are positive, hold on, I should verify exact regimens. Treat chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days and treat gonorrhea with ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once, weight-adjusted, per CDC STI guidelines; this STI-directed therapy is layered on top of, or replaces, other antibiotics depending on whether cellulitis or systemic features from the abscess mandate broader anaerobic and gram-negative coverage, so I need to tailor rather than stack indiscriminately [^111LoDNy].

> I should confirm the plan to culture and de-escalate. Obtain purulent material for culture at the time of drainage when feasible, recognizing that culture-positive cases are common and correlate with systemic signs; then step down to the narrowest effective agent and shortest effective duration guided by susceptibilities and clinical response, aligning with stewardship priorities to reduce collateral damage [^114jnBr6].

> Regarding duration, let me consider the minimum effective course. For cellulitis accompanying a drained abscess in an immunocompetent patient who improves promptly, 5 to 7 days is typically adequate, with extension based on clinical response, host status, and microbiology; I should document clinical targets for stopping and emphasize that shorter, optimized courses are preferred when safely possible [^116s3oei].

> For special populations, I need to ensure pregnancy safety. Avoid doxycycline and fluoroquinolones in pregnancy; favor beta-lactams such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or a cephalosporin when antibiotics are indicated, and monitor closely given rare but serious complications reported in pregnant patients with Bartholin abscesses, emphasizing prompt drainage and obstetric collaboration [^notfound].

> In penicillin allergy, let me think about balanced coverage. A reasonable non–beta-lactam path is TMP-SMX combined with metronidazole to cover gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes when antibiotics are indicated, adjusting per culture, severity, and local resistance, while remembering that anaerobes are prominent contributors in vulvovaginal abscesses and need explicit coverage when systemic therapy is used [^notfound].

> I should not miss the malignancy safety net. In patients aged 40 years or older or with recurrent or atypical masses, arrange biopsy to exclude Bartholin gland carcinoma and consider guideline-informed oncologic evaluation because a subset of persistent "cysts" harbor malignancy [^111VKYhp] [^111aBKqu].

> Next, I should review an ESBL contingency. If there is a history of ESBL colonization or compelling risk and the patient has systemic illness, a carbapenem such as ertapenem can be used initially with rapid de-escalation once susceptibilities return, recognizing that ESBL E. coli have been documented in Bartholin abscesses albeit infrequently; stewardship guardrails apply to minimize Reserve-agent exposure [^114jnBr6] [^116s3oei].

> Finally, I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship is explicit. Do not prescribe antibiotics for uncomplicated cysts or drained abscesses without cellulitis or systemic illness; obtain cultures when possible, select Access-category or narrower agents where effective, and de-escalate promptly based on results to the shortest safe duration, documenting local susceptibility considerations and clinical endpoints for stopping [^113YkcUS] [^1148v7dw] [^116s3oei].

> In summary, the primary treatment of a Bartholin gland abscess is procedural drainage, typically with a Word catheter; reserve antibiotics for cases with cellulitis, systemic signs, or special host risks, target gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes when needed, add STI therapy if indicated by risk or testing, culture at drainage with de-escalation as results return, and protect patients through pregnancy-safe selections, malignancy screening in older patients, and strict stewardship to avoid unnecessary antibiotic exposure [^113YkcUS] [^113YkcUS] [^111LoDNy] [^111VKYhp] [^116s3oei].

Antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated Bartholin cysts, as these cysts are noninfectious. Antibiotics are only used when there is an abscess or cellulitis, and must be combined with drainage or a Word catheter — not as sole therapy. Empiric regimens should cover polymicrobial flora [^114HkXgj], including anaerobes and common pathogens such as E. coli [^114jnBr6], Bacteroides, and Prevotella [^111XZvUs]. Recommended options include amoxicillin-clavulanate or a cephalosporin plus metronidazole; add doxycycline or ceftriaxone if gonorrhea or chlamydia is suspected. Duration is typically 5–7 days, adjusted to culture results and clinical response.

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated only when there is clinical evidence of infection, such as:

- **Abscess formation**: Fluctuant, tender, erythematous swelling with purulent discharge.

- **Cellulitis**: Surrounding erythema, warmth, and induration [^113YkcUS].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, chills, or malaise.

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased risk of infection and complications [^116s3oei].

Antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated, noninfected Bartholin cysts.

---

## Common pathogens associated with infected Bartholin cysts

Infected Bartholin cysts are typically polymicrobial, involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; common pathogens include [^114HkXgj]:

| **Pathogen** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Escherichia coli | Most common aerobic pathogen [^114jnBr6] |
| Bacteroides species | Common anaerobic pathogen [^111XZvUs] |
| Prevotella species | Common anaerobic pathogen [^111XZvUs] |
| Streptococcus species | Less common [^111XZvUs] |
| Neisseria gonorrhoeae | Associated with sexually transmitted infections [^113YJeUL] |
| Chlamydia trachomatis | Associated with sexually transmitted infections [^113YJeUL] |

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and options include [^114HkXgj]:

- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate**: 875 mg/125 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days.

- **Cephalosporins**: Cefdinir 300 mg orally twice daily or cefpodoxime 200 mg orally twice daily, combined with metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days.

- **Clindamycin**: 300 mg orally three times daily for 5–7 days, particularly in penicillin-allergic patients [^114HkXgj].

- **Metronidazole**: 500 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days, combined with doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily if gonorrhea or chlamydia is suspected.

---

## Role of antibiotics in preventing recurrence

Antibiotics alone do not prevent recurrence of Bartholin cysts. Recurrence is common due to persistent ductal obstruction or inadequate drainage, and definitive surgical interventions — such as marsupialization or Word catheter placement — are necessary to prevent it [^11365H2N] [^112Mf9kv].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy carries potential risks and side effects, including [^116s3oei]:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis [^1125QnEF].

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, antibiotic-associated colitis [^116TQqA9].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Development of resistant bacterial strains [^1148v7dw].

- **Superinfection**: Overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms [^1147GDA7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize that antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated Bartholin cysts and should be used only when there is clinical evidence of infection, such as abscess formation or cellulitis. Definitive surgical interventions are necessary to prevent recurrence [^11365H2N].

### Clinical and microbiological characteristics of Bartholin gland abscesses [^114jnBr6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

To examine the clinical course and causative microorganisms of Bartholin gland abscesses, this retrospective study analyzed all patients treated for such abscesses between 2006 and 2011 at the Soroka University Medical Center in southern Israel.

During the study period, 219 women were admitted due to Bartholin gland abscesses, 63% of which were primary abscesses and 37% were re-abscesses, indicating the occurrence of a second clinical event. Pus cultures were positive in 126 cases (61.8%), with Escherichia coli identified as the most frequent pathogen (43.7%), and 10 cases (7.9%) were polymicrobial. Culture-positive cases showed significant associations with fever (25% compared with 9.3%; p = 0.043), leukocytosis (50.4% compared with 33.8%; p = 0.027), and neutrophilia (17.9% compared with 5.9%; p = 0.021). The odds ratio of having any of these conditions with a positive culture was 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.3–4.3; p = 0.003). In the recurrent group, 81% experienced recurrence on the same side, with a mean recurrence time of 32 ± 50 months. Infection with E. coli was significantly more common in recurrent infections compared to primary infections (56.8% compared with 37%; p = 0.033). Three cases showed resistance to most beta-lactam antimicrobials, with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli strains identified.

In conclusion, a substantial proportion of patients with Bartholin gland abscess are culture-positive, with E. coli being the most common pathogen. Microbiological findings and their clinical correlations underline the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment.

This study was conducted to determine the epidemiology concerning the causative organisms for Bartholin's gland abscess in Japan. Microbiological examination of 224 cases showed positive results in 219 cases and negative results in 5 cases. Of all the bacterial isolates, 307 were aerobes and 118 were anaerobes. The most frequently isolated bacterium was Escherichia coli. Among the anaerobes, the most frequently isolated organism was Bacteroides species, followed by Prevotella species. Organisms related to respiratory infectious diseases, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, including resistant bacteria, were sometimes involved between 2000 and 2004.

### Management of Bartholin's duct cyst and gland abscess [^113YkcUS]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Bartholin's duct cysts and gland abscesses are common problems in women of reproductive age. Bartholin's glands are located bilaterally at the posterior introitus and drain through ducts that empty into the vestibule at approximately the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions. These normally pea-sized glands become palpable only if the duct becomes cystic or if a gland abscess develops. The differential diagnosis includes cystic and solid lesions of the vulva, such as epidermal inclusion cyst, Skene's duct cyst, hidradenoma papilliferum, and lipoma.

The goal of management is to preserve the gland and its function if possible. Office-based procedures include insertion of a Word catheter for a duct cyst or gland abscess and marsupialization of a cyst; marsupialization should not be used to treat a gland abscess. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is warranted only when cellulitis is present. Excisional biopsy is reserved for use in ruling out adenocarcinoma in menopausal or perimenopausal women with an irregular, nodular Bartholin's gland mass.

### Cancer of the vulva: 2025 update: FIGO cancer report 2025 [^111aBKqu]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). High credibility.

Bartholin gland carcinomas are rare forms of vulvar malignancy, accounting for approximately 5% of vulvar cancers. It is unclear what proportion is associated with high-risk HPV infection. Cancers of the Bartholin glands may either be transitional cell or squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) that arise from the duct, or adenocarcinomas arising from the gland itself. There are also adenoid cystic and adenosquamous variants. All SCCs showed diffuse and intense p16 expression consistent with the presence of HPV. The diagnosis is often made after resection of a persistent or recurrent Bartholin cyst.

Bartholin gland carcinomas are effectively treated with a radical hemivulvectomy and bilateral groin dissection; however, they are more likely to have metastatic disease at presentation. Due to their location deep in the ischiorectal fossa, adequate surgical margins may be difficult to achieve, and postoperative radiation may decrease the likelihood of local recurrence.

Radical local excision alone is adequate treatment for adenoid cystic lesions, and adjuvant radiation is recommended for positive margins or perineural invasion.

### Cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: Penetration of meropenem into infected cysts [^113pT2dv]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The cyst fluid/serum MEPM concentration ratio varied among the patients, but we could not identify any factors that influenced this ratio because of the small number of subjects enrolled in this study. Neither the cyst fluid MEPM concentration nor the MEPM concentration ratio was correlated with the time until cyst drainage after administration of MEPM, suggesting that the intracystic MEPM concentration might be maintained for a considerable period. Nine of the ten patients enrolled in this study were on hemodialysis. In these patients, the serum MEPM concentration might have been maintained at a higher level because of decreased urinary excretion, which could have led to the prolongation of higher intracystic MEPM concentrations.

For β-lactam antibiotics, it is generally accepted that the bactericidal effect of these agents is determined by the time that concentrations of antibiotics are above the MIC (T > MICs) for the pathogens. This is another possible explanation for the effectiveness of MEPM (β-lactam antibiotics) for all patients in this study, despite showing poor penetration into the infected cysts.

Among the limitations of this study, the sample size was small, and all of the patients were Japanese. In addition, nine of the ten patients were on dialysis, and eight patients had liver cyst infections. Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to non-dialysis patients or patients with renal cyst infections. Furthermore, we only measured the serum and cyst fluid MEPM concentrations at one point in each patient, so we do not have information about the systemic MEPM concentration.

### Nafcillin [^1125QnEF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Nafcillin should generally not be administered to patients with a history of sensitivity to any penicillin. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy. The use of antibiotics may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If new infections due to bacteria or fungi occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.

The liver/biliary tract is the primary route of nafcillin clearance. Caution should be exercised when patients with concomitant hepatic insufficiency and renal dysfunction are treated with nafcillin. Serum levels should be measured and the dosage adjusted appropriately to avoid possible neurotoxic reactions associated with very high concentrations [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].

Prescribing Nafcillin for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Nafcillin for Injection, USP, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Nafcillin for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it…

### Novel technique for management of Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses [^111pNKcd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Definitive methods for treatment of a Bartholin cyst and abscess include placement of a Word catheter, marsupialization, application of silver nitrate, and surgical excision. Placement of a Word catheter is the most frequently employed technique for office and emergency department (ED) management. However, many institutions do not have the Word catheter available; in addition, the catheter tends to dislodge before epithelialization, leading to recurrence of the cyst.

- **Objective**: We have developed a simple technique for management of Bartholin gland abscess or cyst using readily available materials. This technique involves using a small loop of plastic tubing, which is secured to prevent expulsion before epithelialization of a drainage tract.

- **Case report**: A 25-year-old woman presented to the ED with a Bartholin gland abscess. After administration of local anesthetic, a loop of tubing was placed, allowing for drainage of the abscess. The patient was discharged home with a course of oral antibiotics. At a 3-week follow-up, the Bartholin gland abscess was found to be healed; the device was removed without difficulty, leaving two drainage tracts.

- **Conclusion**: This technique may be used as an alternative to placement of a Word catheter for management of Bartholin gland abscess or cyst.

### Polycystic intrahepatic infection caused by enterococcus casseliflavus: a case report and literature review [^114LJyeN]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The 2015 CARI guidelines suggested that once multiple cystic liver infections or a suspicious infection is diagnosed, antibiotics should be used first to treat the infection. Because the infection occurs in the capsule, quinolones with strong lipid solubility are preferred. If the symptoms are not relieved within 72 hours, third-generation anti-infection treatment with ceftriaxone should be added to the regimen, and the antibiotic regimen should be adjusted according to drug sensitivity and culture results.

In the 2022 guidelines, it is strongly recommended to use fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins as first-line antibiotics for treating hepatic cyst infections, based on a level of evidence 2 and a 90% consensus. Additionally, a 4 to 6 weeks course of antibiotic therapy is advised, backed by a level of evidence 4 and a unanimous 100% consensus. Suwabe's research indicates that in patients experiencing liver cyst infections, especially those with re-episodes and liver enlargement, Gram-negative bacteria constitute 74–79% of the identified pathogens, among which E. coli exhibits notable resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. This study further proposes that the heightened resistance to fluoroquinolones could be associated with prolonged and repeated antibiotic usage.

In patients with Polycystic Liver Disease (PLD) experiencing cyst infections, surgical treatment options include cyst fenestration, also known as deroofing, and segmental hepatic resection, which are applicable for patients with superficial large cysts or small to medium-sized cysts confined to specific liver segments.

### Cefdinir [^112nauKu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing cefdinir in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged treatment may result in the possible emergence and overgrowth of resistant organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate alternative therapy should be administered. Cefdinir, as with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (antibiotics), should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of colitis. In patients with transient or persistent renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), the total daily dose of cefdinir should be reduced because high and prolonged plasma concentrations of cefdinir can result following recommended doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefdinir, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When cefdinir is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ce.

### Urinary retention as the presentation of Bartholin's duct cyst in a neonate [^114DQE1J]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with a vaginal mass (large Bartholin's duct cyst) associated with a contralateral renal cyst and hydroureteronephrosis are unable to urinate. While occasionally seen in adults, Bartholin's duct cyst is rare in neonates. The origins of Bartholin's and Gartner's cysts can be traced to the mesonephric duct. Given the rarity of these cysts, there is significant confusion regarding their diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Here, we present the first report of an interlabial mass as a Bartholin's duct cyst in a neonate. The treatment of vaginal cysts is also discussed.

### Interventions in addition to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of radiologically proven tubo-ovarian abscess [^112qDUTT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

The first-line management of a tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) typically involves the administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. These antibiotics cover gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobic, and aerobic bacteria. In addition to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, interventions such as interventional drainage or surgical removal can be used to reduce the infection's burden. These additional interventions are categorized under radiological drainage (CT- or USS-guided) or surgical interventions (minimal access, laparotomy, or colpotomy approach).

For patients who respond to antibiotic treatment alone, the morbidity associated with surgery or anesthesia for additional interventions can be avoided. However, there is uncertainty about whether adding surgical or procedural interventions provides an overall benefit in managing TOA. Early intervention on an inflammatory mass in an unwell patient may increase morbidity due to the risks associated with both anesthesia and the procedure itself. While avoiding surgery may reduce short-term morbidity, it may allow the inflammatory mass to persist or enlarge, potentially prolonging treatment duration and increasing the risk of clinical deterioration or recurrence.

A summary of the benefits and risks for each treatment modality is available in Supplementary Material 2.

- **Why it is important to do this review**: TOA is a commonly encountered health problem.

TOA is frequently encountered in the hospital setting, and global estimates show a rising incidence.

Regarding specific circumstances for intra-abdominal abscess, particularly in patients with tubo-ovarian abscess, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend administering clindamycin 450 mg PO QID or metronidazole 500 mg PO BID. This should be done to complete 14 days of therapy with oral doxycycline to provide more effective anaerobic coverage in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease with a tubo-ovarian abscess.

### New screens and targets in antibacterial drug discovery [^117T8Enx]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

As the supply of effective antibiotics dwindles and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria becomes more commonplace, there is an urgent need to identify novel antibacterial targets and leads with new mechanisms of action. Among the strategies to bolster our scarcity of effective antibiotics are biochemical and phenotype-based screens, and the rational design of inhibitors. In this review, we highlight some recent contributions that these methodologies have yielded, placing particular emphasis on screens capable of identifying novel leads involved in processes such as virulence, underexploited targets that reside in bacterial cell surfaces, the use of bacteriophage as antibiotic adjuvants, and novel targets of essential pathways. We discuss these findings in the context of the field of antibiotic drug discovery and how such discoveries position us to begin filling the antibiotic gap that has been widening for the last half-century.

### Microbiology and management of polymicrobial female genital tract infections in adolescents [^114HkXgj]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

This review describes the microbiology and management of female genital tract infections in adolescents. These infections include vulvovaginitis, vulvovaginal pyogenic infections (abscesses of Bartholin's and Skene's glands, infected labial inclusion cysts, labial abscesses, furunculosis, and hidradenitis), endometritis, pyometritis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian and pelvic abscess. Anaerobes can be cultured in 50% to 90% of females with a variety of genital infections and are the exclusive isolates in 20% to 50%.

Obligate anaerobes are particularly common in closed-space infections, such as tubo-ovarian and vulvovaginal abscesses. The most common anaerobes found in these infections are gram-negative bacilli (especially P. bivia and P. disiens) and anaerobic cocci. Anaerobes generally are not the only pathogens found, but are usually mixed with aerobes. The most common aerobic pathogens are members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, especially E. coli, and aerobic or microaerophilic streptococci.

Sexually acquired infections include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex, and Condyloma accuminata. Treatment regimens must provide antimicrobial coverage for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, anaerobes, streptococci, and gram-negative facultative bacteria.

### Multi-targeting by monotherapeutic antibacterials [^111q9twe]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2007). Low credibility.

Antibacterial discovery research has been driven, medically, commercially, and intellectually, by the need for new therapeutics that are not subject to the resistance mechanisms that have evolved to combat previous generations of antibacterial agents. This need has often been equated with the identification and exploitation of novel targets. However, efforts towards the discovery and development of inhibitors of novel targets have proved frustrating. It might be that the 'good old targets' are qualitatively different from the crop of all possible novel targets. What has been learned from existing targets can be applied to the quest for new antibacterials?

Selection of studies

Two review authors will perform an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search in Covidence, using a hierarchy of exclusion checklist. We will remove duplicated abstracts using the relevant function in Covidence, as well as by comparing study characteristics during screening and manually removing duplicate studies if identified. Where abstracts are not in English, we will use Google Translate to determine eligibility. We will retrieve the full texts of all potentially eligible studies. Where a potentially eligible study is not in English, we will seek the assistance of a translator. Two review authors will independently examine all full‐text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and select studies eligible for inclusion in the review. We will check the references from the studies under consideration for inclusion. Any disagreements will be resolved by referral to a third review author, who will not have been one of the two initial authors involved in assessing that study. We will evenly divide the work between us following the search.

Screening eligible studies for trustworthiness

At least two review authors will evaluate all studies meeting our inclusion criteria to select studies that, based on available information, we deem to be sufficiently trustworthy to be included in the analysis.

- **Trustworthiness evaluation**: We will use one of the following screening checklists.
	- Checklist to assess Trustworthiness in Randomised Controlled Trials (TRACT checklist)

### Prospective randomized study of marsupialization versus silver nitrate application in the management of Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses [^112Mf9kv]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

To prospectively compare the efficacy of marsupialization or silver nitrate application in the treatment of Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses, both of which are widely used as outpatient procedures, a prospective randomized trial was conducted.

- **Design**: Prospective randomized trial. Design classification I.
- **Setting**: Teaching and research hospital, a tertiary center.
- **Patients**: A total of 212 patients were admitted to our gynecology clinic with symptomatic Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses.
- **Interventions**: Marsupialization and silver nitrate application in Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses.
- **Measurements and main results**: The 212 patients were randomly allocated to either marsupialization (Group I) or silver nitrate application (Group II) from March 2005 through March 2007. A total of 159 women were eligible for reevaluation at the end of the sixth month. In all, 83 were randomized to Group I and 76 to Group II. The patients were called for revisits on day 3, day 7, month 1, and month 6 of treatment. The two groups were compared for recurrence rates as the primary outcome and duration of procedures, complications, size of scar tissues, and presence of dyspareunia as secondary outcomes. Comparisons of the two groups were evaluated by Pearson's Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. The two groups were comparable with regard to age, parity, and diameter of cyst or abscess. The recurrence rates were similar: 24.1% in group I and 26.3% in group II at 6 months (p = .67). No statistically significant differences were found with respect to the duration of procedures or presence of dyspareunia. Complete healing without scar was observed.

### The Bartholin gland cyst: past, present, and future [^111m5HjG]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Bartholin gland cysts account for 2% of all gynecologic visits per year. The treatment of Bartholin gland cysts has evolved from a complicated, bloody procedure requiring general anesthesia to, most recently, a simple puncture of the cyst and placement of a drain performed in the office. Although treatments for Bartholin gland cysts seem simple on the surface, diagnosing simple cysts versus abscesses versus malignant tumors can complicate treatment for this common problem.

This article examines the history of the treatment of Bartholin gland cysts. Traditional treatments include excision, fistulization, marsupialization, and cauterization with carbon dioxide laser and silver nitrate. Modern variations are discussed, including the use of hydrodissection for excision, as well as the application of magnetic resonance imaging in devising treatment for recurrent cysts.

### Antibiotic therapy for severe bacterial infections [^116s3oei]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Early antibiotic therapy for patients with severe infections is essential to improve outcomes. Conversely, the use of overly broad antibiotic therapy for susceptible pathogens or unnecessary antibiotics in patients without bacterial infections is associated with adverse life-threatening events and superinfections. Changes induced by antibiotics in the human microbiota alter both immune and metabolic systems. Uncontrolled antibiotic use encourages the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Around 50% of ICU patients receiving antibiotic therapy do not have confirmed infections, while de-escalation and shortened treatment duration are infrequently performed. Mortality from serious infections remains high, highlighting the need for treatment optimization.

- **Methods**: Narrative review.
- **Objectives**: To summarise the available evidence, emerging options, and unresolved controversies in optimizing antibiotic therapy in severe infections.
- **Results**: Local epidemiology, underlying illnesses, accessibility to health care systems, and diagnostic and therapeutic resources are important factors to consider. Rapid diagnostic tests combined with individualized decision-making improve the selection of antibiotic therapy. Rapid de-escalation to narrow-spectrum monotherapy and shortening of the duration of therapy should be the rule. Uncertainty still persists regarding the personalization of therapy for difficult-to-treat resistant bacteria. Pharmacokinetic (PK) optimization and prolonged or continuous beta-lactam use are safe and may improve outcomes.

### Tobramycin [^113NuH5D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial cultures should be obtained prior to and during treatment to isolate and identify etiologic organisms and to test their susceptibility to tobramycin. If susceptibility tests show that the causative organisms are resistant to tobramycin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted. In patients with a serious, life-threatening gram-negative infection, including those with a suspected condition, therapy with a penicillin or cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside may be indicated. Treatment with tobramycin sulfate may be initiated before the results of susceptibility studies are obtained. The decision to continue therapy with tobramycin should be based on the results of susceptibility studies, the severity of the infection, and other important concepts discussed in the warnings box above.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tobramycin and other antibacterial drugs, tobramycin should only be used to treat or prevent infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Cefaclor [^1147GDA7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prescribing cefaclor in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria. Prolonged use of cefaclor may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with cephalosporin antibiotics. It should be recognized that a positive Coombs' test may be due to the drug, for example, in hematologic studies or in transfusion cross-matching procedures when antiglobulin tests are performed on the minor side, or in Coombs' testing of newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin antibiotics before parturition.

Cefaclor should be administered with caution in the presence of markedly impaired renal function. Since the half-life of cefaclor in anuria is 2.3 to 2.8 hours, dosage adjustments for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment are usually not required. Clinical experience with cefaclor under such conditions is limited; therefore, careful clinical observation and laboratory studies should be made. As with other β-lactam antibiotics, the renal excretion of cefaclor is inhibited by probenecid.

Antibiotics, including cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.

### Designing development programs for non-traditional antibacterial agents [^114kPjGV]. Nature Communications (2019). Low credibility.

Given the threats posed by the rise of antibacterial resistance, many responses are being pursued in parallel, including infection prevention and control, disease surveillance, antibiotic stewardship, and the development of new therapeutics, including so-called "non-traditional" therapeutics.

Although there is no universal definition of "non-traditional", Tse et al. define traditional products to include "small-molecule agents that directly target bacterial components to exert a bacteriostatic [i.e.g.rowth prevention] or bactericidal [i.e. killing] effect", whereas non-traditional agents include "antimicrobial therapeutics that work through other means (i.e. not a small molecule and/or utilizes a non-traditional target)". Non-traditional agents are diverse, including:

- **Agents that modify the microbiome**.
- **Chelators that inactivate metals needed for bacterial enzymatic activity**.
- **Nucleic acids that interfere with bacterial DNA**.
- **Antibodies or viruses (bacteriophages) that target microorganisms or their toxins with high specificity**.

Their diversity reflects radically different mechanisms and approaches that may improve treatment options and, in theory, delay the development of resistance.

### Tobramycin [^116TQqA9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including tobramycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When an antibacterial drug is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tobramycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common side effect caused by antibiotics, which usually resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. However, after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### Tetracycline hydrochloride [^1115BTKt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tetracycline hydrochloride and other antibacterial drugs, tetracycline hydrochloride should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Tetracycline is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below:

- **Upper respiratory tract infections**: Caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Hemophilus influenzae. Note: Tetracycline should not be used for streptococcal disease unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible.

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: Caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Eaton agent), and Klebsiella sp.

- **Skin and soft tissue infections**: Caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus. (Tetracyclines are not the drugs of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infections.)

- **Infections caused by rickettsia**: Including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus group infections, Q fever, and rickettsialpox.

- **Psittacosis**: Caused by Chlamydophila psittaci.

- **Infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis**: Such as uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections.

### Streptomycin [^116XWPZX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including streptomycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When streptomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance, rendering them untreatable by streptomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics and usually resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. However, sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after taking the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Drug interactions**: The ototoxic effects of aminoglycosides, including streptomycin, are potentiated by the co-administration of ethacrynic acid, furosemide, mannitol, and possibly other diuretics.

- **Nursing mothers**: Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from streptomycin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

### Placement of a Word catheter: A resident training model [^114TdGEw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The present study developed and evaluated a practical teaching model and training protocol for Word catheter placement in the treatment of a Bartholin gland cyst. Residents were asked to treat a model of the female perineum, fashioned from harvested porcine tissue, with a simulated Bartholin cyst via Word catheter placement and drainage. Each resident was evaluated for procedural competence and was retested after viewing a continuous 59-second video demonstrating catheter placement.

The model's resemblance to female genitalia was confirmed by 68% of residents. Correct diagnosis and treatment of a Bartholin gland cyst were made by 61%. The mean pre-training score was 5.5 ± 1.46, while the post-training average was 8.2 ± 1.20, indicating an approximate 58% increase in resident proficiency (P < .05).

A model of the female perineum fashioned from harvested porcine tissue is a suitable instructional aid in the recognition and treatment of a Bartholin cyst. Proficiency in Word catheter placement is improved through the use of the model and instructional video.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute cystitis, specifically in relation to antibiotic therapy, the ESCMID/IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend initiating any of the following regimens as first-line therapy for female patients with uncomplicated cystitis:

- **Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID for 5 days**: This regimen is recommended due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, with efficacy considered superior compared to 3 days of TMP/SMX.

- **TMP/SMX 160/800 mg BID for 3 days**: This option is recommended if local resistance rates of uropathogens causing acute uncomplicated cystitis are less than 20% or if the infecting strain is known to be susceptible.

- **Fosfomycin trometamol 3 g in a single dose**: Recommended due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, although it appears to have inferior efficacy compared to standard short-course regimens.

- **Pivmecillinam (where available) 400 mg BID for 3–7 days**: Recommended due to minimal resistance and propensity for collateral damage, acknowledging that it may have inferior efficacy compared to other available therapies.

### CO2 laser treatment for Bartholin gland abscess: Ultrasound evaluation of risk recurrence [^113pfkwX]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of CO2 laser treatment and parameters correlated with recurrence in patients with Bartholin gland abscesses treated using this approach.

This prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2) was conducted in a university hospital and included 147 patients who met eligibility criteria.

The intervention involved preoperative ultrasound evaluation of Bartholin gland lesions and CO2 laser treatment. All patients received CO2 laser therapy, with the median operative time being 15 minutes (range, 12–35 minutes). The median postoperative stay was 1 hour (range, 1–4 hours). The estimated 3-year relapse-free rate was 88.56%. Lesion wall thickness of 0.5–1.5 mm, multilocular lesion, and hyperechogenic lesion were correlated with recurrence.

In conclusion, CO2 laser treatment of Bartholin gland abscesses could be a valid option. Ultrasound characteristics of Bartholin gland lesions could predict lesion recurrence rate.

### The who essential medicines list AWaRe book: From a list to a quality improvement system [^1148v7dw]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are often prescribed inappropriately, either when they are not necessary or with an unnecessarily broad spectrum of activity. AWaRe (AccessWatchReserve) is a system developed by WHO to classify antibiotics based on their spectrum of activity and potential for favoring the development of antibiotic resistance.

- **AWaRe classification**: Access antibiotics have a narrow spectrum and low potential for resistance; Watch antibiotics have a broader spectrum and higher potential for resistance; Reserve antibiotics are last resort antibiotics to use very selectively.

The WHO target is that by 2023, at least 60% of prescribed antibiotics globally should be from the Access category. The WHO AWaRe Book aims to improve empiric antibiotic prescribing by providing simple guidance for common infections based on the principles of AWaRe in alignment with the Model Lists of Essential Medicines for adults and children.

Five patients proceeded to surgical excision following failure of conservative measures. Long-term follow-up was available for eight patients, ranging from 1 to 12 years (mean of 4 years).

There were three patients with recurrences at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively. The first patient initially demonstrated clinical resolution but had a recurrence of symptoms at 1 year, which resolved following surgical excision of the affected area. The second patient experienced recurrence 5 years after surgical excision. She was treated with observation alone, and her symptoms resolved within 6 months. The third patient was initially treated with surgical excision, with a recurrence in the same breast 7 years later. She was subsequently treated with anti-inflammatories only and was then lost to follow-up.

### Intracystic magnetic resonance imaging in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: Features of severe cyst infection in a case-control study [^112aejZ6]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited renal disorder and the most common monogenetic cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Cyst infection is a frequent and serious complication of ADPKD that is often difficult to diagnose and treat and can even be fatal. It has been estimated that 30% to 50% of patients with ADPKD experience renal infection during their lifetime, although cyst infection leading to hospitalization is much less frequent, occurring in approximately 9%. Cyst infection often becomes resistant to antibiotics, and percutaneous or surgical drainage of infected cysts is generally recommended when fever persists despite 1–2 weeks of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. It has been reported that infection of large cysts (> 5 cm in diameter) is more likely to become severe and that large infected cysts frequently require drainage. However, much is still unknown regarding cyst infection in ADPKD. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for detecting infected cysts, but this imaging method has the disadvantages of limited availability and high cost. Additionally, it was reported that the radiation dose associated with PET might be increased in patients with renal failure, making it difficult to perform PET in ADPKD patients whenever cyst infection is suspected. We recently devised MRI diagnostic criteria for cyst infection based on a comparison between cysts with confirmed infection, normal cysts, and cysts with intracystic hemorrhage (Additional file 1). The possibility of cyst infection can be evaluated by using

### White paper: Developing antimicrobial drugs for resistant pathogens, narrow-spectrum indications, and unmet needs [^114VbMkB]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Despite progress in antimicrobial drug development, a critical need persists for new, feasible pathways to develop antibacterial agents to treat people infected with drug-resistant bacteria. Infections due to resistant gram-negative bacilli continue to cause unacceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Antibacterial agents have been historically studied in noninferiority clinical trials that focus on a single site of infection (e.g. complicated urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections); yet these designs may not be optimal, and often are not feasible for the study of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria.

Over the past several years, multiple stakeholders have worked to develop consensus regarding paths forward with the goal of facilitating the timely conduct of antimicrobial development. Here we advocate for a novel and pragmatic approach, and toward this end, present feasible trial designs for antibacterial agents that could enable the conduct of narrow-spectrum, organism-specific clinical trials and ultimately approval of critically needed new antibacterial agents.

### Chorioamnionitis and sternoclavicular septic arthritis after drainage of Bartholin gland abscess [^112nnVtC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Complications after drainage of Bartholin gland abscesses in pregnancy are rare.

- **Case**: A 29-year-old primigravid at 35 weeks of gestation with dichorionic-diamniotic twins underwent Bartholin gland abscess drainage. Afterward, she reported shoulder pain and became febrile. Examination revealed maternal and fetal tachycardia with abdominal tenderness consistent with chorioamnionitis, and she underwent delivery. Blood cultures grew Escherichia coli, and antibiotics were begun. Her shoulder pain worsened, and examination demonstrated inflammation over the sternoclavicular joint. Fluid aspirate of this joint grew E. coli. She experienced improvement after aspiration and was discharged home on antibiotics.

- **Conclusion**: Although rare, severe consequences can result from Bartholin gland abscesses in pregnant patients, including sepsis and septic arthritis. Close clinical follow-up should be considered in pregnant patients undergoing abscess drainage.

### Azactam [^111RsRUq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Azactam (aztreonam for injection, USP) and other antibacterial drugs, Azactam should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Azactam is indicated for the treatment of the following infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms:

- **Urinary tract infections**: Include both complicated and uncomplicated cases, such as pyelonephritis and cystitis (initial and recurrent) caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca*, Citrobacter species*, and Serratia marcescens*.

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: Encompass infections like pneumonia and bronchitis caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter species, and Serratia marcescens*.

- **Septicemia**: Caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis*, Serratia marcescens*, and Enterobacter species.

- **Skin and skin-structure infections**: Include infections associated with postoperative wounds, ulcers, and burns, caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter species.

* indicates additional specified strains within the species mentioned.

### Incidental Bartholin gland cysts identified on pelvic magnetic resonance imaging [^113QyUuy]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

To estimate the prevalence of Bartholin gland cysts in asymptomatic women serving as control participants who underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of research studies, the secondary aim was to investigate potential demographic characteristics associated with Bartholin gland cysts.

- **Methods**: Pelvic MRIs from 430 control participants enrolled in five research projects were evaluated. All images were assessed by at least two authors. The presence, laterality, and size of Bartholin gland cysts were recorded. Demographic information for each participant was obtained at the time of enrollment in the respective parent study.

- **Results**: Approximately 3% of the participants had visible Bartholin gland cysts on MRI scans. Fifty percent of the cysts were identified on the right side, 42.9% were seen on the left side, and 7.1% were bilateral. The cysts averaged 1.3×1.2×1.3 cm, with dimensions ranging from 0.5 to 2.7 cm. There were no demographic differences between women with and without visible Bartholin gland cysts.

- **Conclusion**: Bartholin gland cysts occur in 3% of adult women and affect women of broad ranges of age and parity. Women with visible Bartholin gland cysts are demographically similar to those without cysts on pelvic imaging.

- **Level of evidence**: II.

### Endometriosis MR mimickers: T1-hyperintense lesions [^117JG9vc]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

Bartholin's gland cysts arise in the superficial perineal pouch of the urogenital triangle. When the ducts of these glands become obstructed, it leads to retention of secretions and the formation of cysts. Bartholin's gland cysts are the most common type of vulvar cysts, mostly ranging in size from 1 to 4 cm.

While many patients with Bartholin's gland cysts are asymptomatic, some may experience mild dyspareunia during vaginal penetration, which needs to be differentiated from deep dyspareunia associated with endometriosis. It is important to note that the specific anatomical location of these cysts on the posterolateral surface of the vestibule, often occurring bilaterally, should not be mistaken for cystic endometriotic implants in patients with a history of vaginal delivery (with or without episiotomy) or prior transvaginal surgeries. On imaging, Bartholin's gland cysts with high proteinaceous content exhibit high signal intensity on T1-WI, along with heterogeneous and low signal intensity on T2-WI (Supplemental - Figure 5).

Skene's gland cysts, or periurethral glands, are tubule-alveolar structures located at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions along the distal two-thirds of the urethra, providing lubrication. These are typically round and unilocular fluid-filled cysts. Homogeneous T1-hyperintensity, suggesting high proteinaceous content, can help in their detection and physical examination identification (Supplemental - Figure 6). It is essential to differentiate these cysts from urethral diverticulum.

### Cancer of the vulva: 2021 update [^115JbH5G]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Low credibility.

Bartholin gland carcinomas are rare forms of vulvar malignancy, accounting for about 5% of vulvar cancers, and it is unclear what proportion is associated with high-risk HPV infection. Cancers of the Bartholin glands may be either transitional cell or squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) that arise from the duct or adenocarcinomas arising from the gland itself. There are also adenoid cystic and adenosquamous variants. All SCCs showed diffuse and intense p16 expression, consistent with the presence of HPV. The diagnosis is often made after resection of a persistent or recurrent Bartholin's cyst.

Bartholin gland carcinomas are effectively treated with a radical hemivulvectomy and bilateral groin dissection; however, they are more likely to have metastatic disease at presentation. Due to their location deep in the ischiorectal fossa, adequate surgical margins may be difficult to achieve, and postoperative radiation may decrease the likelihood of local recurrence.

Radical wide local excision alone is adequate treatment for adenoid cystic lesions, and adjuvant radiation is recommended for positive margins or perineural invasion.

### Exploring the principles behind antibiotics with limited resistance [^115V7fT1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our study investigated the effects of diverse antibiotics on bacterial resistance evolution to elucidate factors contributing to antibiotic efficacy. We identified key principles of antibiotic action that minimize resistance and proposed potential directions for future antibiotic development. However, further in vivo experiments are needed to enhance and validate the findings presented here. More generally, these promising results suggest a fruitful direction for future therapeutic applications, advocating for a focus on dual-target mechanisms that disrupt bacterial membranes while targeting additional cellular components. Our study focused on antibiotics effective against Gram-negative bacterial species with critical clinical importance. Therefore, it remains to be shown whether similar conclusions hold for antibiotics specific against infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Our work also highlights the complexity of resistance mechanisms and the importance of a strategic, informed approach to antibiotic design and use.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute cystitis, particularly in terms of antibiotic therapy, the ESCMID/IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend reserving fluoroquinolones such as ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin as second-line therapy. This is due to the potential for collateral damage associated with these antibiotics.

### Bartholin's gland carcinoma: a 15-year experience [^111TUfoL]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Our objective was to review our experience with carcinoma of Bartholin's gland relative to treatment and oncologic outcome.

- **Methods**: Patient names were collected from our vulvar cancer database for the period September 1985 to September 2000. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed, and data were abstracted relative to demographics, presenting symptoms, treatment, and oncologic outcome.

- **Results**: We treated 12 women with Bartholin's gland carcinoma, and 11 patients are reported. Seven women presented with a painless vulvar mass, and 8 of 11 had initially been treated for an infectious process before referral to our institution. Squamous histology was most common, and the right gland was more frequently involved. Ten patients were treated with primary surgery, followed by adjuvant radiation in 7 for inadequate resection margins or lymphatic metastases. One patient was treated with primary chemoradiation. Stage I, II, III, IVA, and IVB disease was present in 3, 1, 4, 2, and 1 patient, respectively. Recurrence was suffered by 54.5% during a mean follow-up time of 73.5 months (median, 60; range, 8–180 months). Overall survival is 58.3% at the time of writing.

- **Conclusions**: Conventional therapy for Bartholin's gland carcinoma yielded a 67% 5-year survival. Seventy-one percent of women receiving adjuvant radiotherapy recurred despite this precaution. Work is needed to identify an effective systemic therapy and to better determine which patients may benefit from pelvic radiotherapy.

### Ery-tab [^115gNngS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Ery-tab®, should only be used to treat bacterial infections and do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Ery-tab® is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ery-tab® or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, which usually resolves when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes, after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever), which may occur as late as two or more months after taking the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^116p68YB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, particularly concerning pregnant patients, the ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend administering a targeted antibiotic for 5–7 days in pregnant patients with acute cystitis. It is advised to avoid using amoxicillin and ampicillin if empiric therapy is initiated before culture and sensitivity results are available, due to the high rates of resistance of E. coli to these antibiotics in most areas.

### Association of Bartholin cysts and abscesses and sexually transmitted infections [^113YJeUL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Bartholin gland cysts or abscesses account for many gynecologic visits in the emergency department (ED). Previous smaller studies have suggested a link between Bartholin cysts/abscesses and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but few studies have involved the ED.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified patients aged 18 years or older seen in one ED between January 2012 and March 2017 who had urinalysis and urine culture and/or were tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas by nucleic acid amplification testing. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate associations between Bartholin cysts/abscess and demographics, laboratory findings, and ED diagnoses.

- **Results**: Data were collected for 75,000 ED patients. Sixty-four patients had a diagnosis of Bartholin cyst or abscess, 40 of whom were also tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. Ten percent of patients with a Bartholin cyst/abscess were infected with N. gonorrhoeae, compared with 3% of those without a Bartholin cyst/abscess (P = 0.008). The rates of C. trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis infections were 13% and 26%, respectively, among patients with a Bartholin cyst/abscess, compared with 8% and 30%, respectively, among those without a Bartholin cyst/abscess (P > .05 for both). On regression analysis, only increased urobilinogen level (β, 0.31; odds ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11–1.66; p = 0.003) and infection with N. gonorrhoeae (β, 1.69; odds ratio, 5.40; 95% CI, 1.43–20.35; p = 0.01) were associated with a Bartholin cyst/abscess.

### Levofloxacin penetration into a renal cyst in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^114x4q3b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited disorder often complicated by cyst infection. Treatment becomes particularly challenging when the culprit organism is resistant to antibiotics known to sufficiently penetrate cysts. We present the case of a patient with ADPKD and suspected cyst infection caused by group B Streptococcus who was treated successfully with levofloxacin and ampicillin. Although data support excellent cyst penetration with ciprofloxacin, its gram-positive antimicrobial activity is marginal. The newer quinolones have added gram-positive activity, but little is known about cyst penetration by these antibiotics. We simultaneously measured cyst and serum levels of levofloxacin and ampicillin and found levofloxacin to penetrate cysts well. Therefore, levofloxacin may be useful in the management of renal cyst infection, particularly for the treatment of gram-positive organisms.

In cases of vulvar cancer, particularly for patients with Bartholin gland carcinoma, the BGCS 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining combination imaging using MRI and CT. This approach provides detailed information on the extent of local and metastatic disease. Additionally, consideration should be given to obtaining a PET-CT in selected cases.

### Association of recurrence of infected congenital preauricular cysts following incision and drainage vs fine-needle aspiration or antibiotic treatment: A retrospective review of treatment options [^114BEhYy]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment modalities for preauricular sinus tract infections vary. Effort should be taken to decrease methods that lead to increased recurrence after surgical excision.

The objective of this study was to determine whether incision and drainage (I & D) of infected congenital preauricular cysts is associated with an increased rate of recurrence when compared with fine-needle aspiration or antibiotic treatment.

This was a 9-year (2006–2014) retrospective cohort study undertaken at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Children treated for preauricular sinus tract infections were identified using the procedure code for excision of preauricular pit, cyst, or sinus tract. The main outcomes and measures focused on postexcision recurrence.

Sixty-nine children, ranging in age from 4 months to 17 years (mean age, 5.9 years), underwent excision of a preauricular cyst. Thirty-seven of 69 patients (54%) were female. Fifty-seven of 69 (83%) had a preoperative history of infection; the remainder had chronic drainage. Of children with preoperative infection, 27 were initially treated with incision and drainage (I & D), 12 were treated with fine-needle aspiration only, and 18 received antibiotic therapy alone. Overall, the recurrence rate was 8 in 69 (11.6%). Among the 27 patients with a preoperative history of infection treated with I & D, 5 lesions (18.5%) recurred, whereas among those who only received preoperative antibiotic therapy or fine-needle aspiration, 1 in 30 lesions (3.3%) recurred (absolute difference of 15.2%; 95% CI, -1.7% to 33.6%).

### Bartholin duct cyst and gland abscess: Office management [^11365H2N]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

The Bartholin glands, located in the base of the labia minora, play a role in vaginal lubrication. Due to the presence of other glands, the removal of a Bartholin gland does not affect lubrication. Blockage in the ducts of these typically pea-sized structures can lead to gland enlargement and the subsequent development of Bartholin duct cysts or gland abscesses. Two percent of women will develop a cyst or an abscess in their lifetime; hence, physicians should be familiar with the range of treatment options. Bartholin duct cysts and gland abscesses can typically be treated in the office. The healing and recurrence rates are similar among fistulization, marsupialization, and silver nitrate and alcohol sclerotherapy. However, needle aspiration and incision and drainage — the two simplest procedures — are not recommended due to the relatively increased recurrence rate.

### Rectovaginal fistula as a complication to a Bartholin gland excision [^1172gwxs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Rectovaginal fistula is a rare complication of inflammatory bowel disease, obstetric trauma, pelvic surgery, radiation, and trauma. We present a rectovaginal fistula occurring after an excision of a Bartholin gland.

- **Case**: A healthy 43-year-old woman presented with flatus per vagina immediately following a Bartholin gland excision. She had a history of recurrent Bartholin abscess and had undergone multiple incision and drainage procedures of this cyst over the past 6 years. On rectovaginal examination, the patient was found to have a rectovaginal fistula and subsequently underwent successful transvaginal repair.

- **Conclusion**: Rectovaginal fistula can occur after excision of a Bartholin gland. This case report illustrates a rare and serious complication of a commonly performed gynecologic procedure.

### Novel approaches are needed to develop tomorrow's antibacterial therapies [^111yzzKR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Society faces a crisis of rising antibiotic resistance even as the pipeline of new antibiotics has been drying up. Antibiotics are a public trust; every individual's use of antibiotics affects their efficacy for everyone else. As such, responses to the antibiotic crisis must take a societal perspective. The market failure of antibiotics is due to a combination of scientific challenges to discovering and developing new antibiotics, unfavorable economics, and a hostile regulatory environment.

- **Scientific solutions**: These include changing the way we screen for new antibiotics. More transformationally, developing new treatments that seek to disarm pathogens without killing them, or that modulate the host inflammatory response to infection, will reduce selective pressure and hence minimize resistance emergence.

- **Economic transformation**: This will require new business models to support antibiotic development.

- **Regulatory reform**: Reform is needed so that clinical development programs are feasible, rigorous, and clinically relevant.

Pulmonary and critical care specialists can have tremendous impact on the continued availability of effective antibiotics. Encouraging use of molecular diagnostic tests to allow pathogen-targeted, narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy, using short rather than unnecessarily long course therapy, reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for probable viral infections, and reducing infection rates will help preserve the antibiotics we have for future generations.

### Cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: Penetration of meropenem into infected cysts [^113CjRtw]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

It is often difficult to identify infected cysts in patients with ADPKD. Therefore, we only enrolled patients whose cysts contained purulent fluid with abundant neutrophils, confirming that they had definite cyst infection. The serum MEPM concentration varied widely in this study, but this finding was consistent with previous reports that the Cmax of MEPM varied following a single intravenous dose of 0.5 g in patients on intermittent hemodialysis. Our results suggested that MEPM shows poor penetration into infected cysts. MEPM is a water-soluble antibiotic, so this finding may be considered reasonable. However, MEPM is clinically effective for cyst infection in most ADPKD patients.

One reason for this apparent discrepancy might be that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MEPM is relatively low for most bacteria. For example, the MIC 90 of MEPM for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumonia (typical gram-negative bacteria) was only 0.03 μg/mL according to a survey performed in Japan. However, the MIC 90 of MEPM is high for some bacteria, e.g. 16 μg/mL for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The intracystic MEPM concentration might not reach the effective level for such bacteria, which could explain why MEPM is not always effective for cyst infection.

If cyst infection does not respond to antibiotic therapy with MEPM, we should consider that the intracystic MEPM concentration may be too low to be effective against the causative bacteria, and we should also remember that Enterococcus spp. is frequent in patients with refractory cyst infection.

### Intracystic magnetic resonance imaging in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: features of severe cyst infection in a case-control study [^114KCVsr]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

A limitation of this study is its retrospective nature, as it was conducted at a single center. We enrolled controls who were documented as not having cyst infection during the study period according to our medical records; however, it is possible that some of these patients received treatment for this condition at other hospitals. Additionally, selection bias may have occurred because attending physicians decided whether to perform abdominal MRI in the controls. A positive result from cyst contents culture was required for case enrollment, suggesting that our subjects might have had severe cyst infection since bacteria were not eliminated by prior antibiotic therapy.

Identifying the infected cyst in patients with severe cyst infection is clinically important, as drainage should be performed. The frequency of cysts with a diameter greater than 5 cm was significantly higher among cases than controls, possibly due to selection bias. Infection is more likely to become severe if the cyst is large, and draining cysts smaller than 5 cm can be technically difficult. We determined the cyst/skeletal muscle ratio; however, this method is less accurate than using an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Creating an ADC map takes longer and is often challenging for patients with ADPKD, who can only remain in the supine position briefly due to organomegaly.

The MRI protocol we used was relatively convenient for patients, though obtaining 10 mm slices may have reduced imaging sensitivity. Lastly, the number of patients was insufficient to draw definitive conclusions, limiting the generalizability of the study findings.

### Interventions in addition to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of radiologically proven tubo-ovarian abscess [^115sVDR7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

The domains of bias that will be addressed are as follows:

- **Bias arising from the randomisation process**: This includes alternate randomisation or other methodologies that allow for future knowledge or prediction of assignments.

- **Bias due to deviation from intended intervention**: As the main effect of interest is assignment to the intervention, deviations from the intended intervention will be considered if they are inconsistent with the trial protocol, arise because of the experimental context, or influence the outcome. Although non-protocol interventions received by participants are unlikely to affect the outcome of interest, we will reassess this for each included study. The role of blinding will be assessed for each study at the level of participants, carers, and those delivering the interventions.

- **Bias due to missing outcome data**: This involves methods used to account for missing data within studies. We will consider both the true value of the outcomes for participants with missing data and the likely underlying cause that led to the missing outcome data, and whether these are related, to assess the likelihood of bias in this domain.

- **Bias in measurement of outcome**: This includes an assessment of whether the method of measuring the outcome is appropriate, whether this method is consistent across intervention groups, who is measuring the outcome data, whether they are blind to the intervention assignment, and whether the outcome assessment could be influenced by the knowledge of the intervention received.

### Important challenges to finding new leads for new antibiotics [^114rFTLq]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Identification of new antibiotics remains a huge challenge. The last antibiotic of a new chemical class and mechanism was discovered more than 30 years ago. Advances since have been largely incremental modifications to a limited number of chemical scaffolds. Discovering and developing truly new antibiotics is challenging: the science is complex, and the development process is time-consuming and expensive. Herein, we focus on the discovery phase of modern antibacterial research and development.

We argue that antibacterial discovery has been challenged by a poor understanding of bacterial permeability, by generic in vitro conventions that ignore the host, and by the inherent complexity of bacterial systems. Together, these factors have colluded to challenge modern, industrial, and reductionist approaches to antibiotic discovery. Nevertheless, advances in our understanding of many of these obstacles, including a new appreciation for the complexity of both host and pathogen biology, bode well for future efforts.
