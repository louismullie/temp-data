## Question

recommended daily water intake

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended daily water intake. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between total water intake and drinking water only. Then, I should verify authoritative guideline targets for the general adult population. Next, I will examine randomized trial evidence for condition-specific benefits where water interventions change outcomes. After that, I need to consider individualization by age, sex, body size, activity, climate, and health status. I will then review practical biomarkers and monitoring tools. Finally, I should synthesize a pragmatic, safety-conscious recommendation and note special populations and caveats, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction so I don't conflate terms. Total water intake includes water from beverages plus water in foods and metabolic water, whereas drinking water refers to plain water from tap or bottles. For example, the Institute of Medicine's adequate intakes of 3.7 L/day for men and 2.7 L/day for women are total water figures, with roughly 20–30% typically coming from food, so the beverage-only portion is correspondingly smaller, and I should be careful not to imply that all of this must be drunk as plain water [^113G8YCg] [^112JuNVJ] [^117LwWUw].

> Next, I should review authoritative population guidelines to anchor baseline targets. The European Food Safety Authority proposes about 2.5 L/day total water for men and 2.0 L/day for women aged 14–70 years, with the expectation that roughly 80% comes from fluids, which aligns with physiologic modeling around a desirable urine osmolality of about 500 mOsm/kg. The Institute of Medicine sets higher totals at 3.7 L/day for men and 2.7 L/day for women, reflecting U.S. population medians and different assumptions, and both frameworks emphasize that needs vary with diet, activity, and environment rather than a single universal number [^113GmEzA] [^113G8YCg] [^114Qy8bv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single optimal intake. I need to check the clinical trial landscape for outcome-level evidence where water interventions changed health endpoints. Randomized trials show that premeal water intake of about 500 mL can augment weight loss in adults with overweight/obesity, with effects ranging roughly 44–100% greater weight loss versus control in some studies, plausibly via gastric distension and substitution for caloric beverages; however, an adolescent RCT failed to show BMI benefit despite behavioral support, underscoring adherence and context limitations [^11669Q9y] [^113Mgx82] [^117Vi6Uu]. For secondary prevention of kidney stones, increasing water to achieve at least 2.0–2.5 L/day urine volume reduces recurrences by about half and prolongs time to recurrence, with low-to-moderate certainty evidence; guidelines endorse generous fluid intake to maintain high urine volume for stone prevention [^116aCG8Q] [^114JdhEn] [^116pVWdB]. In premenopausal women with recurrent UTIs who drink less than 1.5 L/day, adding 1.5 L/day water reduced cystitis episodes by about 1.5 per year and antimicrobial use by about 1.7 courses, indicating a meaningful antimicrobial-sparing effect; a small headache RCT suggested improved quality of life with increased intake, and in adults with high copeptin and low intake, adding 1.5 L/day lowered copeptin and fasting glucose, suggesting potential metabolic benefits, though these are single studies and warrant replication [^113jrqYk] [^113RvN1d] [^1129fyY9].

> I should confirm how to individualize beyond population averages. Water turnover varies widely with age, sex, body size, physical activity, climate, and diet. Large doubly labeled water datasets show marked interindividual variability, and simple rules like "8 × 8" ounces are not evidence-based for everyone. Athletes in the heat, for example, may need several additional liters around training, whereas older adults often have reduced thirst sensitivity and may require deliberate prompting. Obesity modifies the relationship between intake and urine concentration, so larger individuals may need relatively more fluid to achieve the same hydration biomarkers. Pregnancy and lactation increase needs, and in ADPKD, expert guidance suggests tailoring intake to achieve generous urine volumes when kidney function allows, while in advanced CKD, advice shifts to individualized, often thirst-guided intake to avoid volume overload [^117UUpsz] [^116iMWBU] [^112FEcGF] [^113DkP4R] [^112doQWV] [^114DVgdo].

> Wait, let me verify the practical monitoring tools because clinicians often ask for bedside markers. Urine osmolality around 500 mOsm/kg reflects a physiologic target associated with adequate urine flow and lower vasopressin, but it is not easily measured routinely. Urine-specific gravity less than about 1.013 and urine color of 3 or less on a validated chart are reasonable surrogates for maintaining urine osmolality at or below 500 mOsm/kg, with USG offering high diagnostic accuracy and urine color providing a simple self-check, though both must be interpreted in context of recent diet, activity, and timing. First-morning samples are most informative, and body mass changes within 1% support euhydration in active settings [^115zVRTa] [^115ftku5] [^1156tiF3].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic approach while keeping safety in mind. For most healthy adults in temperate climates with moderate activity, aiming for about 2.0–2.5 L/day of total water is reasonable, recognizing that roughly 0.5–0.7 L often comes from food, implying about 1.3–2.0 L/day from beverages, with plain water as the preferred source. In practical terms, that is often framed as about 6–8 cups of fluids per day, but I should emphasize that this is a starting point and should be adjusted upward with heat, exercise, high solute intake, illness, or pregnancy, and downward if there are medical contraindications. For people with a history of calcium stones, targeting a urine volume above 2.5 L/day with generous, evenly spaced fluid intake is supported. For adults pursuing weight loss, premeal water can be a low-risk adjunct. For older adults, I need to ensure access, reminders, and monitoring because thirst is blunted. For everyone, replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with water reduces energy intake and improves cardiometabolic profiles, which is a high-yield, evidence-based message [^113GmEzA] [^116pVWdB] [^113Mgx82] [^113FZHCg] [^111AeaV8].

> But wait, what if I overstated a single number as "optimal"? I should double-check that no high-quality evidence fixes a universal daily water quota. Indeed, the most rigorous RCT synthesis concludes that evidence is limited and heterogeneous, supporting benefits in specific contexts but not establishing a single optimal intake; thus, recommendations should remain individualized and anchored to physiologic markers, clinical context, and patient preferences rather than a rigid rule [^1162PcW9] [^112F3Wuc].

> Finally, I need to ensure special populations and caveats are explicit. Children and adolescents generally have lower absolute needs but higher per-kilogram requirements and often underconsume plain water. Older adults are at higher dehydration risk and may need structured prompts. Patients with CKD stages 4–5 or clinical volume constraints should follow individualized, thirst-guided advice. Endurance athletes should avoid overdrinking and use thirst and weight-change monitoring to prevent hyponatremia. And although rare, overconsumption beyond renal excretory capacity can cause hyponatremia, so advice should always be sensible and tailored rather than encouraging indiscriminate high intake [^112jET6G] [^114DVgdo] [^113cJCL5].

The recommended daily water intake is **about 3.7 liters per day for men** and **about 2.7 liters per day for women**, including all fluids and water from foods [^113G8YCg]. Individual needs vary with age, sex, activity, climate, and health status; athletes, older adults, and those in hot environments may need more [^114fda4R] [^117UUpsz]. Water is the preferred beverage, and intake should be adjusted to thirst, urine color (aim for pale yellow), and clinical context [^114Q6sxa] [^115zVRTa].

## Recommended daily water intake

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) provides **general guidelines** for daily water intake, including fluids from beverages and foods:

| **Population group** | **Recommended daily water intake (liters/day)** |
|-|-|
| Adult men | 3.7 L/day (about 13 cups) |
| Adult women | 2.7 L/day (about 9 cups) |
| Pregnant women | 3.0 L/day (about 10 cups) |
| Lactating women | 3.8 L/day (about 13 cups) |

---

These values include **water from beverages and foods**, which typically account for about 20% of total water intake [^117LwWUw].

---

## Factors influencing water intake requirements

Several factors influence **individual water needs**:

- **Age and sex**: Older adults may have reduced thirst sensation and impaired kidney function, necessitating careful hydration monitoring [^1167HH6q].
- **Physical activity**: Increased physical activity elevates water requirements due to higher sweat losses [^114fda4R].
- **Climate and environment**: Hot, humid, or high-altitude environments increase water needs [^117UUpsz].
- **Health status**: Certain medical conditions (e.g. kidney disease, heart failure) and medications may alter water requirements [^112doQWV].

---

## Health benefits of adequate water intake

Adequate hydration provides **numerous health benefits**, including:

- **Kidney health**: Reduces risk of kidney stones and supports renal function [^116pVWdB] [^116aCG8Q].
- **Cognitive function**: Maintains cognitive performance and mood [^112x4Ssb].
- **Weight management**: May aid weight loss by reducing appetite and calorie intake [^113Mgx82] [^113FZHCg].
- **Cardiovascular health**: Supports blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular function [^116iMWBU].

---

## Risks of inadequate water intake

Inadequate hydration poses **significant health risks**:

- **Dehydration**: Impairs physical performance, cognitive function, and thermoregulation [^114fda4R] [^112jET6G].
- **Kidney stones**: Increases risk of nephrolithiasis [^116pVWdB] [^116aCG8Q].
- **Urinary tract infections**: Elevates risk of recurrent UTIs [^113jrqYk].
- **Chronic diseases**: Linked to higher risk of chronic kidney disease and other conditions [^111X42et] [^113Crjas].

---

## Risks of excessive water intake

Excessive water intake can cause **hyponatremia** — a potentially life-threatening sodium imbalance — particularly in endurance athletes or those with impaired renal function [^113cJCL5]. It is important to balance intake with individual needs and clinical context.

---

## Practical recommendations for daily water intake

Given individual variability, **practical recommendations** include:

- **Listen to thirst**: Thirst is a reliable indicator of hydration needs for most individuals [^notfound].
- **Monitor urine color**: Pale yellow urine indicates adequate hydration; dark yellow suggests insufficient intake [^115ftku5].
- **Adjust intake**: Increase intake with physical activity, hot weather, illness, or specific medical conditions [^114fda4R] [^117UUpsz].
- **Prefer water**: Water is the preferred beverage for hydration, though other fluids and foods contribute to total intake [^114Q6sxa].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require **specialized hydration guidance**:

- **Athletes**: Individualized hydration plans based on sweat rates and environmental conditions are recommended [^114fda4R] [^116iMWBU].
- **Older adults**: Careful monitoring is necessary due to reduced thirst sensation and impaired kidney function [^1167HH6q] [^111VcFY5].
- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: Sodium and water intake should be individualized based on disease stage and clinical context [^114DVgdo] [^113ZTEUZ].

---

The recommended daily water intake is **about 3.7 liters per day for men** and **about 2.7 liters per day for women**, including all fluids and water from foods. Individual needs vary with age, sex, activity, climate, and health status; athletes, older adults, and those in hot environments may need more. Water is the preferred beverage, and intake should be adjusted to thirst, urine color, and clinical context.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^117TTXLW]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Previous studies of urinary hydration biomarkers have shown that during acute progressive dehydration, USG, urine osmolality and urine color may be used interchangeably to track hydration status. In sedentary to moderately active adults, where sweat losses are not as pronounced, water balance is largely determined by the adequacy of fluid intake. Our results extend the utility of urinary hydration biomarkers beyond acute water loss and progressive dehydration into the context of drinking behaviors seen in real-life conditions. Within the context of free-living French adults, 24-h USG, osmolality, volume and color were all strongly related. This finding is not surprising, given that urine concentration and volume are inversely related, and that USG, osmolality and color all represent urine concentration. Perhaps more important, the values for these biomarkers span a sufficiently broad range to show linear relations to fluid intake. This suggests that urinary biomarkers of hydration may have the potential to be used to approximate fluid intake volume in situations where collecting fluid intake data is difficult. Moreover, fluid intake records alone account for only one side of the water balance equation, and cannot account for daily water loss. Urinary biomarkers of hydration status, in contrast, provide information about the adequacy of fluid intake relative to body water losses, and are thus more indicative of adequate hydration status than relying on fluid intake alone. In the current study, data was collected during temperate environmental conditions, and the physical activity of participants was restricted to sedentary activities, thus limiting water losses. Thus, we anticipated that urine biomarkers would closely reflect fluid intake volume to the extent possible in a study conducted in free-living conditions.

Currently, adequate intake guidelines for water are based largely on median intake reported in large population surveys. Although collection methods vary, intake studies commonly employ recall-based methods such as 24-h diet recall and food frequency questionnaires that have a tendency to underestimate intake. Moreover, these instruments were developed mainly to examine nutrient intakes from food; little is known about their validity to accurately assess fluid intake. Despite the shortcomings of dietary intake surveys, water intake guidelines rely heavily on these reported intake values, and rarely take into account the impact of a given level of fluid intake on hydration physiology or health. The ability to model the relationship between fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers would allow for the establishment of adequate intake recommendations based on physiological indicators of hydration; moreover, it would facilitate studies evaluating the link between adequate fluid intake and health.

### Ultraprocessed or minimally processed diets following healthy dietary guidelines on weight and cardiometabolic health: a randomized, crossover trial [^1123BJ59]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

Figure 1a outlines the study design and measurement timepoints. Age, sex, ethnicity, occupation, nightshift work pattern, educational level, marital status, medical history, medication intake, alcohol consumption, smoking habits and family history of obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were self-reported at screening.

The baseline period lasted 2 weeks to allow time to collect all data to check eligibility, including regarding habitual UPF intake with two additional nonconsecutive recalls after screening, followed by randomization and booking in the baseline visit, and then sufficient notice and time to set participants up with their first food delivery. For consistency, a 2-week assessment window was used for the baseline visit of the second diet.

Weight was measured using an electronic scale to the nearest 0.1 kg (Tanita DC-430MAS; Tanita). Body composition, including fat mass, body fat percentage, visceral fat rating, fat-free mass, muscle mass, bone mass, total body water mass and total body water percentage were assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (Tanita) at each visit. BIA at baseline and week 8 was conducted following an overnight fast with no alcohol intake or strenuous activity in the preceding 24 h. Assessments at week 4 were not fasted. Participants were provided with standardized wording in the week before their baseline and week 8 visits to maintain a consistent hydration status: "Please make sure that for the visit, you eat your usual diet for the 24 h before the visit day and to avoid alcohol and strenuous exercise. Please fast from 20:00 pm on the night before the study visit, and drink only water. Please do try to drink some water before the visit as this helps with the cannulation.ˮ Upon arrival, participants were asked to confirm that they had fasted and given the opportunity to drink water to thirst before measurements to ensure consistency. Basal metabolic rate was estimated by the Tanita BIA scanner based on fat-free mass and participant age. Height was assessed using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.5 cm. Waist circumference was measured in centimeters using an inelastic tape measure at the iliac crest. BMI was derived from weight and height (in kg m −2), and waist-to-height ratio from WC and height. Estimated daily energy imbalance was assessed using the energy densities of fat mass and fat-free mass of ~9,300 kcal kg −1 and 1,100 kcal kg −1, respectively. The mean daily energy imbalance (kcal day −1) for each participant for each diet was calculated as (9,300 × change in fat mass (kg) from baseline to week 8 + 1,100 × change in fat-free mass (kg) from baseline to week 8)/exact number of days from the start of the diet to the week 8 BIA assessment date. BP was recorded in triplicate, seated, alongside HR with an automated sphygmomanometer and oximeter. BP was recorded as the average of the second and third recordings. Venous blood samples were collected after an overnight fast and included glucose, HbA1c, liver function tests (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase and albumin), lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, total-cholesterol-to-HDL ratio, non-HDL-C and triglycerides) and CRP.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^11669Q9y]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Weight Loss

Four studies (22%), evaluated the effect of water on weight change in participants with overweight and obesity. In 3 parallel group RCTs, adults with overweight and obesity randomized to consume 1500 mL of water per day before meals for a period of 12 weeks to 12 months had greater weight loss compared with those in the control groups (approximately 100%, 87%, and 44% more weight vs control groups).

In a fourth studyincluding 38 participants who reported drinking less than 1000 mL/d, drinking 2000 mL/d was not associated with weight over a 6-month period (effect estimate, 0.0 [95% CI, −0.1 to 0.1]; p = 0.88). The study recruited only 63% of its target, and at 6 months, the intervention group reported drinking 1135 (95% CI, 900 to 1400) mL/d. Compared with the other 3 studies assessing weight change, this study was distinct because it included adolescents aged 17 years or younger, whereas the other studies included adults only, and the water intervention in this study was not premeal intake.

Fasting Blood Glucose

Two studies (11%), assessed the effect of a water intervention on fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. Sedaghat et alrandomized 40 patients with recently diagnosed (< 5 years) type 2 diabetes into a water intervention or control group that received no water recommendation. The water intervention consisted of drinking 250 mL before breakfast, 500 mL before lunch, and 250 mL before dinner for a total of 8 weeks. There was a significant between-group difference in mean change in FBG in the intervention (−32.6 mg/dL) vs the control group (5.3 mg/dL) (P = 0.003) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). On the other hand, Nakamura et altested a water intervention consisting of drinking 550 mL within 2 hours of waking and 550 mL before bedtime and found that FBG increased by approximately 0.6 mg/dL after 12 weeks in both groups. This RCT consisted of 60 adults with baseline FBG between 90 and 126 mg/dL and excluded participants receiving medication and/or lifestyle modification for diabetes. Baseline FBG of study participants was approximately 97 mg/dL, substantially lower than that in Sedaghat et al, which was approximately 225.7 mg/dL in the intervention group and 221.7 mg/dL in the control group.

### Chronicle of the institute of medicine physical activity recommendation: how a physical activity recommendation came to be among dietary recommendations [^1153Fgzs]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Under a contract from the US Department of Health and Human Services, a multidisciplinary expert panel was appointed to review "the scientific literature regarding macronutrients and energy and develop estimates of daily intake that are compatible with good nutrition throughout the life span and that may decrease the risk of chronic disease". Within the overall context of the charge, the panel sought to quantify rates and components of daily energy expenditure in healthy adults with body mass indexes (in kg/m(2)) of 18.5–25, in growing children (in the 5th-85th percentiles of weight-for-length), and in pregnant and lactating women. The recommendation for adults became the daily energy intake necessary to cover total daily energy expenditure (TEE). For special cases, dietary macronutrients and energy to support child growth and pregnancy and lactation by women were considered. TEE was based on the results of doubly labeled water studies, and the TEE results were presented in units of physical activity level (PAL = TEE/BEE) and DeltaPAL, where BEE is the basal rate of energy expenditure extrapolated to 24 h. Most adults (66%) maintaining a BMI in the healthful range had PAL values > 1.6, or the equivalent of ≥ 60 min of physical activity of moderate intensity each day. Hence, on the basis of the doubly labeled water data and the results of epidemiologic studies, the physical activity recommendation for adults was judged to be 60 min/d. The recommendation for children was for a minimum of 60 min/d. In conclusion, dietary and physical activity recommendations for healthful living are inextricably intertwined. Adequate physical activity provides protection against chronic diseases and helps to balance energy expenditure and intake.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^1167HH6q]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive decline is an important public health concern given 55 million people have been diagnosed with dementia and almost 80 million people are projected to be affected by 2030. Cognitive function is particularly important, especially as the population ages, because it determines the maintenance of our independence, the performance of everyday activities, and the quality of life. Cognitive decline and dementia have a diverse etiology, and effective treatment is still not available. For this reason, prevention strategies targeting modifiable factors, such as nutritional habits and dietary intake to slow the development of cognitive impairment, remain a promising public health approach. Evidence to date assessing individual dietary factors and dietary patterns in relation to cognitive health has been summarized in the Lancet Neurology, while there is information related to various macro- and micronutrients and patterns, evidence related to water appears limited.

Water intake is a nutritional habit that is often overlooked, yet it is considered essential for the optimal physiological function of the human body. As the most abundant component of the human body, water intake and optimal hydration are considered key aspects for the proper functioning of organ systems, aiding, among others, in efficient digestion, elimination of toxins, energy production, thermoregulation, and joint lubrication, as well as a multitude of biochemical reactions. Furthermore, proper hydration is thought to be important for optimal cognitive functioning as it plays a vital role in neural conductivity.

Dehydration occurs when the body loses more water than is taken in, whereas hypohydration refers to the state of water deficit; these conditions result in less-than-optimal hydration and may elicit adverse physiological consequences. For the purposes of this paper, dehydration will be the term used to encompass the state of improper hydration due to unbalanced water loss or water deficit. In Europe, the percentage of the population reported to have inadequate water intake is estimated to vary from 5 to 35%. Understanding water intake and hydration status is of particular importance in older adults as this population tends to be less likely to meet recommendations on water intake and is at greater risk for dehydration due to blunted sensitivity to thirst signals, lower body reserves due to reduced muscle mass, reduced ability to deal with heat stress, and use of medications or laxatives with diuretic effects. Multiple health organizations and dietary guidelines have acknowledged that adequate hydration status is associated with the preservation of physical and mental functions and that water intake is the best way to achieve hydration.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to water intake, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to screen patients with ADPKD to estimate habitual daily fluid intake during initial evaluation to enhance counseling and education.

### Water for preventing urinary stones [^116aCG8Q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary stone disease is a common condition characterised by increasing prevalence and high rates of recurrence. Observational studies have reported that increased water intake played a role in the prevention of urinary stone formation but with limited strength of evidence.

Objectives

To compare the effects of increased water intake with standard water intake for the prevention of urinary stone formation in participants with or without a history of urinary stones.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE (Ovid) and the Cochrane Library to 15 October 2019. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions to publication language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at the benefits and harms of increased water intake versus standard water intake for the prevention of urinary stone formation in participants with or without a history of urinary stones.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence/recurrence rate of urinary stones; adverse events) using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We calculated hazard ratio (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs to assess the intervention effect for time-to-event outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the evidence by using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Our search identified no RCTs investigating the role of increased water intake for the prevention of urinary stone formation in participants with no history of urinary stones (primary prevention). We found one RCT assessing the effects of increased water intake versus standard water intake for the prevention of urinary stone formation in people with a history of urinary stones (secondary prevention). This trial randomised 220 participants (110 participants in the intervention group with increased water intake and 110 in the control group with standard water intake). Increased water intake was defined as achieving a urine volume of at least 2.0 L per day by drinking water. Based on this study, increased water intake may decrease stone recurrences (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.84; 199 participants; low-certainty evidence); this corresponds to 149 fewer (43 fewer to 205 fewer) stone recurrences per 1000 participants with 270 stone recurrence per 1000 participants over five years in the control group. Increased water intake may also prolong the time to urinary stone recurrence compared to standard water intake (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.79; 199 participants; low-certainty evidence); based on a stone recurrence rate of 270 per 1000 participants over five years, this corresponds to 152 fewer (209 fewer to 50 fewer) recurrences per 1000 participants. For both outcomes we downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. We found no evidence for the outcome of adverse events AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no RCT evidence on the role of increased water intake for primary prevention of urinary stones. For secondary prevention, increased water intake achieving a urine volume of at least 2.0 L/day may reduce urinary stone recurrence and prolong time to recurrence for people with a history of urinary stone disease. However, our confidence in these findings is limited. We did not find evidence for adverse events.

### A study of fluid intake from beverages in a sample of healthy French children, adolescents and adults [^116X5FGA]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Classic 'recommendations', such as 'at least 8 × 8 ounce glasses of water per day', have been questioned in an elaborate review by Valtin (2002). However, although there seems to be little scientific support for such recommendations, there is no evidence to show that drinking such a level of fluid might be bad for health. Recently, experts have suggested that such a level of intake may actually be insufficient to appropriately cover bodily needs, even in a sedentary middle-aged individual living in a temperate environment. As much as 3 l of fluid daily have been recommended recently by American experts (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2004). This report did not specify the exact requirements for water intake, but set general recommendations for women at ∼2.7 l of total water — from all beverages and foods — each day, and for men an average of ∼3.7 l of total water. The panel did not set an upper level for water.

This report is the first specific description of beverage intake among the French, based on a quota sample of the population. Differences have appeared between the four age groups in the selection of various types of beverages, as well as consistencies (the major part of daily fluid intake is water). The proportion of daily energy obtained from drinks (all types combined) is ∼10%. Wide variations are observed around mean values, suggesting that fluid intake could be insufficient in some people, or that energy intake from fluids might contribute significantly to adequate or inadequate total energy intake. Longitudinal studies should be carried out in different populations (different countries, different age groups, different socioeconomic levels, etc.) to determine whether the chronic contribution of beverages does impact health or body weight control, as suggested in studies examining the longitudinal changes in body weight associated with the intake of energy-containing drinks (Ludwig et al. 2001; Schulze et al. 2004; Stookey et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009).

### Water intake in drinks and food: how should we advise patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction on their water intake and / or urine output, as a cornerstone of lifestyle interventions? ICI-RS 2024 [^116re4Q5]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Water intake in drinks and food is essential for life. Multiple guidelines exist to help give recommendations for healthy water intake and urine output, but few of these are specific to patients with lower urinary tract symptoms.

Methods

A debate held at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society meeting, held in Bristol in June 2024, considered ways to improve this situation.

Results and Conclusion

There are challenges in measuring both total water intake and also urine output, but we suggest that urine output may be the most helpful measure to focus on for future guidelines for patients.

### Daily water intake among US men and women, 2009–2012… [^113G8YCg]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Key findings Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009–2012.
- Among U. S. adults, men consumed an average of 3. 46 liters of water per day, and women consumed
2. 75 liters per day.
- Men aged 60 and over consumed less water than men aged 20–39 and 40–59. Similarly, women aged 60 and over consumed less water than women aged 20–39 and 40–59. Water is an essential nutrient for life. Institute of Medicine recommendations from 2004 set adequate levels for total water intake from all foods and liquids at 3. 7 liters for men and
2. 7 liters for women. Consuming inadequate amounts of water increases the risk of dehydration, kidney stones, and poorer cognitive performance. On average, men aged 20–39 and 40–59 consumed water at about the recommended adequate intake level of 3.

7 L, while those aged 60 and over consumed
0. 78 L less water than the recommended adequate intake. Women aged 20–39 consumed water at about the adequate intake level of 2. 7 L, while women aged 40–59 consumed
0. 2 L more than the adequate intake, and women aged 60 and over consumed 0. 19 L less than the recommended adequate intake. Summary Overall in 2009–2012, the daily average total water intake from all foods and liquids among U. S. adults aged 20 and over was 3. 46 L for men, with 30% coming from plain water, and
2. 75 L for women, with 34% coming from plain water. Men's average total water intake per day was approximately 0. 25 L less than the recommended adequate intake, whereas women's intake was approximately the same as the adequate intake. On average, men and women aged 60 and over, non-Hispanic black men and women, Hispanic men and women, men and women with low physical activity, and men with moderate physical activity consumed less than the adequate daily intake.

### Consensus recommendations on training and competing in the heat [^1156tiF3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pre-exercise hydration

Resting and well-fed humans are generally well hydrated, and the typical variance in day-to-day total body water fluctuates from 0.2% to 0.7% of body mass. When exposed to heat stress in the days preceding competition, it may, however, be advisable to remind athletes to drink sufficiently and replace electrolyte losses to ensure that euhydration is maintained. Generally, drinking 6 mL of water per kg of body mass during this period every 2–3 h, as well as 2–3 h before training or competition in the heat, is advisable.

There are several methods available to evaluate hydration status, each one having limitations depending on how and when the fluids are lost. The most widely accepted and recommended methods include monitoring body mass changes, measuring plasma osmolality and urine specific gravity. Based on these methods, one is considered euhydrated if daily body mass changes remain < 1%, plasma osmolality is < 290 mmol/kg and urine specific gravity is < 1.020. These techniques can be implemented during intermittent competitions lasting for several days (eg, cycling stage race, tennis/team sports tournament) to monitor hydration status. Establishing baseline body mass is important, as daily variations may occur. It is best achieved by measuring post-void nude body mass in the morning on consecutive days after consuming 1–2 L of fluid the prior evening. Moreover, since exercise, diet and prior drinking influence urine concentration measurements, first morning urine is the preferred assessment time point to evaluate hydration status. If first morning urine cannot be obtained, urine collection should be preceded by several hours of minimal physical activity, fluid consumption and eating.

### The void in using urine concentration to assess population fluid intake adequacy or hydration status [^111HAUG4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Urine concentration can be used to assess fluid intake adequacy or to diagnose dehydration. However, too often urine concentration is used inappropriately to draw dubious conclusions that could have harmful health and economic consequences. Inappropriate uses of urine concentration relate primarily to convenience sampling (timing) and problems related to convenience sampling (misapplication of thresholds), but a conceptual problem also exists with using urine concentration in isolation. The purpose of this Perspective article is to briefly explain the problematic nature of current practices and to offer a possible solution to improve practice with minimal added complication. When urine is used exclusively to assess fluid intake adequacy and hydration status in adults, we propose that only when urine concentration is high (> 850 mmol/kg) and urine excretion rate is low (< 850 mL/24 h) should suspicion of inadequate drinking or impending dehydration be considered. Prospective tests of the 850 × 850 thresholds will provide supporting evidence and/or help refine the best thresholds for men and women, young and old.

### The role of obesity in the relation between total water intake and urine osmolality in US adults, 2009–2012 [^112FEcGF]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Adequate water intake is critical to physiologic and cognitive functioning. Although water requirements increase with body size, it remains unclear whether weight status modifies the relation between water intake and hydration status.

Objective

We examined how the association between water intake and urine osmolality, which is a hydration biomarker, varied by weight status.

Design

NHANES cross-sectional data (2009–2012) were analyzed in 9601 nonpregnant adults aged ≥ 20 y who did not have kidney failure. Weight status was categorized with the use of body mass index on the basis of measured height and weight (underweight or normal weight, overweight, and obesity). Urine osmolality was determined with the use of freezing-point depression osmometry. Hypohydration was classified according to the following age-dependent formula: ≥ 831 mOsm/kg - [3.4 × (age - 20 y)]. Total water intake was determined with the use of a 24-h dietary recall and was dichotomized as adequate or low on the basis of the Institute of Medicine's adequate intake recommendations for men and women (men: ≥ 3.7 or < 3.7 L; nonlactating women: ≥ 2.7 or < 2.7 L; lactating women: ≥ 3.8 or < 3.8 L for adequate or low intakes, respectively). We tested interactions and conducted linear and log-binomial regressions.

Results

Total water intake (P = 0.002), urine osmolality (P < 0.001), and hypohydration prevalence (P < 0.001) all increased with higher weight status. Interactions between weight status and water intake status were significant in linear (P = 0.005) and log-binomial (P = 0.015) models, which were then stratified. The prevalence ratio of hypohydration between subjects with adequate water intake and those with low water intake was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.73) in adults who were underweight or normal weight, 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.79) in adults who were overweight, and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.88) in adults who were obese.

Conclusion

On a population level, obesity modifies the association between water intake and hydration status.

### Recommended dietary pattern to achieve adherence to the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology (AHA / ACC) guidelines: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111AeaV8]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Added sugars and SSBs — limits and health associations state that sweets and added sugars should be limited, with a recommendation for added sugars of no more than 100 kcal/d for women or 150 kcal/d for men and < 100 kcal for children. The 2015 DGA recommends limiting added sugars intake to a maximum of 10% of total calories, and one teaspoon of sugar contributes 16 calories. In USDA food patterns for 1600–2400 cal, added sugars range from 4% to 6% of calories (or 4.5–9.4 teaspoons), and a 20-oz bottle of cola contributes 14 teaspoons of sugar. The AHA recommends limiting added sugars to no more than 100 cal or 6 teaspoons per day for most women and 150 cal or 9 teaspoons a day for most men; healthy beverage options such as water and fat-free or low-fat milk should be encouraged in place of SSBs, and there is a robust body of evidence that SSB consumption has been associated with increased risk of CVD mortality, hypertension, liver lipogenesis, T2DM, obesity, and kidney disease.

### Association between water consumption and body weight outcomes: a systematic review [^112CrkEY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Drinking water is often applied as a dietary means for weight loss and overweight/obesity prevention, but no evidence-based recommendation exists for this indication.

Objective

We summarized the existing evidence on the association between water consumption and body weight outcomes in adults of any body weight status.

Design

In a systematic review, we retrieved studies from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE), cross-references by PubMed functions and hand-searching, and experts' recommendations. Any type of study including adults aged > 18 y that reported the association between daily water consumption and any weight-related outcome, such as body weight, body mass index, or body weight classifications, was eligible.

Results

Of 4963 retrieved records, 11 original studies and 2 systematic reviews were included. In participants dieting for weight loss or maintenance, a randomized controlled trial, a nonrandomized controlled trial, and an observational longitudinal study showed that increased water consumption, in addition to a program for weight loss or maintenance, reduced body weight after 3–12 mo compared with such a program alone. In mixed-weight populations not primarily dieting for weight loss or maintenance, 2 short-term randomized trials showed no effect of water consumption on body weight; 6 cross-sectional studies showed inconsistent results.

Conclusions

Studies of individuals dieting for weight loss or maintenance suggest a weight-reducing effect of increased water consumption, whereas studies in general mixed-weight populations yielded inconsistent results. The evidence for this association is still low, mostly because of the lack of good-quality studies. This trial was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/Prospero as CRD42012002585.

### A new proposed guidance system for beverage consumption in the United States [^114Q6sxa]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The Beverage Guidance Panel was assembled to provide guidance on the relative health and nutritional benefits and risks of various beverage categories. The beverage panel was initiated by the first author. The Panel's purpose is to attempt to systematically review the literature on beverages and health and provide guidance to the consumer. An additional purpose of the Panel is to develop a deeper dialog among the scientific community on overall beverage consumption patterns in the United States and on the great potential to change this pattern as a way to improve health. Over the past several decades, levels of overweight and obesity have increased across all population groups in the United States. Concurrently, an increased daily intake of 150–300 kcal (for different age-sex groups) has occurred, with approximately 50% of the increased calories coming from the consumption of calorically sweetened beverages. The panel ranked beverages from the lowest to the highest value based on caloric and nutrient contents and related health benefits and risks. Drinking water was ranked as the preferred beverage to fulfill daily water needs and was followed in decreasing value by tea and coffee, low-fat (1.5% or 1%) and skim (nonfat) milk and soy beverages, noncalorically sweetened beverages, beverages with some nutritional benefits (fruit and vegetable juices, whole milk, alcohol, and sports drinks), and calorically sweetened, nutrient-poor beverages. The Panel recommends that the consumption of beverages with no or few calories should take precedence over the consumption of beverages with more calories.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^117UUpsz]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Fluid requirements

The UK NHS's Eatwell Guide recommends a daily intake of six to eight glasses of fluid per day and the European Food Safety Authority recommends 2.5 l of water for males over 14 years and 2 l for females. However, these recommendations have recently been called into doubt following a large international study. This cross-sectional study analysed water turnover (fluid balance, ml/day) data from over 5,604 subjects, from birth to 96 years old, from 23 different countries, available from the International Atomic Energy Agency International Doubly Labelled Water database. Each participant consumed a weight-adjusted dose of deuterated water. The level of deuterated water was measured before and after the isotope drink using either saliva, urine or serum, allowing an estimation of the amount of deuterated water left in the body and therefore the total body water volume. The study team found that water turnover reduced with advancing age and was lowest in females aged > 65 years. Total body water also declined with advancing age, presumed secondary to reduced muscle mass. The authors then used extensive data on geography, climate, activity levels and water turnover to produce an equation to estimate an individual's daily water requirements:

[1,076 × PAL] + [14.34 × body weight (kg)] + [374.9 × sex] + [5.823 × humidity (%)] + [1,070 × athlete status] + [104.6 × HDI] + [0.4726 × altitude (m)] — [0.3529 × age (years) 2] + [24.78 × age (years)] + [1.865 × ambient temperature (°C) 2] — [19.66 × temperature (°C)] — 713.1.

PAL, physical activity level = total energy expenditure/basal energy expenditure, roughly estimated as light work = 1.7, moderate work female (F) 2.2, male (M) 2.7, moderately heavy work F 2.3, M 3.0, heavy work F 2.8, M 3.8; athlete = 1, non-athlete = 0; male = 1, female = 0; HDI, human development index, high (e.g. UK) = 0, middle = 1, low = 2;

### Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among adults – 18 states, 2012 [^114MSbbJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Reducing consumption of calories from added sugars is a recommendation of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and an objective of Healthy People 2020. Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) are major sources of added sugars in the diets of U.S. residents. Daily SSB consumption is associated with obesity and other chronic health conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. U.S. adults consumed an estimated average of 151 kcal/day of SSB during 2009–2010, with regular (i.e., nondiet) soda and fruit drinks representing the leading sources of SSB energy intake. However, there is limited information on state-specific prevalence of SSB consumption. To assess regular soda and fruit drink consumption among adults in 18 states, CDC analyzed data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Among the 18 states surveyed, 26.3% of adults consumed regular soda or fruit drinks or both ≥ 1 times daily. By state, the prevalence ranged from 20.4% to 41.4%. Overall, consumption of regular soda or fruit drinks was most common among persons aged 18‒34 years (24.5% for regular soda and 16.6% for fruit drinks), men (21.0% and 12.3%), non-Hispanic blacks (20.9% and 21.9%), and Hispanics (22.6% and 18.5%). Persons who want to reduce added sugars in their diets can decrease their consumption of foods high in added sugars such as candy, certain dairy and grain desserts, sweetened cereals, regular soda, fruit drinks, sweetened tea and coffee drinks, and other SSBs. States and health departments can collaborate with worksites and other community venues to increase access to water and other healthful beverages.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^113ZTEUZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy — recommended sodium intake (CPG 5.2) states the normal U.S. daily sodium chloride intake is "5.8 to 17.4 g (2.3 to 6.9 g [100 to 300 mmol] of sodium)", and that a tolerable upper intake level for healthy adults is "no more than 5.8 g (2.3 g [100 mmol] of sodium)", while European societies "recommend 3.8 g (1.5 to 2.3 g [80 to 100 mmol] of sodium) for patients with arterial hypertension". For dialysis patients, "the daily sodium chloride intake suggested… [is] no more than 5 g", and in a "70 kg anuric compliant patient" a "5-g sodium chloride diet… should bring about a 1.5-kg average interdialysis weight gain on a conventional thrice-weekly regimen". For hypertensive dialysis patients, "a more stringent daily sodium chloride limitation amounting to 2.5 to 3.8 g (1 to 1.5 g [43 to 65 mmol] of sodium) has been recommended". Implementation guidance specifies that "canned, processed, and salty-tasting food should be avoided", and if restriction is not tolerated, "more prolonged and/or more frequent dialysis treatments (including periodic isolated ultrafiltration) may be required". Adaptation notes that "after exposure to salt restriction for 8 to 12 weeks" low-sodium foods become preferred without reducing essential nutrients, sodium restriction "can be modified and tailored" in those losing sodium through "either RKF or extrarenal routes", and abrupt, strenuous restriction may risk that patients "become malnourished".

### Criterion values for urine-specific gravity and urine color representing adequate water intake in healthy adults [^115ftku5]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Growing evidence suggests a distinction between water intake necessary for maintaining a euhydrated state, and water intake considered to be adequate from a perspective of long-term health. Previously, we have proposed that maintaining a 24-h urine osmolality (U Osm) of ≤ 500mOsm/kg is a desirable target for urine concentration to ensure sufficient urinary output to reduce renal health risk and circulating vasopressin. In clinical practice and field monitoring, the measurement of U Osm is not practical. In this analysis, we calculate criterion values for urine-specific gravity (U SG) and urine color (U Col), two measures which have broad applicability in clinical and field settings. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis performed on 817 urine samples demonstrates that a U SG ⩾1.013 detects U Osm > 500mOsm/kg with very high accuracy (AUC 0.984), whereas a subject-assessed U Col ⩾4 offers high sensitivity and moderate specificity (AUC 0.831) for detecting U Osm > 500mOsm/kg.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^114NLBFZ]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the general acknowledgment that an appropriate level of fluid intake and hydration status is important for health, there have been limited investigations to date assessing the relationship between fluid intake or hydration status and cognitive function. Existing evidence suggests that good hydration status may be associated with better cognitive test results and that mild, induced dehydration can impair cognitive abilities, but findings are not consistent and there are only a few studies exploring the relationship of hydration status and hardly any assessing amount of water intake, with cognitive performance in older community-dwelling adults.

Of the few relevant and recent studies that have been conducted, one cross-sectional analysis of 2506 community-dwelling older American adults (aged ≥ 60 years) from the Nutrition and Health Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2014 cycles assessed both hydration status and water intake in relation to cognitive performance. In comparison with the present findings, this study found women (but not men) considered to be hydrated, based on a SOSM level between 285 and 289 mmol/L, had better attention and processing speeds, based on a Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST), than women not at optimal hydration. These cross-sectional findings differ from the present observations where global cognitive function, but not individual tests related to attention and processing, was associated with hydration status. Whereas, correspondingly, water intake (but not hydration status) was positively associated with DST-f, which is similar to the DSST in that it is an indicator of attention as well as short-term memory capacity, and this was seen across all older adults (both men and women). Additionally, in the NHANES study, cognitive test scores were significantly lower among adults who failed to meet EFSA recommendations on adequate intake (AI) of water in bivariate analyses, yet this significance was attenuated in the multivariable analyses among both women and men. Yet, using the alternative AI of daily water intake of 1500 mL or more, which is comparable to the highest drinking water intake group in the present study, women scored higher on the Animal Fluency Test, a measure of verbal fluency and hence executive function, and DSST than women with intake levels below this amount, and findings among men trended in the same direction.

### Factors associated with water consumption measured using the stable isotope techniques among Japanese adults: a cross-sectional study [^115rjbFj]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

While some dietary guidelines have established daily water requirements for adults, those for older adults are not well defined. Factors associated with water turnover (WT), indicating water requirements and preformed water (PW), referring to fluids consumed from food and beverages, remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to investigate these factors in Japanese adults.

Subjects/Methods

This cross-sectional study included 57 participants aged 54–85 years, living in Fukuoka City, Japan. The WT and PW were measured using the doubly labelled water (DLW) methods from August 2015 to September 2015. Dietary intake and physical activity were evaluated using a 3-day dietary record (DR) and a validated triaxial accelerometer, respectively. Fasting blood and urine samples, as well as environmental conditions, were assessed using a validated technique. We evaluated the variables for predicting water consumption by using a multivariate generalised linear model, with forward stepwise selection using these covariates.

Results

The median WT and PW were 2842ml/day and 2227ml/day, respectively. In the multivariate model, WT (R 2 = 0.629) and PW (R 2 = 0.621) were moderately predicted by variables such as sex, body weight, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, water consumption estimated by DR, urinary aldosterone and osmolality, creatinine clearance and wet-bulb globe temperature. The PW estimates from DR were ~40% lower than those from DLW method, despite a significant correlation between the values.

Conclusions

WT and PW are associated not only with lifestyle and environmental factors but also with urinary markers and kidney function. These findings provide useful insights into the differences in each individual's water requirement.

### Water supplementation reduces copeptin and plasma glucose in adults with high copeptin: the H ₂ O metabolism pilot study [^1129fyY9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Because elevated copeptin, a marker of vasopressin, is linked to low water intake and high diabetes risk, we tested the effect of water supplementation on copeptin and fasting glucose.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Thirty-one healthy adults with high copeptin (> 10.7 pmol · L-1 in men and > 6.1 pmol·L-1 in women) identified in a population-based survey from 2013 to 2015 and with a current 24-hour urine osmolality of > 600 mOsm · kg-1 were included.

Intervention

Addition of 1.5 L water daily on top of habitual fluid intake for 6 weeks.

Main Outcome Measure

Pre- and postintervention fasting plasma copeptin concentrations.

Results

Reported mean water intake increased from 0.43 to 1.35 L · d-1 (P < 0.001), with no other observed changes in diet. Median (interquartile range) urine osmolality was reduced from 879 (705, 996) to 384 (319, 502) mOsm · kg-1 (P < 0.001); urine volume increased from 1.06 (0.90, 1.20) to 2.27 (1.52, 2.67) L · d-1 (P < 0.001); and baseline copeptin decreased from 12.9 (7.4, 21.9) pmol · L-1 to 7.8 (4.6;11.3) pmol · L-1 (P < 0.001). Water supplementation reduced fasting plasma glucose from a mean (SD) of 5.94 (0.44) to 5.74 (0.51) (P = 0.04). The water-associated reduction of both fasting copeptin and glucose concentration in plasma was most pronounced in participants in the top tertile of baseline copeptin.

Conclusions

Water supplementation in persons with habitually low water consumption and high copeptin levels is effective in lowering copeptin. It appears a safe and promising intervention with the potential of lowering fasting plasma glucose and thus reducing diabetes risk. Further investigations are warranted to support these findings.

### Facilitating positive health behaviors and well-being to improve health outcomes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115BjpK8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes — 2025 — nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) and water indicates that the FDA has approved many NNS for consumption by the general public, including people with diabetes; for some people with diabetes who regularly consume sugar-sweetened foods or beverages, NNS may be an acceptable substitute for nutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation; NNS do not appear to have a significant effect on glycemic management and can reduce overall calorie and carbohydrate intake as long as individuals are not compensating with additional calories from other sources; a recent meta-analysis and systematic review of RCTs found no evidence that NNS raise liver enzymes; evidence for weight management is mixed, though a review of low- and no-calorie sweetener beverages used as substitutes for sugar-sweetened beverages reported a small improvement in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors without evidence of harm and with a direction of benefit similar to that seen with water; health care professionals should promote water as the healthiest beverage option, should encourage reductions in foods and beverages with added sugars, assuring people with diabetes that NNS have undergone extensive safety evaluation and are continually monitored can allay unnecessary concern for harm, and health care professionals can regularly assess individual NNS use based on acceptable daily intake and recommend moderation.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^1162PcW9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Several public recommendations exist regarding the amount of daily water intake, yet the supporting evidence is not clear, and benefits of increasing water consumption are not well-established.

Objective

To summarize evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) pertaining to the health-related outcomes associated with increased or decreased daily water consumption.

Evidence Review

A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase was performed up to April 6, 2023. Studies were included if they aimed to assess the impact of daily water consumption by any defined amount on any health-related outcome.

Findings

Of 1464 records screened, 18 (1%) eligible studies were included in the review. Among eligible studies, 15 (83%) were parallel group RCTs, and 3 (16%) were crossover studies. Interventions in these studies consisted of a recommendation to alter the daily amount of water intake by a specific amount for a predefined period ranging between 4 days and 5 years, while the control groups were mostly asked to maintain their usual intake habits. The studies assessed various populations. Recurring primary end points included weight loss, fasting blood glucose level, headache, urinary tract infection, and nephrolithiasis. Consuming additional water was associated with greater weight loss (range, 44%-100% more than control conditions) and fewer nephrolithiasis events (15 fewer events per 100 participants over 5 years). Single studies suggested benefits related to migraine prevention, urinary tract infection, diabetes control, and hypotension. Ten studies (55%) reported at least 1 positive result, and 8 studies (44%) reported negative results.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review found that there is a limited number of clinical trials in the literature assessing the benefits of increasing water intake related to a large variety of health outcomes. While the quality and quantity of evidence is limited, a small number of studies suggested benefits of water intake on weight loss and nephrolithiasis, while single studies raised the possibility of benefits for patients with migraine, urinary tract infection, diabetes, and hypotension. Given the low cost and low adverse-effect profile of water, further well-designed studies should assess benefits in these specific conditions.

### Criterion values for urine-specific gravity and urine color representing adequate water intake in healthy adults [^114HrrTh]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Insufficient water intake or low urinary output has been associated with health outcomes, including recurrent kidney stones, increased risk of renal insufficiency and impaired glucose regulation. A U Osm of less than 500 mOsm/kg has been proposed as a reasonable target for 'optimal hydration', but U Osm is not a practical field measure and to date, no corresponding values for U SG nor U Col have been published. In this analysis, we demonstrate that both U Col and U SG may be used as surrogates for U Osm to identify individuals above or below the 500 mOsm/kg target. U SG is both sensitive and specific, suggesting its utility for health care professionals and clinicians within their daily practice. Subject-assessed U Col demonstrated good sensitivity and moderate specificity. To our knowledge, this is the first subject-self-assessment of U Col by healthy adults, confirming U Col as a practical field measure with utility in day-to-day individual hydration monitoring.

### A study of fluid intake from beverages in a sample of healthy French children, adolescents and adults [^113BikT2]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

To assess the intake of fluid in healthy French children, adolescents, adults and seniors, considering amounts, types of beverages, time and place of consumption.

Subjects/Methods

Data regarding fluid intake were extracted and analyzed from the National Intake Survey, which was conducted in quota samples of the French population (Comportement et Consommations Alimentaires en France study). Seven-day questionnaires were administered to free-living individuals in 2002–2003. A total of 566 children (aged 6–11 years), 333 adolescents (aged 12–19 years), 831 adults (aged 20–54 years) and 443 seniors (aged ≥ 55 years) were included in this study.

Results

The average total intake of fluid was 1–1.3 l per day depending on age groups. Water accounted for about one-half of daily fluid intake. The contribution of other types of beverages varied with age (for example, dairy drinks in children and adolescents; alcoholic drinks in adults and seniors). Intake of sodas (including regular and light) was highest in adolescents (169 mL a day). Beverages were mainly consumed at home during meals.

Conclusions

This is the first description of fluid intake in French children, adolescents, adults and seniors, considering amounts, types of beverages, time and place of intake. It shows that water is the main source of fluid in all age groups. Selection of various types of beverages is different according to age.

### Fluid therapy in mechanically ventilated critically ill children: the sodium, chloride and water burden of fluid creep [^116Z4n2F]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Isotonic saline, i.e. NaCl 0.9%, which is constituted of 154 mEq of sodium and 154 mEq of chloride per Liter, is the classical fluid creep. Besides the well-known side-effects of NaCl 0.9%, including hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia, NaCl 0.9% contributes significantly to the total daily intake of sodium and chloride. It is important to underline the fact that recommended sodium intakes for both adults and children range between 1 and 2 mEq/kg/day. Furthermore, it is well known that during an abrupt increase in sodium intake, in healthy subjects, only a fraction of the excessive sodium is excreted on the first day, leading to a positive sodium balance, thus increasing the body's sodium stores and favoring a consensual water retention and weight gain. It is conceivable that these mechanisms are even more pronounced in critically ill patients who frequently have altered homeostatic mechanisms. This, of course, might foster the formation of edema and favor the worsening of the clinical condition.

The aim of the present retrospective study is to describe the current clinical practice regarding fluid therapy in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary Italian referral hospital, quantify the load of water, sodium and chloride due to different fluid indications and assess the association between sodium intake and water balance.

### American College of Sports Medicine position stand. exercise and fluid replacement [^114fda4R]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2007). Low credibility.

This Position Stand provides guidance on fluid replacement to sustain appropriate hydration of individuals performing physical activity. The goal of prehydrating is to start the activity euhydrated and with normal plasma electrolyte levels. Prehydrating with beverages, in addition to normal meals and fluid intake, should be initiated when needed at least several hours before the activity to enable fluid absorption and allow urine output to return to normal levels. The goal of drinking during exercise is to prevent excessive (> 2% body weight loss from water deficit) dehydration and excessive changes in electrolyte balance to avert compromised performance. Because there is considerable variability in sweating rates and sweat electrolyte content between individuals, customized fluid replacement programs are recommended. Individual sweat rates can be estimated by measuring body weight before and after exercise. During exercise, consuming beverages containing electrolytes and carbohydrates can provide benefits over water alone under certain circumstances. After exercise, the goal is to replace any fluid electrolyte deficit. The speed with which rehydration is needed and the magnitude of fluid electrolyte deficits will determine if an aggressive replacement program is merited.

### A study of fluid intake from beverages in a sample of healthy French children, adolescents and adults [^111VcFY5]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

The French national recommendations for daily fluid intake encourage a level of intake adequate for body weight, age, physical activity and other factors (Martin, 2001). For adults, it is stated that fluid intake should be sufficient to cover daily needs that vary according to each individual's characteristics and lifestyle. Seniors should be particularly careful that their fluid intake is sufficient, as dehydration can have dramatic consequences. In addition to fluid intake from drinks, about one more liter of water should be obtained from the fluid contained in ingested foods, so that under the usual conditions, the total daily intake of fluid should be ∼2.6 l (Martin, 2001).

In spite of the general consensus that an appropriate level of fluid intake is of paramount importance for health and even survival, the actual intake of fluid or total water is not often reported as such in studies of food or nutrient intakes. A study of water intake in the participants of the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 1999–2002 indicated a mean total water intake (from foods and beverages) of ∼1.4 l a day in children and adolescents (4–18 years) and of 2 l in adults (Fulgoni, 2007). Plain drinking water contributed to more than half of this total intake (0.78 l in 4–18 year olds; 1.28 l in adults). By contrast, in a recent study of beverage intake in American preschool children, beverage intake was examined but water intake was excluded, because water is not part of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database categories (O'Connor et al. 2006). Clearly, more information is required regarding the total fluid intake of populations, whether or not it is associated with the intake of nutrients.

This study presents the self-reported intake of beverages, recorded in a quota sample recruited to be representative of the general population in France. Intake in different age groups was assessed: children, adolescents, adults and seniors.

### Water: neglected, unappreciated and under researched [^111PsffJ]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Water, an essential nutrient, is often ignored in reports of dietary surveys and nutrition. Although it is ubiquitous in foods and beverages, the attention is often focused on the minerals or calorific values of the fluids imbibed rather than the water per se. Water is often taken for granted by many in Western countries due to its abundant availability through water systems. In developing countries, however, water and sanitation raise significant problems. This review overviews (i) the global perspective of the potable water supply, (ii) human rights and water, (iii) dietary guidelines and sources of water and (iv) the physiology of water balance. Gaps in knowledge and understanding around hydration and water requirements are also discussed. Nutritionists are urged to look at the bigger picture of the global water supply and to use good judgement and common sense when advising on water requirements.

### Comparison of the mineral content of tap water and bottled waters [^115a6cBq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Because of growing concern that constituents of drinking water may have adverse health effects, consumption of tap water in North America has decreased and consumption of bottled water has increased. Our objectives were to 1) determine whether North American tap water contains clinically important levels of calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and sodium (Na+) and 2) determine whether differences in mineral content of tap water and commercially available bottled waters are clinically important.

Design

We obtained mineral analysis reports from municipal water authorities of 21 major North American cities. Mineral content of tap water was compared with published data regarding commercially available bottled waters and with dietary reference intakes (DRIs).

Measurements and Main Results

Mineral levels varied among tap water sources in North America and among bottled waters. European bottled waters generally contained higher mineral levels than North American tap water sources and North American bottled waters. For half of the tap water sources we examined, adults may fulfill between 8% and 16% of their Ca2+ DRI and between 6% and 31% of their Mg2+ DRI by drinking 2 liters per day. One liter of most moderate mineralization European bottled waters contained between 20% and 58% of the Ca2+ DRI and between 16% and 41% of the Mg2+ DRI in adults. High mineralization bottled waters often contained up to half of the maximum recommended daily intake of Na+.

Conclusion

Drinking water sources available to North Americans may contain high levels of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+ and may provide clinically important portions of the recommended dietary intake of these minerals. Physicians should encourage patients to check the mineral content of their drinking water, whether tap or bottled, and choose water most appropriate for their needs.

### International consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children and young people [^113NLPNR]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Lifestyle interventions and treatments

Maintenance of normal weight

No RCTs of lifestyle interventions with relevant outcome measures have been conducted in patients with ADPKD. However, there is no evidence to suggest that lifestyle recommendations for the general paediatric population, as well as those for children and adults with CKD, do not apply to children with ADPKD (Box 8). The importance of maintaining normal weight is underlined by the observation that obesity is an independent predictor of faster loss of renal function in adults with early ADPKD.

Salt intake

The dietary salt intake of the general population of infants, toddlers and older children on a Western diet far exceeds the recommended amounts. In adults with CKD, high salt intake is associated with higher blood pressure, proteinuria and progression to ESRD –. Higher sodium intake also blunts the antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects of RAAS blockade. In patients with ADPKD, urinary sodium excretion correlates with kidney growth. Moreover, in patients with later-stage ADPKD, higher urinary sodium levels (a surrogate for sodium intake) increased the risk of a composite end point of a 50% reduction in eGFR, ESRD or death. Few interventional trials exist, but restricting salt intake lowers blood pressure and proteinuria in adults with ADPKD or CKD. In accordance with numerous guidelines for CKD, we recommend that children with ADPKD should aim to achieve the recommended intake for healthy children, which may require extra assistance (for example, advice from a dietician).

Water and protein intake

High water intake to suppress endogenous vasopressin production is often recommended for patients with ADPKD. However, evidence from interventional and observational studies does not confirm a benefit of this intervention, and a randomized trial is still ongoing. Studies suggest that adults with ADPKD are more sensitive to water deprivation than those with IgA nephropathy and produce higher levels of endogenous vasopressin to reach similar levels of urine osmolality to those of healthy individuals. Dehydration should therefore be avoided, and patients should be encouraged to drink to satisfy thirst. A low-osmolar diet (low sodium, low protein and adjusted water intake to decrease urinary osmolality to < 280 mOsM/kg (280 mmol/kg)) decreased the levels of endogenous copeptin (a surrogate marker of vasopressin) in a short study of adults with ADPKD, but a potential long-term benefit on cyst growth remains speculative. In children with non-ADPKD CKD, an RCT did not find a beneficial effect of a low-protein diet on GFR decline. Unnecessary protein restriction should be avoided in children to reduce the risk of malnutrition.

### The most essential nutrient: defining the adequate intake of water [^116xyNRH]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Although water is quantitatively the most import nutrient, there are no recommended dietary allowances (RDA) or adequate intake (AI) values. Based on 718 assessments of 24-hour total water intake, urine volume, and urine osmolality, individual hydration status was characterized in 479 healthy boys and girls of the DONALD study aged 4.0 to 6.9 years and 7.0 to 10.9 years. Mean 24-hour total water intake ranged from 0.90 mL/kcal to 0.96 mL/kcal, and median 24-hour urine osmolality ranged from 683 mosm/kg to 854 mosm/kg. A maximum urine osmolality of 830 mosm/kg (mean - 2 SD) in healthy children with a typical affluent Western-type diet was the physiologic criterion of the upper limit of euhydration. "Water reserve" (24-hour urine volume - hypothetical urine volume to excrete 24 urine solutes at a concentration of 830 mosm/kg) was a quantitative measure of individual 24-hour hydration status and ensuring euhydration in 97% of the subjects in each group; AI values of total water in the 4 age and sex groups ranged from 1.01 mL/kcal to 1.05 mL/kcal. These procedures to quantify 24-hour hydration status may prove valuable in investigating the effects on health of different states of euhydration.

### Improving hydration among hospitalised older adults in an acute geriatric ward with a bundled multi-component intervention [^1123aeyf]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Previously, a service improvement project in Singapore Changi General Hospital (CGH) was carried out in 2020, trialling the use of a dysphagia cup to encourage oral intake in geriatric inpatients. The study found that 90% of geriatric patients did not consume the recommended daily fluid allowance of 1.6 L/day for females and 2.0 L/day for males as recommended by ESPEN guidelines. With similar problems of inadequate oral hydration among geriatric inpatients in a local institution, the CGH study provided valuable insight into the potential issues that our study could face. The CGH study noted that the mean amount of water consumed daily by hospitalised older adults was 1030 mL (range of 500–2200 mL), with only 10% meeting the lower limit of daily recommended water consumption. Therefore, when caring for hospitalised older adults, the practical approach to aiming for optimal hydration is to achieve the best oral fluid intake possible under ongoing circumstances even though it may not meet the recommended daily fluid allowance as per guidelines. A practical target when aiming for the best daily oral fluid intake among hospitalised older adults was 1 L based on the mean amount of water consumed in our local geriatric inpatient population and literature. Hence, the study aimed to investigate the percentage of geriatric inpatients who consume at least 1 L of fluids per day, analyse the problem of poor oral hydration, identify workflow gaps, then generate and test solutions that would improve oral hydration.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^111X42et]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Water is essential for a wide variety of physiological functions, and water intake must be sufficient to compensate for daily losses. Low daily water intake and low urine output increase long-term risk of kidney dysfunction, and insufficient intake may also have a role in the development of hyperglycemia. Guidelines for adequate total water intake for the general adult population have been proposed by several international governing bodies. Yet, these recommendations are based on population median water intakes, with limited consideration of links between water intake and hydration status and without links between water intake and health. Moreover, the recommendations do not provide a method for individuals to ensure they are consuming enough water to meet their specific hydration needs.

Establishing the adequacy of fluid intake based on physiological indicators of hydration is challenging, because there are multiple biological indicators of hydration in average adults in free-living conditions, each sensitive to a different aspect of hydration. The accurate measurement of hydration status is complicated because body water turnover occurs constantly and water moves between intracellular and extracellular compartments. Proposed biomarkers of hydration include the direct measurement of blood, urine, saliva and tears, as well as estimates of body water via bioelectrical impedance or spectroscopy. No single method appears to be ideal for all situations. Serum osmolality is considered a good marker for acute or critical dehydration situations, but is tightly regulated and insensitive to mild hydration deficits in healthy sedentary individuals with ad libitum access to fluids. In contrast, urinary hydration biomarkers do vary according to fluid intake, and are biologically significant in terms of predicting health outcomes such as chronic kidney disease.

### Origins for the estimations of water requirements in adults [^115jUaxh]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Water homeostasis generally occurs without conscious effort; however, estimating requirements can be necessary in settings such as health care. This review investigates the derivation of equations for estimating water requirements. Published literature was reviewed for water estimation equations and original papers sought. Equation origins were difficult to ascertain and original references were often not cited. One equation (% of body weight) was based on just two human subjects and another equation (ml water/kcal) was reported for mammals and not specifically for humans. Other findings include that some equations: for children were subsequently applied to adults; had undergone modifications without explicit explanation; had adjusted for the water from metabolism or food; and had undergone conversion to simplify application. The primary sources for equations are rarely mentioned or, when located, lack details conventionally considered important. The sources of water requirement equations are rarely made explicit and historical studies do not satisfy more rigorous modern scientific method. Equations are often applied without appreciating their derivation, or adjusting for the water from food or metabolism as acknowledged by original authors. Water requirement equations should be used as a guide only while employing additional means (such as monitoring short-term weight changes, physical or biochemical parameters and urine output volumes) to ensure the adequacy of water provision in clinical or health-care settings.

### Water intake and risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^113Crjas]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The association of water intake with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the knowledge about the relationship between water intake and the risk of T2DM.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and Scopus up to June 2018 for observational studies. Risk ratios (RR)s and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)s were calculated and fixed effects models were used.

Results

Overall, 6 studies were included in the meta-analyses. There was an inverse relationship between water intake and risk of T2DM (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91–0.97, P < 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 24%, P = 0.24).

Conclusion

Our findings indicated that the intake of water was correlated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in women and men. These results support the current recommendations of water intake as an inseparable part of a diet with the lowest risk of diabetes mellitus.

### Projecting future fluid intake of Chinese children in a warming world [^1161j1qF]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Water is an essential component of human life and accounts for ~60–70% of body mass, playing a crucial role in maintaining optimal health and function of various physiological processes. Both excessive and insufficient water intake negatively impact human health. Adequate water intake sustains fundamental body functions and fosters cognitive alertness, concentration and overall academic performance, which is particularly critical for school-aged children and adolescents in a phase of rapid physical and cognitive growth characterized by increased metabolic rates. Ensuring adequate water intake is essential to support educational progress, participation in extracurricular activities, and overall well-being. Therefore, there is a need to establish water intake guidelines and enhance public awareness about the significance of maintaining sufficient hydration. An investigation on water consumption among National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants in the United States from 1999 to 2002 revealed an average daily total water intake (including both foods and beverages) of approximately 1.4 L for children and adolescents (aged 4–18 years). In China, only three surveys have been carried out specifically focusing on total fluid intake (TFI), which encompasses drinking water and all other types of beverages –. The Chinese Nutrition Society recommends a daily TFI of approximately 1 L for children aged 7–10 years, 1.3–1.4 L for boys aged 11–17 years, and 1.1 to 1.2 L for girls aged 11–17 years.

However, TFI often falls short of adequate intake (AI) recommendations in some countries. Such recommendations usually consider age, sex, activity, and environmental conditions. Prior research has indicated the association between environmental temperature and water consumption –. For instance, a cross-sectional community study conducted in the US-Mexico population showed a 28% increase in water consumption when outdoor air temperatures exceeded 90 °F. Another study involving Japanese adults revealed that total water intake was about 10% higher during summer compared to winter. During warmer months, individuals exhibit higher water intake to regulate body temperature and replace lost fluids, while cooler months witness comparatively lower water consumption. However, none of these studies have thoroughly investigated the exposure-response relationships between ambient temperature and TFI, and understanding this association will be helpful in assessing how individuals modify their fluid intake in response to different ambient temperatures conditions.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^113woNHU]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

For an inactive 60-year-old female weighing 65 kg with average UK home humidity (50%) and temperature (20°C) in Newcastle upon Tyne, the water turnover would be 2169.5 ml/day; assuming 40% of water input were from food, that would equate to a recommended daily fluid intake of 1.3 l (or 5.2 glasses of water). Unfortunately, due to the age-related changes in water turnover beyond the age of 60 years, the authors excluded people over this age to derive the equation. In addition, the equation does not consider that a greater proportion of older people may be dehydrated. However, it does competently call into question the existing NHS advice.

Oral hydration

Orally ingested water is largely absorbed in the small intestine where the absorption of sodium and glucose creates osmotic gradients promoting intracellular water uptake. It could therefore be assumed that plain water is not the most hydrating of fluids to drink. To confirm this, one study compared the effects of 13 different beverages on hydration. Seventy-two young (mean age 25 ± 4 years), healthy and active males consumed four beverages each, under experimental conditions to create a standardised baseline level of hydration, on different days in a randomised order. One litre of each beverage was consumed steadily over 30 minutes. The drinks included were still spring water, sparkling water, cola, diet cola, sports drink, oral rehydration salts (ORS), orange juice, lager, hot black coffee, hot black tea, cold black tea, full-fat milk and skimmed milk. After 1 hour, in comparison with still water, a statistically significant positive fluid balance was seen with full-fat milk, skimmed milk, ORS and orange juice. At 4 hours, this effect persisted for all these drinks except orange juice. A hydration index (urine mass within 2-hours post beverage/urine mass post-still water) was significantly greater for full-fat milk, skimmed milk, ORS and orange juice. An additional interesting finding revealed that hydration was no worse than still-water when consuming caffeinated drinks or alcohol, although perhaps the study duration was too short to adequately capture the pharmacological effects of these drinks. Clearly these results arise from experimental conditions in a highly selective cohort and similar results may not arise in older people with altered physiology, people with co-morbidity or polypharmacy.

### Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration [^111hR74C]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

How much water we really need depends on water functions and the mechanisms of daily water balance regulation. The aim of this review is to describe the physiology of water balance and consequently to highlight the new recommendations with regard to water requirements. Water has numerous roles in the human body. It acts as a building material; as a solvent, reaction medium and reactant; as a carrier for nutrients and waste products; in thermoregulation; and as a lubricant and shock absorber. The regulation of water balance is very precise, as a loss of 1% of body water is usually compensated within 24 h. Both water intake and water losses are controlled to reach water balance. Minute changes in plasma osmolarity are the main factors that trigger these homeostatic mechanisms. Healthy adults regulate water balance with precision, but young infants and elderly people are at greater risk of dehydration. Dehydration can affect consciousness and can induce speech incoherence, extremity weakness, hypotonia of ocular globes, orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Human water requirements are not based on a minimal intake because it might lead to a water deficit due to numerous factors that modify water needs (climate, physical activity, diet and so on). Water needs are based on experimentally derived intake levels that are expected to meet the nutritional adequacy of a healthy population. The regulation of water balance is essential for the maintenance of health and life. On an average, a sedentary adult should drink 1.5 l of water per day, as water is the only liquid nutrient that is really essential for body hydration.

### Criterion values for urine-specific gravity and urine color representing adequate water intake in healthy adults [^115zVRTa]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Water is essential to life, represents the largest single nutrient in terms of intake, and must be replenished daily through food and fluid consumption. Adequate intakes have been established based upon population median data. However, adequate intakes are not linked to specific health outcomes, and daily water needs are highly individual and depend upon environment, activity, diet and other factors. Thus, a dietary reference value for the general population is unlikely to have much relevance for the individual. Various biomarkers of urine concentration allow for individual-level daily hydration monitoring. Specifically, urine osmolality (U Osm) is the most precise, non-invasive biomarker available to evaluate the 24-h hydration process, as it represents the net sum of water gains, losses and neuroendocrine responses that act to maintain body water homeostasis, and responds rapidly to changes in daily water intake. Recently, we proposed a 24-h U Osm of ≤ 500 mOsm/kg as a reasonable target for urine concentration, reflecting sufficient total water intake to compensate daily losses, reduce circulating vasopressin and ensure sufficient urinary output to reduce the risk of some renal health outcomes. However, one limitation to a target based upon U Osm is that it is not easily measured day to day; moreover, clinicians, coaches and dietitians lack the possibility to measure U Osm within their practices or in the field, limiting its utility as a hydration monitoring tool for the larger population. Two alternate methods for measuring urine concentration with greater clinical and field applicability are urine-specific gravity (U SG), which can easily be measured by clinicians, and urine color (U Col), which may be self-assessed. To date, no criterion values for U SG nor U Col, corresponding to a U Osm of 500 mOsm/kg, have been published. Thus, the objective of this analysis was to calculate the criterion values for U SG and subject-assessed U Col, which would have the best diagnostic accuracy for identifying U Osm > 500 mOsm/kg.

### 24-h hydration status: parameters, epidemiology and recommendations [^1126Q5Pp]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Hydration of individuals and groups is characterised by comparing actual urine osmolality (Uosm) with maximum Uosm. Data of actual, maximum and minimum Uosm in infants, children and adults and its major influencing factors are reviewed. There are remarkable ontogenetic, individual and cultural differences in Uosm. In the foetus and the breast-fed infant Uosm is much lower than plasma osmolality, whereas in children and adults it is usually much higher. Individuals and groups may show long-term differences in Uosm. In industrialised countries, the gender difference of Uosm is common. There are large intercultural differences of mean 24-h Uosm ranging from 860 mosm/kg in Germany, 649 mosm/kg in USA to 392 mosm/kg in Poland. A new physiologically based concept called 'free-water reserve' quantifies differences in 24-h euhydration. In 189 boys of the DONALD Study aged 4.0–6.9 y, median urine volume was 497 ml/24-h and median Uosm 809 mosm/kg. Considering mean-2 s.d. of actual maximum 24-h Uosm of 830 mosm/kg as upper level of euhydration and physiological criterion of adequate hydration in these boys, median free-water reserve was 11 ml/24-h. Based on median total water intake of 1310 ml/24-h and the third percentile of free-water volume of -156 ml/24-h, adequate total water intake was 1466 ml/24-h or 1.01 ml/kcal. Data of Uosm in 24-h urine samples and corresponding free-water reserve values of homogeneous groups of healthy subjects from all over the world might be useful parameters in epidemiology to investigate the health effects of different levels of 24-h euhydration.

Water intake and loss in sedentary adults in a temperate climate — typical daily intake is drinks 1575 ml/day (range, 1400–1750 ml/day; 70–80% total intake), food 675 ml/day (range, 600–750 ml/day; 20–30% total intake), metabolism 300 ml/day (range, 250–350 ml/day), with total intake 2550 ml/day (range, 2250–2850 ml/day); corresponding losses are urine 1600 ml/day, skin ("insensitive perspiration") 450 ml/day, respiration 300 ml/day (range, 250–350 ml/day), faeces 200 ml/day (range, 100–300 ml/day), with total loss 2550 ml/day (range, 2000–3100 ml/day), noting that pyrexia and exercise result in activation of sweat glands/additional water loss ("sensitive perspiration").

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^117MNVb5]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

In sedentary adults, hydration is mostly influenced by total fluid intake and not by sweat losses; moreover, low daily fluid intake is associated with adverse health outcomes. This study aimed to model the relation between total fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers.

Subjects/Methods

During 4 consecutive weekdays, 82 adults (age, 31.6 ± 4.3 years; body mass index, 23.2 ± 2.7kg/m(2); 52% female) recorded food and fluid consumed, collected one first morning urine (FMU) void and three 24-h (24hU) samples. The strength of linear association between urinary hydration biomarkers and fluid intake volume was evaluated using simple linear regression and Pearson's correlation. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) modeled the association between fluid intake and 24hU hydration biomarkers.

Strong associations (|r| &#8805; 0.6; P < 0.001) were found between total fluid intake volume and 24hU osmolality, color, specific gravity (USG), volume and solute concentrations. Many 24hU biomarkers were collinear (osmolality versus color: r = 0.49–0.76; USG versus color: r = 0.46–0.78; osmolality versus USG: 0.86–0.97; P < 0.001). Measures in FMU were not strongly correlated to intake. Multivariate PLS and simple linear regression using urine volume explained > 50% of the variance in fluid intake volume (r(2) = 0.59 and 0.52, respectively); however the error in both models was high and the limits of agreement very large.

Conclusions

Hydration biomarkers in 24hU are strongly correlated with daily total fluid intake volume in sedentary adults in free-living conditions; however, the margin of error in the present models limits the applicability of estimating fluid intake from urinary biomarkers.

### A randomized trial on the effects of regular water intake in patients with recurrent headaches [^113RvN1d]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Previously published investigations suggest a positive effect of increased water intake on headache, but a randomised controlled trial has not been done.

Objective

To investigate the effects of increased water intake on headache.

Methods

Randomised controlled trial in primary care with two groups and a follow-up period of 3 months. Patients were included if they had at least two episodes of moderately intense headache or at least five mildly intense episodes per month and a total fluid intake of less than 2.5 l/day. Both groups received written instructions about stress reduction and sleep improvement strategies. The intervention group additionally received the instruction to increase the daily water intake by 1.5 l. The main outcome measures were Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQOL) and days with at least moderate headache per month.

Results

We randomised 50 patients to the control group and 52 patients to the intervention group. Drinking more water resulted in a statistically significant improvement of 4.5 (confidence interval: 1.3–7.8) points on MSQOL. In addition, 47% in the water group reported much improvement (6 or higher on a 10-point scale) on perceived intervention effect against 25% in the control group. However, drinking more water did not result in relevant changes in days with at least moderate headache.

Conclusions

Considering the observed positive subjective effects, it seems reasonable to recommend headache patients to try this non-invasive intervention for a short period of time to see whether they experience improvement.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^114SPu8h]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

There are some limitations to our findings. Mainly, the results of RCTs are interpreted from an intention-to-treat perspective; thus, the actual causal effect of water might not have been accurately demonstrated. While interventions consisted of a recommendation for increasing water intake, adherence to these recommendations and actual intake are not guaranteed. Moreover, since observational studies on the topic may be heavily confounded and subject to several biases, especially recall bias, we restricted our study to RCTs that led to fewer included studies. Lastly, many end points were examined by single studies and thus only limited evidence is available for these end points. The literature would benefit from further studies confirming these results, especially in cases in which the primary end point is a clinical outcome and when the current available studies have obvious limitations or could not achieve target recruitment or participants did not adhere to the intervention. Although current RCTs specify a certain volume of water as the intended intervention, they do not establish what the optimal or target total daily intake should be, which could be addressed in future studies.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^111ex1C7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review followed an a priori registered protocol and conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines. We used data from published RCTs in which the original authors obtained informed consent from participants.

Study Eligibility

Studies were eligible if their research question was to assess the impact of daily water consumption by any defined amount on any health-related outcome. Study design of interest was restricted to RCTs because our aim was to focus on reports of the causal effect of water consumption and to overcome the confounding bias that would be present in observational studies.

Search Strategy

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to April 6, 2023. We developed search strategies in consultation with a research librarian (P.T.). In brief, our searches were developed around 2 main topics: water consumption and health-related issues. For each topic, multiple synonyms were included such as daily water intake or water consumption (topic 1) and urinary symptoms or headache (topic 2). Additional synonyms were developed besides these examples. Full search strategies for each database are in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1. Manual screening of citations from articles selected for data extraction was also performed.

Study Selection

Titles and abstracts of each of the search results were screened by 2 reviewers (N.H. J.L.G.F. B.N. A.S. K.D.L. C.N. and J.L.) independently and in duplicate. Full texts for citations identified as eligible by at least 1 reviewer were obtained and screened by 2 reviewers who used a standardized form to record reasons for exclusion. Disagreements were resolved by referring to a senior investigator (C.P.J. and B.N.B.). Results of the selection process were summarized using a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure). Two of the reviewers independently abstracted the following data: type of clinical trial, year of publication, description of study target population, description of intervention and comparator groups, primary end point assessed, results, and effect estimate (if reported).

Data Analysis

Data were synthesized narratively by presenting descriptive data and summary results. A meta-analysis was not performed because the populations and outcomes assessed were not similar between studies. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized studies (version 2) was used to assess the risk of bias in included studies.

### Replacing caloric beverages with water or diet beverages for weight loss in adults: main results of the choose healthy options consciously everyday (CHOICE) randomized clinical trial [^113FZHCg]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Replacement of caloric beverages with noncaloric beverages may be a simple strategy for promoting modest weight reduction; however, the effectiveness of this strategy is not known.

Objective

We compared the replacement of caloric beverages with water or diet beverages (DBs) as a method of weight loss over 6 mo in adults and attention controls (ACs).

Design

Overweight and obese adults [n = 318; BMI (in kg/m(2)): 36.3 ± 5.9; 84% female; age (mean ± SD): 42 ± 10.7 y; 54% black] substituted noncaloric beverages (water or DBs) for caloric beverages (≥ 200 kcal/d) or made dietary changes of their choosing (AC) for 6 mo.

Results

In an intent-to-treat analysis, a significant reduction in weight and waist circumference and an improvement in systolic blood pressure were observed from 0 to 6 mo. Mean ((± SEM) weight losses at 6 mo were -2.5 ± 0.45% in the DB group, -2.03 ± 0.40% in the water group, and -1.76 ± 0.35% in the AC group; there were no significant differences between groups. The chance of achieving a 5% weight loss at 6 mo was greater in the DB group than in the AC group (OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.05, 5.01; P = 0.04). A significant reduction in fasting glucose at 6 mo (P = 0.019) and improved hydration at 3 (P = 0.0017) and 6 (P = 0.049) mo was observed in the Water group relative to the AC group. In a combined analysis, participants assigned to beverage replacement were 2 times as likely to have achieved a 5% weight loss (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.02, 4.22; P = 0.04) than were the AC participants.

Conclusions

Replacement of caloric beverages with noncaloric beverages as a weight-loss strategy resulted in average weight losses of 2% to 2.5%. This strategy could have public health significance and is a simple, straightforward message. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01017783.

### Effect of increased daily water intake in premenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections: a randomized clinical trial [^113jrqYk]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Increased hydration is often recommended as a preventive measure for women with recurrent cystitis, but supportive data are sparse.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of increased daily water intake on the frequency of recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, controlled, 12-month trial at a clinical research center (years 2013–2016). Among 163 healthy women with recurrent cystitis (≥ 3 episodes in past year) drinking less than 1.5 L of fluid daily assessed for eligibility, 23 were excluded and 140 assigned to water or control group. Assessments of daily fluid intake, urinary hydration, and cystitis symptoms were performed at baseline, 6- and 12-month visits, and monthly telephone calls.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to drink, in addition to their usual fluid intake, 1.5 L of water daily (water group) or no additional fluids (control group) for 12 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome measure was frequency of recurrent cystitis over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were number of antimicrobial regimens used, mean time interval between cystitis episodes, and 24-hour urinary hydration measurements.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the 140 participants was 35.7 (8.4) years, and the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes in the previous year was 3.3 (0.6). During the 12-month study period, the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.5–1.8) in the water group compared with 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0–3.4) in the control group, with a difference in means of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.8; P < .001). Overall, there were 327 cystitis episodes, 111 in the water group and 216 in the control group. The mean number of antimicrobial regimens used to treat cystitis episodes was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7–2.2) and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.3–4.0), respectively, with a difference in means of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3–2.1; P < .001). The mean time interval between cystitis episodes was 142.8 (95% CI, 127.4–160.1) and 84.4 (95% CI, 75.4–94.5) days, respectively, with a difference in means of 58.4 (95% CI, 39.4–77.4; P < .001). Between baseline and 12 months, participants in the water group, compared with those in the control group, had increased mean (SD) urine volume (1.4 [0.04] vs 0.1 [0.04] L; P < .001) and voids (2.4 [0.2] vs -0.1 [0.2]; P < .001) and decreased urine osmolality (-402.8 [19.6] vs -24.0 [19.5] mOsm/kg; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes of fluid daily.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^112F3Wuc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive systematic review to assess the benefits of altered daily water intake interventions. Our study was restricted to RCTs to focus on the reported causal effects of water. We found that increased water intake (and decreased intake in one study) was statistically significantly associated with beneficial effects on several clinical outcomes. Some end points were assessed by more than 1 study and showed mixed results as to whether a statistically significant effect was detected.

### Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on health [^111MxZMX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Alternatives to sugar‐sweetened beverages

Plain water has been the most commonly used source of hydration for the largest part of the evolution of the human species (Wolf 2008). In the context of obesity and obesity‐related diseases, increased consumption of drinking water has been linked to a reduced total energy intake among certain populations (Daniels 2010; Muckelbauer 2013). This effect of drinking water on energy intake may be due to a concomitantly reduced intake of caloric beverages, and possibly also to a reduced intake of solid foods when water is consumed with or before meals, even though this second effect is disputed (Daniels 2010; Muckelbauer 2013). Current dietary guidelines therefore recommend drinking water as a preferred alternative to SSB (DGE 2015; USDA 2015b).

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^114JdhEn]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Nephrolithiasis

Two RCTs in the literature, addressed nephrolithiasis-related end points and increased water intake. Increasing water intake to achieve a daily urine output of 2000 mL or more after an idiopathic calcium stone was associated with significantly fewer stone events by more than half; this intervention was also associated with increased time to recurrence. It is also suggested that increasing water intake in healthy individuals decreases stone risk, judged by an improved Tiselius CRI. Urinary concentration of stone forming salts is an essential part of kidney stone formation. Altering urine volume can thus interfere with these concentrations and prevent stone formation by preventing supersaturation. Stone formers are generally recommended to increase their fluid intake to achieve a urine volume of at least 2.5 L/d.

Other Outcomes

RCTs of interventions involving increased daily water intake found that increased intake was associated with increased mean daytime arterial blood pressure in young adults with hypotension. Water intake interventions did not seem to affect glomerular filtration rate or plasma copeptin in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, DNA adducts formation in exfoliated bladder cells, or any of blood sodium, blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, or quality of life scores in older men.

Several factors contribute to water requirements, and water content from food intake is often overlooked and difficult to calculate. In a study of more than 5600 individuals aged between 8 and 96 years from 23 countries, isotope tracking methods were used to assess water turnover and found that numerous factors (eg, age, body size, activity and athleticism, environmental and geographical factors, socioeconomic status, and others) are all associated with water turnover, which is widely variable. In this systematic review, we found that not only interventions that increased water intake but also those that decreased water intake were associated with beneficial outcomes according to patient status and preexisting conditions. We also found that these interventions might produce no effect for other end points. These findings further the argument that water intake should ideally be individualized and that a recommendation for a single optimal daily consumption amount is challenging.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^112x4Ssb]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Water intake and hydration status have been suggested to impact cognition; however, longitudinal evidence is limited and often inconsistent. This study aimed to longitudinally assess the association between hydration status and water intake based on current recommendations, with changes in cognition in an older Spanish population at high cardiovascular disease risk.

Methods

A prospective analysis was conducted of a cohort of 1957 adults (aged 55–75) with overweight/obesity (BMI between ≥ 27 and < 40 kg/m 2) and metabolic syndrome from the PREDIMED-Plus study. Participants had completed bloodwork and validated, semiquantitative beverage and food frequency questionnaires at baseline, as well as an extensive neuropsychological battery of 8 validated tests at baseline and 2 years of follow-up. Hydration status was determined by serum osmolarity calculation and categorized as < 295 mmol/L (hydrated), 295–299.9 mmol/L (impending dehydration), and ≥ 300 mmol/L (dehydrated). Water intake was assessed as total drinking water intake and total water intake from food and beverages and according to EFSA recommendations. Global cognitive function was determined as a composite z -score summarizing individual participant results from all neuropsychological tests. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted to assess the associations between baseline hydration status and fluid intake, continuously and categorically, with 2-year changes in cognitive performance.

Results

The mean baseline daily total water intake was 2871 ± 676 mL/day (2889 ± 677 mL/day in men; 2854 ± 674 mL/day in women), and 80.2% of participants met the ESFA reference values for an adequate intake. Serum osmolarity (mean 298 ± 24 mmol/L, range 263 to 347 mmol/L) indicated that 56% of participants were physiologically dehydrated. Lower physiological hydration status (i.e.g.reater serum osmolarity) was associated with a greater decline in global cognitive function z -score over a 2-year period (β: − 0.010; 95% CI − 0.017 to − 0.004, p -value = 0.002). No significant associations were observed between water intake from beverages and/or foods with 2-year changes in global cognitive function.

Conclusions

Reduced physiological hydration status was associated with greater reductions in global cognitive function over a 2-year period in older adults with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity. Future research assessing the impact of hydration on cognitive performance over a longer duration is needed.

### A study of fluid intake from beverages in a sample of healthy French children, adolescents and adults [^113J6bR1]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Body hydration is essential for adequate physical and mental function. A number of symptoms have been described corresponding to various degrees of dehydration. Whereas mild dehydration can result in adverse effects on both mental and physical performance, more severe dehydration induces important impairment of survival capacity and, ultimately can lead to death (Lieberman, 2007). In elderly individuals, one important effect of dehydration is an alteration of many crucial physical and mental functions that affect life expectancy (Ferry, 2005; Szinnai et al. 2005; Mentes, 2006). Similar, although not as dramatic, results have also been reported in children (D'Anci et al. 2006).

Fluid needs vary in the human species depending on a large number of factors. Age and body size are important, as well as level of perspiration (affected by temperature and intensity of physical exercise, among many factors) and food habits (such as intake of salt), in addition to other individual or environmental contributors (Lieberman, 2007; Manz, 2007). Given this large inter-individual variability of needs, it is difficult to propose recommendations for the general public, as has been done in many countries for energy and nutrient intakes.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^117381n8]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

In conclusion, hydration biomarkers strongly related to fluid intake may have utility for epidemiological studies linking adequate fluid intake to health outcomes. Linear relationships between urinary hydration biomarkers and acute, progressive dehydration are well established; our findings extend the validity of urinary hydration biomarkers to average adults with known habitual fluid intake. 24hU parameters (osmolality, USG, color and volume) demonstrate strong linear relations to fluid intake, within a broad range of intake volumes that are exhibited by average adults under normal living conditions. Furthermore, urine osmolality, USG and color were strongly related. When ease of measurement is taken into account, USG and urine color appear to be good candidates to track hydration in normal daily living conditions. However, the regression models examined in the current study do not yet provide a sufficient degree of accuracy to approximate intake from hydration markers alone, as the margin of error in both models was large relative to total fluid intake volume. Nonetheless, the strong relation between urinary hydration and fluid intake may provide a physiological basis for individuals and health care providers to assess whether fluid intake is sufficient to meet individual needs.

Water has numerous functions necessary for survival including cellular homeostasis, solvent properties for dissolving ions and solutes, thermoregulation, and transport of waste and nutrients. Despite the established beneficial role of water in skin physiology, the optimal methods for skin hydration and requirements for daily water consumption remain elusive. This review summarizes the cellular and molecular biology of skin hydration, the debate and current recommendations of daily water requirements, and the latest research on interventions to improve skin hydration by both internal and external means of water exposure. We also explore the chemical properties of water, such as the concept of water "hardness" and environmental pollutants, and their impact on skin physiology.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^114Qy8bv]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To maintain adequate hydration status, several countries and public organizations have proposed water intake recommendations for the public. These recommendations have been determined based on data from population studies and accounted for water from beverage and food sources. For instance, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), based on data from population studies from 13 European countries, proposed the dietary reference values (DRV) for the adequate intake (AI) of water which increases with age up to 2.5 L and 2.0 L of water daily for men and women (aged 14 to 70 years), respectively. Similarly, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed increasing water intake levels with age up to 3.7 L/day and 2.7 L/day (aged 19 to 70 years) in men and women, respectively. Yet, the World Health Organization and other guidelines related to cognitive health do not currently include recommendations related to water intake or hydration status. Further understanding of health behaviors, such as cognitive functioning, related to something as fundamental as water intake can have a substantial impact on public health.

Inadequate water intake and dehydration have been associated with existing signs of cognitive impairment among older adults living in long-term care facilities. Moreover, acute studies have shown that dehydration and water supplementation affect mood and cognitive performance. However, fluid and water intake has received limited attention in epidemiological studies, and the literature scarcely examines water intake as a predictor of cognitive performance among older adults. The few studies that have assessed hydration status as a potential predictor of cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults have been inconclusive. Furthermore, to date, few studies have prospectively captured and examined the impact of water and hydration status on cognitive function over a multi-year period. Therefore, the objective of the present analyses was to prospectively investigate the relation between hydration status, water intake, and 2-year changes in cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity.

### Water balance, hydration status, and fat-free mass hydration in younger and older adults [^112tE36D]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Older adults are at increased risk of dehydration, yet water balance is understudied in this population.

Objective

This controlled diet study assessed the effect of age on water input, output, and balance in healthy adults. Hydration status (plasma osmolality and urine specific gravity) and body composition were also measured.

Design

Eleven men and 14 women aged 23–46 y and 10 men and 11 women aged 63–81 y were subjects. Water balance was assessed during days 7–10 of three 18-d controlled feeding trials with protein intakes of 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 g. kg(-1). d(-1). Total water input included water from the provided foods and beverages, ad libitum intake, and metabolic production. Water output included the losses in urine and stool and the insensible losses from respiration and nonsweating perspiration.

Results

Ad libitum water consumption, total water intake, water output through urine, total water output, and net water balance were not different in the older subjects than in the younger subjects. Markers of hydration status were within the range of clinical normalcy for all groups. Total body water (TBW) was not significantly different, fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly lower (P < 0.05), and FFM hydration (TBW:FFM) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the older subjects than in the younger subjects. Dietary protein intake did not influence any of these results.

Conclusions

These results show that healthy older adults maintain water input, output, and balance comparable to those of younger adults and have no apparent changes in hydration status. The results support that the hydration of FFM is increased in older men and women.

Dietary water restriction counseling — Attempts at water restriction commonly are futile if sodium limitation is not observed simultaneously, and reducing a patient's water intake alone is not prudent most of the time because excessive sodium ingestion increases ECF osmolality and stimulates thirst; advising water limitation without curtailing sodium intake will cause suffering from unnecessary thirst.

### Estimates of energy intake, requirements and imbalances based on anthropometric measurements at global, regional and national levels and for sociodemographic groups: a modelling study [^111vKN4B]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

An accurate understanding of total energy intake, energy requirements for healthy body weights and the resultant imbalance is important for many aspects of dietary analysis. Despite its importance, existing estimates are highly uncertain and not well aligned with trends in body weight and malnutrition, especially at regionally comparable and global levels. We estimated energy intake, energy requirements and energy imbalances at global, regional, national and sociodemographic levels based on anthropometric measures.

Methods

We used predictive equations for estimating energy requirements derived from a comprehensive database of doubly labelled water studies, and paired them with global datasets on body weight, height and physical activity to estimate a new proxy of energy intake. We calculated energy requirements to attain healthy body weights by applying the predictive equations to a body mass index that minimises risks for weight-related diseases and is classified as normal. We calculated energy imbalances as the difference between the estimated intake and energy requirements to attain healthy body weights.

Results

On average, 2160 kilocalories per person per day (kcal/day) were required in 2020 to sustain measured levels of body weight, height and physical activity (95% CI, 2100 to 2210 kcal/day), ranging from 1980 (95% CI, 1900 to 2060) kcal/day in low-income countries to 2360 (95% CI, 2310 to 2410) kcal/day in high-income countries. The estimated intake exceeded energy requirements to attain healthy body weights by 80 (95% CI, 70 to 100) kcal/day on average, with 192 countries (97%) having average intakes above recommendations, and 6 countries (3%) with intake below, and increasing to 14 (7%) when considering rural residences. Between 1990 and 2020, 50 countries (25%) changed from average intakes below recommendations to intakes above.

Conclusions

Estimating total energy intake based on anthropometric measures captures the regional and temporal trends in body weight, height and physical activity. The estimates can be used as a complementary measure to existing proxies of energy intake. Among other things, they can inform misreporting of intake in dietary surveys, uncertainty in the amount of food wasted and the lack of data on at-home production in food availability statistics. Aligning existing measures of food intake with consistent estimates of overall energy intake could improve dietary analyses and policy planning.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^111zfQVf]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1957 participants (mean age 65.0 ± 4.9 years and 50.5% women) were available for the assessment of water and fluid intake and 1192 participants for the assessment of hydration status after excluding missing values or implausible data (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the study population according to sex, water (tap and bottle) intake amount, and hydration status. The median (range) consumption of drinking water intake in men and women was 900 (0 to 3100) and 900 (0 to 2700) mL/day, respectively. Compared with participants in the group with the lowest drinking water intake (< 500 mL/day), those with the highest drinking water intake (1.8 to 3.1 L/day) were more likely to be younger (p < 0.001), have a higher BMI (p = 0.001), and have a lower alcohol intake (p < 0.001). Compared to participants considered to be hydrated according to serum osmolarity status, participants considered to be dehydrated tended to be older (p = 0.008), women (p = 0.008), have type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001), have depressive symptoms (p = 0.025), and less likely to drink alcohol (p = 0.002). Participants involved in the present analyses did not differ from the rest of the participants enrolled in the PREDIMED-Plus trial in terms of age, sex, BMI, and prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Furthermore, 80% of participants (69% of men and 90% of women) met the EFSA fluid intake recommendations based on questionnaire responses, yet serum osmolarity values indicated over 50% of participants were physiologically dehydrated with only 10% of participants being considered physiologically hydrated based on serum osmolarity levels.

Regarding preventative measures for exercise-associated hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to proper hydration, WMS 2020 guidelines recommend to advise participants of endurance athletic events or strenuous wilderness activities:

- avoiding overdrinking during the activity

- drinking according to thirst, or determining an estimation of their individual fluid needs during pre-event training activities by assessing body weight losses per hour, which limits the potential for weight gain.

### Criterion values for urine-specific gravity and urine color representing adequate water intake in healthy adults [^111NPGbS]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Eighty-two healthy French adults (23.6 ± 2.9 years; 22.2 ± 1.5 kg/m 2; 41 women) provided informed consent (CPP Est-III, Nancy, France) and collected all individual voids produced over 1–4 consecutive days as part of a larger study (NCT02044679). On collection days, subjects woke up before 0700 hours, voided and discarded this first morning sample. Subsequent voids were collected in individual, clear plastic containers, including the first morning void of the following morning at 0700 hours. For each void, participants self-evaluated U Col using Armstrong et al. 's color scale, under consistent lighting conditions. Once samples were returned to the laboratory, U SG (Pen Urine S.G.; Atago, Japan) and U Osm (Advanced Model 2020 Multi-Sample Osmometer; Advanced Instruments, Inc. Norwood, MA, USA) were measured.

Logistic regression curves were generated with U SG and U Col as predictor variables, and U Osm as a binary outcome variable, with U Osm > 500 mOsm/kg defined as 'condition present', and U Osm ≤ 500 mOsm/kg as 'condition absent'. The optimal cutoffs for U SG and U Col for identifying U Osm > 500 mOsm/kg were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We were equally interested in evaluating sensitivity (if U Osm is > 500 mOsm/kg, how often will U SG, U Col be at or above the cutoff values?) and specificity (if U Osm is ≤ 500 mOsm/kg, how often will U SG, U Col be below the cutoff values?); thus, our analysis favored neither sensitivity nor specificity.

### Influence of water drinking on resting energy expenditure in overweight children [^1144NU5A]. International Journal of Obesity (2011). Low credibility.

Background

It was previously demonstrated that drinking water significantly elevates the resting energy expenditure (REE) in adults, and that low water intake is associated with obesity and lesser success in weight reduction. This study addressed the potential of water drinking to increase the REE in children, as an additional tool for weight management.

Objective

To examine the effect of drinking water on the REE of overweight children.

Design

A total of 21 overweight, otherwise-healthy children (age 9.9 ± 1.4 years, 11 males) drank 10 mL kg(-1) cold water (4 °C). REE was measured before and after water ingestion, for 66 min. The main outcome measure was the change in mean REE from baseline values.

Results

Immediately after drinking water, there was a transient decrease in REE, from a baseline value of 3.32 ± 1.15kilojoule (kJ) per min to 2.56 ± 0.66kJ per min at minute 3 (P = 0.005). A subsequent rise in REE was then observed, which was significantly higher than baseline after 24min (3.89 ± 0.78kJ/min (P = 0.021)), and at most time points thereafter. Maximal mean REE values were seen at 57 min after water drinking (4.16 ± 1.43kJ per min (P = 0.004)), which were 25% higher than baseline. REE was significantly correlated with age, height, weight and fat-free mass; the correlations with maximal REE values after water drinking were stronger than with baseline REE values.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated an increase of up to 25% in REE following the drinking of 10 mL kg(-1) of cold water in overweight children, lasting for over 40min. Consuming the recommended daily amount of water for children could result in an energy expenditure equivalent to an additional weight loss of about 1.2 kg per year. These findings reinforce the concept of water-induced REE elevation shown in adults, suggesting that water drinking could assist overweight children in weight loss or maintenance, and may warrant emphasis in dietary guidelines against the obesity epidemic.

### Associations between hydration state and pregnancy complications, maternal-infant outcomes: protocol of a prospective observational cohort study [^113DkP4R]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

In order to promote enough water intake, it is necessary to propose recommendations on water intake for pregnant women. Only some countries or organizations have made specific recommendations on water intake for pregnant women: 2.7 L/d is recommended by the American Institute of Medicine and 4.8 L/d is advised by the World Health Organization (WHO). A survey of dietary guidelines in 84 countries revealed that only 8 countries had quantitative recommendations for fluid intake. Of the four editions of Dietary Guidelines (1989, 1997, 2007, and 2016) released in China, the first two editions had no recommendation for fluid intake. In 2007, the recommended amount of daily fluid intake was 1.2 L/d for adults, but no recommendation was given for pregnant women. In 2016, the recommendation was 2.7 L/d for women and 3.0 L/d for men and pregnant women. However, the recommendation for water intake for pregnant women was based on data of the water intake survey among pregnant women in other countries, not the data in China. Water requirements vary among pregnant women in different countries due to differences in dietary pattern, environment, and other factors; thus, it is necessary to undertake studies related to water intake during pregnancy in China.

Two hypotheses are proposed in this study: one is that some pregnant women are dehydrated due to having insufficient water intake and the other is that dehydration has negative effects on pregnancy and maternal and infant outcomes. The objectives of this study are, firstly, to investigate the fluid intake among pregnant women, secondly, to assess their hydration state, and finally, to investigate the associations with pregnancy complications and maternal-infant outcomes. This preliminary exploratory study on will provides some related reference data for updating the recommendation for adequate water intake among pregnant women. In addition, it will provide some evidences on water-related education. Based on this preliminary study, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required for the development of clinical guidelines and recommendations. The ultimate goals are to promote adequate water intake, to maintain optimal hydration state, and to improve mater health and birth outcomes.

### Equivalence of afternoon spot and 24-h urinary hydration biomarkers in free-living healthy adults [^1167gsjJ]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Participant recruitment

This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at a single investigating center. Participants were eligible if they were 20–30 years old, in good health, as determined by medical history, physical examination and hematology and biochemistry screening, and with a body mass index between 20 and 25 kg/m 2. Female subjects were included only if they were on a monophasic oral contraceptive method and not pregnant or breast-feeding. Exclusion criteria included smoking > 10 cigarettes/day, excessive alcohol consumption (> 20 g alcohol/day), use of any prescription or over-the-counter medication that may interfere with water balance or metabolism within 14 days before the start of the study, any clinically relevant acute or chronic diseases and following a vegetarian diet. All participants gave written informed consent before the start of the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki ethical principles, it was approved by an Independent Ethics Committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Est-III, Nancy, France) and it was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02044679). Subjects were asked to refrain from intensive physical activity that would result in substantial sweat loss during the study period.

Screening phase

To ensure a wide representation of daily TFI and thus a range of urine output, potential participants completed a 3-day screening phase during which they recorded all daily food and fluid intake (NutriSaas-24WQ-waters; MXS, Paris, France). Participants were included if their mean daily TFI was between 50 and 200% of the dietary reference value (DRV) determined by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Participants were stratified into three predefined arms: ARM 1, consuming between 50 and 80% of the EFSA DRV; ARM 2 (TFI 81–120% of EFSA DRV); and ARM 3 (TFI between 121 and 200% of EFSA DRV). As TFI in a population is generally relatively normally distributed, these arms were used to ensure adequate representation of 'low' and 'high' drinkers, which would otherwise be underrepresented relative to 'medium' drinkers in a sample. The required total sample size was calculated from previously published data to obtain a power of 90%, and α risk of 5%. A total of 63 participants were required, but ultimately 82 participants were recruited (ARM 1, n = 32; ARM 2, n = 28; and ARM 3, n = 22) in order to account for anticipated withdrawal.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^113Mgx82]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Weight Loss

Three studies documented greater weight loss in adult participants with an intervention of premeal water intake of approximately 500 mL. Premeal water intake may induce weight loss through stomach filling, leading to earlier satiety or by replacing high-calorie beverages. In a study by Van Walleghen et al, premeal water consumption (500 mL) was shown to reduce meal energy intake in older adults by approximately 111 kcal. Interestingly, this outcome was not detected in younger adults in this study. Additionally, subjective hunger ratings were lower, while subjective fullness ratings were higher with premeal water consumption. Davy et alconducted a study in which 24 adults with overweight or obesity with a mean (SD) age of 61.3 (1.1) years were given a standard breakfast meal on 2 randomly assigned occasions, only 1 preceded by a 500-mL water preload. They found a statistically significant 13% reduction in meal energy intake with water preload. A psychosocial benefit may also exist, in which water intake might serve as a reminder to eat healthier food.

Establishing a simple, low-cost intervention (eg, premeal water) for weight loss can be enormously beneficial for public health given the increasing health burden of obesity. For example, in the United States, obesity prevalence increased from 30.5% to 41.9% over the past 2 decades, and the estimated medical cost of obesity was nearly $173 billion dollars in 2019. Additionally, a significant portion of vascular deaths (29%) and neoplastic deaths (8%) in late middle age in the United States were attributable to elevated body mass index.

Another studyinvolving 38 adolescent participants failed to demonstrate a beneficial association of a water intervention with weight loss over a 6-month period using an intention-to-treat analysis. Despite not achieving their target for recruitment, the authors reported that the observed difference between groups would still not be statistically significant if recruitment was complete. Nevertheless, the target intake of 2000 mL/d was not achieved, with only 2 participants reporting drinking 1775 mL/d or more. As many as 40% of the participants in the intervention group reported not being able to drink in class or not having convenient or safe places to drink water, suggesting that adherence with the intervention is more difficult to achieve in an adolescent population.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^113GmEzA]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Finally, the strong relation between fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers, notably 24hU osmolality, provides an opportunity to revisit the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in establishing its total water intake guidelines for adults (2.5 and 2.0 l per day of total water for men and women, respectively, with ∼80% coming from fluids). EFSA bases its water daily reference values on observed intakes as well as relative to a 'desirable' urine osmolarity of 500 mOsm/l, calculated from the renal solute load derived from European dietary surveys. The EFSA recommendations incorporated a calculation of the theoretical amount of water required to excrete solute at a urine osmolarity of < 500 mOsm/l. Osmolarity (expressed in mOsm/l) and osmolality (expressed in mOsm/kg) are not synonymous; however, the difference between the two is negligible in solutions of low concentration. Thus, our study data provided an opportunity to test the cutoff of 500 mOsm/kg relative to daily fluid intake. Overall, the calculations and recommendations made by EFSA were well adapted to the majority of adults in our sample. On days when subjects met or exceeded EFSA reference value for water from fluid, urine osmolality was < 500 mOsm/kg 80% of the time. Similarly, urine osmolality exceeded 500 mOsm/kg in 82% of the cases where fluid intake was inferior to daily recommendations. It is worth noting, however, that the reference values for daily water intake may not be sufficient to ensure a low urine osmolality in ∼20% of the population, which is nonetheless substantial. This underscores the large interindividual variability in daily water needs, as well as the necessity of developing biomarkers for adequate fluid intake that are tailored to physiological indicators.

### Self-reported lifestyle behaviours in families with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes across six European countries: a cross-sectional analysis from the feel4Diabetes-study [^114FQqKS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Several European studies have previously investigated the levels of PA, SB and healthy dietary behaviours in primary schoolchildren and adults in a general population. Results indicated that between 5.0% and 47.0% of the European children and between 7.0% and 96.0% of the European adults met the recommended amount of PA per day, depending on assessment methods (i.e. different types of questionnaires, accelerometers) and country. Furthermore, European adults reported a sitting time of 309 min/day on weekdays and 25% of the girls and 33% of the boys exceeded the recommended daily screen-time limits. Regarding dietary behaviour, results of the European Energy-project showed that between 12.0 and 51.7% of children and between 11.8 and 56.1% of adults, depending on country and sex, skip breakfast. Furthermore, research has indicated that between 76 and 94% of 11-year-old European children and 86% of adults did not reach the recommendations regarding fruit and vegetable intake. Moreover, a study conducted in six European countries showed that young children consumed on average between 0.25 and 0.85 L of water per day (depending on gender and country) and French, Italian and Spanish adults consumed on average between 0.60 and 0.72 L of water per day, which is in both children and adults below the recommended amount (1.5 L of water/day in both age groups). Finally, results of the Identification and prevention of Dietary and lifestyle induced health EFfects In Children and infantS (IDEFICS)-study revealed high intakes of total sugars and foods and drinks rich in added sugar in European 2-to 10-year-old children and a high percentage (11–49%, depending of country) of European adults was found to exceed the WHO recommendation on free sugars intake, considering solely fluids.

### Replacing sweetened caloric beverages with drinking water is associated with lower energy intake [^111vHmMx]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Reduced intake of sweetened caloric beverages (SCBs) is recommended to lower total energy intake. Replacing SCBs with non-caloric diet beverages does not automatically lower energy intake, however. Compensatory increases in other food or beverages reportedly negate benefits of diet beverages. The purpose of this study was to evaluate drinking water as an alternative to SCBs.

Research Methods and Procedures

Secondary analysis of data from the Stanford A TO Z intervention evaluated change in beverage pattern and total energy intake in 118 overweight women (25 to 50 years) who regularly consumed SCBs (> 12 ounces/d) at baseline. At baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months, mean daily beverage intake (SCBs, drinking water, non-caloric diet beverages, and nutritious caloric beverages), food composition (macronutrient, water, and fiber content), and total energy intake were estimated using three 24-hour diet recalls. Beverage intake was expressed in relative terms (percentage of beverages).

Results

In fixed effects models that controlled for total beverage intake, non-caloric and nutritious caloric beverage intake (percentage of beverages), food composition, and energy expenditure [metabolic equivalent (MET)], replacing SCBs with drinking water was associated with significant decreases in total energy intake that were sustained over time. The caloric deficit attributable to replacing SCBs with water was not negated by compensatory increases in other food or beverages. Replacing all SCBs with drinking water was associated with a predicted mean decrease in total energy of 200 kcal/d over 12 months.

Discussion

The results suggest that replacing SCBs with drinking water can help lower total energy intake in overweight consumers of SCBs motivated to diet.

### Association between water consumption and body weight outcomes in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^112RfZup]. Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Water is recommended to replace sugar-containing beverages for prevention of childhood obesity. Because this recommendation is not evidence-based yet, the existing evidence on the association between water consumption and body weight outcomes was summarized.

Methods

In a systematic review, studies were retrieved from four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane) and further search methods. Studies including children aged 2–19 years on the association between water consumption and any body weight-related outcome were eligible.

Results

Out of 3,023 retrieved records, 13 studies were included: four longitudinal and nine cross-sectional studies. One cross-sectional analysis in one longitudinal study was additionally included, resulting in ten cross-sectional analyses. One non-randomized controlled study and two observational longitudinal studies showed that increased water consumption reduced the risk of overweight or body mass index. Another observational longitudinal study did not indicate this association. Six cross-sectional analyses found a direct association between water consumption and at least one body weight outcome. Four cross-sectional analyses did not show any association.

Conclusions

On the cross-sectional level, higher water consumption seems to be associated with higher weight status. In contrast, longitudinal studies suggest a weight-reducing effect of water consumption, but evidence for a causal association is still low.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^113RZ5gW]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Recent work by Armstrong et al. established reference ranges for various urinary and plasma hydration biomarkers relative to deciles of total water intake volume; this suggests the possibility of a linear association between intake and hydration biomarkers. If strong linear relations exist between urinary hydration biomarkers and fluid intake, it may be possible to link daily fluid intake volume to biomarkers that are easily measured. This would represent an important advancement in the ability to monitor daily fluid intake, hydration and disease risk, and may help individuals determine a daily fluid intake volume appropriate for their individual hydration requirements.

Our research group recently published an assessment of the impact of habitually different total fluid intake behaviors (low consumption: < 1.2 l per day versus high consumption: > 2.0 l per day) on multiple biomarkers of hydration status in free-living conditions. Hydration biomarkers in first-morning and 24-h urine (24hU) collections, but not plasma osmolality, were significantly different between low and high volume drinkers, and urine osmolality, volume and specific gravity (USG) were distributed over a broad range of values. The study database also included individuals whose fluid consumption fell between the established low and high drinker thresholds, and who were therefore excluded from the previous low/high analysis. This presented us with an opportunity to further explore the associations between hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake over a wide range of fluid intake behaviors. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the strength of correlations between total daily fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers in sedentary adults in free-living conditions, and to model fluid intake relative to urinary hydration biomarkers using simple and multivariate regression methods.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^112dgoCk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — Recommendation 1 (fluid intake) states: "ACP recommends management with increased fluid intake spread throughout the day to achieve at least 2 L of urine per day to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)". Low-quality evidence showed that increased fluid intake is associated with a reduction in stone recurrence, with no difference between tap water and Fiuggi brand oligomineral water; persons already drinking recommended amounts or with contraindications "should not be directed to increase their fluid intake further". Decreasing consumption of soft drinks is associated with reduced recurrence only for beverages "acidified by phosphoric acid, such as colas", and not for drinks "acidified by citric acid, such as fruit-flavored sodas".

Diet and hydration guidance for individuals at risk of pressure injuries — It is good practice to encourage individuals at risk of a pressure injury to consume a balanced diet that includes nutrient dense food and adequate hydration. For most individuals, nutritional requirements can be met with a healthy oral diet, and dietary/nutrition guidelines outline recommended dietary intake based on individualized circumstances (e.g., medical condition, lifestyle, demographics, geographic context, etc.). In healthy individuals who are adequately hydrated, water released from food and metabolism accounts for 20% or more of total water intake.

### The effects of 6 months of increased water intake on blood sodium, glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, and quality of life in elderly (aged 55–75) men [^1138TVcw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study whether there are any negative or positive effects of 6 months of increased fluid intake in reasonably healthy elderly men.

Design

Randomized trial.

Setting

Community-based.

Participants

One hundred forty-one healthy participants aged 55 to 75.

Intervention

One group was given the advice to increase their daily fluid intake by 1.5 L of water; the other group was given placebo medication (8 mL inactive syrup per day).

Measurements

At 6 months blood sodium, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure, and quality of life (QOL) were measured. The changes in water turnover were measured using deuterium.

Results

Most subjects did not manage to increase their fluid intake by 1.5 L. The average increase in the intervention group was approximately 1 L. Twenty-four-hour water turnover in the water group was 359 mL (95% confidence interval = 171–548) higher than that of the control group at 6-month follow-up. Blood pressure, sodium level, GFR, and QOL did not change significantly in either group during the intervention period. In addition, the cases reporting a worsening on the effect measures were equally distributed over the two study groups.

Conclusion

The advice to increase fluid intake by 1.5 L had no negative effects in reasonably healthy men aged 55 to 75.

### Self-reported lifestyle behaviours in families with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes across six European countries: a cross-sectional analysis from the feel4Diabetes-study [^113EvU97]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is highly preventable through adopting a healthy lifestyle. Several lifestyle behaviours contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, including insufficient levels of physical activity (PA), high levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) and unhealthy dietary behaviours. Guidelines and recommendations for these behaviours have been developed for children and adults. PA guidelines set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend children to engage in at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) per day and adults to engage in at least 150 min of MVPA per week (corresponding to at least 30 min of MVPA during 5 days). For SB, studies and national guidelines recommend for both children and adults to minimise the amount of time spent in prolonged sitting and to break up long periods of sitting as often as possible. Further, specifically for children it is recommended not to exceed two hours of recreational screen-time per day. Finally, the WHO recommends to consume at least 400 g of fruit and vegetables, corresponding to five portions per day (for both children and adults), and to limit the daily consumption of unhealthy snacks and soft drinks (not exceeding WHO recommendations for free sugar, < 10% of total energy intake). In addition, recommendations based on previous research, suggest to consume breakfast on a daily basis and the European Food Safety Authority recommends a daily water (fluid) intake of 1.6–2.0 L of water per day for girls and women and boys and men respectively.

### IOC consensus statement on recommendations and regulations for sport events in the heat [^116iMWBU]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydration principles

Healthy humans are generally well hydratedwith a day-to-day variation in total body water of 0.2%–0.7% of body mass. However, the rise in sweat rate when exercising in the heat can dramatically change this fluid balance. A reduction in total body water is associated with a decrease in plasma volume and an increase in plasma osmolalitythat will increase the core temperature threshold for vasodilation and sweating, reduces the sweat rate for any given core temperatureand decreases cardiac filling and challenges blood pressure regulation. Dehydration will therefore exacerbate the rate of heat storage and cardiovascular strain imposed by exercising in the heat, thus reducing exercise heat tolerance. Given the potential limit in accessing and ingesting fluid during the competition (see further), the general principle of hydration should be to avoid hypohydration (less than 2% body mass) during the periods of training in the heat, especially immediately before and during intense training and competition exercise in the heat. Any increase in fluid consumption should be progressive and not limited to competition day as an acute increase in fluid absorption may first increase the urine production. The fluid needs for an athlete training in the heat are highly individual but consistent within the individual when influencing variables are consistent. Fluid needs should be adapted based on changes in body mass and/or plasma osmolality and/or urine specific gravity. Hydration measures should be obtained in the morning to avoid confounding effects of recent diet and exercise. The following examples can also be used as a general guide at first before individualised data are ascertained: 6 mL of fluid per kg of body mass every 2–3 hour, or 2 L per day plus 1–2 L per hour of exercise plus 1 L for each 5°C increase in ambient temperature above 21.5°C.

Recommendations

Hydration capacity during exercise itself is limited; therefore, athletes should ascertain sufficient fluid intake "out of exercise", from the days before and throughout the period of training/competing in the heat.
A simple way to monitor hydration status during a period of training/competing in the heat is to follow the weight–urine–thirst principle with daily monitoring of body mass (changes should remain < 1–2%), urine specific gravity (should remain < 1.020) or colour and thirst. If available to the team, plasma osmolality (< 290 mmol/kg) can be included in cases of suspected chronic dehydration.

### Water supplementation reduces copeptin and plasma glucose in adults with high copeptin: the H ₂ O metabolism pilot study [^1136Basu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Copeptin is elevated in conditions of acute illness. For example, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hemorrhage, and sepsis result in marked elevation of copeptin. In the general population, however, after exclusion of other known factors, the observed elevated copeptin concentration might be due to low total water intake. In the current study, participants in the top tertile of baseline copeptin, with a median (interquartile range) copeptin concentration of 35.2 (21.0 to 66.5) pmol · L −1, did not differ in clinical characteristics from participants with moderately elevated baseline copeptin except for having a greater reduction in copeptin and fasting glucose after increased hydration [Table 3; Fig. 4(a)]. Thus, we have no indication that underlying medical conditions or medication use differ between individuals in the top tertile of copeptin concentration and participants with moderately elevated copeptin. Note that these individuals are selected mainly on the basis of several indices of low water intake, including elevated copeptin concentration, and that these high copeptin concentrations thus may be considered as the upper normal limit in an otherwise healthy population with low water intake.

Regarding safety, water supplementation did not induce any change in plasma osmolality or erythrocyte volume fraction. Plasma sodium was slightly reduced at 6 weeks compared with baseline, but the water intervention did not induce any cases of hyponatremia (defined as plasma sodium < 135 mmol · L −1). This was not surprising because overconsumption of water that exceeds the maximal renal excretion rate of 0.7 to 1.0 L per hour is difficult to achieve and because all participants were selected on the basis of several indices of habitual low water intake. In fact, during the 6-week intervention, the participants increased their daily total water intake only enough to reach levels classified as adequate (2.0 to 2.5 L per day) (Table 4).

We conclude that water supplementation in persons with habitual low water intake is effective in lowering copeptin and appears to be a safe and promising intervention that may lower fasting plasma glucose and thus reduce diabetes risk. Further investigations are warranted to assess the long-term effectiveness of water supplementation in lowering blood glucose concentration and, consequently, diabetes risk.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112hAeid]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to salt and water intake, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider advising a sodium intake of < 2 g of sodium per day (or < 90 mmol of sodium per day or < 5 g of sodium chloride per day) in patients with CKD.

### Long-term health outcomes associated with hydration status [^114X6VdR]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Body water balance is determined by fundamental homeostatic mechanisms that maintain stable volume, osmolality and the composition of extracellular and intracellular fluids. Water balance is maintained by multiple mechanisms that continuously match water losses through urine, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract and respiration with water gains achieved through drinking, eating and metabolic water production. Hydration status is determined by the state of the water balance. Underhydration occurs when a decrease in body water availability, due to high losses or low gains, stimulates adaptive responses within the water balance network that are aimed at decreasing losses and increasing gains. This stimulation is also accompanied by cardiovascular adjustments. Epidemiological and experimental studies have linked markers of low fluid intake and underhydration - such as increased plasma concentration of vasopressin and sodium, as well as elevated urine osmolality - with an increased risk of new-onset chronic diseases, accelerated aging and premature mortality, suggesting that persistent activation of adaptive responses may be detrimental to long-term health outcomes. The causative nature of these associations is currently being tested in interventional trials. Understanding of the physiological responses to underhydration may help to identify possible mechanisms that underlie potential adverse, long-term effects of underhydration and inform future research to develop preventative and treatment approaches to the optimization of hydration status.

### Meal effect on magnesium bioavailability from mineral water in healthy women [^1143rMh6]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium intakes in many industrialized countries are below recommended daily allowances. Magnesium-rich mineral water may contribute to coverage of magnesium requirements by providing significant amounts of natural, energy-free, bioavailable magnesium.

Objective

The objectives were to determine magnesium bioavailability from magnesium-rich (110 mg/L) mineral water in healthy subjects when consumed alone and to evaluate the effect of simultaneous meal consumption.

Design

Magnesium bioavailability was measured in 10 healthy women with the use of a crossover design. Stable magnesium isotopes ((25)Mg and (26)Mg) were administered orally with mineral water, which was consumed with or without a meal. Apparent magnesium absorption was determined by fecal monitoring, and magnesium retention was determined from urinary excretion of magnesium isotopes.

Results

The mean (± SD) magnesium absorption from mineral water consumed alone was 45.7 ± 4.6% (range: 40.2–55.5%) and was significantly greater (P = 0.0001) when it was consumed with a meal (52.3 ± 3.9%; 46.2–60.2%), a relative difference of 14.4%. Magnesium retention also was significantly greater (P = 0.0004) when mineral water was consumed with a meal (41.5 ± 4.2%; 35.2–50.6%) than when consumed alone (37.4 ± 4.0%; 33.1–47.0%), a relative difference of 11.0%.

Conclusions

In healthy young women, approximately 50% of the magnesium from magnesium-rich mineral water was absorbed when consumed alone. Magnesium bioavailability from mineral water is enhanced when the water is consumed with a meal, perhaps because of a slower gastrointestinal transit time, the presence of digestion products from the meal, or both. Regular consumption of magnesium-rich mineral water could make a valuable contribution to magnesium requirements.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^116ZzGhv]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Water is a major constituent of the human body and is considered an essential nutrient that cannot be sufficiently produced by metabolism. The National Academy of Medicine suggests a daily fluid intake of approximately 13 eight-ounce cups for men and 9 for women, respectively. A common public health-related recommendation is to drink 8 cups of water per day, yet the supporting evidence is not clear. Given the wide variability of body weight, activity level, and health status at the population level and the numerous mechanisms that regulate water balance, a single optimal amount of daily water consumption is a challenging concept.

Behavioral factors and hydration status have been widely studied in relation to health conditions owing to the known detrimental effects of dehydration. To our knowledge, there has been no study to compile reports of the benefits of water interventions on clinical outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) pertaining to the impact of increased daily water consumption on health-related outcomes.

### Effects of advice to drink 8 cups of water per day in adolescents with overweight or obesity: a randomized clinical trial [^117Vi6Uu]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Health care professionals commonly recommend increased water consumption, typically to 8 cups per day, as part of a weight-reducing diet. However, this recommendation is based on limited evidence and virtually no experimental data from the pediatric population.

Objective

To compare 2 standardized weight-loss diets among adolescents with overweight or obesity, either with or without additional advice and behavioral support to increase habitual water intake to 8 cups per day.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical, parallel-group trial was conducted between February 2, 2011, and June 26, 2014, at Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, among 38 adolescents with overweight or obesity who reported drinking 4 cups or less of water per day.

Interventions

All participants in both groups received similar weight-reducing interventions, differentiated by advice about water intake (the water group received advice to increase water intake to 8 cups per day; the control group did not receive such advice) but controlled for other dietary recommendations and treatment intensity. The interventions included dietary counseling, daily text messages, and a cookbook with health guides. To support adherence to 8 cups of water per day, the water group received well-defined messages about water through counseling and daily text messages, a water bottle, and a water pitcher with filters.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 6-month change in body mass index z score. Data analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle.

Results

All 38 participants (27 girls and 11 boys; mean [SD] age, 14.9 [1.7] years) completed the study. Both groups reported drinking approximately 2 cups of water per day at baseline. Self-reported change in water intake at 6 months was greater in the water group (difference from baseline, 2.8 cups per day [95% CI, 1.8 to 3.8]; P < .001) compared with that in the control group (difference from baseline, 1.2 cups per day [95% CI, 0.2 to 2.2]; p = 0.02) (difference between groups, 1.6 cups per day [95% CI, 0.2 to 3.0 cups per day]; p = 0.03). The 6-month change in body mass index z score did not differ between the water group (difference from baseline, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.2 to -0.0]; p = 0.005) and the control group (difference from baseline, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.2 to -0.0]; p = 0.008) (difference between groups, -0.0 [95% CI, -0.1 to 0.1]; p = 0.88).

Conclusions and Relevance

Advice and behavioral supports to consume 8 cups of water per day in the context of a weight-reducing diet did not affect body weight among adolescents with overweight or obesity. Despite intensive behavior supports, few adolescents achieved the target of 8 cups of water per day. Environmental interventions to reduce barriers to water consumption at school may be necessary in future research of the feasibility and effectiveness to achieve the target of an intake of 8 cups of water per day in adolescents.
