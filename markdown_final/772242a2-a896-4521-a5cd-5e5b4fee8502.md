## Question

levothyroxine starting dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the levothyroxine starting dose across populations and scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that dosing must be individualized. Then, I should verify the standard full replacement dose for healthy adults and how to apply it in practice. Next, I will examine dose adjustments for older adults and those with cardiac disease, followed by special populations such as pregnancy, pediatrics, and central hypothyroidism. After that, I need to consider etiology-specific adjustments, including post-thyroidectomy and subclinical hypothyroidism. Finally, I should review monitoring intervals, titration strategy, and practical administration factors that affect absorption and adherence, and close with a concise synthesis of the approach [^113SVBJx] [^114Nf3H5].

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: levothyroxine dosing is not one-size-fits-all and must be tailored to age, weight, etiology, comorbidities, and clinical context, with the overarching goal of restoring euthyroidism while avoiding overtreatment, especially in vulnerable groups [^113SVBJx] [^114Nf3H5].

> Now, I should verify the standard full replacement dose for otherwise healthy, non-elderly adults with overt primary hypothyroidism. The weight-based estimate is approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day of actual body weight, which corresponds to about 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult; wait, let me verify the exact range — several authoritative sources converge on 1.6 mcg/kg/day, with some citing 1.6–1.8 mcg/kg/day, and FDA labeling for multiple brands aligns with this estimate, so 1.6 mcg/kg/day is a safe anchor for most healthy adults without cardiac disease [^114C5Dxo] [^113K4pNY] [^1138vghh] [^112bQCgb].

> Hold on, I should verify how to operationalize this in patients with obesity. Using actual body weight can overestimate dose in obesity; using ideal or lean body mass yields more accurate dosing, and some clinicians apply a BMI correction, but the clearest guidance is to avoid actual-body-weight dosing in obesity and prefer lean or ideal weight approaches, with subsequent titration to TSH guiding the final dose [^112bQCgb] [^111TwKrq].

> Next, I will examine older adults and those with cardiac disease. I need to ensure we start low and go slow to mitigate cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias; typical starting doses are 12.5–25 mcg/day with increments of 12.5–25 mcg every 4–6 weeks, and in elderly patients the full replacement requirement is often less than 1 mcg/kg/day; let me double-check that range — yes, both ATA and FDA labeling consistently endorse 12.5–25 mcg/day starts with slow titration in this group [^114q7F9o] [^113cHb34] [^113K4pNY].

> I should confirm the approach to severe, longstanding hypothyroidism. Even in younger patients, if the hypothyroidism is severe or long-standing, a conservative start of 12.5–25 mcg/day with gradual increases every 2–4 weeks is prudent to avoid precipitating cardiac events; this aligns with FDA guidance and ATA principles for cautious initiation in high-risk presentations [^113K4pNY] [^113SVBJx].

> Let me consider pregnancy, because requirements rise early. As soon as pregnancy is confirmed, total levothyroxine needs typically increase by about 30%, and many clinicians add two extra tablets per week initially while monitoring TSH every 4–6 weeks; trimester-specific TSH targets are first trimester 0.1–2.5 mIU/L, second 0.2–3.0 mIU/L, and third 0.3–3.0 mIU/L; I should double-check that the 30% estimate is guideline-supported — yes, ATA and FDA labeling consistently reflect this increase and monitoring cadence [^111iLSE7] [^115srj1L] [^113K4pNY].

> Now, pediatrics — this is weight-based and age-dependent, and I need to be precise. For congenital hypothyroidism, start at 10–15 mcg/kg/day as soon as possible, aiming to normalize T4 within about 2 weeks; for milder CH or central causes, some experts recommend starting lower, around 10 mcg/kg/day or even 5–10 mcg/kg/day in select contexts, with early reassessment to avoid overtreatment; for older children, the per-kilogram requirement declines with age: 4–6 mcg/kg/day at 1–3 years, 3–5 mcg/kg/day at 3–10 years, and 2–4 mcg/kg/day at 10–16 years; I should confirm these ranges — AAP, Endo-ERN, and ATA pediatric sections align with these figures [^1142QiQz] [^111ufqxq] [^112TfK7L] [^114uw91K] [^115gXwoJ].

> But wait, what if the etiology is central hypothyroidism? I need to ensure I do not rely on TSH to titrate. In secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, the target is to maintain free T4 in the upper half of the reference range, and TSH is unreliable; typical starting doses in adults approximate 1.6 mcg/kg/day in otherwise healthy patients, with lower starts in older or comorbid patients, and pediatric congenital central hypothyroidism often uses the same 10–15 mcg/kg/day urgency to normalize fT4 rapidly; I should confirm that TSH is not used for monitoring in this setting — yes, Endocrine Society and ATA are explicit about using free T4 targets [^115iuzjg] [^112GQShE] [^115j29EV] [^115WqTSu].

> Next, I should review post-thyroidectomy dosing. Many clinicians use 1.6 mcg/kg/day initially, but wait, let me verify whether that truly optimizes first-visit euthyroidism; recent systematic reviews show that only about one-third of patients are euthyroid at the first follow-up regardless of the starting method, and interindividual variability is substantial, so while 1.6–1.8 mcg/kg/day is reasonable, I should anticipate adjustments and consider patient-specific factors like BMI and age in the estimate [^115FtBMw] [^112JatY3] [^1156ZVou].

> I will now examine subclinical hypothyroidism. For TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L without symptoms or high-risk features, observation is reasonable; if treatment is indicated (e.g., symptoms, positive TPOAb, ASCVD risk), lower starting doses of 25–75 mcg/day are typical, with the NEJM TRUST trial using 50 mcg/day (25 mcg if low body weight or CAD) and showing no symptomatic benefit in older adults; I should confirm that lower dosing is guideline-concordant — AACE/ATA supports 25–75 mcg/day based on TSH severity and clinical context [^1141nsSW] [^111zQiJu] [^113KWfGB].

> Let me think about monitoring and titration cadence. After any dose change, recheck TSH (and free T4 if central) in 4–6 weeks, then adjust in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the target is reached; once stable, monitor every 6–12 months, and more frequently with intercurrent changes such as pregnancy, new medications, or weight shifts; I should confirm that this interval is consistent — yes, ATA and FDA labeling endorse 4–6 week checks and 6–12 month surveillance when stable [^111CMEpL] [^113K4pNY].

> Next, I should review administration and absorption, because this materially affects dose requirements. Levothyroxine should be taken consistently fasting, 30–60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime ≥ 3 hours after the last meal, separated by at least 4 hours from calcium, iron, bile acid sequestrants, sucralfate, and some antacids; if repeated TSH elevations occur despite adherence, consider switching to liquid or softgel formulations at the same dose after counseling, as these can improve absorption; I need to ensure I cite the timing and interaction data correctly — ATA and ETA provide convergent guidance here [^114ogLS4] [^112VueCg] [^116NSG5q] [^115BtKGW].

> Hold on, I should verify formulation consistency and potency. Different LT4 products can produce modest TSH shifts even when labeled dose is the same, so if a brand is switched, recheck TSH in 4–6 weeks; maintaining the same product long term improves stability, and FDA potency standards help, but endocrine societies still recommend reassessment after any switch [^117LFNGB] [^111wnznq] [^113YhKa3].

> I need to ensure I address special situations like myxedema coma or severe noncritical illness. In myxedema coma, IV levothyroxine loading of 300–500 mcg followed by 50–100 mcg/day is standard, recognizing IV bioavailability is about 70–80% of oral; in non-critically ill inpatients who cannot take oral medication, IV at about 75% of the oral dose is reasonable, with transition back to oral when feasible; let me double-check the bioavailability estimate — yes, ATA cites approximately 75% equivalence for IV-to-PO conversion in this context [^117FyPDD] [^113Yw7xG] [^115yB7y2].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. For healthy adults with overt primary hypothyroidism, start near 1.6 mcg/kg/day of actual weight, adjusting for obesity by using lean or ideal weight; for older adults or those with cardiac disease, start 12.5–25 mcg/day and titrate slowly; for pregnancy, anticipate a 30% increase early and monitor every 4–6 weeks; for infants with CH, start 10–15 mcg/kg/day and taper the per-kilogram dose with age; for central hypothyroidism, target free T4 in the upper half of normal and ignore TSH; for post-thyroidectomy, 1.6–1.8 mcg/kg/day is reasonable but expect adjustments; for subclinical hypothyroidism, use lower starting doses or observe; always recheck TSH 4–6 weeks after any change and maintain consistent administration and, when possible, the same product [^113SVBJx] [^114C5Dxo] [^111iLSE7] [^1142QiQz] [^115iuzjg] [^115FtBMw] [^111zQiJu] [^111CMEpL] [^114ogLS4] [^117LFNGB].

The levothyroxine starting dose is individualized by age, weight, cardiovascular status, and etiology of hypothyroidism [^113SVBJx]. For **healthy adults**, start at 1.6 mcg/kg/day (about 100–125 mcg for a 70 kg person) [^114C5Dxo] and adjust every 4–6 weeks to normalize TSH [^111CMEpL]. In **elderly or cardiac patients**, begin low (12.5–25 mcg/day) and titrate slowly to avoid ischemia or arrhythmias [^112SsTzk] [^113cHb34]. For **pregnancy**, increase the total dose by 30% immediately and monitor TSH every 4 weeks [^111iLSE7]. For **neonates with congenital hypothyroidism**, start at 10–15 mcg/kg/day and adjust based on TSH and free T4 [^1142QiQz]. Always titrate to TSH in primary hypothyroidism and to free T4 in central hypothyroidism [^111CMEpL] [^112GQShE].

---

## General principles for levothyroxine dosing

- **Individualization**: Dosing must consider age, weight, cardiovascular status, etiology, and comorbidities [^113SVBJx].
- **Titration**: Adjust to normalize TSH in primary hypothyroidism and free T4 in central hypothyroidism [^111CMEpL] [^112GQShE].
- **Monitoring**: Recheck TSH or free T4 4–6 weeks after any change [^111CMEpL].

## Standard starting doses for adults

| **Clinical scenario** | **Starting dose** | **Titration** |
|-|-|-|
| Healthy adults (< 50 years, no cardiac disease) | 1.6 mcg/kg/day (≈ 100–125 mcg for 70 kg) | Adjust by 12.5–25 mcg every 4–6 weeks until TSH normalizes [^114C5Dxo] [^111CMEpL] |
| Elderly or cardiac patients | 12.5–25 mcg/day | Increase by 12.5–25 mcg every 6–8 weeks; slower if cardiac symptoms occur [^114q7F9o] [^113cHb34] |
| Severe longstanding hypothyroidism | 12.5–25 mcg/day | Increase by 12.5–25 mcg every 2–4 weeks until TSH normalizes [^114C5Dxo] |

---

## Special populations and clinical scenarios

### Pregnancy

Pre-existing hypothyroidism: **increase total dose by 30% immediately** and monitor TSH every 4 weeks [^111iLSE7]. New-onset hypothyroidism: start at **1.6 mcg/kg/day** if moderate to severe; use **1.0 mcg/kg/day** if TSH < 10 mIU/L [^115srj1L].

---

### Pediatric patients

- **Neonates (congenital hypothyroidism)**: 10–15 mcg/kg/day; adjust to TSH and free T4 [^1142QiQz].
- **Infants and children**: Dose decreases with age; use weight-based dosing and adjust to TSH and free T4 [^115gXwoJ].
- **Adolescents**: 2–4 mcg/kg/day; transition to adult dosing after puberty [^115gXwoJ].

---

### Central hypothyroidism

In central hypothyroidism, **secondary/tertiary hypothyroidism** should be dosed to keep free T4 in the upper half of normal; TSH is unreliable for monitoring [^112GQShE].

---

## Factors influencing levothyroxine dosing

- **Age**: Older patients need lower doses due to reduced metabolism [^112mkg6D].
- **Body weight**: Obesity may require lower per-kg dosing; consider ideal or lean body weight [^112bQCgb].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Start low and titrate slowly to avoid ischemia or arrhythmias [^112SsTzk].
- **Drug interactions**: Calcium, iron, PPIs, and some foods reduce absorption; separate by at least 4 hours [^115BtKGW].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks of improper dosing

Improper dosing can cause **significant morbidity**. Undertreatment leads to persistent hypothyroid symptoms, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular risk [^115sf9qz], whereas overtreatment increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and fractures, especially in older adults [^notfound]. Close monitoring and careful titration are essential to balance efficacy and safety [^111CMEpL].

## Levothyroxine starting doses

| **Population** | **Starting dose** | **Titration** |
|-|-|-|
| Healthy adults | 1.6 mcg/kg/day | 12.5–25 mcg every 4–6 weeks |
| Elderly/cardiac | 12.5–25 mcg/day | 12.5–25 mcg every 6–8 weeks |
| Pregnancy | +30% dose immediately | TSH every 4 weeks |
| Neonates | 10–15 mcg/kg/day | Adjust to TSH/free T4 |
| Central hypothyroidism | Dose to normalize free T4 | Adjust to free T4 |

---

Levothyroxine dosing should be **individualized and titrated to biochemical targets**, with attention to age, weight, cardiovascular status, and comorbidities to optimize outcomes and minimize risks [^113SVBJx].

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

Levothyroxine therapy in specific subpopulations — elderly with hypothyroidism (Recommendation 6a) states that, in general, levothyroxine should be initiated with low doses, and the dose titrated slowly based on serum thyrotropin (TSH) measurements, and it should be recognized that normal serum thyrotropin ranges are higher in older populations (such as those over 65 years), and that higher serum thyrotropin targets may be appropriate. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^111CMEpL]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine dosing and monitoring — primary hypothyroidism: Except in secondary (central) hypothyroidism, dose titration is guided by serum thyrotropin (TSH), with the "target TSH typically being 0.5 to 3.5 or 4 mIU/L". "Dose adjustments are usually made 4–6 weeks after initiating therapy", typically in increments of "12.5–25 μg/d", and "the serum TSH is then repeated in 4–6 weeks, until the TSH target has been reached". Ongoing monitoring is advised as "serum TSH should be measured in 4–6 months and then at 12 months to assure stability". In patients with coronary artery disease, initiation should be conservative: "Patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) should always be started on a low LT4 dose (12.5–25 μg/d), with gradual increases based on symptoms and serum TSH levels".

### Thyroid hormone therapy for older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism [^1141nsSW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

The use of levothyroxine to treat subclinical hypothyroidism is controversial. We aimed to determine whether levothyroxine provided clinical benefits in older persons with this condition.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving 737 adults who were at least 65 years of age and who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism (thyrotropin level, 4.60 to 19.99 mIU per liter; free thyroxine level within the reference range). A total of 368 patients were assigned to receive levothyroxine (at a starting dose of 50 μg daily, or 25 μg if the body weight was < 50 kg or the patient had coronary heart disease), with dose adjustment according to the thyrotropin level; 369 patients were assigned to receive placebo with mock dose adjustment. The two primary outcomes were the change in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score and Tiredness score on a thyroid-related quality-of-life questionnaire at 1 year (range of each scale is 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more symptoms or tiredness, respectively; minimum clinically important difference, 9 points).

Results

The mean age of the patients was 74.4 years, and 396 patients (53.7%) were women. The mean (± SD) thyrotropin level was 6.40 ± 2.01 mIU per liter at baseline; at 1 year, this level had decreased to 5.48 mIU per liter in the placebo group, as compared with 3.63 mIU per liter in the levothyroxine group (P < 0.001), at a median dose of 50 μg. We found no differences in the mean change at 1 year in the Hypothyroid Symptoms score (0.2 ± 15.3 in the placebo group and 0.2 ± 14.4 in the levothyroxine group; between-group difference, 0.0; 95% confidence interval, -2.0 to 2.1) or the Tiredness score (3.2 ± 17.7 and 3.8 ± 18.4, respectively; between-group difference, 0.4; 95% CI, -2.1 to 2.9). No beneficial effects of levothyroxine were seen on secondary-outcome measures. There was no significant excess of serious adverse events prespecified as being of special interest.

Conclusions

Levothyroxine provided no apparent benefits in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism. (Funded by European Union FP7 and others; TRUST ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01660126 .).

Levothyroxine therapy in nonadherence — If prescription of daily levothyroxine is not successful in maintaining a normal serum thyrotropin, weekly oral administration of the full week's dose of levothyroxine should be considered in individuals in whom adherence cannot otherwise be sustained. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^117Tv9cU]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^111iLSE7]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy — levothyroxine therapy for overt hypothyroidism should be titrated to trimester-specific thyrotropin targets, with serial serum thyrotropin assessed every 4 weeks during the first half of pregnancy and reassessed during the second half; for women already taking levothyroxine, two additional doses per week (one extra dose twice weekly with several days separation) may be started as soon as pregnancy is confirmed; Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Trimester thyrotropin reference ranges are provided as 0.1–2.5 mIU/L (first), 0.2–3.0 mIU/L (second), and 0.3–3.0 mIU/L (third). Thyroid function should be monitored every 4–6 weeks at least for the first and second trimesters and also reassessed during the third trimester, and up to 70% of women will require adjustments of 30% or more from the preconception dose.

Infants with overt hypothyroidism — levothyroxine should be started at 10–15 μg/kg/d once newborn screening is positive, with higher doses for severe congenital hypothyroidism; the aim is to keep serum thyroxine in the upper half of the reference range and thyrotropin in the mid to lower half of the pediatric reference range, target normalization of serum thyroxine approximately 2 weeks after starting therapy, and perform surveillance testing every 1 to 2 months during the first year with decreasing frequency thereafter. Strong recommendation. High-quality evidence.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^115gXwoJ]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with "newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete". In CH, "standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d", and "Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses < 8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks". Targets are to "keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L". For follow-up, "surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life", and "For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated". For possible transient CH, "For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable", and permanence is confirmed if on "repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy" the "TSH rises and the T4 decreases". Formulation and interactions are important: "Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided", and "Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided". In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, "the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH".

### Levothyroxine [^114hSafJ]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Newborns

The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10–15 mcg/kg/day. A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg/day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4–6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment. In infants with very low (< 5 mcg/dL) or undetectable serum T4 concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium.

Infants and Children

Levothyroxine therapy is usually initiated at full replacement doses, with the recommended dose per body weight decreasing with age (see TABLE 3). However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2–4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.

Hyperactivity in an older child can be minimized if the starting dose is one-fourth of the recommended full replacement dose, and the dose is then increased on a weekly basis by an amount equal to one-fourth the full-recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy, timing of dosing, ETA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer levothyroxine in accordance with the patient's lifestyle, ensuring an interval of at least 30 minutes between the drug and food or drink intake. Administer levothyroxine consistently either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime, ≥ 3 hours after the evening meal, for optimal therapeutic efficacy.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^115FtBMw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Taking together the reported findings, the current guideline recommendation of a standard 1.6 µg/kg LT4 dose does not appear to be fully supported by evidence.

According to the study aim, the results of the present systematic review show that just above one-third of athyreotic patients have normal TSH at their first postsurgery follow-up independently of the strategy used to decide the LT4 starting dose. Despite LT4 therapy being a well-established and safe treatment, achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy follow-up remains challenging. Although some differences in terms of euthyroidism rates were reached, previously tested dosing strategies ranging from very simple ones to rather complex algorithms do not fully account for interindividual variability, underscoring the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach. Further investigation is needed to uncover these factors and develop more precise, individualized dosing algorithms to improve postthyroidectomy management. Future well-controlled and adequately sized prospective studies specifically designed to address this issue should take into account specific participant eligibility criteria including age, BMI, body composition, underlying thyroid disorders, concomitant therapies, causes of malabsorption, comorbidities, and patient compliance.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^115MxVGg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

### Should the levothyroxine starting dose be tailored to disease severity in neonates with congenital hypothyroidism? [^113wst2w]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Early levothyroxine treatment is crucial to minimize neurocognitive impairment associated with congenital hypothyroidism. In this Practice Point commentary, I discuss the findings, implications, and limitations of the study of Mathai et al. in which neonates with congenital hypothyroidism were treated with variable initial doses of levothyroxine. A high initial levothyroxine dose was used for newborn babies with athyreosis, an intermediate dose for those with ectopic glands, and a low dose for those with dyshormonogenesis. Serum free T(4) levels normalized within 2 weeks, but serum TSH levels within up to 4 weeks. A dose adjustment (mostly a dose reduction) was required in about half of the neonates in the first 2 weeks of life. As Mathai et al. carried out no neuropsychological tests, we do not know if their approach has a more beneficial effect on neurocognitive outcomes than other treatment strategies. Nevertheless, as tailoring the levothyroxine dose to severity rapidly normalized serum free T(4) levels, one would predict a beneficial effect of this approach on neurocognitive outcome.

Intervention

The investigational medicinal products are levothyroxine sodium (T4) as 25 or 50 microgram tablets for oral administration and a matching placebo. All tablets are white and round in shape with the strength imprinted, identically packaged in blisters and packed in plain cardboard cartons to maintain study blinding. Participants are advised to take the suggested dose of study medication once daily half an hour before breakfast.

The intervention group will start with levothyroxine 50 micrograms daily (25 micrograms in participants with < 50 kg body weight or with a history of coronary heart disease) and the control group with matching placebo for six to 8 weeks.

After 6–8 weeks a venous blood sample is taken for TSH assessment. Based on the TSH results, the data centre advises the new dose of study medication or placebo to the clinical investigators.
If TSH < 0.4 mU/L: the treatment dose is reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – effected by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose. These participants will have a further TSH check after 6–8 weeks. If TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L participant will be withdrawn from randomised treatment and referred to usual care.
If TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose.
If TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): 25 micrograms of levothyroxine will be added. Giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

### Levothyroxine [^113cHb34]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Caution should be exercised when administering Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, to the elderly, and to those with concomitant adrenal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS).

Specific Patient Populations:

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6–8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4–6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1156ZVou]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Total thyroidectomy requires lifelong replacement therapy with levothyroxine (LT4). Achieving optimal thyroid hormones replacement promptly after surgery is important but somehow challenging. Indeed, previous studies addressing this topic clearly indicate that a significant proportion of patients who are started on LT4 therapy for postthyroidectomy hypothyroidism require multiple dose adjustments over time. The clinical scenario is thus how we should choose the starting LT4 dose in patients just after total thyroidectomy to warrant the highest rate of euthyroidism at the first postsurgery evaluation. While initial investigations used fixed LT4 doses, revised and eventually adjusted at early follow-up, more recent studies propose potential tailored approaches to more precisely estimate the optimal LT4 dose. Current clinical guidelines on the treatment of primary hypothyroidism recommend that when choosing a starting dose of LT4, several factors including patient's weight, lean body mass, etiology of hypothyroidism, degree of thyrotropin elevation, age, and comorbidities (ie, particularly cardiac diseases) should all be taken into account. Most papers suggest that in athyreotic patients, a starting LT4 dose of 1.6 to 1.8 mcg/kg of body weight would be adequate, even though other authors have advocated for a higher starting dose of 2.0 to 2.1 mcg/kg, at least in selected settings.

There is general agreement that the etiology sustaining hypothyroidism impacts on the optimal LT4 dose, making athyreotic patients, owing to the lack of residual functional thyroid tissue, more likely to require a higher LT4 dose as compared to patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Furthermore, the therapeutic target of TSH may vary in relation to the underlying condition, such as in patients with thyroid cancer who may require higher LT4 doses (ie, TSH-suppressive therapy). In addition, from the patient's standpoint, promptly achieving euthyroidism can provide clinical benefits in terms of both well-being and reduction of further clinical consultations. Although the number of studies in this field is significant, no clear and solid information is available about the optimal LT4 starting dose to be used in athyreotic subjects with no (or at least minor) need for further adjustment over time.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^112nYLHB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Conduct of Review

The present systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (ID 1061048). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in reporting this study (Supplemental Material 1).

Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases. The search aimed to identify studies reporting the proportion of "euthyroid" patients at their first follow-up after thyroidectomy and the strategy employed to estimate the LT4 starting dose. Euthyroid patients were defined as those with TSH levels within the target range specified in each article. For benign diseases, a higher TSH range was used, whereas for malignant conditions, risk-stratified TSH targets were applied. The search was restricted to articles published in English from January 1, 2000, to October 30, 2024. The online search was conducted by the following algorithm: [(levothyroxine) or (L-thyroxine) or (LT4)] and [(thyroidectomy) or (athyreotic)] and (dose). In the attempt to expand the search, references in the retrieved articles were also screened to identify additional studies.

Study Selection

The inclusion criteria were original studies reporting the number of patients achieving euthyroidism at the first postthyroidectomy evaluation and the criteria used to prescribe the initial LT4 dose. Exclusion criteria were studies lacking data on postthyroidectomy follow-up or underlying thyroid pathology, review articles, and outdated publications. Two independent researchers (I.C. P.C.) screened titles and abstracts based on these criteria. Subsequently, all authors independently reviewed the full text of eligible articles to confirm their inclusion in the final analysis.

Data Extraction

For each included study, the following information was extracted independently by 2 investigators (I.C. P.C.) in a piloted form: (1) study details (authors, publication year, and country of origin); (2) patient demographics [median age, body mass index (BMI), and sex]; (3) underlying thyroid pathology (benign or malignant); (4) LT4 dosing method; (5) follow-up data for the first and second postthyroidectomy controls. Extracted data were cross-checked for accuracy, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. When studies included 2 (or more) different populations according to the LT4 dosing strategy employed, they were reported as separate series.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^116GLqG2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH < 0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^111esriY]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6–8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4–6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5–25 mcg/day with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2–4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.

In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^114C5Dxo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVO-T is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVO-T may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVO-T dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVO-T dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: joint British thyroid association / society for endocrinology consensus statement [^1155V2B7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focussed on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasises several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimised aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, a trial of liothyronine/levothyroxine combined therapy may be warranted. The decision to start treatment with liothyronine should be a shared decision between patient and clinician. However, individual clinicians should not feel obliged to start liothyronine or to continue liothyronine medication provided by other health care practitioners or accessed without medical advice, if they judge this not to be in the patient's best interest.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^111TwKrq]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association guideline — levothyroxine (LT4) dose requirements and modifiers are summarized as follows: Based on body weight, hypothyroid patients with minimal endogenous thyroid function require LT4 doses of 1.6–1.8 µg/kg of actual body weight, with some studies estimating 2.0–2.1 µg/kg for some patient groups, and LT4 doses in thyroid cancer patients requiring thyrotropin (TSH) suppression are on the order of 2.1–2.7 µg/kg. Ideal body weight is reported as a better predictor of LT4 dose than actual body weight, women treated for hypothyroidism typically require an increase in LT4 dose early in the first trimester of pregnancy, and LT4 replacement doses tend to decrease with age when titrated based on serum TSH; the presence of the type 2 deiodinase gene (DIO2) Thr92Ala polymorphism has produced inconsistent findings.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^11318eHv]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism — levothyroxine replacement goals in primary hypothyroidism are as follows: Levothyroxine replacement therapy has three main goals. These are (i) to provide resolution of the patients' symptoms and hypothyroid signs, including biological and physiologic markers of hypothyroidism, (ii) to achieve normalization of serum thyrotropin (TSH) with improvement in thyroid hormone concentrations, and (iii) to avoid overtreatment (iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis), especially in the elderly. The goals of LT4 replacement in primary hypothyroidism are to achieve a state of euthyroidism and normalization of the circulating levels of TSH and thyroid hormones, with euthyroidism defined as the normalization of indices of thyroid hormone action and the absence or the regression of symptoms and clinical signs associated with hypothyroidism. The lack of specificity of hypothyroid symptoms and signs, and particularly in autoimmune thyroid disease, renders difficult the assessment of the adequacy of the replacement therapy on a purely clinical basis. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients are unable to detect differences in symptoms when the LT4 dose is changed by approximately 20%, although such a change was sufficient to modify cholesterol levels. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence.

### Does initial dosing of levothyroxine in infants with congenital hypothyroidism lead to frequent dose adjustments secondary to iatrogenic hyperthyroidism on follow-up? [^115KeymG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common preventable cause of intellectual disability. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine (LT4) is between 10 and 15 μg/kg, an extremely wide range. We hypothesized that a sizable proportion of newborns treated for CH at the higher end of the dosage range become biochemically hyperthyroid at a follow-up visit.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of infants with CH between 2002 and 2012.

Results

Of the 104 patients included in this analysis, the average age at diagnosis was 11 days and the average starting dose of LT4 was 12 ± 2.5 μg/kg. At follow-up, 36.5% required a dose reduction because of iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia, 51% required no dose adjustment and 12.5% required a dose increase due to an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The starting doses of LT4 for those requiring a dose reduction, those not requiring an adjustment and those requiring an increase in the dose were 13.2 ± 2.4, 11.5 ± 2.1 and 10.3 ± 2.6 μg/kg/day, respectively (p ≤ 0.0001). Of the 34% of infants treated with an initial dose of > 12.5 μg/day, 57.1% required a dose reduction at follow-up, compared to 26.1% of those whose initial starting dose was ≤ 12.5 μg/kg/day (p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Following the guidelines for initiating therapy for CH, 36.5% of the infants required a dose reduction for iatrogenic hyperthyroxinemia. These infants received a higher dose of LT4 than the infants who either required no adjustment or required an increase in the dose. A narrower range for initial dosing in CH may be appropriate.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Euthyrox) [^113K4pNY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of EUTHYROX is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of EUTHYROX dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 (L-thyroxine) level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate EUTHYROX dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^112zyx7M]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

General Principles

In general, levothyroxine therapy should be instituted at full replacement doses as soon as possible. Delays in diagnosis and institution of therapy may have deleterious effects on the child's intellectual and physical growth and development.

Undertreatment and overtreatment should be avoided (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

LEVOTHROID®may be administered to infants and children who cannot swallow intact tablets by crushing the tablet and suspending the freshly crushed tablet in a small amount (5–10 mL or 1–2 teaspoons) of water. This suspension can be administered by spoon or dropper. DO NOT STORE THE SUSPENSION. Foods that decrease absorption of levothyroxine, such as soybean infant formula, should not be used for administering levothyroxine sodium tablets (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug-Food Interactions).

Newborns

The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in newborn infants is 10–15 mcg/kg/day. A lower starting dose (e.g., 25 mcg/day) should be considered in infants at risk for cardiac failure, and the dose should be increased in 4–6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response to treatment. In infants with very low (< 5 mcg/dL) or undetectable serum T4concentrations, the recommended initial starting dose is 50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium.

Infants and Children

Levothyroxine therapy is usually initiated at full replacement doses, with the recommended dose per body weight decreasing with age (see Table 3). However, in children with chronic or severe hypothyroidism, an initial dose of 25 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended with increments of 25 mcg every 2–4 weeks until the desired effect is achieved.

Hyperactivity in an older child can be minimized if the starting dose is one-fourth of the recommended full replacement dose, and the dose is then increased on a weekly basis by an amount equal to one-fourth the full-recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine requirements (see Pregnancy).

Subclinical Hypothyroidism

If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg/kg/day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level. Patients who are not treated should be monitored yearly for changes in clinical status and thyroid laboratory parameters.

Blinding

Participants are blinded to treatment allocation by using matching tablets and packaging for levothyroxine and placebo. All study personnel remain blinded for the duration of the trial through remote analysis of laboratory results of TSH in the data centre, ensuring the trial stays double blinded. GPs will remain blinded to treatment allocation and TSH tests unless otherwise required in the event of an emergency medical situation. An Interactive Voice Response System at the data centre allows for individual emergency allocation information to be released to an unblinded study physician through 24-h telephone access. All participants will learn the treatment allocation within 15 working days of receiving the final visit and completing all the data to aid in any further treatment decisions with the GP.

All laboratory tests for TSH and fT4 are performed at the local GP and clinical laboratories. The results in the treatment phase are uploaded to the independent data centre which in turn advises the study site on dose titration through the dedicated trial web portal. The study team remains unaware of the results of the thyroid function testing. Additionally, all cooperating GPs were asked to refrain from additional thyroid function measurements to ensure adequate blinding.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1 Dosage

An initial intravenous loading dose of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection between 300 to 500 mcg, followed by once daily intravenous maintenance doses between 50 and 100 mcg, should be administered, as clinically indicated, until the patient can tolerate oral therapy. The age, general physical condition, cardiac risk factors, and clinical severity of myxedema and duration of myxedema symptoms should be considered when determining the starting and maintenance dosages of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection.

Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection produces a gradual increase in the circulating concentrations of the hormone with an approximate half-life of 9 to 10 days in hypothyroid patients. Daily administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection should be maintained until the patient is capable of tolerating an oral dose and is clinically stable. For chronic treatment of hypothyroidism, an oral dosage form of levothyroxine should be used to maintain a euthyroid state. Relative bioavailability between Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection and oral levothyroxine products has not been established. Based on medical practice, the relative bioavailability between oral and intravenous administration of Levothyroxine Sodium for Injection is estimated to be from 48 to 74%. Due to differences in absorption characteristics of patients and the oral levothyroxine product formulations, TSH and thyroid hormone levels should be measured a few weeks after initiating oral levothyroxine and dose adjusted accordingly.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

The guideline presents the latest data regarding combination therapy, liothyronine (LT3) monotherapy, compounded thyroid hormone products, and nutraceuticals, with a secondary objective to review thyroid hormone analogs; it states that subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is not addressed other than in the pediatric population and that thyroid hormone therapy in thyroid cancer is mentioned only if germane. The target audience is clinicians providing care to patients with hypothyroidism, and it is not the intent of these guidelines to replace clinical judgment or individual decision-making, as the recommendations are intended to inform clinicians considering management choices.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113yC48n]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment.

Methods

Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force.

Results

We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones.

Conclusions

We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.

Diverse causes potentially underlie decreased quality of life in biochemically euthyroid patients treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Once these contributing factors are addressed, if symptoms persist, there may be benefit to personalized use of combination therapy adding liothyronine. This approach should be carefully monitored: avoiding overtreatment and ensuring that therapy is only continued if it improves patient-reported quality of life. Most randomized clinical trials have not shown benefits, perhaps because of not targeting the most symptomatic patients. Sustained-release liothyronine preparations may soon be available for optimally designed studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism in select patients.

Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism

The recommended daily dose of LEVO-T in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start LEVO-T at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns (0–3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Newborns (0–3 months) at risk for cardiac failure: Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Children at risk for hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in children, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: LEVO-T dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of LEVO-T by 12.5 to 25 mcg/day and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable LEVO-T dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce LEVO-T dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure LEVO-T dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH < 10 IU per liter) start LEVO-T at 1.0 mcg per kg body weight per day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust LEVO-T dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Congenital hypothyroidism: developmental outcome in relation to levothyroxine treatment variables [^113mC7kH]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Neonatal screening programs for congenital hypothyroidism (CH) were initiated in the 1970s to ensure early treatment in order to prevent mental retardation. With screening, developmental prognosis is considerably improved, but follow-up studies still report developmental delay compared to controls. To explain the delay, most studies have focused on effects of CH severity, supposedly caused by prenatal hypothyroidism. Nonoptimal treatment could also be an explanatory factor. Treatment guidelines have changed; now, a higher levothyroxine starting dose is recommended. In this review, we first summarize outcome studies in CH versus controls and in mild versus severe CH. Second, we report results on the association between levothyroxine treatment variables and developmental outcome. Six research groups have reported results on the association between levothyroxine starting dose and intelligence, and eight groups on the association between circulating thyroid hormones and intelligence. Most studies found a positive association between a high level of treatment, primarily treatment during the first year and later intelligence. However, negative associations between high-dose treatment and outcome have been reported, and the question of optimal treatment in relation to developmental outcome has not been answered.

### Outcomes and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypothyroidism: a retrospective analysis [^115dhZGJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in cancer treatment cause immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), including thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism. The management and outcomes of this irAE are not well established.

Objective

The purpose of this analysis is to describe the onset, management, and outcomes of patients experiencing hypothyroidism from ICI.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted of adults receiving ICI therapy at a community cancer center between January 1, 2017, and February 1, 2020. The primary endpoint was to describe onset (timing) of hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] > 10 µIU/mL). Secondary outcomes included describing hypothyroidism symptoms and levothyroxine use, time to documented disease progression, and occurrence of additional adverse effects (AEs).

Results

Of the 200 patients included in the study, 19% developed clinical hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 µIU/mL, or required initiation of or dose increase in levothyroxine). Median time to TSH higher than 10 µIU/mL was 13.3 weeks and symptoms of hypothyroidism occurred in 34% of patients developing clinical hypothyroidism. The median final daily levothyroxine dose was 88 mcg (0.88 mcg/kg). Time to disease progression was longer in those with clinical hypothyroidism (27.4 months vs. 6.8 months, respectively, P = .015). Additional AEs occurred in 68% of those developing hypothyroidism versus 49% without hypothyroidism (P = .029).

Conclusion and Relevance

Patients with clinical hypothyroidism during ICI treatment may have improved cancer outcomes, but they also are more likely to develop other AEs. Patients requiring thyroid replacement therapy with levothyroxine may benefit from a starting dose between 50 and 100 mcg/day, approximately 0.88 mcg/kg/day.

This study was undertaken to systematically review the literature for achieving more robust evidence on the optimal LT4 dose to be prescribed to athyreotic patients just after total thyroidectomy. The primary outcome was to assess the proportion of patients who achieve euthyroidism under the initial LT4 dose. Secondary outcomes include comparing different dose-choosing methods and stratifying results by patient setting, which may require specific TSH targets.

American Thyroid Association — acquired pediatric hypothyroidism and OHI are managed primarily with levothyroxine. "Autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism; it is more common in females compared to males, and the incidence increases during adolescence". Severe cases may present with "TSH values > 1000 mIU/L". For OHI, "LT4 replacement therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with OHI with the dose adjusted for weight or body surface area", using age bands where "The LT4 dose for patients 1–3 years of age is 4–6 μg/kg/d, for patients 3–10 years the LT4 dose is 3–5 μg/kg/d, and for patients 10–16 years the LT4 dose is 2–4 μg/kg/d", and "LT4 may also be dosed based on body surface area calculated at 100 μg/m2/d". Expectations should be realistic because "Reduction in pretreatment weight should not be presumed with initiation of LT4 replacement therapy".

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^117LFNGB]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) potency, substitution, and monitoring — recommendations and cautions: Since 2007 the FDA has required that LT4 preparations maintain 95%–105% of their stated potency, revised from a prior requirement of 90%–110%, throughout their shelf life, and has required that all LT4 products be reassessed as though they were new drugs. When a generic or branded LT4 meets these criteria, the FDA has determined that preparations can be substituted by the pharmacy unless dispensed as written. The three endocrine societies recommend repeat thyroid function testing when a patient is switched from one LT4 preparation to another to ensure that the goal TSH and FT4 and T3 concentrations are achieved, and it is recommended that, once the therapeutic target is reached, the patient should remain on the same medication and, if possible, on the same dose and preparation of medication to the extent possible. It seems reasonable to keep a patient on a given product and, if a change is necessary, TSH levels should be rechecked; in patients with thyroid cancer, it is important to maintain LT4 product stability when a desired goal TSH is relevant for possible disease recurrence or progression.

### Levothyroxine monotherapy: what works better for the individual with hypothyroidism? [^114gSiVd]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

I explore objective data not supporting the addition of liothyronine (medication) (LT3) to levothyroxine (medication) (LT4) in patients with hypothyroidism. Accurate identification of patients with symptomatic (almost exclusively overt) hypothyroidism is important in evaluating clinical outcomes of therapies. Recent studies have documented that nearly a third of individuals who are offered thyroid hormone are euthyroid at the time of initiation. Additionally, others are clinically diagnosed without biochemical confirmation, so a sizable proportion of those started on LT4 are not hypothyroid. The assumption that nonhypothyroid symptoms will resolve with LT4 is problematic. The true underlying cause of these symptoms remains unidentified and untreated.

Methods

In a narrative fashion I will review the positive predictive value of and correlation of symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and confirmed hypothyroidism likely to favorably respond to thyroid hormone replacement.

Results

Following a review of the reliability of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in predicting a euthyroid state, the correlation of circulating triiodothyronine (serum measurement) (T3) levels with symptoms and predictive value of T3 to forecast the outcome of adding LT3 to LT4 will be reviewed. The utility of striving for high, middle, or low TSH set points within the expected range to predict changes in clinical quality of life and the ability of blinded patients to sense subtle differences along this spectrum will be documented. In addition, the clinical impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the type 2 deiodinase gene will be reviewed. Finally, the overall satisfaction of selected patients with their thyroid hormone treatments will be outlined and preferences for T3-containing treatments from blinded studies will be summarized.

Conclusion

Basing thyroid hormone treatment decisions on patient symptoms likely results in missed diagnoses We should encourage primary care physicians to assess a differential diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses, and not assume a thyroid etiology when TSH is normal. Modifying treatment to a particular TSH target or adjusting based on a low T3 level does not seem to enhance patient outcomes. Finally, pending further trials of "symptomatic" participants, using sustained release LT3 to mimic normal physiology, and including monocarboxylate 10 transporter and Type 2 deiodinase polymorphisms and objective outcomes, I will continue to depend on therapy with LT4 monotherapy and seek alternative explanations for my patients' nonspecific symptoms.

### Levothyroxine dosing in older adults: recommendations derived from the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging [^112mkg6D]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

As thyroid hormone metabolism slows with advancing age, treatment dosing requirements change. Guidelines recommend titration from a low starting dose for older adults with hypothyroidism while providing weight-based estimates for younger populations. However, rapid replacement may be appropriate with acute onset of overt hypothyroidism. Therefore, a weight-based recommendation specific to older adults is needed.

Methods

We determined mean levothyroxine dose using actual and ideal body weight (IBW) ratios for the outcome of euthyroid on therapy relative to assay-specific and proposed age-specific ranges for independently living participants aged ≥ 65 years in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We examined risk factors to identify those at highest risk of overtreatment using regression analyses adjusted for potential covariables and clustering to account for multiple visits per individual.

Results

One hundred eighty-five participants aged ≥ 65 years were on levothyroxine at 645 eligible visits. At euthyroid visits, participants were on an average dose of 1.09 μg/kg (1.35 μg/kg IBW), with 84% of euthyroid individuals on a dose of < 1.6 μg/kg. Average euthyroid dose did not differ by sex using either actual body weight (ABW) or IBW. For obese individuals, mean euthyroid dose was lower if calculated using ABW (0.9 μg/kg vs 1.14 μg/kg; P < .01) but similar if calculated using IBW (1.42 vs 1.32 μg/kg IBW; p = 0.41) compared with those with a body mass index of < 30.

Conclusion

Thyroid hormone dose per body weight estimates for replacement in older adults (1.09 μg/kg ABW or 1.35 μg/kg IBW) are one-third lower than current weight-based dose recommendations for younger populations.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: long-term growth and intellectual outcomes with a lower initial levothyroxine dose [^113bWJ5g]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is known as the most common cause of preventable neurodevelopmental dysfunction in neonates. If not treated, CH children experience severe growth retardation and developmental delay. Since the 1950s, Levothyroxine, a synthetic form of thyroid hormone, has been established as the standard treatment to normalise thyroid hormone levels and prevent morbidities in children with CH.

Most centres follow the guidelines on CH suggested by the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP), emphasising the importance of early screening and adequate treatment with Levothyroxine. Constant updates in the guidelines, especially according to the recently updated version by the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, also recommend commencing the treatment as soon as the CH is diagnosed, with an initial daily dose of Levothyroxine from 10 to 15 mcg/kg. Earlier studies reported concerns regarding early overtreatment, suggesting potential long‐term neurocognitive adverse effects such as ADHD and metabolic consequences. There also is a trend toward reconsidering the Levothyroxine dose with some studies suggesting that lower doses may be sufficient in the treatment of CH. Laura Niuro et al. even claimed that 2‐year growth outcomes among 6.8, 7.4, and 10.8 mcg/kg Levothyroxine dose groups all fall within normal ranges. Similarly, Shan He et al. recommended tailoring the initial dose based on pretreatment TSH levels, suggesting that CH children with milder biochemical abnormalities may not require higher doses.

Despite these discussions, a long‐term study evaluating growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes of CH children initially treated with a lower Levothyroxine dose is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the long‐term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with CH, focusing on the influence of a lower initial dose of Levothyroxine compared to current recommendations.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112SsTzk]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) replacement therapy — co-existent medical conditions: We recommend considering patients' underlying medical conditions (such as atherosclerotic heart disease) in order to establish realistic treatment goals and avoid exacerbation of underlying comorbidities. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence. Renal and liver disease. There are no adjustments in LT4 dosing that are required in cases of cirrhosis or renal failure. Nephrotic syndrome, with its large urinary protein losses that include the thyroid hormone transport proteins TBG, transthyretine and albumin, can be a cause of increased LT4 requirements due to excessive urinary thyroid hormone losses. Cardiac disease. Thyroid hormone therapy, with its inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, is a potential cause of angina in patients with severe CAD. This is the reason for starting patients with low doses of LT4, and increasing the dose slowly, while monitoring for the development of angina or other cardiac symptoms such as tachyarrhythmias. Gastrointestinal disease. See recommendation 3c for discussion of gastritis, celiac disease, and intestinal by-pass surgery.

Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism

The recommended daily dose of EUTHYROX in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start EUTHYROX at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure:

Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity:

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: EUTHYROX dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of EUTHYROX by 12.5 mcg daily to 25 mcg daily and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable EUTHYROX dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce EUTHYROX dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure EUTHYROX dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH less than 10 mIU per liter) start EUTHYROX at 1 mcg per kg body weight per day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust EUTHYROX dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

The dose of EUTHYROX should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require a EUTHYROX dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day, depending on the target level for TSH suppression.

Dosage and Adminitration

General Principles:

The goal of replacement therapy is to achieve and maintain a clinical and biochemical euthyroid state. The goal of suppressive therapy is to inhibit growth and/or function of abnormal thyroid tissue. The dose of Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP that is adequate to achieve these goals depends on a variety of factors including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions, including pregnancy, concomitant medications, and the specific nature of the condition being treated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Hence, the following recommendations serve only as dosing guidelines. Dosing must be individualized and adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, at least one-half hour to one hour before any food is eaten. Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP should be taken at least 4 hours apart from drugs that are known to interfere with its absorption (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Due to the long half-life of levothyroxine, the peak therapeutic effect at a given dose of levothyroxine sodium may not be attained for 4–6 weeks.

2.3 Recommended Dosage and Titration

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults

The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

* Dosages greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily dosages greater than 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure

Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached.

Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients

For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range.

The recommended daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pregnant patients is described in Table 3.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients

The SYNTHROID dosage is based on the target level of TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer.

Levothyroxine administration timing with meals and beverages — recommendation and absorption effects: Because co‑administration of food and levothyroxine is likely to impair levothyroxine absorption, we recommend that, if possible, levothyroxine be consistently taken either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime (3 or more hours after the evening meal) for optimal, consistent absorption. Weak recommendation. Moderate quality of evidence. Under optimum fasting conditions, the absorption of an orally administered dose of LT4 is about 70%–80%, and if oral medications cannot be taken the appropriate intravenous dose is approximately 75% of the oral dose. When LT4 is co‑administered with food, absorption is reduced; in one study in healthy volunteers, LT4 absorption with food was 64% compared with 80% in the fasting state.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

### Establishing the adequate levothyroxine dose after total thyroidectomy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^112JatY3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As millions of people around the world take LT4 daily and a huge number of patients with goiter or cancer undergo thyroidectomy, achieving robust data about the optimal starting LT4 dose should be important for helping the clinical practice of thyroidologists. The main goal of the present meta-analysis was to assess whether different approaches for a LT4 dose-choosing strategy would translate into a higher number of euthyroid patients at the first follow-up visit after total thyroidectomy.

The results of the present analysis show a mean percentage of euthyroid patients receiving LT4 at the first follow-up after thyroidectomy of ∼34%. This indicates that, in most patients, independently from the LT4 dose-choosing method used, TSH level was either below or above the normal range. The high heterogeneity in terms of euthyroidism rates observed across studies (ranging from 19% to 68%) using different dose-choosing strategies highlights the complexity of choosing an adequate starting LT4 replacement dose in thyroidectomized patients. We aimed to identify the primary contributors to this variability, considering methodological differences in LT4 dosing and patient characteristics by assessing whether different methods for estimating LT4 dose would lead to different results in terms of rates of euthyroidism achieved.

The studies included in our analysis employed different dosing approaches, including fixed-dose regimens, weight-based dosing (dose/kg), and individualized algorithms incorporating factors such as BMI, lean body mass (LBM), or age. We conducted mainly 2 comparative analyses: (1) dose/kg studies vs all other approaches and (2) weight-based, BMI-based, LBM-based dosing vs fixed-dose and other particular algorithm-based methods. In both analyses, the second group exhibited higher rates of euthyroidism; however, this was accompanied by greater heterogeneity and wider confidence intervals, primarily due to 1 study belonging to the second group reporting a 68% achievement rate among 31 patients. When considering how these factors were incorporated into dose-choosing algorithms, we found that only 1 study included LBM in its algorithm, yet it achieved a euthyroidism rate of just 26%, indicating no clear advantage over other methods. No study accounted for sex in the dose-choosing algorithm. Two studies included age as a variable, reporting euthyroidism rates of 67% and 58%. Three studies incorporated BMI into their algorithms. Two studies considered age and BMI, while 1 used a BMI-based approach, achieving a euthyroidism rate of 38%.

### Levothyroxine starting dose in primary hypothyroid treatment… [^11198oBM]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Primary hypothyroidism is a common medical disorder that usually presents secondary to autoimmune thyroiditis. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Treatment of hypothyroidism with levothyroxine is effective, but starting doses vary. There are two strategies for initiating levothyroxine in healthy adults younger than 65 years: low-dose and full-dose. Traditionally, lower starting doses of 25 to 50 mcg per day are recommended for patients 65 years and older or who have ischemic heart disease. Low-dose initiation of thyroid supplementation usually takes four to six months before plasma thyrotropin and free thyroxine levels become normal. Roos and associates compared the full starting dose of levothyroxine with the low dose in individuals with primary hypothyroidism without known cardiac disease. Patients were excluded if they had a history of cardiac disease or were taking cardiac medication.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a starting levothyroxine dosage of 25 mcg per day or 1. 6 mcg per kg per day. Levothyroxine doses were adjusted by 25 mcg every four weeks until 24 weeks. Doses then were adjusted every 12 weeks with the goal of maintaining serum thyrotropin and FT. Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to the low-dose group and 25 to the high-dose group. The two groups were similar in severity of hypothyroidism and age. At week four, 13 patients reached euthyroid levels in the high-dose group compared with one in the low-dose group. This trend persisted until week 24, when 21 in the high-dose group and 20 in the low-dose group met the criteria for being euthyroid. The rate of change in clinical scores and quality of life were similar between the two groups. Body weight, heart rate, and blood pressure were unchanged in both groups. There were no palpitations, angina pectoris, or other cardiac events documented in either group.

The authors conclude that starting healthy primary hypothyroid patients on a full dose of levothyroxine is safe and effective for those who do not have a history of cardiac disease. They add that this strategy may be more convenient and cost effective than the method of starting low and titrating slowly.
