## Question

what would treatment be for seborrheic dermatitis in other areas of the body?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what treatment would be for seborrheic dermatitis in other areas of the body. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the condition's distribution and pathophysiology to anchor site-specific choices. Then, I should verify first‑line topical options and dosing. Next, I'll consider anti‑inflammatory strategies and steroid‑sparing maintenance for sensitive areas. After that, I need to tailor therapy by location, including intertriginous and genital skin, and address eyelid involvement when relevant. I will then review escalation to systemic therapy for refractory disease. Finally, I should integrate newer therapies, lay out maintenance and prevention, and note special populations and a concise algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with labeled use or high‑quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and sites involved. Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis concentrated in sebaceous areas of the face, trunk, and intertriginous regions, driven by Malassezia colonization and host inflammatory responses, which guides the twin therapeutic targets of antifungal effect and anti‑inflammation [^113pznTx] [^112JxkED] [^114RUsCq].

> I need to set general treatment principles before choosing agents. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single modality; most patients benefit from an antifungal foundation to reduce Malassezia with short courses of anti‑inflammatory therapy for flares, followed by steroid‑sparing maintenance tailored to site and severity, since chronic steroid use risks atrophy and telangiectasia especially on the face and in folds [^112JxkED] [^115R8Rrf].

> For first‑line antifungal therapy on body sites, ketoconazole 2% cream applied twice daily for about 4 weeks or until clearing is a labeled and practical option; let me verify the dosing label to be precise: yes, 2% BID for 4 weeks or until clinical clearing is correct, and ciclopirox or bifonazole are comparable alternatives where available, with clotrimazole or terbinafine as reasonable substitutions when needed based on access and tolerance [^114QW9oS] [^114z62ba] [^117QbHQm] [^116ZBqMh].

> For anti‑inflammatory control of flares on the body, I should confirm the safest steroid potency and duration. Low‑potency topical corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or desonide for short bursts, generally up to 1–2 weeks, help reduce erythema and itch while minimizing atrophy risk, especially on the face and in intertriginous areas; wait, I initially considered that higher‑potency agents might speed clearance on the trunk, but I need to correct that for safety — superpotent agents like clobetasol are typically reserved for scalp short‑contact regimens and should be used with great caution or avoided on thin body skin due to atrophy risk [^114RxZaS] [^115R8Rrf] [^114a1bVz].

> Let me consider combination therapy in moderate disease. Using an antifungal cream with a brief course of a low‑potency steroid during flares addresses both the Malassezia burden and the inflammatory response; I should double‑check that guidelines endorse this: yes, primary care and dermatology guidance support antifungal plus short‑course mild corticosteroid for symptomatic control, then step down to antifungal alone for maintenance [^112JxkED] [^115R8Rrf].

> For steroid‑sparing options, especially on sensitive sites like the face and intertriginous areas, I will now examine calcineurin inhibitors. Pimecrolimus 1% cream or tacrolimus 0.1% ointment are recommended for patients unresponsive to or intolerant of steroids, or when minimizing steroid exposure is desired, with improvement often within two weeks and without the risk of cutaneous atrophy; labeling warns about rare malignancy signals, but clinical data have not shown increased risk compared with the general population, which I should keep in mind during counseling [^112LBPtK] [^111bGUaa] [^113pznTx].

> But wait, what about other nonsteroidal options for persistent facial or truncal disease? Azelaic acid 15% gel can be helpful given antifungal, keratolytic, and anti‑inflammatory properties, and certain nonsteroidal formulations with zinc PCA or piroctone olamine show antifungal activity and symptom improvement in small studies; I should confirm that the evidence base is limited and use them as adjuncts in refractory cases or when patients prefer nonsteroidal maintenance [^1146Q6Ry] [^1114LFkS] [^112rpeew].

> Next, I should review location‑specific nuances for the face. A reasonable approach is ketoconazole 2% cream for antifungal effect, layered with a very short course of low‑potency steroid for redness and itch, then transition to a calcineurin inhibitor for maintenance to avoid steroid sequelae, with added caution near eyelids due to ocular risks of steroids and the propensity for telangiectasia [^113pznTx] [^112JxkED] [^112LBPtK].

> For the trunk and intertriginous areas, let me think about minimizing maceration and irritation in folds. Antifungal creams such as ketoconazole or ciclopirox remain foundational, with brief, low‑potency steroid courses for flares and calcineurin inhibitors favored for maintenance or when recurrent involvement in folds risks steroid atrophy; I need to ensure that patients are counseled on keeping folds dry and using noncomedogenic emollients between active treatments [^112JxkED] [^112LBPtK].

> In the genital region when balanitis‑like inflammation occurs, hold on, I should verify guideline‑based combinations. The IUSTI guidance supports combining a topical antifungal with a mild‑to‑moderate corticosteroid for short courses to rapidly control inflammation while addressing yeast overgrowth, with careful attention to barrier repair and avoidance of irritants [^113gN5in].

> For eyelid margin involvement consistent with seborrheic blepharitis, I need to check next‑step measures if hygiene and first‑line approaches are insufficient. Short courses of topical antibiotic ointment such as chloramphenicol applied to the lid margin can be considered by eye care clinicians, with or without short‑course azithromycin, alongside warm compresses and lid hygiene to reduce bioburden and inflammation [^112svqLA].

> Now, for refractory or extensive disease, I should confirm systemic options and their dosing. Oral itraconazole may be used in select adults with severe, recalcitrant SD, for example 200 mg daily for 7 days with possible pulsed maintenance of 200 mg daily for 2 days monthly; terbinafine has been used off‑label in resistant cases, and phototherapy is an option when topical and systemic antifungals fail or are contraindicated; hmm, wait a minute, I see a labeled dose for intramuscular methylprednisolone acetate mentioned for seborrheic dermatitis, but given the disease's chronicity and the risks of systemic steroids, this is rarely appropriate and generally not recommended in routine care, so I will note it as an infrequently used, label‑listed option rather than a standard practice [^113r99iM] [^115uowSk] [^113JoCTs].

> Turning to newer therapies, let me verify the role of topical PDE4 inhibition. Roflumilast 0.3% foam is FDA‑approved for seborrheic dermatitis involving scalp, face, trunk, and intertriginous areas, with randomized trials showing superior IGA success versus vehicle by week 8 and low discontinuation rates, supporting its use as a nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory option across hair‑bearing and glabrous sites and as a maintenance strategy after induction [^113h1XKZ] [^114TVsby] [^1118FcMC] [^112oiwZr].

> Exosome therapy has been reported in case studies, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adopting it. Evidence is limited to case reports without controlled data, so it should be considered investigational and not standard of care pending robust trials, particularly given variability in preparation, delivery, and outcomes reporting [^116EwUex] [^1126PkTn] [^115uowSk].

> For maintenance and relapse prevention after clearance, I should double‑check best practices. Intermittent antifungal application, for example once or twice weekly to historically involved areas, helps prevent recurrence, complemented by gentle skin care, avoidance of harsh cleansers, and use of nonmedicated emollients on untreated areas spaced several hours away from active agents to maintain barrier function and reduce irritancy [^112JxkED] [^116j3xf4] [^114RUsCq].

> Special considerations warrant attention. In patients with skin of color, dyspigmentation and petaloid hypopigmented patches may predominate, necessitating careful steroid selection and preference for calcineurin inhibitors to minimize pigmentary sequelae; in HIV/AIDS, disease can be more severe and recurrent, often requiring more aggressive and sustained antifungal and anti‑inflammatory regimens; in children, favor low‑potency steroids and calcineurin inhibitors while avoiding systemic therapy unless disease is severe and refractory [^114NC3Ex] [^113cGFMQ] [^112JxkED].

> Summarizing the practical algorithm, I need to ensure a clear, safety‑first sequence: for mild body SD, start with topical antifungal monotherapy until clear; for moderate disease, add a short course of a low‑potency steroid and then taper to antifungal alone or a calcineurin inhibitor for maintenance; for severe or fold‑predominant or steroid‑sensitive areas, prefer calcineurin inhibitors with antifungal support; for refractory or widespread disease, consider oral itraconazole in adults or topical roflumilast foam as a nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory option; maintain remission with intermittent antifungal or calcineurin inhibitor application and gentle skin care, adjusting to response and tolerability at each step [^112JxkED] [^113r99iM] [^113h1XKZ].

Treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in non-scalp areas centers on **topical antifungals** (ketoconazole, ciclopirox, selenium sulfide) applied once or twice daily until clearance, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance [^112JxkED]. For inflammation, use **low-potency corticosteroids** (hydrocortisone 1%, desonide 0.05%) for 1–2 weeks, then taper to avoid atrophy [^111Yh6TE] [^113pznTx]. Calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus 1%, tacrolimus 0.03–0.1%) are **steroid-sparing options** [^115R8Rrf] for sensitive or intertriginous skin [^112LBPtK].

Keratolytics (salicylic acid, sulfur) help reduce **scale** [^117L7THS], and emollients support **barrier repair** [^116ZBqMh]. For refractory or extensive disease, consider short courses of oral itraconazole or fluconazole, or topical roflumilast 0.3% foam [^114TVsby] [^113h1XKZ]. Maintenance with antifungals and gentle skincare is essential to prevent relapse [^117KTgcX].

---

## Topical antifungal agents

Topical antifungals are **first-line therapy** for non-scalp seborrheic dermatitis because they reduce Malassezia colonization and inflammation [^113pznTx].

- **Ketoconazole 2% cream or foam**: Apply once or twice daily until clearance, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance [^114QW9oS] [^117QbHQm].

- **Ciclopirox 1% cream or shampoo**: Apply once or twice daily until clearance, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance [^117KTgcX] [^112JxkED].

- **Selenium sulfide 2.5% lotion or foam**: Apply once daily for 7–14 days, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance [^111Yh6TE].

---

## Topical corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids reduce inflammation and pruritus [^115R8Rrf]. Use **low-potency agents** to minimize adverse effects [^113pznTx], with **hydrocortisone 1% cream** applied once or twice daily for 1–2 weeks, then taper to maintenance antifungal therapy [^111Yh6TE], and **desonide 0.05% cream** applied once or twice daily for 1–2 weeks before tapering to maintenance antifungal therapy [^114RxZaS].

---

## Topical calcineurin inhibitors

Calcineurin inhibitors are **steroid-sparing options**, especially for sensitive or intertriginous areas [^115R8Rrf] [^112LBPtK]. Use **pimecrolimus 1% cream** twice daily until clearance, then 1–3 times weekly for maintenance [^112LBPtK], or **tacrolimus 0.03–0.1% ointment** on the same schedule [^111bGUaa].

---

## Keratolytic agents

Keratolytics help reduce scaling and improve penetration of other topical therapies [^117L7THS]. Use **salicylic acid 2–5% creams or lotions** or **sulfur-containing creams**, applied once daily to reduce scaling.

---

## Emollients and barrier repair

Regular use of **emollients** supports barrier repair and reduces irritation. Non-fragranced **moisturizers** should be applied daily to maintain skin hydration and barrier function.

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapy is reserved for severe, refractory, or extensive disease. Use **itraconazole** 200 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily for 2 days monthly as maintenance [^113r99iM], or **fluconazole** 150–300 mg weekly for 2–4 weeks, then monthly as maintenance.

---

## Novel therapies

Recent advances include **topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors**. Roflumilast 0.3% foam applied once daily for 8 weeks is effective for **trunk and intertriginous areas** [^114TVsby] [^1118FcMC].

---

## Maintenance and prevention strategies

Long-term control requires ongoing **maintenance therapy and lifestyle modifications**.

- **Maintenance antifungal therapy**: Apply once or twice weekly to prevent relapse [^117KTgcX].

- **Gentle skin care**: Use mild cleansers and avoid irritants [^1122SeT6].

- **Stress management**: Reduce stress to minimize flares [^113tgVei].

---

## Special considerations

- **Intertriginous areas**: Use low-potency corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors to avoid atrophy [^115R8Rrf].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Consider systemic antifungals for severe disease [^116vTSgv].

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Prefer topical antifungals; avoid systemic therapy unless necessary [^116ZBqMh].

---

Treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in non-scalp areas involves topical antifungals, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytics, and emollients, with systemic therapy for severe cases. Maintenance therapy and lifestyle modifications are **essential for long-term control** [^113pznTx].

### Seborrheic dermatitis: Diagnosis and treatment [^111Yh6TE]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, chronic, relapsing skin condition that predominantly affects areas of the body rich in sebaceous glands. Clinically, seborrheic dermatitis presents as symmetric, poorly defined erythematous patches with yellow, oily scales and fine, superficial desquamation (flaking). In individuals with darker skin, erythema may be less apparent, and post-inflammatory pigmentary changes might be a presenting sign with hypopigmented, slightly scaly areas.

Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp can be effectively treated with topical over-the-counter antifungal shampoos and prescription-strength antifungal or corticosteroid solutions, foams, or oils. Thick, scaly areas can be treated with keratolytic shampoos and lotions. Seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body can be treated with over-the-counter and prescription-strength antifungal creams, over-the-counter and prescription-strength corticosteroid creams and ointments, and calcineurin inhibitor cream or ointment.

Neonatal seborrheic dermatitis is common and typically self-resolves by 6 months of age. Mild cases of the scalp (cradle cap) may be treated conservatively with mineral oil to loosen the scale and gentle combing. More severe cases may overlap with atopic dermatitis and can be treated with topical antifungals or topical corticosteroids.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113Mja9S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

In total, the studies included 9052 participants. Of these, 4164 were included in the main intervention group (participants receiving the treatment that is primarily being tested by the investigators), and 3701 were in the largest control group. Multi-arm studies included 1985 participants in a second control group and an additional 202 participants in a third control group, altogether including 4888 control participants.

- **Diagnosis of trial participants**:
	- Seborrhoeic dermatitis or dandruff of the scalp
	- Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp and face
	- Seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face

It was not always clear within studies to what extent the disease also affected the trunk of a participant's body. Few studies stated this clearly (Green; Ortonne; Pari; Pierard; Stratigos; Swinyer), and we assumed that when the face was involved, the trunk might also be affected. Therefore, we did not make further distinctions between seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp exclusively and seborrhoeic dermatitis of these parts with truncal involvement.

One study specifically recruited patients with HIV who had seborrhoeic dermatitis as participants, with most recruited from the outpatient departments of hospitals.

- **Trial settings**:
	- Eight studies were conducted in the United States
	- Six each in Germany and France
	- Five in the UK
	- Four in Turkey
	- Three each in Greece and Belgium
	- Two each in India, Iran, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Sweden
	- One study each in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, Italy, Japan, and Korea

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113cGFMQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face, and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents, and phototherapy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

- **Main results**: We included 51 studies with 9,052 participants.

### Exosome therapy for chronic severe seborrheic dermatitis: A case report [^116EwUex]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A male patient, aged 34 years, presented with chronic, severe seborrheic dermatitis (SD) that had been untreated for 6 months prior to the hospital visit. He had previously received various treatments, such as topical steroids (hydrocortisone 1%), antifungal creams (ketoconazole 2%), and antifungal shampoos, with only partial response and recurrence. His SD was debilitating both socially and emotionally, with frequent dry dandruff on his shoulders and clothing, significantly affecting his quality of life.

To alleviate SD symptoms, a total of four sessions each for the face and scalp of ASCE exosome therapy was conducted, with an interval of 2 weeks between sessions. The exosome was administered using a Derma pen with a depth of 2 mm, and a total of 5 mL of ASCE was administered per session. The injection was intradermal, and the same volume was maintained throughout the treatment course. During treatment, the patient experienced an SD flare-up after the second session, affecting both the face and scalp, for which a brief course of mild topical steroids (hydrocortisone 1%) for 5 days was introduced as adjunctive treatment. ASCE plus balm was also applied topically to the face to aid in skin healing.

The treatment efficacy was assessed using the Physician's Global Assessment and Investigator's Global Assessment scales, both employing a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) to rate disease severity, with higher scores indicating more severe conditions. Scaling was evaluated on a 4-point scale from 0 (none; no visible scaling on lesions) to 3 (severe).

### Interventions for infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (including cradle cap) [^115sSeFq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis (ISD) is a chronic, inflammatory, scaling skin condition that causes redness and a greasy scaling rash in infants and young children. It can last from weeks to months, but rarely years. When it occurs on the scalp, it is referred to as 'cradle cap'. While benign and self-limiting regardless of its location on the body, it can distress parents. The effectiveness of commonly promoted treatments is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of interventions for infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis in children from birth to 24 months of age.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 22 May 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched trials registers and checked reference lists of included studies for further references to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Additionally, we searched for unpublished RCTs and grey literature via web search engines and corresponded with authors and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs of interventions for ISD in children from birth up to 24 months who were clinically diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner with ISD or cradle cap. We allowed comparison of any treatment to no treatment or placebo, and the comparison of two or more treatments or a combination of treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were 'Change in severity score from baseline to end of study' and 'Percentage of infants treated who develop adverse effects or intolerance'.

### Patient with treatment resistant peristomal and scalp dermatitis [^1148BkYr]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Answers**:

	- **LCH – Correct**. LCH is a spectrum of diseases caused by a clonal proliferation of Langerhans cells. Patients present with scaly, erythematous, seborrhea-like eruptions with follicular papules on the scalp, face, trunk, and erosions in intertriginous areas. Birbeck granules on electron microscopy were used to diagnose LCH, but this has been replaced by CD1a and Langerin immunohistochemical stains. BRAF V600E is the most common mutation identified in LCH lesions.

	- **Mycosis fungoides – Incorrect**. Mycosis fungoides is the most common subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and presents with erythematous patches and plaques in sun-protected areas. Histology demonstrates papillary dermal fibrosis and epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes.

	- **Dermatomyositis – Incorrect**. Dermatomyositis is a multisystem autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by inflammatory myopathy, photo-distributed cutaneous eruption, and pathogenic autoantibodies. Age-appropriate screening is recommended to rule out underlying malignancy. Although psoriasiform dermatitis of the scalp is seen in dermatomyositis, this patient's rash morphology, distribution, and pathology are atypical for dermatomyositis.

	- **MCR – Incorrect**. MCR is a rare histiocytic disorder associated with solid organ and hematologic malignancy. Unlike our case, MCR presents with symmetric erosive polyarthritis and papulonodular lesions on the face and dorsal hands. Histology shows CD207-negative histiocytic infiltrate and multinucleated giant cells.

	- **Seborrheic dermatitis – Incorrect**. Seborrheic dermatitis presents with scaly, erythematous, seborrhea-like eruptions but differs in morphology and distribution from the case described.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^114TVsby]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Topical treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis are limited by efficacy and safety concerns. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in adult patients with seborrheic dermatitis affecting the scalp, face, and/or trunk.

This multicenter phase 2a clinical trial was conducted across 24 sites in the US and Canada between November 12, 2019, and August 21, 2020. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis that persisted for three months or longer, and an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or greater (at least moderate). The condition affected 20% or less body surface area, including the scalp, face, trunk, and/or intertriginous areas. Data analysis was carried out from September to October 2020.

Participants were randomized to receive once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3% (n = 154), or vehicle foam (n = 72) for eight weeks. The main outcome was defined as IGA success, which entailed achieving an IGA score of clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline by week 8. Secondary outcomes included IGA success at weeks 2 and 4; achievement of erythema score of 0 or 1 plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline at weeks 2, 4, and 8; achievement of scaling score of 0 or 1 plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline at weeks 2, 4, and 8; and changes in the Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) score from baseline. Additionally, WI-NRS success was defined as achieving a 4-point or greater improvement in WI-NRS score in patients with a baseline score of 4 or higher.

### Medicated shampoos for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^1164kPjV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common papulosquamous disorder of the skin, affecting 3% to 5% of the population. Dandruff, a less severe form of seborrheic dermatitis, affects a greater proportion of the population. The exact pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown; however, colonization of the lipophilic yeast Malassezia furfur and an inflammatory reaction to this yeast each seem to play a role in disease etiology. Therefore, treatment for seborrheic dermatitis is aimed at yeast elimination and inflammation control.

Several treatment modalities are available for seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, including shampoos, which contain both active ingredients related to antimycotic or anti-inflammatory effects, and surfactant ingredients that allow these shampoos to replace regular shampoos for affected patients. The literature on the treatment of therapeutic shampoos is reviewed, and treatment strategies for managing seborrheic dermatitis with therapeutic shampoos are provided.

### Efficacious and safe management of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis using clobetasol propionate shampoo 0·05% combined with ketoconazole shampoo 2%: a randomized, controlled study [^112e1W3R]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Topical antifungals and corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis. The short-contact clobetasol propionate 0·05% shampoo (CP) is an efficacious and safe once-daily treatment for scalp psoriasis.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CP alone and combined with ketoconazole shampoo 2% (KC) in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis.

- **Methods**: This randomized and investigator-blinded study consisted of three phases, each lasting 4 weeks. During the treatment phase, subjects were randomized to receive KC twice weekly (K2), CP twice weekly (C2), CP twice weekly alternating with KC twice weekly (C2 + K2), or CP four times weekly alternating with KC twice weekly (C4 + K2). All subjects received KC once weekly during the maintenance phase and were untreated during the follow-up phase.

- **Results**: At the end of the treatment phase, all three CP-containing regimens were significantly more efficacious than K2 in decreasing the overall disease severity (P < 0·05). Both combination regimens were also significantly more efficacious than K2 in decreasing each individual sign of the disease (P < 0·05). While the C2 and C4 + K2 groups experienced slight worsening during the maintenance phase, the efficacy of C2 + K2 was sustained and remained the highest among all groups. All regimens were well tolerated without inducing any skin atrophy. Similarly low incidences of telangiectasia, burning, and adverse events were observed among the four groups.

- **Conclusions**: The combination therapy of twice-weekly CP alternating with…

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp [^115R8Rrf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting primarily the skin of the scalp, face, chest, and intertriginous areas, causing scaling and redness of the skin. Treatment options include antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and keratolytic agents, as well as phototherapy.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical pharmacological interventions with established anti-inflammatory action for seborrhoeic dermatitis occurring in adolescents and adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to September 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database. We searched five trials databases and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs in adults or adolescents (> 16 years) with diagnosed seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp or face, comparing topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and lithium salts) with other treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses if feasible.

- **Main results**: We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^116j3xf4]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

This study was a parallel-group, double-blind, vehicle-controlled randomized clinical trial investigating the efficacy of once-daily roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. The trial was conducted at 24 sites across the US and Canada. The study protocol and statistical analysis plans can be found in Supplements 1 and 2. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years or older, clinically diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis for a duration of three months or more. They had an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 or greater and the dermatitis affected 20% or less of their body surface area (BSA), including areas such as the scalp, face, trunk, and intertriginous regions.

Patients were required to discontinue specific treatments at least two weeks prior to randomization, including topical antifungals, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, sulfur-based treatments, medical devices, crisaborole, azelaic acid, and metronidazole. Additional excluded medications are listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 3. Patients were permitted to use nonmedicated emollients, moisturizers, and sunscreens once daily, provided they were applied at least three hours after the application of the investigational product to untreated areas only.

### Seborrhoeic dermatitis [^116ZBqMh]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis affects at least 10% of the population. Malassezia (Pityrosporum) ovale is thought to be the causative organism and causes inflammation by mechanisms that are still poorly defined. Seborrhoeic dermatitis tends to relapse after treatment.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp in adults? What are the effects of topical treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and body in adults? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bifonazole, emollients, ketoconazole, lithium succinate, selenium sulphide, tar shampoo, terbinafine, and topical corticosteroids (betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, hydrocortisone, mometasone furoate).

### The global prevalence of seborrheic dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116V7cbV]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, yet its global prevalence, pathogenesis, and epidemiology remain inadequately defined. This study aims to provide a detailed estimation of its global prevalence, analyze demographic variations, and explore differences in various settings.

Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from inception through October 2023. Original investigations on seborrheic dermatitis prevalence were included after duplicate screening of titles, abstracts, and full articles, including only studies with clinician-diagnosed cases.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Following PRISMA guidelines, data were extracted, and quality was assessed independently by multiple reviewers. A random-effects model using restricted maximum likelihood was used for meta-analysis and subgroup analyses.

- **Main outcome and measure**: The primary outcome was the pooled estimate of global seborrheic dermatitis prevalence.

From 1574 identified articles, 121 studies were included, encompassing 1,260,163 individuals, revealing a pooled global seborrheic dermatitis prevalence of 4.38% (95% CI, 3.58%-5.17%). There was significant heterogeneity (I2 = 99.94%). Subgroup analyses showed variations by age, with a higher prevalence in adults (5.64% [95% CI, 4.01%-7.27%]) compared to children (3.70% [95% CI, 2.69%-4.80%]) and neonates (0.23% [95% CI, 0.04%-0.43%]). Geographic analyses indicated variability, with the highest prevalence in South Africa (8.82%).

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^114z62ba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

We developed a detailed data extraction form and tested it on a subset of the included studies to ascertain its adequacy and usability. Necessary modifications were made before using the form to extract data from identified studies. EOO, JHV, JHR, OAO, and VNB conducted the data extraction. We employed the same review author pairing approach for data extraction that was used for study selection. When discrepancies arose between a pair of review authors, one of the other review authors resolved them. EOO entered the data into RevMan, and JHV verified their accuracy.

- **Assessment of risk of bias in included studies**: Assessment of risk of bias consisted of an evaluation of the following components for each included study, using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins).

	- **Method of generating randomisation sequence**: We considered this adequate if a proper randomisation method, such as a table of random numbers or a computer program, had been used. The randomisation sequence had to be generated away from the actual trial site.

	- **Method of allocation concealment**: We considered this adequate if the assignment could not be foreseen by trial participants or investigators, for example, through the use of identical bottles with codes indecipherable to both participants and investigators.

	- **Blinding**: We considered whether participants, care providers, and outcome assessors were adequately blinded as to who received the intervention and who received the placebo.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: Nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^111XL2qm]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

In recent years, research on facial psoriasis has been limited to a small number of trials, and systemic therapy has been investigated in only a single study. For topical therapies, the immunomodulatory calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus, was more effective than calcitriol, whereas calcipotriol combined with hydrocortisone showed greater clearance than calcipotriol alone. Topical pimecrolimus is also effective in treating facial psoriasis. In one post hoc analysis, systemic therapy with adalimumab was more efficacious than methotrexate and placebo.

In the short term, treatment can consist of milder topical steroids, but these agents present the risk of provoking acne, atrophy, and ocular side effects. Topical vitamin D analogs and pimecrolimus are effective steroid‐sparing agents. For milder disease on the seborrheic dermatitis spectrum, ketoconazole 2% cream may be helpful.

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp: Summary of a Cochrane review [^1173T5tQ]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Clinical question**: Are there differences in effectiveness between topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or lithium salts) and placebo or azoles in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adults?

- **Bottom line**: The topical anti-inflammatory treatments were more effective in achieving total clearance of symptoms than placebo by 1.4-fold to 8.5-fold. However, there are no considerable differences in the anti-inflammatory topical treatments when compared with azoles for short-term treatment. Despite the chronic nature of the disease, there is no evidence of treatment effects in long-term, continuous, or intermittent use of these compounds.

### Topical pimecrolimus 1% cream for resistant seborrheic dermatitis of the face: an open-label study [^113ZxQJM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis are numerous, including both topical and systemic agents (e.g. topical corticosteroids, oral antifungals, and psoralen plus UVA). However, long-term use of topical corticosteroids may lead to adverse effects. Pimecrolimus 1% cream is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for seborrheic dermatitis.

- **Objective**: To explore the efficacy of pimecrolimus 1% cream for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis lesions resistant to conventional treatments.

- **Methods**: Sixteen patients with resistant seborrheic dermatitis of the face applied pimecrolimus 1% cream twice daily for two weeks. The lesions were assessed clinically, and the severity of the signs was assessed using a 4-point score. Additionally, the scores of all affected regions (paranasal, forehead, and eyebrows) were evaluated separately to assess whether different results would be obtained in different regions of the face. Patients also completed self-assessments on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at each visit.

- **Results**: Statistically significant reductions in the scores of all parameters were observed on day 7 and day 14 of the study. There were no significant differences between the responses in the three regions of the face. No adverse effects were reported, except for temporary pruritus immediately after the application of pimecrolimus 1% cream in one patient.

- **Conclusion**: Although the interpretation of efficacy was limited by the open-label, non-controlled study design and the small number of patients, this trial suggests that pimecrolimus 1% cream may be a beneficial treatment for resistant seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113uC6oN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

We changed the review title from 'Interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis' to 'Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. In the protocol, we initially presented this review as an all-encompassing interventions review for seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, we had to modify that goal and limit ourselves to topical antifungal agents used for the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. This decision was made because of the multiplicity of comparisons and the equally diverse outcome variables that we encountered. We reasoned that for meaningful comparisons leading to coherent conclusions, it was best to split the review into segments focusing on major classes of treatment as we identified them from the trials we examined. These segments will be published in series, culminating in an overview.

We had proposed to conduct a search for side effects of various interventions used to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis but did not carry out this search due to a lack of resources. In the included studies, adverse effects that were reported were non-specific; with hindsight, we believe that a search for specific adverse effects would have been challenging to perform. Additionally, we decided that searching grey literature and conference proceedings, as proposed in the protocol, would not yield extra information. The quality of reporting of published trials was already low, which made analysis difficult. Conference proceedings that were covered by the electronic search provided very little in terms of data, leading us to conclude that further searches were unnecessary.

### Intradermal botulinum toxin A injection for scalp sebum secretion regulation: A multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in Chinese subjects [^117PBJKq]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). High credibility.

Previous studies revealed that the scalp regreasing process post-shampooing followed hyperbolic-like kinetics over days, with the highest amount of sebum occurring at 2 to 3 days post-shampooing. Lower amounts of sebum were observed in older age groups across all ethnicities compared to younger individuals. Male subjects were found to produce more sebum than females, irrespective of ethnicity. Factors such as diet, occupation, smoking, climate, ultraviolet radiation, pollutants, personal hygiene, and circadian rhythms contribute to this process. Excessive scalp sebum secretion facilitates the regreasing process, leading to greasy scalp and hair. Greasy hair, coated with sebum, progressively sticks together, trapping external dirt and particles. Unwanted sebum blocks pores and fuels bacteria and yeasts, resulting in itchiness, dandruff, folliculitis, and acne in susceptible individuals.

Clear scalp and volumized hair contribute to a youthful, decent, and healthy appearance. Unlike facial oiliness, which can be modified with cosmetics, greasy scalp and hair are difficult to conceal. Frequent washing may help alleviate scalp and hair oiliness, but can also lead to sensitive or irritable skin. Compared with oily facial skin, there are fewer therapeutic options available for treating greasy scalp and hair. The efficacy of energy devices for treating scalp sebum excretion remains controversial, and the use of lasers on hairy scalps appears difficult and restricted. Although systemic treatments such as antifungals, isotretinoin, spironolactone, and herbal medicine are…

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^114cgFmQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

This study compared lithium salts to placebo for seborrhoeic dermatitis treatment.

- **Primary outcomes**: Participants without complete resolution were studied. Dreno compared lithium gluconate versus placebo. In the short term (up to four weeks), lithium resulted in a higher remission rate. However, the difference was not statistically significant (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04). At long-term follow-up (more than four weeks), lithium was statistically significantly better than placebo (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Symptom severity scores for erythema, pruritus, and scaling were assessed through systematic symptom severity assessment.

	- **Erythema score**: One study by Langtry compared lithium preparations versus placebo, providing weak evidence of better erythema reduction with lithium (MD -3.90, 95% CI -16.91 to 9.11). A similar effect was observed at long-term follow-up (MD -6.20, 95% CI -20.49 to 8.09). Dreno analyzed erythema separately, finding that lithium gluconate produced better clearance of erythema at eight weeks of follow-up compared with placebo (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.84).

	- **Scaling score**: Results from Langtry indicated that participants taking lithium had lower scaling scores than those given placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant (MD -5.00, 95% CI -18.78 to 8.78).

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^111YTBVx]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibition may be effective for seborrheic dermatitis based on its capacity to suppress proinflammatory cytokines implicated in seborrheic dermatitis pathophysiology by elevating cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. Limited evidence from case reports and a small clinical trial supported the efficacy of the topical PDE4 inhibitor crisaborole and the oral PDE4 inhibitor apremilast, both used off label, for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. Roflumilast is a selective, highly potent PDE4 inhibitor with between 25- and more than 300-fold greater potency than crisaborole or apremilast in vitro. An oral formulation of roflumilast is approved for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Topical roflumilast is under investigation for the long-term management of various dermatologic conditions, including atopic dermatitis, scalp psoriasis, and chronic plaque psoriasis, having been approved on July 29, 2022, by the US Food and Drug Administration. We present results of a phase 2a randomized clinical trial of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for once-daily treatment of seborrheic dermatitis on scalp and non-scalp locations.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117QbHQm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Summary of main results

We found studies on the effects of ketoconazole, bifonazole, metronidazole, clotrimazole, and ciclopirox in alleviating symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Ketoconazole led to a lower incidence of failure to achieve complete resolution than was seen with placebo, but the results were statistically heterogeneous and could not be explained by subgroup analyses of dose, mode of delivery, nor conflict of interest. Evidence was considered to be of moderate or low quality.

Treatment with ketoconazole yielded less failure of total rash clearance than was observed with placebo. Evidence for this was of low quality. Ketoconazole reduced erythema and scaling better than placebo did, but the two treatments had a comparable effect on pruritus. Participants taking ketoconazole had a comparable risk of side effects across all reporting studies when compared with those given placebo.

Ketoconazole was less effective than steroids in yielding complete remission of rashes, but this finding was not statistically significant. Ketoconazole and steroids showed similar effects on improvement of erythema, pruritus, and scaling symptoms. Statistical heterogeneity was high, and the evidence was judged to be of low quality. Participants taking ketoconazole had a 44% lower risk of side effects than those taking steroids.

Ketoconazole was comparable with ciclopirox in eliminating symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis. Evidence for this was graded as low. The two drugs were comparable when assessed in terms of symptom-specific outcomes. The incidence of side effects was consistent across studies.

### Role of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis: a review of pathophysiology, safety, and efficacy [^111bGUaa]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is characterized by erythematous pruritic patches and plaques with greasy scale that occur in sebaceous areas. It is common, affecting up to 3% of the population. Past treatments have relied on a wide variety of anti-inflammatory and antifungal agents, but corticosteroids have limited use due to long-term adverse effects.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors provide a safe alternative for the treatment of SD, as these drugs block the inflammatory cascade involved in the disease process and pose no risk of skin atrophy. Studies of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD have found that improvement occurred within 2 weeks, and if SD recurred after stopping treatment, it was significantly less severe. There have been no studies of the comparative efficacy of pimecrolimus versus tacrolimus for the treatment of SD.

Common adverse effects, such as mild burning and irritation, have been associated with the use of both of these agents. Safety profile studies are limited to atopic dermatitis, which show no increase in infection rate, photocarcinogenicity, or signs of immunosuppression in patients using topical calcineurin inhibitors for long-term treatment. This article reviews the clinical trials of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of SD, focusing on efficacy and safety.

### Facial seborrheic dermatitis: A report on current status and therapeutic horizons [^1146Q6Ry]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis, characterized by erythema and/or flaking or scaling in areas of high sebaceous activity, affects up to 5% of the US population and often appears in conjunction with other common skin disorders such as rosacea and acne. Despite ongoing research, its etiology remains puzzling. Increased sebaceous and hormonal (androgenic) activity is thought to play a part. Recent evidence suggests an important role for individual susceptibility to irritant metabolites of the skin commensal Malassezia, most probably M. globosa.

- **Therapeutic approaches**: Approaches thus include agents with antifungal, antikeratinizing, and anti-inflammatory activity. Azelaic acid, which has all three properties, may be a useful addition to first-line management. Current management includes topical steroids, the immunosuppressant agents tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, azoles and other antifungals, and keratolytic agents. A recent exploratory study supports the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid 15% gel in seborrheic dermatitis. Azelaic acid may be especially valuable in this application because of its efficacy in treating concomitant rosacea and acne.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^113pznTx]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting patients of all ages, with a global prevalence of 5% or greater. Cardinal features include erythematous, scaly, pruritic patches and plaques with a yellowish, greasy appearance. These manifestations affect areas with abundant sebaceous glands and are often accompanied by dyspigmentation in patients with darker skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can significantly impact quality of life, particularly for those with more severe disease.

Treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis include topical antifungals, corticosteroids, and sulfur/sulfacetamide. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are also used off-label. Coal tar is less commonly used due to associated safety concerns. Treatments are available in various forms such as creams, lotions, ointments, foams, shampoos, gels, and solutions/topical suspensions. While corticosteroids are effective, they should not be used long-term due to risks of atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, rosacea, and ocular toxic effects when applied to the eyelid.

Topical calcineurin inhibitors, though not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating seborrheic dermatitis, have shown efficacy and safety in patients with severe facial seborrheic dermatitis. They are associated with short-term warmth and burning sensations, and labeling includes a warning for rare cases of lymphoma and skin cancer, although clinical data do not suggest a higher risk compared to the general population. Scalp seborrheic dermatitis is often treated with shampoos containing antifungal agents.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113Ge2S3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Outcomes

We made some changes to the secondary outcome measures, reasoning that global severity scores cannot be assessed in a valid way. Consequently, we chose to drop the outcome measures listed below:

- Mean change in global severity score from baseline as assessed by the physician.
- Mean change in global severity score from baseline as assessed by the participant.

We replaced these measures with severity scores for erythema, pruritus, and scaling, which are cardinal symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis and are unarguably the most investigated. We deemed these measures adequate to objectively capture treatment effects and enable comparisons across trials, even when they were derived on different scales. This decision was made after due consultation with experts in this field, including the Co-ordinating Editor of the Skin Group. The consultation was conducted to clarify which measure of treatment effect was objective enough to facilitate comparisons across studies. It was informed by the observation that global severity scores were measured on the basis of different combinations of affected areas of the skin and various possible symptoms. Thus, we excluded studies that used only composite scores for treatment outcomes, as they did not all represent the same thing. Such studies are listed under the heading "Excluded studies". Studies were included only if investigators had measured complete clearance of symptoms or a change in at least one of the cardinal symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Subgroup analysis

In the review, we added conflicts of interest to the parameters on which we based our analysis.

### Topical ruxolitinib in the treatment of refractory facial seborrheic dermatitis [^113tgVei]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition affecting sebum-rich areas of the body. It is one of the most common skin diseases, with a prevalence of 14.3% in the middle-aged and elderly population. SD follows a relapsing and remitting course, worsening with stress and during the winter months. Importantly, SD has been reported to have a negative effect on quality of life. The underlying mechanism of SD is poorly understood; a combination of Malassezia species colonization, immune system activation, and genetic predisposition, among various other endogenous and exogenous factors, likely contribute to its pathogenesis. The clinical presentation ranges from simple dandruff to a fulminant rash. The diagnosis is made clinically by the presence of greasy yellow scales overlying well-demarcated erythematous patches or plaques affecting the face, scalp, and upper portion of the chest in a symmetric distribution; the hairline, eyebrows, glabella, and nasolabial folds are particularly involved. Facial SD is frequently associated with rosacea. The goal of therapy is to clear visible signs of disease and reduce associated symptoms. This treatment must be maintained long-term to prevent recurrence. Since the underlying mechanism involves, at least in part, Malassezia proliferation and inflammation, common treatments include antifungal and anti-inflammatory therapy. First-line therapy includes topical antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole 2% cream) in combination with a mild topical corticosteroid (e.g. hydrocortisone 2.5% or desonide 0.05% creams) or topical calcineurin inhibitors.

### Diagnosis and treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^1122SeT6]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition in infants, adolescents, and adults. The characteristic symptoms — scaling, erythema, and itching — occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is diagnosed clinically based on the location and appearance of the lesions. The skin changes are believed to result from an inflammatory response to a common skin organism, Malassezia yeast.

Treatment with antifungal agents, such as topical ketoconazole, is the mainstay of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body. Because of possible adverse effects, anti-inflammatory agents like topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors should be used only for short durations. Several over-the-counter shampoos are available for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp; patients should be directed to initiate therapy with one of these agents. Antifungal shampoos (for long-term use) and topical corticosteroids (for short-term use) can be used as second-line agents for the treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis.

### Selenium sulfide [^112cxYsr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Selenium sulfide is indicated for the treatment of tinea versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, and dandruff.

### Ketoconazole [^1119YZra]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adverse reactions have been studied through clinical trials. In 11 double-blind trials involving 264 patients using ketoconazole shampoo, 2% for dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis treatment, an increase in normal hair loss and irritation was observed in less than 1% of patients. In three open-label safety trials, 41 patients shampooed 4–10 times weekly for six months, and adverse experiences, each occurring once, included abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. Similar to other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have also been reported.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% (n = 106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n = 107), or a placebo (n = 105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%), and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only adverse events occurring in more than one patient in any of the treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any group.

- **Post-marketing experience**: Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, estimating their frequency is challenging. Adverse drug reactions identified during post-marketing experience with ketoconazole shampoo, 2% include reports of hair discoloration, abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, and angioedema.

### An open-label, single-center pilot study to determine the antifungal activity of a new nonsteroidal cream (Promiseb topical cream) after 7 days of use in healthy volunteers [^1114LFkS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. The duration of treatment with mid- to high-potency formulations is limited by the well-known side effects associated with their long-term use; further, topical corticosteroids treat only the inflammation associated with the disease. This study assessed the antifungal activity of a new corticosteroid-free cream against Malassezia spp, which may be an important pathogenic factor in seborrheic dermatitis. This was a single-center, bilateral, open-label pilot study in 10 healthy volunteers. The nonsteroidal cream was applied twice daily to a designated target area on the chest for 7 days, and the number of colony-forming units of Malassezia spp taken by tape stripping after 7 days was compared with baseline. The percentage reduction from baseline to day 7 in the number of colony-forming units of Malassezia spp was 94% on the treated side versus 49% on the untreated side (P = .03). This pilot study shows the nonsteroidal topical cream has antifungal activities. Further exploration into its potential as a therapeutic alternative for seborrheic dermatitis is warranted.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^115pKAiH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The rationale for certain treatment regimens was seldom given; most studies simply stated that participants were treated for four weeks with a 2% solution to be applied twice daily. However, a wide variation in dose and mode of delivery was observed without a clear explanation for this. It is interesting that no relationship between dose and the outcome 'clearance of symptoms' was obvious at the study level as an indirect comparison. It was only when individual symptom outcomes were assessed that higher doses seemed to produce a better treatment effect. However, this observation was based only on single studies. In direct comparisons of dose effect, no reason was found to conclude that different doses had different treatment effects.

The major problem with the quality of the evidence was how outcomes were measured. We failed to identify any validated outcome measure for seborrhoeic dermatitis or outcome measures conventionally endorsed by expert committees or ranking specialist fora. This situation also applies to other dermatological disorders, as our consultation with experts in the field revealed. Our principal outcome measure, namely, total clearance, has face validity, but we do not know how reliably it can be measured. Global severity scores have the drawback that they can be based on assessment of any symptom/affected area combination, which could weaken the reliability of the measure. Therefore, we excluded studies that measured outcomes in this way. They are listed under excluded studies. Although we undertook rigorous assessment of treatment outcomes, considerable heterogeneity remained in the results.

### Skin microbiota in health and disease: From sequencing to biology [^111APKoT]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff are chronic skin conditions often displayed on skin rich in sebaceous glands, such as the upper back, nose, and scalp. Both conditions are thought to be within the spectrum of the same disease, differing in severity and location. The pathophysiology of these conditions is not completely understood. However, fungal colonization is a predisposing factor. Malassezia fungi, specifically Malassezia globosa and Malassezia restricta, have been identified as the predominant fungi on both normal skin and the scalp of patients with seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff. The amount of fungi correlates with disease severity.

### Red face revisited: Endogenous dermatitis in the form of atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis [^114RUsCq]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis are multifactorial dermatitides collectively known as endogenous dermatitis. Although both conditions can affect the face, they have distinct clinical, epidemiological, and physiopathological characteristics. These two diseases are prevalent worldwide. Atopic dermatitis is characterized by xerosis and an increased susceptibility to irritants and proteins, with patients often developing asthma, allergic rhinitis, and systemic manifestations mediated by immunoglobulin E. In contrast, seborrheic dermatitis is a moderate chronic dermatitis localized to sebum-rich regions and areas with cutaneous folds. While there are numerous studies on the pathophysiology, immunology, and genetics of atopic dermatitis, the genetic and immunological markers of seborrheic dermatitis remain less understood.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^112oiwZr]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

A total of 328 patients were screened, and 226 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.9 [16.8] years; 116 men, 110 women) were randomized to roflumilast foam (n = 154) or vehicle foam (n = 72). Most patients (208 of 226 [92.0%]) completed the study. Only 2 (1.3%) roflumilast-treated patients discontinued due to adverse events (AEs), compared with 1 (1.4%) vehicle-treated patient. Additionally, 2 patients (1.3%) missed the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) assessment at week 8 due to COVID-19 disruption and were excluded from the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population (n = 224).

Treatment groups were well balanced for demographic and baseline disease characteristics. More than 90% of patients had moderate severity of seborrheic dermatitis (IGA score of 3) at baseline; approximately 90% had a moderate score for erythema, and slightly more than 80% had a moderate score for scaling. Mean Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) scores were slightly less than 6 in both groups. The mean percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected was 3.3% in the roflumilast group and 3.0% in the vehicle group. More roflumilast-treated patients than vehicle-treated patients presented with facial involvement (64.9% vs. 50.0%).

### Non-steroidal topical therapy for facial seborrheic dermatitis [^112rpeew]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory skin disorder occurring in areas rich in sebaceous glands. It manifests clinically as erythematous macules or plaques with varying levels of scaling and associated pruritus. Although the pathogenesis of SD has yet to be fully understood, Malassezia yeasts, hormones, sebum levels, and immune response are known to play important roles. Additional factors, including drugs, winter temperatures, and stress, may exacerbate SD. Available treatments include antifungal agents, topical low-potency steroids, and calcineurin inhibitors.

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a topical non-steroidal cream in treating facial seborrheic dermatitis (FSD). We performed a case series of 11 patients with mild or moderate FSD and a history of several previous treatments without improvement. The patients were treated for 8 weeks with a topical non-steroidal facial cream (NSFC) containing zinc PCA, piroctone olamine, hydroxyphenyl propamidobenzoic acid, biosaccharide gum-2, and stearyl glycyrrhetinate. Signs and symptoms and tolerance were assessed before, during, and at the end of treatment. All of the patients had improved symptoms of FSD (desquamation, pruritus, erythema, and stinging sensation); 81.8% showed an excellent response and 18.1% showed a good response. None of the patients had adverse effects.

### Management of seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis versicolor [^116vTSgv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are two very common skin diseases. Pityriasis versicolor is a chronic superficial fungal disease usually located on the upper trunk, neck, or upper arms. In pityriasis versicolor, the lipophilic yeast Malassezia (also known as Pityrosporum ovale or P. orbiculare) changes from the blastospore form to the mycelial form under the influence of predisposing factors. The most important exogenous factors are high temperatures and high relative humidity, which probably explain why pityriasis versicolor is more common in the tropics. The most important endogenous factors are greasy skin, hyperhidrosis, hereditary factors, corticosteroid treatment, and immunodeficiency.

There are many ways of treating pityriasis versicolor topically. Options include propylene glycol, ketoconazole shampoo, zinc pyrithione shampoo, ciclopiroxamine, selenium sulfide, and topical antifungals. In difficult cases, short-term treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole is effective and well tolerated. To avoid recurrence, a prophylactic treatment regimen is mandatory.

Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by red scaly lesions predominantly located on the scalp, face, and upper trunk. There are now many studies indicating that Malassezia plays an important role in this condition. Even a normal number of Malassezia will start an inflammatory reaction. Mild corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. However, the disease recurs quickly, often within just a few days. Antifungal therapy is effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^1168Y7cT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

- **Ketoconazole vs. steroids**: The analysis focused on two key outcomes: the failure to achieve complete resolution of scaling, and side effects.

- **Ketoconazole vs. zinc pyrithione**: Several analyses were conducted, showing the failure to achieve complete resolution in both short and long-term perspectives. Additionally, there was a decrease in the scaling score observed, both initially and long-term, along with side effects.

- **Ketoconazole vs. ciclopirox**: The comparison included outcomes such as the failure to achieve complete resolution. In terms of reducing erythema, both the initial and long-term decreases in the erythema score were evaluated. An analysis of pruritus score reduction was also included, along with failure to achieve complete resolution of erythema.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory dermatosis with an ambiguous pathophysiology involving the overcolonization of Malassezia, combined with predisposing factors. These include sebocyte activity, impaired immunity with diminished T-cell responses and activation of complements, disruption of epidermal barrier integrity and skin microbiota, and various environmental influences.

### Exosome therapy for chronic severe seborrheic dermatitis: A case report [^115uowSk]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory skin condition marked by scaly, red lesions, typically in areas with high sebum production, such as the scalp, face, trunk, and skin folds. SD is a chronic disease that can be well-controlled with available therapies but has no definitive cure. Initial treatments often include topical antifungals and corticosteroids; however, these frequently relapse and present adherence challenges, especially in severe or resistant cases. Prolonged corticosteroid use can also cause complications like skin thinning, perioral dermatitis, and telangiectasia, driving the need for alternative therapies. Treatment typically depends on SD severity.

- **Management of mild-to-moderate cases**: These are managed with topical corticosteroids, antifungals (e.g. ciclopirox and ketoconazole), and keratolytics like propylene glycol. For facial and body areas, additional options include calcineurin inhibitors, clotrimazole, and lithium succinate.

- **Severe or resistant cases**: These may require systemic antifungals like terbinafine or itraconazole, and UV-B phototherapy.

Recent advancements such as exosome-based therapy have gained significant attention due to the natural, cell-derived characteristics of extracellular vesicles, particularly exosomes, which are lipid bilayer vesicles of 40–150 nm in size. Exosomes carry a range of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA, reflective of their parent cells, and play a crucial role in disease pathogenesis through intercellular signaling. These can be administered either topically or via injection.

### Seborrheic dermatitis in skin of color: Clinical considerations [^114NC3Ex]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, relapsing, inflammatory skin condition of unclear etiology. The Malassezia yeast genus is believed to play a role. Seborrheic dermatitis commonly affects areas of the skin with high sebum production, including the scalp, nasolabial folds, glabella, eyebrows, beard, ears, retroauricular skin, sternum, and other skin folds. The condition may present differently in individuals with skin of color. Darker-skinned individuals may present with scaly, hypopigmented macules and patches in typical areas of involvement. Arcuate or petal-like patches may be seen, specifically termed petaloid seborrheic dermatitis.

Children of color often do not experience the classic "cradle cap" appearance of seborrheic dermatitis and instead have erythema, flaking, and hypopigmentation of the affected areas and folds of skin. Seborrheic dermatitis tends to respond well to conventional treatments, although it tends to recur. Patients with skin of color may require a modified treatment approach that takes into account differences in hair texture and hair washing frequency. This paper aims to highlight these differences to help reduce disparities in the management of seborrheic dermatitis in patients of color.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^115DYSWi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

We conducted sensitivity analyses on two comparisons: 'ketoconazole versus placebo' and 'ketoconazole versus steroids'. We planned to evaluate differences in outcomes based on adequate randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. However, we found no study, or at most two studies, that presented a low risk of bias in these areas. Consequently, we refrained from drawing conclusions regarding the influence of risk of bias on review results.

- **Publication bias**: Funnel plots for the main comparisons containing sufficient studies did not reveal a strong indication of publication bias.

- **Grading of the evidence**: Only one study had no limitations regarding randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding of the outcome assessor (Dreno). Therefore, we downgraded the evidence for all comparisons on the basis of limitations in study design. For further downgrading decisions, see Table 1.

### Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp: Etiology and treatment [^115XB8Fi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common chronic infection of the lipid-rich areas of the skin. While seborrheic dermatitis has been a recognized clinical entity for decades, its etiology remains unclear. Early investigations into the development of seborrheic dermatitis focused on the role of Malassezia (previously Pityrosporum) yeasts. These yeasts are normal skin commensals, leading to doubts about their importance as pathogens in this disorder. However, it was later discovered that treating seborrheic dermatitis with an antifungal agent not only led to clinical improvement but also reduced the number of Malassezia yeasts on the skin. This finding renewed interest in the Malassezia yeasts. It has been hypothesized that there is an immunological component to seborrheic dermatitis, possibly representing an abnormal host response to the Malassezia yeasts. This paper discusses the role of Malassezia in the etiology of seborrheic dermatitis, as well as various treatment options.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117KTgcX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Given the extensive search and absence of language restrictions, we are confident that we located most of the studies on topical antifungal treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, we found sufficient evidence to draw conclusions only for ketoconazole-, ciclopirox-, and bifonazole-based treatments. For several classes of antifungals, no studies at all were conducted. Studies with long-term follow-up were particularly sparse. Various studies were carried out over a wide time span, with the oldest study dating back to 1985.

Many studies did not report our primary outcomes; when this occurred, we included studies that reported only our secondary outcomes. When studies were so poorly reported that we could not use the data in meta-analyses, we reported study findings in the text of this review. Studies used a wide range of doses and application modes of topical antifungal agents. We included studies on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp, and on dandruff, which is considered a mild form of seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we are confident that we have included all available evidence.

In most studies, participants were of widely ranging age groups and of both sexes. Results from most studies were given for all participants without stratification on the basis of sex, age, and so forth. Thus, we could not explore the role of these personal characteristics in treatment outcomes. Most studies used pregnancy as an exclusion criterion; therefore, it is unclear whether antifungals are efficacious in pregnant individuals.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117L7THS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis aims to achieve a remission of rashes, eliminate itching and burning sensations, reduce the severity of rashes, and prevent their recurrence. A variety of drug and non-drug treatments have been tried for seborrhoeic dermatitis. Antifungal and anti-inflammatory drugs are probably the most widely applied. Various preparations are available for topical and oral application.

Behavioral modifications such as frequent skin cleansing with soap, resolute commitment to personal hygiene, and frequent outdoor recreation, especially in summer, have been found to lessen the symptoms. Other therapeutic modalities include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, and coal tar, which are applied topically and function to soften and remove the thick hardened crusts that sometimes occur in seborrhoeic dermatitis. Recalcitrant cases of this skin problem have been managed with phototherapy, such as ultraviolet B phototherapy, as well as with isotretinoin therapy, which reduces sebaceous gland size and consequently sebum secretion.

In this review, we have focused on the more widespread topical application of antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, and ciclopirox, which are available as ointments, creams, gels, and shampoos.

- **How the intervention might work**: Based on the concept that *Malassezia* yeasts are involved in the pathogenesis of seborrhoeic dermatitis, antifungals have long been proposed as a treatment that confers similar benefits.

### The evolving role of therapeutic shampoos for targeting symptoms of inflammatory scalp disorders [^114Y5j4o]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Scalp lesions are common among patients with psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and several other inflammatory and fungal conditions. Topical corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment for many scalp dermatoses and significantly reduce erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Conventional corticosteroid formulations, such as creams and ointments, are often difficult or time-consuming for patients to apply and may produce undesirable cosmetic effects. Medicated shampoos provide a more convenient alternative for patients requiring topical administration of corticosteroids for scalp conditions.

Tar shampoos have long been used to treat psoriasis and are effective for the long-term maintenance of remission in patients who respond to therapy. Antifungal shampoos are effective for treating seborrheic dermatitis and other mycotic conditions. A shampoo formulation containing fluocinolone acetonide, 0.01%, is also approved for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. A superpotent corticosteroid shampoo, clobetasol propionate 0.05% (Clobex Shampoo), is approved in the United States for once-daily treatment of psoriasis of the scalp. The results of a 2007 pilot study demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo improved the signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. These findings suggest that high-potency corticosteroid shampoos may provide an important option for topical corticosteroid therapy in dermatologic conditions affecting the scalp.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: A double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^1118FcMC]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

The study on the efficacy of roflumilast foam in seborrheic dermatitis was published in 2023 in the journal JAMA Dermatology. This research examines the impact of roflumilast 0.3% foam on patients with seborrheic dermatitis.

- **Study design**: The study employed a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT) design.

- **Population**: The trial involved 226 patients, consisting of 110 females and 116 males.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Participants were adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis for at least 3 months and an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 3, with the condition affecting 20% or less of the body, including areas such as the scalp, face, trunk, and intertriginous regions.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Key exclusions included recent use (within 2 weeks before randomization) of topical antifungals, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, sulfur-based treatments, medical devices, crisaborole, azelaic acid, or metronidazole.

- **Interventions**: The interventions included 154 patients receiving roflumilast foam (a once-daily topical application of 0.3% roflumilast in emollient foam) and 72 patients receiving vehicle foam (once-daily topical application of vehicle foam without the active ingredient).

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was a significant increase in IGA success at week 8, observed in 73.8% of patients receiving roflumilast foam compared to 40.9% of those receiving the vehicle foam (absolute difference [AD] 32.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 18.5 to 45.7).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant additional outcomes were observed, though they were not detailed in this excerpt.
