## Question

Treatment for elevated lead

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of elevated lead levels across populations and severities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "elevated" blood lead by current reference values and clinical context. Then, I should verify the universal principle of source identification and exposure elimination. Next, I will stratify management by severity and population, including children, pregnant persons, and adults, and confirm chelation thresholds and agents. After that, I need to review supportive care, monitoring for rebound, and special scenarios like retained bullet fragments. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight controversies and evidence gaps, making sure each assertion is backed by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the thresholds that trigger action, because treatment decisions hinge on these cutoffs. The CDC's 2021 update set the blood lead reference value for children aged 1–5 years at 3.5 µg/dL to guide public health and clinical follow-up, while the USPSTF acknowledges that there is no safe level and rates screening evidence as insufficient for universal screening in asymptomatic children and pregnant persons, which affects how we operationalize "elevated" in practice [^115w7ByV] [^117X5UnQ]. Historically, chelation has been indicated at or above 45 µg/dL in children, and severe toxicity with encephalopathy is typically seen at levels exceeding 80–100 µg/dL, so I should keep those clinical anchors in mind as I proceed [^115aKgND] [^116vNkbk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy before addressing the foundation: source identification and exposure elimination are the cornerstone of management at all levels, and chelation without removing the source risks failure and rebound. I need to ensure that every plan includes a detailed environmental history, home inspection when indicated, and remediation of lead hazards, with nutritional optimization of iron, calcium, and zinc to reduce absorption and mitigate independent neurodevelopmental risks [^113hVqxr] [^112iFQLU] [^116MNjd8].

> Next, I should review management for children with BLLs below 3.5 µg/dL. Even at these low levels, I need to provide anticipatory guidance on exposure reduction, reinforce diet with adequate iron and calcium, and monitor development at well-child visits, because neurocognitive effects can occur without a threshold and early intervention may mitigate cumulative harm [^115w7ByV] [^112iFQLU] [^116MNjd8].

> For children with BLLs between 3.5 and 19 µg/dL, I should confirm that the approach remains focused on exposure reduction, nutrition, and follow-up testing rather than chelation. Wait, let me verify the timing of repeat testing: CDC recommends retesting based on age and exposure risk, and I should arrange environmental investigation and consider an abdominal radiograph if pica or paint chip ingestion is suspected, with bowel decontamination if radiopaque material is present [^112iFQLU] [^116MNjd8].

> For children with BLLs 20–44 µg/dL, I need to ensure a full medical evaluation, environmental intervention, and closer follow-up, while remembering that chelation lowers blood lead but has not demonstrated neurodevelopmental benefit in this range. The TLC trial showed a short-term BLL reduction with succimer without cognitive or behavioral gains at long-term follow-up, so I should avoid implying that chelation will reverse neurotoxicity here [^113hVqxr] [^112JHhb9] [^114T873A].

> For children with BLLs ≥ 45 µg/dL, I should confirm that chelation is indicated after source control, with hospitalization if symptomatic. Succimer (DMSA) is the first-line oral agent for children aged 1 year and older, with the standard 19-day course of 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days followed by every 12 hours for 14 days, and I must monitor for rebound and repeat courses if needed after a 2-week interval. If encephalopathy is present or BLL is very high, combination parenteral therapy with dimercaprol followed by calcium disodium EDTA is indicated, and I should coordinate with a medical toxicologist or pediatric environmental health specialist [^112YrvFV] [^116Sqdi3] [^1144nq6L] [^116vNkbk].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or lactating? I should double-check that chelation during pregnancy is generally avoided due to teratogenic concerns and that management emphasizes exposure elimination and close maternal–fetal monitoring. For severe poisoning near term, delivery may be prioritized over chelation to limit ongoing exposure, and breastfeeding should be paused until maternal BLLs decline to safer levels, with neonatal management individualized and often including chelation if cord or neonatal levels are elevated [^114AjmdQ].

> For adults, I need to ensure occupational and environmental source control and align with workplace standards. OSHA's historical return-to-work thresholds are far less protective than current medical guidance; many authorities recommend medical removal at BLLs around 20–30 µg/dL and consider chelation for levels ≥ 45 µg/dL, with CaNa2EDTA as the standard agent and dimercaprol added for severe cases or encephalopathy. I should confirm that repeated chelation may slow renal decline in patients with high-normal body lead burden, though this is outside routine occupational management and requires specialist oversight [^116irjcz] [^1144nq6L] [^1175rXdU] [^112gL4GU].

> I will now examine supportive care that applies across severities. Nutritional optimization with iron, calcium, and zinc can reduce absorption and support development, and I should screen for iron deficiency and treat it. I need to monitor for rebound after chelation because lead redistributes from bone to blood; scheduling venous BLL checks weekly after therapy and repeating courses after a 2-week break is prudent. Throughout, I should coordinate with public health for environmental remediation and provide developmental referrals for children at risk [^113hVqxr] [^116Sqdi3] [^112iFQLU].

> Let me consider special scenarios. Retained bullet fragments can leach lead over time; I should monitor BLLs for at least a year and consider chelation or surgical removal if levels rise or symptoms develop. In anuric patients, I should verify that CaNa2EDTA is dialyzable but only partially removed, so coordination with nephrology and toxicology is essential. During drug shortages, I need to adapt regimens and document rationale, ideally in consultation with regional poison control and pediatric environmental health specialists [^114eMygn] [^112Kb1iP] [^113YkG2c].

> Next, I should review the evidence on chelation efficacy and safety so I do not overstate benefits. The TLC trial demonstrated that succimer reduces BLLs without improving long-term cognitive outcomes in children with BLLs 20–44 µg/dL, and animal data suggest potential harm from chelation in the absence of elevated tissue lead, reinforcing that chelation is not benign and should be reserved for appropriately selected cases with careful monitoring [^112JHhb9] [^114T873A] [^111CDWAe].

> I should double-check the practical algorithm to ensure it aligns with guidelines. For any elevated BLL, confirm with a venous sample, identify and eliminate the source, and optimize nutrition. For BLLs 3.5–19 µg/dL, use case management and retesting; for 20–44 µg/dL, add intensive environmental intervention and medical evaluation; for ≥ 45 µg/dL, initiate chelation with succimer in children and consider combination parenteral therapy if encephalopathy is present or levels are very high, with inpatient care as indicated. Throughout, monitor for rebound and repeat chelation if needed, and coordinate with public health and specialists [^112iFQLU] [^116MNjd8] [^113hVqxr].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties and controversies transparently. There is no safe BLL for children, screening strategies vary by jurisdiction, and chelation does not reverse established neurocognitive injury, so primary prevention and early exposure elimination remain paramount. Evidence gaps persist regarding the net benefit of screening asymptomatic pregnant persons and the long-term renal and cardiovascular effects of chelation outside specific contexts, which should temper aggressive extrapolation beyond current indications [^111xnxjL] [^117X5UnQ] [^112JHhb9].

Treatment for elevated lead centers on **source removal** and **chelation therapy** for severe cases. Chelation is indicated for **BLL ≥ 45 µg/dL** in children [^112YrvFV] and adults, and for any BLL with severe symptoms or encephalopathy [^114eNUW5]. Succimer (DMSA) is first-line for children with BLL ≥ 45 µg/dL [^112YrvFV]; calcium disodium EDTA is used for higher levels or when oral therapy is not feasible [^1144nq6L]. Dimercaprol plus EDTA is used for **severe toxicity or encephalopathy** [^1144nq6L]. For mild elevations (BLL < 45 µg/dL), management is source removal, nutrition (iron, calcium), and monitoring [^113hVqxr]; chelation does not improve neurocognitive outcomes at low levels [^112JHhb9] [^112WCGoD]. Supportive care includes hydration, seizure control, and monitoring for rebound lead levels after chelation [^112bUFkg].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment decisions are guided by **BLL, age, symptoms, and exposure source**:

| **Blood lead level (bll)** | **Population** | **Indication for treatment** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 45 µg/dL | Children (≥ 1 year) | Chelation therapy [^112YrvFV] |
| ≥ 45 µg/dL | Adults | Chelation therapy |
| < 45 µg/dL | Children and adults | Source removal, nutrition, monitoring [^113hVqxr] [^114eNUW5] |
| Severe symptoms or encephalopathy | Any age | Immediate chelation therapy [^114eNUW5] |

---

## Chelation therapy

Chelation agents bind lead and enhance excretion; **indications, dosing, and monitoring** are critical:

| **Chelation agent** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Succimer (DMSA) | BLL ≥ 45 µg/dL in children ≥ 1 year | 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days, then every 12 hours for 14 days [^116Sqdi3] | CBC, liver enzymes, renal function, BLL rebound [^116Sqdi3] |
| Calcium disodium EDTA | BLL ≥ 45 µg/dL or when oral therapy not feasible | 1,000 mg/m²/day IV or IM for 5 days [^1144nq6L] | Renal function, electrolytes, BLL |
| Dimercaprol (BAL) + EDTA | Severe toxicity or encephalopathy | BAL 3–4 mg/kg IM every 4–6 hours; EDTA 1,000 mg/m²/day IV or IM [^1144nq6L] | Close monitoring in ICU |

---

## Non-chelation management

For BLL < 45 µg/dL, management focuses on **source removal**, nutrition, and monitoring:

- **Source removal**: Identify and eliminate lead sources (paint, water, soil, consumer products) [^111xnxjL].
- **Nutrition**: Ensure adequate iron, calcium, and zinc to reduce absorption [^111xnxjL].
- **Monitoring**: Regular BLL checks and developmental surveillance [^116MNjd8].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is essential, especially in severe cases, and includes **hydration** with IV fluids to maintain urine output and prevent dehydration [^1144nq6L], **seizure control** with benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants, and **rebound monitoring** with repeated BLLs after chelation due to redistribution from bone [^116Sqdi3].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Chelation is generally avoided; manage conservatively with source removal and monitoring.
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust chelation dosing and monitor renal function closely [^1144nq6L].
- **Occupational exposure**: Implement workplace safety, monitoring, and medical removal if indicated [^112oEYgY].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Chelation effectively reduces BLLs but **does not reverse neurocognitive effects** at low levels [^112JHhb9]; therefore, **early intervention and prevention** are critical [^112WCGoD].

---

Treatment for elevated lead entails **source removal**, nutrition, and chelation for severe cases, with supportive care and monitoring for rebound; **early intervention** and prevention are key to minimizing long-term effects.

### Screening for elevated lead levels in childhood and pregnancy: an updated summary of evidence for the US preventive services task force [^115SV9Bn]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In 1996, the US Preventive Services Task Force provided recommendations for routine screening of asymptomatic children and pregnant women for elevated blood lead levels. This review updates the evidence for the benefits and harms of screening and intervention for elevated blood lead in asymptomatic children and pregnant women.

Methods

We searched Medline, reference lists of review articles, and tables of contents of leading pediatric journals for studies published in 1995 or later that contained new information about the prevalence, diagnosis, natural course, or treatment of elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children aged 1 to 5 years and pregnant women.

Results

The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels among children and women in the United States, like that in the general population, continues to decline sharply, primarily because of marked reductions in environmental exposure, but still varies substantially among different communities and populations. Similar to the findings in 1996, our searches did not identify direct evidence from controlled studies that screening children for elevated blood lead levels results in improved health outcomes, and there was no direct evidence identified from controlled studies that screening improves pregnancy or perinatal outcomes. No new relevant information regarding the accuracy of screening for lead toxicity was identified during the update, and we did not identify evidence that demonstrates that universal screening for blood lead results in better clinical outcomes than targeted screening. Substantial new relevant information regarding the adverse effects of screening and interventions was not identified.

Conclusions

There is no persuasive evidence that screening for elevated lead levels in asymptomatic children will improve clinical outcomes. For those children who are screened and found to have elevated levels, there is conflicting evidence demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of early detection and intervention.

Importance

Elevated blood lead level is associated with serious, often irreversible, health consequences.

Objective

To synthesize evidence on the effects of screening, testing, and treatment for elevated blood lead level in pregnant women and children aged 5 years and younger in the primary care setting to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Elevated blood lead level, morbidity, mortality, clinical prediction tools, test accuracy, adverse events.

Results

A total of 24 studies (N = 11 433) were included in this review. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening vs no screening in children. More than 1 positive answer on the 5-item 1991 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) screening questionnaire was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 48% (95% CI, 31.4% to 65.6%) and specificity of 58% (95% CI, 39.9% to 74.0%) for identifying children with a venous blood lead level greater than 10 μg/dL (5 studies [n = 2265]). Adapted versions of the CDC questionnaire did not demonstrate improved accuracy. Capillary blood lead testing demonstrated sensitivity of 87% to 91% and specificity greater than 90%, compared with venous measurement (4 studies [n = 1431]). Counseling and nutritional interventions or residential lead hazard control techniques did not reduce blood lead concentrations in asymptomatic children, but studies were few and had methodological limitations (7 studies [n = 1419]). One trial (n = 780) of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) chelation therapy found reduced blood lead levels in children at 1 week to 1 year but not at 4.5 to 6 years, while another trial (n = 39) found no effect at 1 and 6 months. Seven-year follow-up assessments showed no effect on neuropsychological development, a small deficit in linear growth (height difference, 1.17 cm [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.93]), and poorer cognitive outcomes reported as the Attention and Executive Functions subscore of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (unadjusted difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -4.5 to 1.0]; adjusted P = 0.045) in children treated with DMSA chelation. Evidence was too limited to determine the accuracy of screening questionnaires or benefits and harms of treatment in pregnant women.

Conclusions and Relevance

Screening questionnaires were not accurate for identifying children with elevated blood lead levels. Chelating agents in children were not significantly associated with sustained effects on blood level levels but were associated with harms.

### Screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117X5UnQ]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Elevated blood lead levels in children are associated with neurologic effects such as behavioral and learning problems, lower IQ, hyperactivity, hearing problems, and impaired growth. In pregnant women, lead exposure can impair organ systems such as the hematopoietic, hepatic, renal, and nervous systems, and increase the risk of preeclampsia and adverse perinatal outcomes. Many of the adverse health effects of lead exposure are irreversible.

Objective

To update the 2006 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for elevated blood lead levels in children and pregnant women.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of elevated blood lead levels. In this update, an elevated blood lead level was defined according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference level of 5 μg/dL.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that questionnaires and other clinical prediction tools to identify asymptomatic children with elevated blood lead levels are inaccurate. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that capillary blood testing accurately identifies children with elevated blood lead levels. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of treatment of elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children 5 years and younger and in pregnant women. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence regarding the accuracy of questionnaires and other clinical prediction tools to identify asymptomatic pregnant women with elevated blood lead levels. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening for or treatment of elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. The USPSTF concluded that the current evidence is insufficient, and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children 5 years and younger and in pregnant women cannot be determined.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic pregnant persons.

### Lead poisoning in children [^115aKgND]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The prevalence and severity of childhood lead poisoning have been greatly reduced since the removal of lead from paint and gasoline in the 1970s. Despite these efforts, approximately 310,000 U.S. children younger than five years have elevated blood lead levels. Health care professionals should perform targeted screening for lead poisoning in children who are Medicaid-enrolled or -eligible, foreign born, or identified as high risk by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) location-specific recommendations or by a personal risk questionnaire. Venous sampling is the preferred method for measuring blood lead levels, but a carefully collected finger-stick sample is an acceptable alternative. Capillary samples of elevated levels should be confirmed by a venous sample. The CDC recommends that the threshold for follow-up and intervention of lead poisoning be a blood lead level of 10 microg per dL or higher. Recommendations for treatment of elevated blood levels include a thorough environmental investigation, laboratory testing when appropriate, iron supplementation for iron-deficient children, and chelation therapy for blood lead levels of 45 microg per dL or more. Prevention consists of education and avoidance of lead-contaminated products.

### The scientific basis for chelation: animal studies and lead chelation [^111CDWAe]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

This presentation summarizes several of the rodent and non-human studies that we have conducted to help inform the efficacy and clinical utility of succimer (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccincinic acid) chelation treatment. We address the following questions: (1) What is the extent of body lead, and in particular brain lead reduction with chelation, and do reductions in blood lead accurately reflect reductions in brain lead? (2) Can succimer treatment alleviate the neurobehavioral impacts of lead poisoning? And (3) does succimer treatment, in the absence of lead poisoning, produce neurobehavioral deficits? Results from our studies in juvenile primates show that succimer treatment is effective at accelerating the elimination of lead from the body, but chelation was only marginally better than the complete cessation of lead exposure alone. Studies in lead-exposed adult primates treated with a single 19-day course of succimer showed that chelation did not measurably reduce brain lead levels compared to vehicle-treated controls. A follow-up study in rodents that underwent one or two 21-day courses of succimer treatment showed that chelation significantly reduced brain lead levels, and that two courses of succimer were significantly more efficacious at reducing brain lead levels than one. In both the primate and rodent studies, reductions in blood lead levels were a relatively poor predictor of reductions in brain lead levels. Our studies in rodents demonstrated that it is possible for succimer chelation therapy to alleviate certain types of lead-induced behavioral/cognitive dysfunction, suggesting that if a succimer treatment protocol that produced a substantial reduction of brain lead levels could be identified for humans, a functional benefit might be derived. Finally, we also found that succimer treatment produced lasting adverse neurobehavioral effects when administered to non-lead-exposed rodents, highlighting the potential risks of administering succimer or other metal-chelating agents to children who do not have elevated tissue lead levels. It is of significant concern that this type of therapy has been advocated for treating autism.

### Lead poisoning in children [^111FE8RD]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic lead poisoning has become more common in children. Blood lead levels of less than 5 µg per dL are associated with impairments in neurocognitive and behavioral development that are irreversible. Risk factors for lead poisoning include age younger than five years, low socioeconomic status, living in housing built before 1978, and use of imported food, medicines, and pottery. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a recommendation in 2019 citing insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of universal screening for elevated blood lead levels in asymptomatic children and pregnant women. Local risk factors can be substantial, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that states and cities formulate their own targeted screening guidelines. In the absence of local guidance, the CDC recommends screening all Medicaid-eligible children at 12 months and again at 24 months, or at least once between 36 and 72 months if not previously screened. The CDC also recommends universal screening in areas where more than 27% of the housing was built before 1950, or where at least 12% of children 12 to 36 months of age have blood lead levels greater than 10 µg per dL. Life-threatening lead levels are treated with chelation therapy, and lower levels should prompt case management and environmental investigations to identify and remove the source of exposure. Primary prevention strategies are essential to eliminate the harmful effects of lead on child development.

Therapeutic Approaches for Treating Neurobehavioral Effects of Lead Exposure

Treatment with lead-chelating agents has been the primary mode of therapy for treating lead-poisoned children since the 1950s, but the metric for gauging therapeutic efficacy has changed over time. When lead-chelating agents were first implemented for clinical use, they were often deployed in the treatment of symptomatic children, some exhibiting signs of lead-induced encephalopathy. The chelating agents used at that time, including CaNa 2 EDTA, are credited with dramatically reducing the mortality rate in such children. Fortunately, blood lead levels of children have declined dramatically over the past 50 + years (though exposure disparities remain), and lead-induced encephalopathy is rare, particularly in developed countries. However, in light of the evidence that even slightly elevated lead levels are associated with impaired cognitive functioning in children, there remains pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at low exposure (blood lead) levels.

### Very high blood lead levels among adults-United States, 2002–2011 [^114sF8hV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Reducing lead exposures at work and in the community is essential to avoid adverse health effects in humans. Reducing by 10% the rate of persons who have elevated BLLs (i.e. BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL) from work exposures is a Healthy People 2020 objective (OHS-7). The 2010 baseline rate for BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL is 26.4 adults per 100,000 employed adults. Reducing adverse health effects resulting from lead exposures requires 1) adherence to engineering controls and safe work practices; 2) BLL testing and management of elevated BLLs according to the most current medical guidelines and recommendations; and 3) education in the workplace and community. OSHA lead standards give the examining physician broad flexibility to tailor special protective procedures to the needs of individual employees. Therefore, the most current guidelines for management of lead-exposed adults should be implemented by the medical community at the current CDC reference BLL of 10 μ g/dL, including consideration of removal from lead exposure at lower levels than the current OSHA lead standards require. Increasing the number and timeliness of referrals to OSHA of workplaces identified by state ABLES programs fosters prompt intervention and mitigation of lead exposure hazards.

What is already known on this topic?

The vast majority of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in the United States are workplace-related. Most lead exposures at work occur in the manufacturing, construction, services, and mining industries. Current research has found that even BLLs < 10 μ g/dL can cause harm in adults. CDC considers BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL to be elevated. In contrast to the CDC reference level, prevailing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standards allow workers removed from lead exposure to return to lead work when their BLL falls below 40 μ g/dL.

What is added by this report?

Data collected by the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance program during 2002–2011 identified 11,536 adults with very high BLLs (≥ 40 μ g/dL), of whom 19% had elevated BLLs recorded during ≥ 2 years. Among those with known exposure source, occupational exposures accounted for 91% of adults with very high BLLs.

### Elevated blood lead levels associated with retained bullet fragments-United States, 2003–2012 [^1129W38j]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Symptoms resulting from elevated BLLs can vary widely and are often nonspecific, including fatigue, abdominal pain, and memory loss. As of 2004, fewer than 100 cases of lead toxicity caused by RBFs had been reported in the medical literature. During 2003–2012, elevated BLLs associated with RBFs constituted 0.3% of all elevated BLLs and 4.9% of BLLs ≥ 80 μ g/dL. Elevated BLLs associated with RBFs occurred predominantly among males aged 16–24 years in nonoccupational settings. The population identified in this study differs from the population exposed to lead in occupational settings, where cases are identified through a mechanism of routine lead exposure screening. However, adult males without an occupational exposure, including those with RBFs, would likely only be screened if they seek care for symptoms related to elevated BLLs, or as part of routine care for other purposes, if suspicion is raised by a medical provider. In addition, a low index of suspicion of lead toxicity by medical providers might result in a delay in diagnosis, and patients might receive multiple incorrect diagnoses before receiving correct assessment and treatment. Furthermore, BLLs can fluctuate in persons with RBFs. A person with a low BLL at the time of testing can have an increase in BLL and become symptomatic when RBFs migrate, such as into a joint space.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, not all states report to ABLES, and persons with RBFs are often not tested; therefore, these data should be considered minimum estimates of the magnitude of the problem. Second, the reporting requirement varies by state and ranges from requiring reporting of all BLLs to only those ≥ 40 μ g/dL. Third, before 2007, work-related RBFs were not systematically identified through ABLES; identification of adults at risk for lead exposure is limited primarily to certain groups at high risk and universal blood lead screening is not standard practice. Finally, only some states provided 10–24 μ g/dL BLL data. The possibility exists that some reporting states might not have investigated patients with BLLs 10–24 μ g/dL or determined the location where lead exposure occurred, thereby resulting in omission or misclassification of RBF cases.

Persons with elevated BLLs with an unknown exposure source can be queried about RBFs. Patients with RBFs might benefit from counseling on lead and its health effects, and the importance of baseline and periodic BLL monitoring.

### Early-life low lead levels and academic achievement in childhood and adolescence [^1166Cb3L]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Children's exposure to lead has long been recognized as harmful to their health and neurodevelopment. Lead biologically disrupts and damages brain and neurological development. Lead exposure has been associated with long-term adverse cognitive, mental, physical, and social outcomes. Globally, nearly 5.5 million cardiovascular-related deaths among adults and 765 million lost IQ points among children below 5 years of age in 2019 were associated with lead exposure.

National and international public health authoritative bodies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization, acknowledge that there are no safe levels of lead. Such organizations provide guidelines based on thresholds for blood lead levels that are considered high enough to warrant retesting, assessment of lead exposure sources, parent education about lead exposure, and in cases of high lead levels, treatment of children for these levels. During the past few decades, these thresholds have become lower as the mean lead blood level and the proportion of children with high blood levels steadily declined, owing to a range of health and housing policies aimed at eliminating or reducing lead exposure from homes, canned food, water, gasoline, and other sources. Because of these policies and reduced exposure to lead, the mean lead blood level among children aged 1 to 5 years in the US declined from 15.2 to 0.83 μg/dL between 1976 through 1989 and 2011 through 2016 based on samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Nonetheless, lead continues to affect many children and adults worldwide. In 2015, over half of the US population was estimated to have been exposed to high lead levels in early childhood.

### Public and occupational health risks related to lead exposure updated according to present-day blood lead levels [^115jndwb]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

This 2018 NHANES report (Table 1), based on historical blood lead (1988–1994), has little relevance for public health policies in the third decade of the twenty-first century for the following reasons. First, the blood lead levels recorded in NHANES III are not representative of current lead exposure. To a large extent, these levels reflected the recirculation of lead from earlier bone stores, which in many participants accrued from the first decades of the twentieth century onward, when lead was still highly prevalent in the environment in the United States. In our analyses of 12,725 NHANES IV participants examined from 2003 to 2010, the geometric mean blood concentration in all participants was 1.41 µg/dl, with lower levels in women than men (1.25 vs. 1.80 µg/dl) and in Whites than in Blacks and Hispanics (1.46 vs. 1.57 µg/dl). All blood lead levels were below 30 µg/dl. Second, PAF was calculated as the proportional decline in mortality that would occur if the blood lead concentrations of all participants were reduced to a reference level of 1.0 µg/dl or less, which is an unfeasible target, given lead exposure from natural sources and food. This very low null-effect blood lead concentration substantially inflated the hazard ratios and PAFs associated with blood lead. Third, hypertension as the causal pathway linking mortality to environmental or occupational lead exposure is a deeply rooted paradigm, based on research dating back more than half a century ago. The NHANES III report itself argued against this mechanistic pathway, given that models accounting for hypertension and hypertension treatment or adjusted for systolic and diastolic blood pressure as continuously distributed variables barely affected the hazard ratios (Table 1). Along similar lines, in a meta-analysis of summary statistics extracted from 31 studies involving 58,518 participants, all published before February 2001, doubling of blood lead was only associated with a marginally higher blood pressure. The pooled estimates averaged 1.0 mmHg (CI, 0.5–1.4 mmHg) systolic and 0.6 mmHg (CI, 0.4–0.8 mmHg) diastolic. Furthermore, in a prospective population study of 728 individuals (50.7% women; age range, 20–82 years), blood pressure was measured conventionally at baseline (1985–1989) and at follow-up (1991–1995) and by 24-h ambulatory monitoring at follow-up. Over a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range, 3.5–8.4 years), the geometric mean blood lead concentration dropped by 32% from the baseline level of 8.7 µg/dl (range, 1.7–72.5 µg/dl). The small changes in the systolic/diastolic blood pressure on conventional measurement (−1.5/+1.7 mmHg) were unrelated to the blood lead concentration at baseline or to the changes in this exposure biomarker over follow-up. Similarly, the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was not associated with blood lead at baseline or follow-up. A recent NHANES report with data from 1999–2016 included 30,467 participants aged 20–79 years. Non-Hispanic Black men (n = 3006) had the highest mean blood lead level (2.20 μg/dl), compared with 3814 Hispanic men (2.18 μg/dl) and 6989 non-Hispanic White men (1.89 μg/dl). A similar ethnic gradient in blood lead was observed among women: 1.49 μg/dl in 3256 non-Hispanic Black women, 1.30 μg/dl in 4130 Hispanic women, and 1.30 μg/dl in 7078 non-Hispanic White women. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, hypertension was not associated with blood lead (odds ratio, 1.002; CI, 0.983–1.021).

### Chelation for heavy metals (arsenic, lead, and mercury): protective or perilous? [^113eLfyv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Despite clinical experience that spans more than half a century, chelation for toxic heavy metals represents one of the most controversial and misapplied interventions in clinical toxicology. The prompt use of chelating agents to treat acute, life-threatening intoxication is an indication that is largely supported by experimental animal data and limited clinical research. Although chelating agents administered for chronic intoxication may accelerate the excretion of heavy metals, their therapeutic efficacy in terms of decreased morbidity and mortality is largely unestablished. Recent investigations suggest that their use in such settings might be associated with deleterious effects. Careful attention to risk-benefit issues is warranted, particularly in clinical situations in which the etiological role of heavy metals in the patient's illness is in question.

### Who to test? A retrospective study of lead testing in high-risk children [^114SeMCp]. Clinical Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nearly all pediatric patients in our setting meet high-risk criteria for lead exposure based on screening recommendations and guidelines. Implementation of screening and testing has been inconsistent.

Objective

To assess the utility and efficacy of performing universal lead testing between ages 1 and 5 at an urban academic pediatric practice.

Methods

Retrospective review of patients with routine lead testing between 2010 and 2015. Key variables included demographics, serum lead level, and behavioral diagnoses.

Results

A total of 6597 serum lead levels from 3274 patients were reviewed. Forty-seven samples (0.7%) from 24 patients (0.7%) were elevated. Of the 24 patients with elevated lead, 75% were identified at age 1 or 2. Sixty-seven percent of patients with first elevated lead level at age 3 or older had a diagnosis of developmental delay.

Conclusion

Routine testing of high-risk patients yielded minimal specificity in identifying elevated lead levels, especially in patients older than 3 years and without developmental delay.

### Role of chelation in the treatment of lead poisoning: discussion of the treatment of lead-exposed children trial (TLC) [^114gkcK4]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Lead exposure in children is one component leading to cognitive impairment. The Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children Trial (1994–2004) studied the effect of succimer in treating low levels of lead exposure (20–44 mcg/dL) in children 12 to 33 months old. While succimer was effective in reducing blood lead concentrations in the short term, treatment of blood lead levels did not result in any detectable improvement in a wide variety of measurements of cognitive or behavioral function. Furthermore, blood lead concentrations were not distinguishable between chelated and non-chelated individuals at 1 year. The most important treatment strategy is identification and termination of major sources of lead exposure.

### Blood lead levels in children aged 1–5 years-United States, 1999–2010 [^111SjVej]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

What are the implications for public health practice?

The greatest reductions in the proportion of children with elevated BLLs have been made over the past four decades in those racial/ethnic and income groups that had the highest BLLs. Persistent differences between the mean BLLs of different racial/ethnic and income groups can be traced to differences in housing quality, environmental conditions, nutrition, and other factors. Resources should be targeted to areas and communities where children are most at risk to achieve the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing mean BLLs for all children in the United States (EH 8.2).

The greatest reductions have occurred among children in racial/ethnic and income groups that historically were most likely to have BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL. These reductions reflect the impact of strategies coordinated and implemented at national, state, and local levels. They include elimination of lead in vehicle emissions, elimination of lead paint hazards in housing, reduction in lead concentrations in air, water, and consumer products marketed to children, and identification and increased screening of populations at high risk. However, the small numbers of NHANES participants with BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL means that national estimates of the prevalence of BLLs this high are unstable, and year-to-year changes in prevalence are difficult to interpret. In the 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 NHANES cycles, nine and six survey participants, respectively, aged 1–5 years had BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL.

Childhood exposure to lead can have lifelong consequences. The significant differences between the GM BLLs by race/ethnicity and income indicate a persistent disparity. In January 2012, ACCLPP observed that these disparities can be traced to differences in housing quality, environmental conditions, nutrition, and other factors designed to control or eliminate lead exposure.

CDC concurred with ACCLPP that primary prevention (i.e. ensuring that all homes are lead-safe and do not contribute to childhood lead exposure) is the only practical approach to preventing elevated BLLs in children. Prevention requires reducing environmental exposures from soil, dust, paint, and water, before children are exposed to these hazards. Efforts to increase awareness of lead hazards and nutritional interventions to increase iron and calcium, which can reduce lead absorption, are other key components of a successful prevention policy. Given the continued disparity in BLLs, resources should be targeted to those areas where children are most at risk. NHANES provides useful data for measuring progress towards eliminating high BLLs and ensuring that resources are targeted toward the most vulnerable children.

### Succimer (Chemet) [^116Sqdi3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Pretreatment Evaluations

Identify the source of lead in the pediatric patient's environment and eliminate the source prior to beginning treatment with CHEMET.
Assess the following before initiating treatment with CHEMET:
Blood lead concentration
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Ensure absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1500/mcL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]
Transaminases (AST/ALT) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]
Renal function with blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, urinary protein [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Patients who have previously received Edetate calcium disodium (CaNa2EDTA) with or without dimercaprol may receive CHEMET for subsequent treatment after an interval of four weeks.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage of CHEMET for pediatric patients with lead poisoning is 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m2orally every 8 hours for five days followed by 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m2orally every 12 hours for an additional 14 days [see Table 1 CHEMET Pediatric Dosing Chart]. Initiation of therapy at higher doses is not recommended. The total treatment course consists of 19 days.

After discontinuation of CHEMET, elevated blood levels and associated symptoms may return rapidly because of redistribution of lead from bone stores to soft tissues and blood. Assess blood lead concentration after the completion of a 19 day course and every week until stable. Repeated courses may be administered after two weeks off treatment if blood lead concentrations remain elevated. A minimum of two weeks between treatment courses is recommended unless blood lead concentrations indicate the need for more prompt treatment.

The safety of uninterrupted dosing longer than 3 weeks has not been established and is not recommended.

Dosage Modifications for Neutropenia

Monitor CBCs weekly.

If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is < 1200/mcL interrupt CHEMET.

Resume CHEMET when ANC has recovered to > 1500/mcL (or the patient's baseline count).
Immediately discontinue CHEMET for signs/symptoms of infection.
Only rechallenge patients who developed neutropenia with CHEMET therapy if the benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk.

### The challenges of treating lead toxicity during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113YkG2c]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite decades of environmental reform, legacy lead is a persistent health hazard within communities. Secondary prevention with screening for childhood lead exposure typically occurs at the 12-month and 24-month well visits, and early identification of toxicity is of vital importance to reduce morbidity and mortality. Over the past few years, there have been multiple challenges impacting the management of lead toxicity, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, a national shortage of the chelation agent CaNa2EDTA, and housing-related concerns that may result in re-exposure of lead before lead abatement. This report identifies the importance of lead screening and limitations that a pandemic has placed on health care while emphasizing access to care and community resources needs to be a priority.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^116D7bry]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Insights Provided by the Animal Model of Developmental Lead Exposure

Our study provides important insights into the benefits and risks of succimer chelation therapy and also highlights the ways in which animal models can further our understanding of these clinical conditions, in ways that are not possible from studies of humans alone. First, this study provides clear evidence that the administration of succimer, using a regimen sufficient to reduce brain lead levels, can lessen lead-induced impairments in learning ability, attention, and regulation of arousal and/or emotion. These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits caused by lead exposure. The primary area of dysfunction seen in the moderate-lead exposure group, impaired learning ability, was completely alleviated by succimer treatment. For the high-lead group, treatment with succimer provided a robust benefit on measures indicative of impaired regulation of arousal or affect — one of the most pervasive areas of impairment seen in this group, and a major cause of their impaired performance overall. However, for the high-lead group, succimer produced only a slight improvement in learning ability and did not lessen the deficient inhibitory control. The high-lead rats treated with succimer performed similarly to non-chelated low/moderate lead-exposed rats — consistent with their comparable brain lead levels — suggesting that a more prolonged succimer treatment may have further improved performance in the high-lead exposed animals.

In addition, the finding that succimer produced lasting adverse effects when administered to non-lead–exposed rats highlights the potential risks of administering succimer or other metal-chelating agents to children who do not have elevated body lead levels. This could be the situation in off-label uses of chelating agents, such as chelation therapy for autistic children who have no history of lead exposure. It is of significant concern that this type of therapy is being advocated as safe and effective for treating autism. It should be noted, however, that as a direct result of the findings from our animal model study, NIH made the decision to permanently halt an ongoing clinical trial of succimer chelation of children with autism. This is one of the very few examples where clinical practice was influenced by animal data alone, clearly illustrating the contribution and importance of studies with animal models.

### Lead pellet ingestion in 3 children: another source for lead toxicity [^115H6HmX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute ingestions of spherical lead ammunition foreign bodies such as bullets and lead shot can cause acute blood lead level elevations and clinical symptoms necessitating emergency department evaluations and sometimes treatment. This article presents 3 cases of children ingesting lead ammunition, all receiving gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination and chelation therapy for significantly elevated blood lead level. Case-specific exposures and treatments for the lead ammunitions are presented. Radiographs documented lead pellet ingestion in all 3 cases. Pediatric patients absorb lead from the GI tract more quickly than adults and may necessitate more urgent evaluation and treatment than adolescents/adults. More rapid GI absorption has the potential to result in possible irreversible neurotoxicity and neurocognitive deficits as well as behavioral changes. Failure of lead foreign bodies to pass from the GI tract may require more aggressive interventions for their removal to prevent ongoing absorption. Emergency health care providers should be aware of alternative lead sources besides the most common source of paint, as these lead foreign bodies also need urgent evaluation and possibly treatment.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^1111frn1]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Animal models play several key roles in studying links between neurotoxicant exposure and childhood behavioral disorders such as ADHD. First, they are critical for establishing causal relationships between exposure to a particular neurotoxicant and dysfunction in various cognitive and affective domains. Establishing definitive causal links is not possible in human epidemiological studies due to the challenges associated with exposure assessment, and in fully controlling for the multitude of sociodemographic risk factors, such as poverty, that are often correlated with neurotoxicant exposure. Second, following the successful development of an animal model which recapitulates the key phenotypic features of the behavioral disorder, such models can be used to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms and test the efficacy of potential therapies.

Our animal model studies of early developmental exposure to lead and manganese illustrate these contributions. Results from our animal model of developmental lead exposure provided the first evidence that chelation therapy can alleviate certain types of lead-induced cognitive dysfunction, which is an important contribution since the neurotoxic effects of early lead exposure are considered to be irreversible. Moreover, because we were able to measure the effects of the chelator on both cognitive functioning and brain lead levels, we were able to shed light on one possible reason for the disparate conclusions reached about the effectiveness of succimer chelation in the human and animal studies, i.e. in our rodent model study, chelation was effective in lessening the adverse cognitive effects of lead exposure, whereas the human clinical trial of this treatment found no benefit. Specifically, in our studies, cognitive benefits were seen with chelation, but only under conditions (lead exposure and chelation dose) where a substantial reduction in brain lead was achieved. The human clinical trial most likely did not achieve a sufficient reduction in brain lead to see a cognitive benefit, based on the small changes in blood lead that were observed. Finally, the finding that succimer produced lasting adverse effects when administered to non-lead–exposed rats highlights the potential risks of administering succimer or other metal chelating agents to children who do not have elevated tissue lead levels. This situation could occur with prolonged chelation of lead-exposed children or with the use of succimer in children (e.g. with autism spectrum disorder) without a history of lead exposure. It remains of significant concern that this type of therapy is being advocated as safe and effective for treating autism.

### Low-level cumulative lead and resistant hypertension: a prospective study of men participating in the veterans affairs normative aging study [^111XGMup]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosed hypertension continues to increase nationally, with ≈1 in 3 American adults affected. 1, 2 The burden of hypertension costs society significantly. In 2014, hypertension was the leading cause of > 410 000 deaths, with an estimated cost of $48.6 billion. 2 Furthermore, the prevalence of hypertension is expected to be > 40% of the US population by 2030. 3 Given the magnitude of impact hypertension has on society, scientists and clinicians are using a multipronged approach to examine environmental, behavioral, and genetic risk factors to screen at‐risk populations. Managing risk occurs in concert with optimizing medical management, with the most recent recommendations published by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force. 4

Despite rigorous clinical guidelines and risk mitigation, nearly half of people with hypertension lack appropriate control of their disease. 1 This can be attributed to insufficient medical therapy, medication nonadherence and, lifestyle behaviors. However, resistant hypertension, as defined by persistent blood pressure (BP) above target while taking 3 antihypertension medications or controlled by > 3 medications, remains a clinical burden. 5, 6 Epidemiologic studies estimate that up to 20% of patients with hypertension will meet criteria for resistant hypertension, although rigorous review demonstrates a prevalence closer to 9% to 12%. 6, 7 Behavioral factors, polypharmacy, pathophysiologic volume status, and secondary causes all contribute to the context that makes an individual resistant to proper pharmacotherapy for hypertension and subsequently at increased risk for cardiovascular mortality. 8, 9

Lead has been studied for its potential role in elevated and volatile BP. Prolonged exposure to lead has been found to portend the development of hypertension. 10 Cohort studies have linked blood lead levels to increased BP and hypertensive risk in England, Sweden, and the United States in both men and women. 11, 12, 13, 14 Recently, blood lead has been shown to be a possible attributable risk in > 400 000 cardiovascular‐related deaths annually. 15 While strong epidemiologic evidence has been present for decades linking lead to elevation in BP, recent basic science research has provided insight into the mechanism of lead‐induced hypertension. In vitro and in vivo work points to lead interfering with systemic and local BP control via activity of the renin‐angiotensin system, sympathetic system, and vasocontractility properties of endothelium. 16

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^115w7ByV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Policy Update

The BLRV is a population-based measurement which indicates that 2.5% of U.S. children aged 1–5 years have BLLs ≥ 3.5 μ g/dL. It is not a health-based standard or a toxicity threshold. The BLRV should be used as a guide to 1) help determine whether medical or environmental follow-up actions should be initiated for an individual child and 2) prioritize communities with the most need for primary prevention of exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention efforts. Whether a BLL measurement at or above the BLRV triggers medical or environmental follow-up will depend on existing jurisdictional laws, regulations, and resource availability. Follow-up lead testing to confirm BLLs is recommended. CDC strongly advises that providers follow CDC's Recommended Actions Based on Blood Lead Level.

### Lead encephalopathy presenting as status epilepticus: a case report [^116vNkbk]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Lead encephalopathy tends to occur in the setting of blood lead levels in excess of 80–100 mcg/dL, and results from disruption of the cerebrovascular endothelium, leading to capillary leak and subsequent cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. Along with removal from or of the source of exposure, lead encephalopathy management centers around meticulous critical care, management of increased intracranial pressure if it occurs, and combined parenteral chelation therapy with dimercaprol and calcium disodium EDTA. Body surface area (BSA) based dosing of the chelating agents is recommended and was used in our patient's case to avoid under-dosing.

Chelation therapy in our case was complicated by nationwide shortages of the two first line parenteral chelating agents, dimercaprol and calcium disodium EDTA, owing to the cessation of operations of Akorn pharmaceuticals and undisclosed reasons by Bausch Health, respectively. The poison center assisted the pharmacy in borrowing calcium disodium EDTA from a nearby hospital. Succimer was initiated on HD4, and due to delays in transport, calcium disodium EDTA was initiated on HD5. Dimercaprol replaced succimer on HD6 once it became available. Because calcium disodium EDTA has variable penetration across the blood brain barrier and interim guidance for management of lead encephalopathy or severe toxicity in the setting of dimercaprol unavailability has not been established, we propose it is reasonable to consider dual chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA and succimer at this time. Barriers to this substitution that our group experienced include lack of literature to support comparable efficacy of succimer administration via enteral feeding tubes.

A rebound increase in blood lead concentration is often seen after chelation therapy as lead stores in the soft tissue and bone are released and re-equilibration occurs, necessitating repeat treatments. To ameliorate the potential deleterious effects of such rebound, our patient was transitioned immediately to oral succimer after completion of combination parenteral therapy with calcium disodium EDTA and dimercaprol. While we believe this succeeded in blunting the rate of rise, our patient ultimately required several additional courses of chelation with succimer and calcium disodium EDTA for persistent blood lead level elevations.

In sum, we report a case of severe lead intoxication in a patient who presented with severe microcytic anemia and status epilepticus. We hope that this case will serve as a reminder to clinicians to consider this diagnosis in compatible clinical scenarios, as rapid recognition and treatment are essential to ensure neurologically intact survival.

### Folk prescription for treating rhinitis as a rare cause of childhood lead poisoning: a case series [^113jsEeM]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of lead intoxication

Despite intestinal and neurological symptoms the diagnosis of lead poisoning was delayed. Hepatotoxicity was observed in our patients as evidenced by elevated transaminase levels. Both DMSA and CaNa 2 EDTA can be hepatotoxic; pretreatment evaluation of liver function is necessary. With DMSA, a transient mild rise of hepatic transaminases is the most common adverse effect reported, generally resolving on discontinuation of treatment without long-term sequelae. Published studies on the frequency of this transaminase increase differ, varying between < 1.5 and 60% of patients. In a multicenter placebo controlled DMSA trial conducted in children with initial BLLs between 20 and 45 μg/dL, no difference in the rate of elevated ALT levels in treated versus untreated children was observed.

Although hepatic damage is not a common feature of childhood lead poisoning, animal studies have found that chronic lead poisoning caused mild histological and histochemical changes in the liver. The very high liver enzyme levels in case 3 delayed chelation. With the conservative approach taken, liver function recovered quickly and BLLs declined. Spontaneous excretion of lead in patients with acute lead poisoning may have a greater impact on BLLs than those with more chronic lead poisoning since lead has not had time to accumulate in bone.

### Severe lead poisoning requiring hospitalization: a case report [^115RfNnd]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Cases of severe childhood lead poisoning (a blood lead level (BLL) ≥ 45 mcg/dL) in the United States have decreased with time. Clinicians will encounter such cases only rarely. When such cases arise, however, recognizing their complexities and identifying resources that can help in management are important. We present here a case of severe childhood lead poisoning, highlighting the variable presentation, the rebound phenomenon of BLL after chelation, the usefulness of the zinc protoporphyrin as an adjunctive monitoring parameter, and the importance of early involvement of an inter-professional team.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^111xnxjL]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Blood lead concentrations have decreased dramatically in US children over the past 4 decades, but too many children still live in housing with deteriorated lead-based paint and are at risk for lead exposure with resulting lead-associated cognitive impairment and behavioral problems. Evidence continues to accrue that commonly encountered blood lead concentrations, even those below 5 µg/dL (50 ppb), impair cognition; there is no identified threshold or safe level of lead in blood. From 2007 to 2010, approximately 2.6% of preschool children in the United States had a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 µg/dL (≥ 50 ppb), which represents about 535000 US children 1 to 5 years of age. Evidence-based guidance is available for managing increased lead exposure in children, and reducing sources of lead in the environment, including lead in housing, soil, water, and consumer products, has been shown to be cost-beneficial. Primary prevention should be the focus of policy on childhood lead toxicity.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels [^115pQX5e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Lead is a common environmental contaminant, and exposure to lead is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the United States. Lead is associated with negative outcomes in children, including impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. In 1991, CDC defined the blood lead level (BLL) that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dL. Concurrently, CDC also recognized that a BLL of 10 microg/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL. This report summarizes the findings of a review of clinical interpretation and management of BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL conducted by CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. This report provides information to help clinicians understand BLLs ≤ 10 microg/dL, identifies gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outlines strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. In addition, this report summarizes scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead exposure risk assessment. To aid in the interpretation of BLLs, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within ± 2 microg/dL. Clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. As local and patient circumstances permit, clinicians should consider early referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and consider more frequent rescreening of children with BLLs approaching 10 microg/dL, depending on the potential for exposure to lead, child age, and season of testing. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health-care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.

### Lead and cadmium as cardiovascular risk factors: the burden of proof has been MET [^117D6nLp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The totality of evidence reviewed above supports the recognition of both lead and cadmium as environmentally acquired contaminants that increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in a dose‐dependent manner. In fact, a 2020 American Heart Association statement in American Indians and Alaska natives recognizes toxic metals as a risk factor for CVD. 69 These environmentally acquired metal contaminants may partially explain residual risk after traditional risk factors are taken into account. Past reductions in exposure to these metals have likely also contributed to reductions in cardiovascular mortality. However, as metal exposure remains widespread, additional efforts are needed. 70 Funding for public health efforts is urgently needed to develop infrastructure, in particular for handling wastewater and producing metal‐free drinking water, as ≈18 million people in the United States currently receive water through aged lead pipes, 71 and to decrease urban lead exposure in neighborhoods affected by lead contamination in homes and residential soil. Preventing metal exposure in children and young adults is critical, given the long‐term persistence of lead and cadmium in the body. As mentioned by Levin et al, new efforts are needed to rekindle government‐wide surveillance, for instance through an interagency task force under the guidance of the Environmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in monitoring and reporting lead exposures and trends. 72 Clinical interventions and drug development are also needed to block the toxic effects or facilitate the elimination of persistent metals. In 2017, environmental cardiologist Aruni Bhatnagar stated "though heart disease rates have been coming down, the rate has slowed and flattened out in the recent past. That is why we thought we need to try something different". 73 The evidence is strong that the time to recognize metal contaminants in the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of CVD is in the here and now.

One possible reason for the finding that succimer treatment was effective in alleviating certain areas of dysfunction but not others may relate to the sensitivity of particular functions to elevated brain lead levels, coupled with the efficacy with which a 3-week course of succimer chelation reduced brain lead. In this study, the fact that the lower lead (Mod-Pb) animals experienced only learning dysfunction, whereas the high-lead animals experienced learning, attentional, and affective dysfunction suggests that learning ability is sensitive to even slightly elevated brain lead levels, contrary to these other areas of functioning. One hypothesis is that the 3-week course of succimer reduced brain lead levels in the moderate-lead group to a level at which functional impairment is not seen. In contrast, this same succimer regimen reduced brain lead of the high-lead group only to the level seen in the non-chelated moderate-lead animals (data not shown, see). It seems likely that a more prolonged succimer regimen or multiple regimens may have further reduced brain lead in the high-lead group and consequently, their dysfunction. In sum, these data demonstrate that under conditions in which succimer significantly reduces brain lead levels, it effectively reduces the cognitive and affective deficits produced by lead exposure.

### Lead toxicity and genetics in flint, MI [^111cYAxj]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

It has been well established that lead poisoning, as defined by the CDC as blood lead levels (BLLs) at or above 5 μg/dl, can lead to long-term neurotoxic effects in children and requires immediate treatment. As such, the CDC has long recommended clinicians' assess to all patients for lead exposure and test BLLs for all at-risk patients. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognised that there is no safe level of lead for children due to the irreversible lifelong detrimental effects of lead exposure. Since the disaster of lead contaminated drinking water in Flint, MI has been uncovered, action has been taken to test children for lead poisoning. However, when children are tested and results show that lead levels are below the 5 μg/dl criteria no further follow-up is conducted with these children, as they are deemed 'healthy'. This practice is problematic, given that other studies have shown that blood lead levels, even at rates lower than the poison range can be detrimental to a child's health. The estimated population of Flint is ~99,002, with about 27% of the residents categorised as children under the age of 18 years. Therefore, more than ~26,730 children, of whom 60% are African Americans (N = 16,038), have been exposed to environmental lead in the drinking water.

### Committee opinion no. 533: lead screening during pregnancy and lactation [^113NTeKa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Prenatal lead exposure has known adverse effects on maternal health and infant outcomes across a wide range of maternal blood lead levels. Adverse effects of lead exposure are being identified at lower levels of exposure than previously recognized in both children and adults. In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the first guidelines regarding the screening and management of pregnant and lactating women who have been exposed to lead.

### Notes from the field: severe environmental contamination and elevated blood lead levels among children-Zambia, 2014 [^112kX6zS]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

In addition to soil testing, 196 children aged 2–8 years living within these communities were tested for blood lead using a LeadCare II blood testing system (Magellan Diagnostics, Inc. N. Billerica, Massachusetts) under the supervision of the district health center. The system uses capillary blood, and children's fingers were thoroughly cleaned before testing. The mean blood lead level (BLL) was 48.3 micrograms per deciliter (μ g/dL) of whole blood. The lowest BLL measured was 13.6 μ g/dL. The upper BLL of detection by the testing system is 65.0 μ g/dL; 52 (26.5%) readings exceeded that limit. The upper value for the CDC reference range for BLLs in children is 5 μ g/dL. CDC recommends that lead chelation therapy be considered when a child has a BLL ≥ 45 μ g/dL. * Previous World Bank funding provided modest case-management assistance and chelation therapy for severe cases of lead poisoning; however, such efforts have been suspended and are currently unavailable.

Reports of lead poisoning from mining, smelters, and battery processing operations in other low-income countries demonstrate the severity of lead poisoning in children. In a review of 242 studies of known chemically contaminated sites, lead was the primary contaminant in 57 (25%) studies, representing 8,345 exposed children.

The economically disadvantaged communities living near the former lead mining and smelting site in Kabwe are at significant risk from lead contamination. Additional hotspot remediation and mine tailings dust control measures should be considered as a primary preventive measure. More urgent is the implementation of a BLL surveillance and treatment program for affected children and behavioral and educational interventions to reduce the extent of the poisoning and prevent continued exposure.

### Effect of residential lead-hazard interventions on childhood blood lead concentrations and neurobehavioral outcomes: a randomized clinical trial [^115Bnfwx]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Childhood lead exposure is associated with neurobehavioral deficits. The effect of a residential lead hazard intervention on blood lead concentrations and neurobehavioral development remains unknown.

Objective

To determine whether a comprehensive residential lead-exposure reduction intervention completed during pregnancy could decrease residential dust lead loadings, prevent elevated blood lead concentrations, and improve childhood neurobehavioral outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This longitudinal, community-based randomized clinical trial of pregnant women and their children, the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, was conducted between March 1, 2003, and January 31, 2006. Pregnant women attending 1 of 9 prenatal care clinics affiliated with 3 hospitals in the Cincinnati, Ohio, metropolitan area were recruited. Of the 1263 eligible women, 468 (37.0%) agreed to participate and 355 women (75.8%) were randomized in this intention-to-treat analysis. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 interventions designed to reduce residential lead or injury hazards. Follow-up on children took place at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years of age. Data analysis was performed from September 2, 2017, to May 6, 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Residential dust lead loadings were measured at baseline and when children were 1 and 2 years of age. At 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years of age, the children's blood lead concentrations as well as behavior, cognition, and executive functions were assessed.

Results

Of the 355 women randomized, 174 (49.0%) were assigned to the intervention group (mean [SD] age at delivery, 30.1 (5.5) years; 119 [68.3%] self-identified as non-Hispanic white) and 181 (50.9%) to the control group (mean [SD] age at delivery, 29.2 [5.7] years; 123 [67.9%] self-identified as non-Hispanic white). The intervention reduced the dust lead loadings for the floor (24%; 95% CI, -43% to 1%), windowsill (40%; 95% CI, -60% to -11%), and window trough (47%; 95% CI, -68% to -10%) surfaces. The intervention did not statistically significantly reduce childhood blood lead concentrations (-6%; 95% CI, -17% to 6%; p = 0.29). Neurobehavioral test scores were not statistically different between children in the intervention group than those in the control group except for a reduction in anxiety scores in the intervention group (β = -1.6; 95% CI, -3.2 to -0.1; p = 0.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

Residential lead exposures, as well as blood lead concentrations in non-Hispanic black children, were reduced through a comprehensive lead-hazard intervention without elevating the lead body burden. However, this decrease did not result in substantive neurobehavioral improvements in children.

### Lead poisoning; a neglected potential diagnosis in abdominal pain [^111kmqKZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain is one of the leading reasons for seeking medical care in emergency and outpatient departments. Abdominal pain has a diverse diagnostic schema, which ranges from mild self-limiting conditions to life-threatening emergencies. It is believed 20–40% of abdominal pain etiologies remain unknown at the time of discharge. Lead toxicity is on the differential diagnosis for abdominal pain, albiet more often of a chronic nature. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that blood lead levels (BLLs) of greater than 5 mg/dL are elevated.

During the difficult time of an endemic or epidemic, premature closure of a diagnosis is exacerbated by anchoring, the tendency for clinicians to stick with the initial impression even as new information becomes available. Because of the broad differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, misdiagnosis may be minimized by a formalized approach. Anchoring is exacerbated during times such as the opium endemic in Iran. In order to avoid this diagnostic misadventure, clinicians must keep an open mind as to the diagnosis and use the iterative process of the differential diagnosis. By following a predetermined algorithm, diagnostic errors can be minimized.

Lead poisoning may occur from many situations, including occupational exposure (e.g. battery manufacturing workers, lead solder workers, automobile radiator repair, etc.), tile workers, and potters or paint chips. Lead-based paints before 1950, old pipes, house dusts, imported toys, and herbal and Ayurvedic medications are among the possible sources for lead poisoning. Lead poisoning is generally asymptomatic; however, it can present with abdominal pain, constipation, anemia, hearing loss, fatigue, neuropathy and neurotoxicity, encephalopathy, renal diseases, abortions, osteopenia, and even death.

Treatment of lead poisoning is centered on prevention, eliminating lead exposure, proper diet (rich in calcium and iron), education, and if indicated, treatment using chelating agents including (dimercaprol (BAL), calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa2 EDTA), succimer (DMSA,2–3 mesodimercaptosuccinic acid), and D-penicillamine).

### Long-term outcome of repeated lead chelation therapy in progressive non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases [^112gL4GU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research suggest that repeated lead-chelation therapy decelerates progression of renal insufficiency in non-diabetic (non-DM) patients with high-normal body lead burden (BLB). Study findings are limited by relatively short-term follow-up and small sample size.

Methods

A total of 116 non-DM patients with chronic kidney diseases (serum creatinine level of 1.5–3.9 mg/dl), high-normal BLB (> 60 microg and < 600 microg) and no lead exposure history were randomly assigned to a chelation or control group in this 4-year clinical trial. For 3 months, the 58 chelation group patients received initial lead-chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA, and the 58 control group patients received placebos. During the ensuing 48 months, repeated chelation therapy was administered weekly to chelation group patients unless, on repeated testing, BLB was < 60 microg; the control group patients received weekly placebo infusions for 5 weeks at 6-month intervals.

Results

Mean change in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the chelation group was -1.8 ± 8.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2), as compared with -12.7 ± 8.4 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in the control group (P < 0.0001) at study end. Chelation group rates of decline in the GFR was lower than that in the control group, although they had similar decline rates before chelation. At study end, 18 patients, including 15 control group patients, had elevated serum creatinine levels to two times the baseline values. Both Cox and Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated repeated chelation therapy was the important determining factor of progression of renal insufficiency.

Conclusions

Repeated chelation therapies can, over a four-year period, slow progression of renal insufficiency in non-DM patients with high-normal BLB.

### Edetate calcium disodium [^1144nq6L]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

When a source for the lead intoxication has been identified, the patient should be removed from the source, if possible. The recommended dose of edetate calcium disodium for asymptomatic adults and pediatric patients whose blood lead level is < 70 mcg/dL but > 20 mcg/dL (World Health Organization recommended upper allowable level) is 1,000 mg/m2/day whether given via intravenous infusion or intramuscularly (see Surface Area Nomogram).

For adults with lead nephropathy, the following dosing regimen has been suggested: 500 mg/m 2 every 24 hours for 5 days for patients with serum creatinine levels of 2 to 3 mg/dL, every 48 hours for 3 doses for patients with creatinine levels of 3 to 4 mg/dL, and once weekly for patients with creatinine levels above 4 mg/dL. These regimens may be repeated at one month intervals. 12

Edetate calcium disodium, used alone, may aggravate symptoms in patients with very high blood lead levels. When the blood lead level is > 70 mcg/dL or clinical symptoms consistent with lead poisoning are present, it is recommended that edetate calcium disodium be used in conjunction with BAL (dimercaprol). Please consult published protocols and specialized references for dosage recommendations of combination therapy.14–18

Therapy of lead poisoning in adults and pediatric patients with edetate calcium disodium is continued over a period of five days. Therapy is then interrupted for 2 to 4 days to allow redistribution of the lead and to prevent severe depletion of zinc and other essential metals. Two courses of treatment are usually employed; however, it depends on the severity of the lead toxicity and the patient's tolerance of the drug.

Edetate calcium disodium is equally effective whether administered intravenously or intramuscularly. The intramuscular route is used for all patients with overt lead encephalopathy and this route is preferred by some for young pediatric patients.

Acutely ill individuals may be dehydrated from vomiting. Since edetate calcium disodium is excreted almost exclusively in the urine, it is very important to establish urine flow with intravenous fluid administration before the first dose of the chelating agent is given; however, excessive fluid must be avoided in patients with encephalopathy. Once urine flow is established, further intravenous fluid is restricted to basal water and electrolyte requirements. Administration of edetate calcium disodium should be stopped whenever there is cessation of urine flow in order to avoid unduly high tissue levels of the drug. Edetate calcium disodium must be used in reduced doses in patients with pre-existing mild renal disease.

### Early-life low lead levels and academic achievement in childhood and adolescence [^113LYiEk]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The CDC has historically issued guidelines for blood lead levels. As stated by the CDC, these are not meant as health or toxicity standards but represent the population-based levels for the 2.5% of children in NHANES with the highest blood lead values. These thresholds are referred to as blood lead reference values. In 2021, the CDC lowered the threshold from 5 μg/dL or higher, which was in effect from 2012 to 2021, to 3.5 μg/dL or higher; these thresholds represent the 97.5th percentiles in 2015 through 2018 and 2007 through 2010 samples, respectively. Before 2012, the CDC had 10 μg/dL or higher as a level of concern.

The CDC and other authoritative public health agencies acknowledge that low blood lead levels can still be harmful for child development. However, current thresholds (and those before them) are also meant to guide government and public health (federal, state, and local) processes and resources for further interventions. For lead levels greater than or equal to 3.5 μg/dL, recommendations include additional management and intervention steps for reporting the test, assessing and investigating environmental exposure history, diet checks and assessments especially for calcium or iron deficiency, evaluating development, considering referral to additional services and specialists, and above certain thresholds (> 45 μg/dL) gastrointestinal tract decontamination.

### Decreases in young children who received blood lead level testing during COVID-19–34 jurisdictions, January-May 2020 [^115ovrEr]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

CDC identifies no safe BLL in children and considers a blood lead reference value (BLRV) of 5.0 μ g/dL* sufficient to prompt clinical and public health intervention. Among children aged < 6 years, very high BLL (> 70 μ g/dL) can cause neurologic problems (e.g. seizures or coma), organ failure, and death. Lower, but still elevated, BLL can affect the nervous system, causing permanent neurologic damage, behavioral disorders, and cognitive impairment. In the United States, the most common childhood lead exposures are from lead-based paint that was used in pre-1978 housing, † lead-contaminated soil or lead-containing pollutants from industrial sources, and water from old lead pipes and fixtures. Very young children might ingest lead dust or paint because of their tendency to put fingers or objects (toys or paint chips) in their mouths, and they more readily absorb lead because their bodies are rapidly developing. Primary prevention focuses on reducing lead exposures in homes, schools, and communities. Secondary prevention consists of BLL screening as part of routine well-child examinations. Early identification of children with lead exposure can help identify and eliminate lead sources (and future exposures for other children); reduce their BLL over time; and link children with high BLLs to medical, nutritional, and educational services. Medicaid-enrolled children are required to be screened at ages 12 and 24 months; many states have additional screening requirements.

In 1995, elevated BLLs became a nationally reportable condition. CDC funds 53 state and local childhood lead poisoning prevention programs to conduct ongoing surveillance of BLL testing among children. § During May and June 2020, CDC received anecdotal reports of declines in BLL testing. To understand BLL testing trends during the COVID-19 pandemic, including after a national emergency was declared in March 2020, CDC requested that state and local health departments report the total number of children aged < 6 years with BLL tests by month during January–May 2019 and January–May 2020. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. Health departments could also submit qualitative information. Based on the 2007–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and subsequent trends, an estimated 2.0% of children who did not have a BLL test were conservatively assumed to have levels exceeding the BLRV.

### Decreases in young children who received blood lead level testing during COVID-19–34 jurisdictions, January-May 2020 [^113g8ALA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Exposure to lead, a toxic metal, can result in severe effects in children, including decreased ability to learn, permanent neurologic damage, organ failure, and death. CDC and other health care organizations recommend routine blood lead level (BLL) testing among children as part of well-child examinations to facilitate prompt identification of elevated BLL, eliminate source exposure, and provide medical and other services. To describe BLL testing trends among young children during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC analyzed data reported from 34 state and local health departments about BLL testing among children aged < 6 years conducted during January–May 2019 and January–May 2020. Compared with testing in 2019, testing during January–May 2020 decreased by 34%, with 480,172 fewer children tested. An estimated 9,603 children with elevated BLL were missed because of decreased BLL testing. Despite geographic variability, all health departments reported fewer children tested for BLL after the national COVID-19 emergency declaration (March–May 2020). In addition, health departments reported difficulty conducting medical follow-up and environmental investigations for children with elevated BLLs because of staffing shortages and constraints on home visits associated with the pandemic. Providers and public health agencies need to take action to ensure that children who missed their scheduled blood lead screening test, or who required follow-up on an earlier high BLL, be tested as soon as possible and receive appropriate care.

### Succimer (Chemet) [^1171dJoC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In an attempt to control rebound of blood lead levels, 19 pediatric patients, ages 1 to 7 years, with blood lead levels of 42–67 mcg/dL, were treated with 350 mg/m2CHEMET every 8 hours for five days and then divided into three groups. One group was followed for two weeks with no further therapy, the second group was treated for two weeks with 350 mg/m2daily, and the third with 350 mg/m2every 12 hours. After the initial 5 days of therapy, the mean blood lead level in all subjects declined 61%. While the untreated group and the group treated with 350 mg/m2daily experienced rebound during the ensuing two weeks, the group who received the 350 mg/m2every 12 hours experienced no such rebound during the treatment period and less rebound following cessation of therapy.

In another study, ten pediatric patients, ages 21 to 72 months, with blood lead levels of 30–57 mcg/dL were treated with CHEMET 350 mg/m2every eight hours for five days followed by an additional 19–22 days of therapy at a dose of 350 mg/m2every 12 hours. The mean blood lead levels decreased and remained stable at under 15 mcg/dL during the extended dosing period.

In addition to the controlled studies, approximately 250 patients with lead poisoning have been treated with CHEMET either orally or parenterally in open U.S. and foreign studies.

### Lead toxicity in children: an unremitting public health problem [^112CTPfD]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lead is a pervasive environmental contaminant. Lead accumulates in the body, impairing a molecular level various cellular processes. Lead exposure during childhood causes adverse and permanent neurodevelopmental consequences, sometimes even with "low" blood lead levels. Symptoms are frequently silent, making lead exposure an often unrecognized and underestimated threat for pervasive neurocognitive disorders.

Methods

We identified articles focusing on childhood exposure to lead and neurodevelopment via a search of the electronic database PubMed (National Library of Medicine), including journal articles published from 2007 to 2019. These articles were used to evaluate the effect of environmental lead exposure and analyze whether control efforts over the past decades have altered the prevalence of exposed children.

Conclusions

Children are still being exposed to lead despite evidence of the adverse impact of exposure, even for children with blood lead levels below the currently recognized threshold for intervention. Legislative and educational efforts have reduced lead exposure but are not being followed universally. Primary prevention and identification of high-risk populations are the best cost-benefit interventions to fight this public health problem.

### Who tests for lead and why? A 10-year analysis of blood lead screening, follow-up and CNS outcomes in a statewide US healthcare system [^117XG6aU]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to determine (1) which providers in US healthcare systems order lead tests, why and at what frequency and (2) whether current patient population lead levels are predictive of clinical outcomes.

Methods

Retrospective medical record study of all blood lead tests in the Medical University of South Carolina healthcare system 2012–2016 and consequent evidence of central nervous system (CNS)-related disease across a potential 10-year window (2012–2022).

Results

Across 4 years, 9726 lead tests resulted for 7181 patients (49.0% female; 0–94 years), representing 0.2% of the hospital population. Most tests were for young (76.6% ≤ age 3) and non-Hispanic black (47.2%) and Hispanic (26.7%) patients. A wide variety of providers ordered tests; however, most were ordered by paediatrics, psychiatry, internal medicine and neurology. Lead levels ranged from ≤ 2.0µg/dL (80.8%) to ≥ 10µg/dL (0.8%; max 36µg/dL). 201 children (3.1%) had initial lead levels over the reference value for case management at the time (5.0µg/dL). Many high level children did not receive follow-up testing in the system (36.3%) and those that did often failed to see levels fall below 5.0µg/dL (80.1%). Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic patients were more likely to see lead levels stay high or go up over time. Over follow-up, children with high lead levels were more likely to receive new attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder diagnoses and new psychiatric medications. No significant associations were found between lead test results and new CNS diagnoses or medications among adults.

Conclusions

Hospital lead testing covers a small portion of patients but includes a wide range of ages, presentations and provider specialities. Lack of lead decline among many paediatric patients suggests there is room to improve provider guidance around when to test and follow-up.

### Lead exposure in children: prevention, detection, and management [^115yCKfw]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Fatal lead encephalopathy has disappeared and blood lead concentrations have decreased in US children, but approximately 25% still live in housing with deteriorated lead-based paint and are at risk of lead exposure with resulting cognitive impairment and other sequelae. Evidence continues to accrue that commonly encountered blood lead concentrations, even those less than 10 microg/dL, may impair cognition, and there is no threshold yet identified for this effect. Most US children are at sufficient risk that they should have their blood lead concentration measured at least once. There is now evidence-based guidance available for managing children with increased lead exposure. Housing stabilization and repair can interrupt exposure in most cases. The focus in childhood lead-poisoning policy, however, should shift from case identification and management to primary prevention, with a goal of safe housing for all children.

### Environmental lead exposure and progression of chronic renal diseases in patients without diabetes [^1175rXdU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Previous research suggests that environmental lead exposure correlates with age-related decreases in renal function.

Methods

Two hundred two patients with chronic renal insufficiency (indicated by a serum creatinine level between 1.5 mg per deciliter and 3.9 mg per deciliter) who had a normal total-body lead burden and no history of exposure to lead were observed for 24 months. After the observation period, 64 subjects with an elevated body lead burden were randomly assigned to the chelation control groups. For three months, the patients in the chelation group received lead-chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA, and the control group received placebo. During the ensuing 24 months, repeated chelation therapy was administered weekly to 32 patients with high-normal body lead burdens (at least 80 microg but less than 600 microg) unless on repeated testing the body lead burden fell below 60 microg; the other 32 patients served as controls and received weekly placebo infusions for 5 weeks every 6 months. The primary end point was an increase in the serum creatinine level to 1.5 times the base-line value during the observation period. A secondary end point was the change in renal function during the intervention period.

Results

The primary end point occurred in 24 patients during the observation period; the serum creatinine levels and body lead burden at base line were the most important risk factors. The glomerular filtration rate improved significantly by the end of the 27-month intervention period in patients receiving chelation therapy: the mean (± SD) change in the glomerular filtration rate in the patients in the chelation group was 2.1 ± 5.7 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, as compared with -6.0 ± 5.8 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area in the controls (P < 0.001). The rate of decline in the glomerular filtration rate in the chelation group was also lower than that in the controls during the 24-month period of repeated chelation therapy or placebo.

Conclusions

Low-level environmental lead exposure may accelerate progressive renal insufficiency in patients without diabetes who have chronic renal disease. Repeated chelation therapy may improve renal function and slow the progression of renal insufficiency.

### Protecting children from toxic exposure: three strategies [^113onAG4]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

To a toxicologist, "poisonings" are cases in which the child has a defined pattern of symptoms, corresponding to toxic effects at a mid to high level of exposure. "Toxicity" refers to a broader spectrum of effects. At lower levels of toxicity a child may have no specific, individual symptoms but may be affected subclinically. There are three basic strategies to protect children: individual intervention, the preventive medicine strategy, and the public health strategy. This article uses lead exposure as a model for discussing these differences in terminology and the three different protective strategies.

### Decreasing the cutoff for elevated blood lead (EBL) can decrease the screening sensitivity for EBL [^112vGyNP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Change in the definition of elevated blood lead (EBL) from greater than or equal to 10 μg/dL (cutoff A) to greater than or equal to 5 μg/dL (cutoff B) was recently endorsed in the United States. A potential effect of this change is to decrease the screening sensitivity for EBL detection. We demonstrate this effect by simulated sampling of an example patient distribution for lead. Using lead-dependent assay imprecision, simulated sampling of the patient distribution tracked individual misclassifications relative to the EBL cutoff. Decreasing the EBL cutoff from A to B reduced screening sensitivity for EBL detection in this population to less than 90%, a decrease of 4%. The result was due to the fact that, for B, a greater fraction of the EBL population was near the EBL cutoff and therefore subject to misclassification due to assay imprecision. The effect of the decreased EBL cutoff to reduce EBL screening sensitivity is likely to apply to EBL screening programs generally.

### Workplace lead exposure [^112oEYgY]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ACOEM recommendations for BLL worker monitoring and medical removal — "Defined as Airborne or Surface Lead Content Known or Reasonably Anticipated to Cause Elevated BLL" — specify "Baseline or preplacement medical history and physical examination, a baseline BLL, complete blood count, and serum creatinine before the worker is placed in a job with anticipated significant lead exposure", and that "Additional medical examinations may also be recommended periodically in specific workers". For lead workers, "BLL (measured in μg/dL) every 2 months for first 6 months of placement, or upon change to tasks resulting in higher exposure, then BLL every 6 months". For "Recommendations if BLL ≥ 20 μg/dL", remove from exposure if "repeat BLL measured in 4 weeks remains > 20 μg/dL, or if the first or any single value is BLL ≥ 30 μg/dL". For "Recommendations if BLL ≥ 30 μg/dL", "Remove from exposure immediately… In addition, monthly BLL testing needed. Consider return to lead work after two BLLs < 15 μg/dL, 1 month apart, then monitor as above".

We identified trials through electronic searches of CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to April Week 1 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 2), CINAHL (1937 to 20 Jan 2012), PsycINFO (1887 to Dec week 2 2011), ERIC (1966 to 17 Jan 2012), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to 20 January 2012), Science Citation Index (1970 to 20 Jan 2012), ZETOC (20 Jan 2012), LILACS (20 Jan 2012), Dissertation Abstracts (late 1960s to Jan 2012), ClinicalTrials.gov (20 Jan 2012), Current Controlled Trials (Jan 2012), Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Jan 2012) and the National Research Register Archive. We also contacted experts to find unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of household educational or environmental interventions to prevent lead exposure in children where at least one standardised outcome measure was reported.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed all eligible studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trialists to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included 14 studies (involving 2656 children). All studies reported blood lead level outcomes and none reported on cognitive or neurobehavioural outcomes. We put studies into subgroups according to their intervention type. We performed meta-analysis of both continuous and dichotomous data for subgroups where appropriate. Educational interventions were not effective in reducing blood lead levels (continuous: mean difference (MD) 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 0.12, I(2) = 0 (log transformed); dichotomous ≥ 10µg/dL (≥ 0.48 µmol/L): relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.30, I(2) = 0; dichotomous ≥ 15µg/dL (≥ 0.72 µmol/L): RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.09, I(2) = 0). Meta-analysis for the dust control subgroup also found no evidence of effectiveness (continuous: MD -0.15, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.11, I(2) = 0.9 (log transformed); dichotomous ≥ 10µg/dL (≥ 0.48 µmol/L): RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18, I(2) = 0; dichotomous ≥ 15µg/dL (≥ 0.72 µmol/L): RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.07, I(2) = 0.56). When meta-analysis for the dust control subgroup was adjusted for clustering, no statistical significant benefit was incurred. The studies using soil abatement (removal and replacement) and combination intervention groups were not able to be meta-analysed due to substantial differences between studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on current knowledge, household educational or dust control interventions are ineffective in reducing blood lead levels in children as a population health measure. There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of soil abatement or combination interventions. Further trials are required to establish the most effective intervention for prevention of lead exposure. Key elements of these trials should include strategies to reduce multiple sources of lead exposure simultaneously using empirical dust clearance levels. It is also necessary for trials to be carried out in developing countries and in differing socioeconomic groups in developed countries.

### Validation of a machine learning model to predict childhood lead poisoning [^112c3cG9]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite substantial reductions in lead hazards during the past decades, childhood lead poisoning remains a significant environmental health issue in the United States. An estimated 0.5% of children born in 2013 to 2014 have blood lead levels (BLLs) greater than the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference level of 5 μg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.0483). Elevated BLLs (EBLLs), even those below the current reference level, have been linked to neurobehavioral deficits, such as reduced intellectual and academic performance and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

The main intervention that public health agencies such as the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) use for lead poisoning is inspection of the home environment in cases of EBLL to identify and control hazards. This secondary prevention effort relies on reported exposure to trigger the intervention. However, no treatment has been found effective for reversing the effects of exposure. Thus the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics have called for primary prevention through proactive identification and remediation of hazards before a child develops an EBLL.

However, primary prevention is a challenge. In Chicago, 81% of the city's 1.2 million housing units were built before 1978, the year in which lead-based paint was banned, but few of these buildings have infants residing in them, and even fewer have reported cases of exposure. In 2017, only 1713 new EBLL (≥ 5 μg/dL) cases were reported, and 567 inspections were performed.

To overcome this challenge, prioritization of lead poisoning prevention resources to children most at risk of exposure has been proposed. A parsimonious regression model using county, median income, and housing age was developed in North Carolina. More recently, a machine learning model using BLL, housing, and demographic predictors at a range of spatiotemporal scales was developed for Chicago. The present study had 3 main objectives: first, to replicate the parsimonious regression model of lead poisoning using Chicago data; second, to validate the machine learning model by comparison with this regression model; and third, to pilot the targeting of lead poisoning prevention resources to children predicted to be most at risk of exposure.

### Update of the blood lead reference value-United States, 2021 [^1171mtW2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

HCPs play a vital role in addressing pediatric lead exposure by initiating recommended follow-up actions based on the child's BLL. The updated BLRV empowers HCPs to take earlier action to mitigate exposures for children aged 1–5 years with BLLs between 3.5 and 5 μ g/dL, who, before this update, would not have been recommended to receive these services for a BLL < 5 μ g/dL. Earlier recognition of lead exposure enables providers and families to intervene by stopping exposure that might otherwise result in higher BLLs, thus likely limiting or preventing potential adverse health effects.

Although there are practical challenges, HCPs who identify children with BLLs between 3.5 and 5 μ g/dL should strive to ascertain possible sources of exposure by taking an environmental history and providing nutritional counseling which can help decrease lead absorption. Before this update, these actions were not recommended to occur for BLLs < 5 μ g/dL. In addition, HCPs can provide guidance on exposure reduction, regardless of whether sources are identified, and link children to health departments for appropriate services. Follow-up testing using venous samples should be conducted after any remediation activities have taken place to ensure that exposure reduction was effective in addition to assessing developmental progress at regular intervals and providing referrals to supportive services as needed.

### Efficacy of succimer chelation of mercury at background exposures in toddlers: a randomized trial [^114y2Y2q]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether succimer, a mercaptan compound known to reduce blood lead concentration in children, reduces blood mercury concentration.

Study Design

We used samples from a randomized clinical trial of succimer chelation for lead-exposed children. We measured mercury levels in pre-treatment samples from 767 children. We also measured mercury levels in blood samples drawn 1 week after treatment began (n = 768) and in a 20% random sample of the children who received the maximum 3 courses of treatment (n = 67). A bootstrap-based isotonic regression method was used to compare the trend with time in the difference between the adjusted mean mercury concentrations in the succimer group and that in the placebo group.

Results

The adjusted mean organic mercury concentration in the succimer group relative to the placebo group fell from 99% at baseline to 82% after 3 courses of treatment (P for trend = .048), but this resulted from the prevention of the age-related increase in the succimer group.

Conclusion

Succimer chelation for low level organic mercury exposure in children has limited efficacy.

### Effect of chelation therapy on the neuropsychological and behavioral development of lead-exposed children after school entry [^114T873A]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Some children in the United States continue to be exposed to levels of lead that increase their risk for lowered intellectual functioning and behavior problems. It is unclear whether chelation therapy can prevent or reverse the neurodevelopmental sequelae of lead toxicity. The objective of this study was to determine whether chelation therapy with succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid) in children with referral blood lead levels between 20 and 44 microg/dL (0.96–2.12 micromol/L) at 12 to 33 months of age has neurodevelopmental benefits at age 7 years.

Methods

The Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted between September 1994 and June 2003 in Philadelphia, PA; Newark, NJ; Cincinnati, OH; and Baltimore, MD. Of 1854 referred children who were between the ages of 12 to 33 months and screened for eligibility, 780 were randomized to the active drug and placebo groups stratified by clinical center, body surface area, blood lead level, and language spoken at home. At 7 years of age, 647 subjects remained in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral succimer or placebo. Up to 3 26-day courses of succimer or placebo therapy were administered depending on response to treatment in those who were given active drug. Eighty-nine percent had finished treatment by 6 months, with all children finishing by 13 months after randomization. All participants received residential lead hazard control measures before treatment. TLC subjects also received a daily multivitamin supplement before and after treatment(s) with succimer or placebo. Scores on standardized neuropsychological measures that tap cognition, behavior, learning and memory, attention, and neuromotor skills were measured.

Results

Chelation therapy with succimer lowered average blood lead levels for approximately 6 months but resulted in no benefit in cognitive, behavioral, and neuromotor endpoints.

Conclusion

These new follow-up data confirm our previous finding that the TLC regimen of chelation therapy is not associated with neurodevelopmental benefits in children with blood lead levels between 20 and 44 microg/dL (0.96–2.17 micromol/L). These results emphasize the importance of taking environmental measures to prevent exposure to lead. Chelation therapy with succimer cannot be recommended for children with blood lead levels between 20 and 44 microg/dL (0.96–2.12 micromol/L).

### Very high blood lead levels among adults-United States, 2002–2011 [^114njyzZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Very high BLLs continue to be documented in adults in the United States. Actions that might decrease the number of adults with harmful BLLs include 1) increased employer efforts to reduce work-related lead exposure and to comply with current guidance for testing and managing lead-exposed workers; 2) adherence by lead-exposed workers to safe work practices, such as properly using personal protective equipment, washing before eating, and showering and changing clothes before going home; 3) education of the medical community to use current guidelines and recommendations for management of lead-exposed adults with BLLs ≥ 10 μ g/dL; and 4) increased involvement of the public health community to prevent nonoccupational lead exposures.

ACOEM position — workplace lead exposure: The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) believes that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) should update its lead standard and apply it to all workers with potential exposure by inhalation or ingestion, including documented elevations in air and blood lead level (BLL) metrics; any exposure anticipated to cause an elevated BLL is considered significant regardless of airborne dust, and OSHA revisions should include more protective action levels, permissible exposure limits (PELs) for airborne and surface lead dust, workplace hygiene requirements, and medical removal protection provisions.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^117NjNNt]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Secondary causes — environmental exposures and blood pressure: Several environmental exposures have been associated with higher childhood BP, with prominent exposures including lead, cadmium, mercury, and phthalates. For lead, long-term exposure in adults has been associated with higher BP in population studies and in studies of industrial workers with high lead exposure, although findings have not been consistent, and at least 1 cross-sectional study of 122 children demonstrated that children with higher blood lead concentrations had higher BP; furthermore, in a randomized study of lead-exposed children, those who received chelation with succimer did not have lower BP than those who received a placebo. Cadmium exposure has been linked to higher BP levels and the development of HTN in adults, particularly among women.

### Decreases in young children who received blood lead level testing during COVID-19–34 jurisdictions, January-May 2020 [^111MDVBy]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Approximately 500,000 fewer children in the reporting jurisdictions were tested for lead exposure during the first 5 months of 2020 than during the same period in 2019. Estimating from this finding, approximately 10,000 children with elevated BLL were missed because of decreased testing. Reported challenges to conducting follow-up medical visits and environmental investigations indicate delays in exposure elimination and linkage to critical services for these children. Although socioeconomic data were not collected, a disproportionate impact is anticipated among children at risk for increased lead exposure, including children from racial or ethnic minority groups, from families who have been economically or socially marginalized, and those living in older housing with lead-based paint. These groups have also been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lead testing trends among young children mirror declines in other pediatric medical services during the pandemic, including emergency department visits, well-child visits and screenings, §§ and orders for childhood vaccines and vaccination coverage. As a result of COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders and school closures, there is also concern that children spending more time in contaminated environments could have ongoing or increased exposure.

Although telemedicine and other remote service delivery strategies provide an alternative to office and clinic visits during the pandemic, in-person visits are still necessary for many essential health examinations, including BLL testing among children. During the pandemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that well-child examinations occur in person whenever possible and within the child's medical home where continuity of care can be established. CDC guidance recommends that health care providers identify children who have missed well-child visits or recommended vaccinations and contact them to schedule in-person appointments, with prioritization of infants, children aged < 24 months, and school-aged children. * It is important that health care providers ensure that all children receive lead testing, including those who missed routine BLL screening, those with prior elevated BLLs who need follow-up testing, and those with possible lead exposure. Collaborations among health departments; Special Supplementation Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children programs; immunization programs; Medicaid; refugee health organizations; and other health service providers for children at risk, including outreach to parents and providers and reminders to test children at risk for lead exposure, can help ensure that these children receive needed health assessments. States and local childhood lead poisoning prevention programs can examine data from blood lead surveillance and Medicaid to identify children in need of lead testing.

### Workplace lead exposure [^117V1GsU]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

OSHA standard — current thresholds and evidence gap: Many provisions apply only at an action level of airborne lead dust ≥ 30 μg/m3 as an 8-h time-weighted average, and mandatory medical removal may not apply until a worker's BLL equals 50 or 60 μg/dL, despite evidence of adverse effects even with BLLs in the range of 10 to 20 μg/dL; historically the U.S. geometric mean blood lead was 12.8 μg/dL, falling to 1.09 μg/dL by 2011–2012, and multiple groups have concluded that PELs and permissible BLLs under current OSHA standards are not protective.

### Spine injury [^114eMygn]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Penetrating spinal injury — retained bullet fragments and lead monitoring: Lead poisoning caused by retained lead bullet fragments is extremely rare. If concerned, monitor the patient's lead level for a year following the injury, and if the lead level is rising, consider treatment with chelation agents or removal of the fragment, if technically feasible.

### Interpreting and managing blood lead levels of less than 10 microg / dL in children and reducing childhood exposure to lead: recommendations of the centers for disease control and prevention advisory committee on childhood lead poisoning prevention [^114Xq3Z9]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Lead is a common environmental contaminant. Lead exposure is a preventable risk that exists in all areas of the United States. In children, lead is associated with impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, and physical abilities. In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined the blood lead level that should prompt public health actions as 10 microg/dL. Concurrently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recognized that a blood lead level of 10 microg/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful effects of lead. Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and mental development can be affected at blood lead levels of < 10 microg/dL. In this report we provide information to help clinicians understand blood lead levels < 10 microg/dL, identify gaps in knowledge concerning lead levels in this range, and outline strategies to reduce childhood exposures to lead. We also summarize scientific data relevant to counseling, blood lead screening, and lead-exposure risk assessment. To aid in the interpretation of blood lead levels, clinicians should understand the laboratory error range for blood lead values and, if possible, select a laboratory that achieves routine performance within ± 2 microg/dL. Clinicians should obtain an environmental history on all children they examine, provide families with lead-prevention counseling, and follow blood lead screening recommendations established for their areas. As circumstances permit, clinicians should consider referral to developmental programs for children at high risk for exposure to lead and more frequent rescreening of children with blood lead levels approaching 10 microg/dL. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between health care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.

### Household interventions for preventing domestic lead exposure in children [^115L8bCE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lead poisoning is associated with physical, cognitive and neurobehavioural impairment in children, and trials have tested many household interventions to prevent lead exposure. This is an update of the original review, first published in 2008.

Objectives

To assess the effects of household interventions for preventing or reducing lead exposure in children, as measured by improvements in cognitive and neurobehavioural development, reductions in blood lead levels and reductions in household dust lead levels.

Search Methods

In May 2016 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and two trials registers: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also checked the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted experts to find unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of household educational or environmental interventions, or combinations of interventions to prevent lead exposure in children (from birth to 18 years of age), where investigators reported at least one standardised outcome measure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed all eligible studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trialists to obtain missing information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 14 studies involving 2643 children: 13 RCTs (involving 2565 children) and one quasi-RCT (involving 78 children). Children in all studies were under six years of age. Thirteen studies took place in urban areas of North America, and one was in Australia. Most studies were in areas with low socioeconomic status. Girls and boys were equally represented in all studies. The duration of the intervention ranged from 3 months to 24 months in 12 studies, while 2 studies performed interventions on a single occasion. Follow-up periods ranged from 6 months to 48 months. Three RCTs were at low risk of bias in all assessed domains. We rated two RCTs and one quasi-RCT as being at high risk of selection bias and six RCTs as being at high risk of attrition bias. For educational interventions, we rated the quality of evidence to be high for continuous blood lead levels and moderate for all other outcomes. For environmental interventions, we assessed the quality of evidence as moderate to low. National or international research grants or governments funded 12 studies, while the other 2 did not report their funding sources. No studies reported on cognitive or neurobehavioural outcomes. No studies reported on adverse events in children. All studies reported blood lead level outcomes. We put studies into subgroups according to their intervention type. We performed meta-analyses of both continuous and dichotomous data for subgroups where appropriate. Educational interventions were not effective in reducing blood lead levels (continuous: mean difference (MD) 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 0.12, I² = 0%; 5 studies; N = 815; high quality evidence (log transformed); dichotomous ≥ 10.0 µg/dL (≥ 0.48 µmol/L): risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.30; I² = 0%; 4 studies; N = 520; moderate quality evidence; dichotomous ≥ 15.0 µg/dL (≥ 0.72 µmol/L): RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.09; I² = 0%; 4 studies; N = 520; moderate quality evidence). Meta-analysis for the dust control subgroup also found no evidence of effectiveness on blood lead levels (continuous: MD -0.15, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.11; I² = 90%; 3 studies; N = 298; low quality evidence (log transformed); dichotomous ≥ 10.0 µg/dL (≥ 0.48 µmol/L): RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18; I² = 0; 2 studies; N = 210; moderate quality evidence; dichotomous ≥ 15.0 µg/dL (≥ 0.72 µmol/L): RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.07; I² = 56%; 2 studies; N = 210; low quality evidence). After adjusting the dust control subgroup for clustering in meta-analysis, we found no evidence of effectiveness. We could not pool the studies using soil abatement (removal and replacement) and combination intervention groups in a meta-analysis due to substantial differences between studies, and generalisability or reproducibility of the results from these studies is unknown. Therefore, there is currently insufficient evidence to clarify whether soil abatement or a combination of interventions reduces blood lead levels.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on current knowledge, household educational interventions are ineffective in reducing blood lead levels in children as a population health measure. Dust control interventions may lead to little or no difference in blood lead levels (the quality of evidence was moderate to low, meaning that future research is likely to change these results). There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of soil abatement or combination interventions. No study reported on cognitive or neurobehavioural outcomes or adverse events. These patient-relevant outcomes would have been of great interest to draw conclusions for practice. Further trials are required to establish the most effective intervention for preventing lead exposure. Key elements of these trials should include strategies to reduce multiple sources of lead exposure simultaneously using empirical dust clearance levels. It is also necessary for trials to be carried out in low- and middle-income countries and in differing socioeconomic groups in high-income countries.

### Household interventions for secondary prevention of domestic lead exposure in children [^112RZA78]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lead exposure is a serious health hazard, especially for children. It is associated with physical, cognitive and neurobehavioural impairment in children. There are many potential sources of lead in the environment, therefore trials have tested many household interventions to prevent or reduce lead exposure. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of household interventions intended to prevent or reduce further lead exposure in children on improvements in cognitive and neurobehavioural development, reductions in blood lead levels and reductions in household dust lead levels.

Search Methods

In March 2020, we updated our searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 10 other databases and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched Google Scholar, checked the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted experts to identify unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of household educational or environmental interventions, or combinations of interventions to prevent lead exposure in children (from birth to 18 years of age), where investigators reported at least one standardised outcome measure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed all eligible studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trialists to obtain missing information. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 17 studies (three new to this update), involving 3282 children: 16 RCTs (involving 3204 children) and one quasi-RCT (involving 78 children). Children in all studies were under six years of age. Fifteen studies took place in urban areas of North America, one in Australia and one in China. Most studies were in areas with low socioeconomic status. Girls and boys were equally represented in those studies reporting this information. The duration of the intervention ranged from three months to 24 months in 15 studies, while two studies performed interventions on a single occasion. Follow-up periods ranged from three months to eight years. Three RCTs were at low risk of bias in all assessed domains. The other 14 studies were at unclear or high risk of bias; for example, we considered two RCTs and one quasi-RCT at high risk of selection bias and six RCTs at high risk of attrition bias. National or international research grants or governments funded 15 studies, while the other two did not report their funding sources. Education interventions versus no intervention None of the included studies in this comparison assessed effects on cognitive or neurobehavioural outcomes, or adverse events. All studies reported data on blood lead level outcomes. Educational interventions showed there was probably no evidence of a difference in reducing blood lead levels (continuous: mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.13 to 0.07; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 815 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; log-transformed data), or in reducing floor dust levels (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.24; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 318 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Environmental interventions versus no intervention Dust control: one study in this comparison reported data on cognitive and neurobehavioural outcomes, and on adverse events in children. The study showed numerically there may be better neurobehavioural outcomes in children of the intervention group. However, differences were small and the CI included both a beneficial and non-beneficial effect of the environmental intervention (e.g. mental development (Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II): MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.1 to 2.4; 1 study, 302 participants; low-certainty evidence). The same study did not observe any adverse events related to the intervention during the eight-year follow-up, but observed two children with adverse events in the control group (1 study, 355 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis also found no evidence of effectiveness on blood lead levels (continuous: MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.06; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 565 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; log-transformed data). We could not pool the data regarding floor dust levels, but studies reported that there may be no evidence of a difference between the groups (very low-certainty evidence). Soil abatement: the two studies assessing this environmental intervention only reported on the outcome of 'blood lead level'. One study showed a small effect on blood lead level reduction, while the other study showed no effect. Therefore, we deem the current evidence insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of soil abatement (very low-certainty evidence). Combination of educational and environmental interventions versus standard education Studies in this comparison only reported on blood lead levels and dust lead levels. We could not pool the studies in a meta-analysis due to substantial differences between the studies. Since the studies reported inconsistent results, the evidence is currently insufficient to clarify whether a combination of interventions reduces blood lead levels and floor dust levels (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on available evidence, household educational interventions and environmental interventions (namely dust control measures) show no evidence of a difference in reducing blood lead levels in children as a population health measure. The evidence of the effects of environmental interventions on cognitive and neurobehavioural outcomes and adverse events is uncertain too. Further trials are required to establish the most effective intervention for reducing or even preventing further lead exposure. Key elements of these trials should include strategies to reduce multiple sources of lead exposure simultaneously using empirical dust clearance levels. It is also necessary for trials to be carried out in low- and middle-income countries and in differing socioeconomic groups in high-income countries.

### Low-level cumulative lead and resistant hypertension: a prospective study of men participating in the veterans affairs normative aging study [^115tDxUh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Lead has been shown to interfere with the function of vasculature and endothelial cells through increases in renin‐angiotensin system and vasoconstricting prostanoids, in combination with decreases in the potent vasodilator, nitric oxide. 25 In vivo research has focused on the mechanism by which lead influences BP. Low levels of lead leads to a marked decrease in nitric oxide bioavailability secondary to anion superoxide production. Furthermore, lead upregulates renin‐angiotensin system activity via increased angiotensin‐converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor type 1, as well as greater production of cyclooxygenase‐derived prostanoids, which results in arterial contraction. 25 Vasoconstriction results in a further rise in BP.

In addition to effects on local vasodilatory properties and renin‐angiotensin system activity, lead levels can also cause desensitization of ß‐adrenergic receptors, which are widely distributed throughout the body. ß 2 ‐receptors serve as arterial targets, which result in vasodilation and a decrease in systemic BP upon activation. 26 In rat models of lead‐exposure and lead‐removal studies, in vivo analysis revealed a significant reduction in ß‐adrenergic receptor as the lead load became larger. 26, 27 Understanding the relationship by which cumulative lead deposition impedes control of hypertension can aid in assessing patient risk. 28 Furthermore, hypertensive risk can be reduced by effective lifestyle. 29 The addition of mitigating environmental risk factors, such as lead, that increase clinical risk of resistant hypertension may prove to be another piece of the puzzle in lowering the burden of hypertensive disease burden and complications.

Public health efforts to reduce lead exposure have been successful in lowering lead levels among all age demographics. 30, 31 However, clinical management remains largely targeted toward acute toxicity. 31 The threshold for acceptable blood lead levels is based off of historical population distributions, yet no known normal level exists. 32 With higher fidelity measurement devices, we can now determine the subtle way in which long‐term exposure to lead relates to poor health outcomes. This knowledge has prompted calls for lowering the threshold of acceptable lead levels and the level of intervention. 32, 33, 34 Vigilant screening and exposure reduction remains the primary method to reduce lead stores. 35, 36 Certain therapeutic interventions, such as calcium supplementation, may offer additional actionable items in reducing lead levels and pathologic sequelae. 37 The current study and other work demonstrating the relationship between lead and hypertension suggests that investigation into more aggressive screening, exposure reduction, and intervention at the individual level may prove beneficial in certain patients with high cardiovascular risk. 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 37, 38

### The effect of chelation therapy with succimer on neuropsychological development in children exposed to lead [^112JHhb9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Thousands of children, especially poor children living in deteriorated urban housing, are exposed to enough lead to produce cognitive impairment. It is not known whether treatment to reduce blood lead levels prevents or reduces such impairment.

Methods

We enrolled 780 children with blood lead levels of 20 to 44 microg per deciliter (1.0 to 2.1 micromol per liter) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of up to three 26-day courses of treatment with succimer, a lead chelator that is administered orally. The children lived in deteriorating inner-city housing and were 12 to 33 months of age at enrollment; 77 percent were black, and 5 percent were Hispanic. Follow-up included tests of cognitive, motor, behavioral, and neuropsychological function over a period of 36 months.

Results

During the first six months of the trial, the mean blood lead level in the children given succimer was 4.5 microg per deciliter (0.2 micromol per liter) lower than the mean level in the children given placebo (95 percent confidence interval, 3.7 to 5.3 microg per deciliter [0.2 to 0.3 micromol per liter]). At 36 months of follow-up, the mean IQ score of children given succimer was 1 point lower than that of children given placebo, and the behavior of children given succimer was slightly worse as rated by a parent. However, the children given succimer scored slightly better on the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment, a battery of tests designed to measure neuropsychological deficits thought to interfere with learning. All these differences were small, and none were statistically significant.

Conclusions

Treatment with succimer lowered blood lead levels but did not improve scores on tests of cognition, behavior, or neuropsychological function in children with blood lead levels below 45 microg per deciliter. Since succimer is as effective as any lead chelator currently available, chelation therapy is not indicated for children with these blood lead levels.

### Consensus of expert opinion for the diagnosis and management of hypermanganesaemia with dystonia 1 and 2 [^1149Prr3]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

This dosing is based on the treatment guidelines for lead exposure in children by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs.

With the lack of relevant clinical trial data available, there is limited evidence that the above chelation agents are efficient in chelating manganese ions and reducing brain manganese deposition. While some case reports suggest that D‐Penicillamine can lead to improvement of neurological symptoms to some extent, urinary excretion of manganese in response to D‐Penicillamine is minimal. 2,3 Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) has been reported to improve blood manganese levels and motor symptoms in nine patients with HMNDYT1, particularly in those with milder neurological phenotypes. However, of note, these patients were also given iron supplementation; hence, no conclusion can be made regarding the effectiveness of DMSA. Para‐aminosalicylic acid (PAS) has been shown effective in treating environmental manganese intoxication in some cases. There is limited experience of the use of PAS in inherited manganese transporter defects. A single attempt with a short course of PAS in treating a patient with HMNDYT1 did not lead to apparent clinical improvement (personal communication Dr. Maude Landry). Studies in both neuronal culture and rodent models suggest that PAS may have a dual action and act both as a chelator of manganese as well as an antioxidant. These characteristics, together with its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and oral bioavailability, make PAS a promising compound for further studies. There is a single case report of a patient with HMNDYT1 presenting predominantly with polycythaemia who was treated with Trientine with subsequent normalization of hemoglobin and reduction in serum manganese, accompanied by improved MRI brain appearances suggesting a reduction in Mn deposition.

Dietary restriction of manganese has been attempted in a patient with HMNDYT2 who received manganese‐free gastrostomy feeds. However, no effect on blood manganese levels was observed. This questions whether dietary manganese restriction is beneficial. Manganese is ubiquitously found in the diet; however, some foods are particularly high in manganese, including nuts, chocolate, shellfish, fruits, cereals, and tea. Therefore, an oral diet restricted in manganese is difficult to establish.

### Interpretation of population health metrics: environmental lead exposure as exemplary case [^113fddhF]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The association of the relative risk of death with blood lead was respectively computed for a 3.4-fold increment in the exposure biomarker (difference between the 20th and 80th percentiles of blood lead, 1.46 to 4.92 µg/dL)or for a 6.7-fold increase (difference between 10th and 90th percentiles, 1.0–6.7 µg/dL). A more credible approach would have been to compute relative risk for smaller increments in blood lead, such as a doubling. In an ongoing study of newly hired workers, employed at North American lead recycling plants, blood lead increased over 2 years about 3-fold from 4.1 to 13.7 µg/dL, making a 2-fold change in a nonoccupational setting a more reasonable quantity, given the current environmental lead exposure levels in the United States. Assuming a log-linear association between mortality and the logarithmically transformed blood lead concentration, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios given in Table 2 recalculated for 2.0-fold instead of a 6.7-fold increase in blood lead were 1.10 (CI, 1.05–1.15), 1.17 (CI, 1.08–1.27), and 1.24 (1.13–1.37), for total, cardiovascular and coronary mortality, respectively. This illustrates the enormous impact of desirable changes in the exposure variable on estimates of relative risk. Selecting an attainable blood lead target higher than 1 µg/dL would also have substantially attenuated the PAF and the number of preventable deaths, as unrealistically reported by Lanphear et al.

In this context, one should note that blood lead levels ranging from 1.94 to 3.62 µg/dL did not confer a significantly elevated 10-year risk of all-cause or cause-specific mortality compared with a blood lead concentration below 1.93 µg/dL (Table 1). In Figure 1 in the article by Lanphear, the 95% CIs of the hazard ratios for total, cardiovascular, and coronary mortality all indicated that relative risk was significantly greater than unity, even at blood lead levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 µg/dL, including 1150 participants with undetectable blood lead.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^117LvrhA]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Behavioral disorders involving attention and impulse control dysfunction, such as ADHD, are among the most prevalent disorders in children and adolescents, with significant impact on their lives. The etiology of these disorders is not well understood, but is recognized to be multifactorial, with studies reporting associations with polygenic and environmental risk factors, including toxicant exposure. Environmental epidemiological studies, while good at establishing associations with a variety of environmental and genetic risk factors, cannot establish causality. Animal models of behavioral disorders, when properly designed, can play an essential role in establishing causal relationships between environmental risk factors and a disorder, as well as provide model systems for elucidating underlying neural mechanisms and testing therapies. Here, we review how animal model studies of developmental lead or manganese exposure have been pivotal in (1) establishing a causal relationship between developmental exposure and lasting dysfunction in the domains of attention, impulse control, and affect regulation, and (2) testing the efficacy of specific therapeutic approaches for alleviating the lasting deficits. The lead and manganese case studies illustrate how animal models can advance knowledge in ways that are not possible in human studies. For example, in contrast to the Treatment of Lead Poisoned Children (TLC) human clinical trial evaluating succimer chelation efficacy to improve cognitive functioning in lead-exposed children, our developmental lead exposure animal model showed that succimer chelation can produce lasting cognitive benefits if chelation sufficiently reduces brain lead levels. In addition, this study revealed that succimer treatment in the absence of lead exposure produces lasting cognitive dysfunction, highlighting potential risks of chelation in off-label uses, such as the treatment of autistic children without a history of lead exposure. Our animal model of developmental manganese exposure has demonstrated that manganese can cause lasting attentional and sensorimotor deficits, akin to an ADHD-inattentive behavioral phenotype, thereby providing insights into the role of environmental exposures as contributors to ADHD. These studies have also shown that oral methylphenidate (Ritalin) can fully alleviate the deficits produced by early developmental Mn exposure. Future work should continue to focus on the development and use of animal models that appropriately recapitulate the complex behavioral phenotypes of behavioral disorders, in order to determine the mechanistic basis for the behavioral deficits caused by developmental exposure to environmental toxicants, and the efficacy of existing and emerging therapies.

### Possible effect of chelation treatment on metabolomic and lipidomic analysis in lead exposure [^1142o4Gn]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to examine patients with lead poisoning in terms of metabolomic profiles and bioactive lipids (oxysterols and sphingosine 1-phosphate [S1P]) before and after chelation therapy.

Methods

Consent was obtained from 42 individuals diagnosed with lead poisoning and blood and urine samples were collected before and after chelation therapy. The levels of 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), cholestan-3b,5a,6b-triol (Ctriol), and S1P were measured via LC-MS/MS. Metabolomic analysis was performed via GC-MS.

Results

7-KC and C-triol levels were detected higher before chelation therapy compared with after therapy (P < 0.001 for both). S1P levels were measured higher before the therapy. The results also showed that sphingolipid metabolism-related pathways were affected by lead toxicity as well as other related pathways.

Conclusion

This preliminary study showed that lipid metabolism is affected in lead exposure and chelation therapy is effective in reversing possible damage.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^115kiBko]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

While a primary goal of chelation therapy in treating lead-poisoned children is simply to reduce body lead burden, especially in sensitive target organs like the brain, there is also the expectation that reduced brain lead levels will reduce neurotoxicity and associated symptoms. However, surprisingly few studies have evaluated whether chelation therapy improves cognitive outcomes in children with sub-clinical lead poisoning. With respect to succimer, the most widely administered chelating agent for the treatment of lead-poisoned children, only one clinical trial conducted to date included cognitive outcomes. This study, referred to as the Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children (TLC) study, did not detect a benefit of chelation, relative to placebo, in children with blood lead levels between 20 and 44 µg/dL, treated at 12 to 33 months of age. Cognitive benefits from chelation were not seen at the 36-month follow-up or at age 7 years. Notably, these investigators included an assessment of intellectual attainment [the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence–Revised (WPPSI-R)], as well as a neuropsychological test battery [the Developmental neuropsychological assessment (NEPSY)] designed to identify neuropsychological deficits that interfere with learning, including attentional and executive functions. Also included were several parent and teacher rating scales designed to tap ADHD as well as behavioral conduct problems [the short form of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale–Revised (CPRS-R), and the Behavioral assessment system for children-parent rating scale (BASC) for parents and for teachers]. In contrast to the negative findings seen with chelation in this multi-center human clinical trial, a few animal studies suggested that succimer chelation therapy can improve behavioral outcomes caused by lead poisoning. In addition to our studies with numerous cognitive endpoints (, discussed below), several animal model studies reported that succimer normalized various behaviors altered by lead exposure, including forced-swim immobility, activity level, and habituation rate.

### Effect of chelation therapy on progressive diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and high-normal body lead burdens [^116bGVeo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A previous study in type 2 diabetic patients with high-normal body lead burdens showed that EDTA chelation therapy for 3 months slows progressive diabetic nephropathy during a 12-month follow-up. The effect of a longer course of therapy on kidney function decrease over a longer follow-up is not known.

Study Design

A 12-month run-in phase, then a randomized single-blind study with a 27-month intervention.

Setting & Participants

University medical center; 50 patients (serum creatinine, 1.5–3.9 mg/dL) with high-normal body lead burden (≥ 80- < 600 μg) were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups.

Intervention

The treatment group received weekly chelation therapy for 3 months to reduce their body lead burden to < 60 μg and then as needed for 24 months to maintain this level. The control group received placebo for 3 months and then weekly for 5 weeks at 6-month intervals for 24 months.

Outcomes

The primary end point was change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time. A secondary end point was a 2-fold increase in baseline serum creatinine level or the requirement for renal replacement therapy.

Measurements

Body lead burdens were assessed by EDTA mobilization tests and eGFR was calculated using the equation for Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.

Results

Mean baseline eGFRs in the treatment and control groups were similar. After 3 months of chelation therapy, the change in eGFR in the treatment group (+1.0 ± 4.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) differed significantly from that in the control group (-1.5 ± 4.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = 0.04). In the subsequent 24-month intervention, the yearly rate of decrease in eGFR (5.6 ± 5.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year) in the treatment group was slower than that (9.2 ± 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) per year; P = 0.04) in the control group. 17 (68%) control-group patients and 9 (36%) treatment-group patients achieved the secondary end point.

Limitations

Small sample size, not double blind.

Conclusions

A 27-month course of EDTA chelation therapy retards the progression of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients with high-normal body lead burdens.

### Recommendations for blood lead screening of medicaid-eligible children aged 1–5 years: an updated approach to targeting a group at high risk [^1154w8Jv]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Lead is a potent, pervasive neurotoxicant, and elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) can result in decreased IQ, academic failure, and behavioral problems in children. Eliminating EBLLs among children is one of the 2010 U.S. national health objectives. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate substantial decreases both in the percentage of persons in the United States with EBLLs and in mean BLLs among all age and ethnic groups, including children aged 1–5 years. Historically, children in low-income families served by public assistance programs have been considered to be at greater risk for EBLLs than other children. However, evidence indicates that children in low-income families are experiencing decreases in BLLs, suggesting that the EBLL disparity between Medicaid-eligible children and non — Medicaid-eligible children is diminishing. In response to these findings, the CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention is updating recommendations for blood lead screening among children eligible for Medicaid by providing recommendations for improving BLL screening and information for health-care providers, state officials, and others interested in lead-related services for Medicaid-eligible children. Because state and local officials are more familiar than federal agencies with local risk for EBLLs, CDC recommends that these officials have the flexibility to develop blood lead screening strategies that reflect local risk for EBLLs. Rather than provide universal screening to all Medicaid children, which was previously recommended, state and local officials should target screening toward specific groups of children in their area at higher risk for EBLLs. This report presents the updated CDC recommendations and provides strategies to 1) improve screening rates of children at risk for EBLLs, 2) develop surveillance strategies that are not solely dependent on BLL testing, and 3) assist states with evaluation of screening plans.

### Elevated blood lead levels in refugee children – new hampshire, 2003–2004 [^113BPffQ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

As a result of reductions in lead hazards and improved screening practices, blood lead levels (BLLs) in children aged 1–5 years are decreasing in the United States. However, the risk for elevated BLLs (≥ 10 microg/dL) remains high for certain populations, including refugees. After the death of a Sudanese refugee child from lead poisoning in New Hampshire in 2000, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS) developed lead testing guidelines to screen and monitor refugee children. These guidelines recommend 1) capillary blood lead testing for refugee children aged 6 months-15 years within 3 months after arrival in New Hampshire, 2) follow-up venous testing of children aged < 6 years within 3–6 months after initial screening, and 3) notation of refugee status on laboratory slips for first tests. In 2004, routine laboratory telephone reports of elevated BLLs to the New Hampshire Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (NHCLPPP) called attention to a pattern of elevated BLLs among refugee children. To develop prevention strategies, NHDHHS analyzed NHCLPPP and Manchester Health Department (MHD) data, focusing on the 37 African refugee children with elevated BLLs on follow-up for whom complete data were available. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that 1) follow-up blood lead testing is useful to identify lead exposure that occurs after resettlement and 2) refugee children in New Hampshire older than those routinely tested might have elevated BLLs. Refugee children in all states should be tested for lead poisoning on arrival and several months after initial screening to assess exposure after resettlement.

### Animal models of childhood exposure to lead or manganese: evidence for impaired attention, impulse control, and affect regulation and assessment of potential therapies [^116aPcuj]. Neurotherapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Animal Model of Developmental Lead Exposure, Attention and Impulse Control Impairment, and Therapeutic Efficacy of Succimer Chelation

Our lab has conducted numerous lead exposure studies with various exposure models, with the goal of specifying the nature of the cognitive and/or affective changes produced by early asymptomatic lead exposure, and providing a model system for studies designed to test potential therapies. Due to space constraints, we will focus on one large study that tested the effectiveness of the chelating agent succimer to ameliorate lead-induced cognitive deficits. This study, which was designed to parallel the Treatment of Lead Poisoned Children (TLC) multi-center placebo-controlled study on succimer efficacy to improve cognitive function in children, sought to determine whether treatment with a succimer regimen shown to produce significant reductions in blood and brain lead levels also lessens the lasting cognitive and affective changes that are produced by developmental lead exposure. It also aimed to determine whether succimer produces lasting cognitive and/or affective impairment when administered in the absence of lead exposure. Findings from the latter are important to gauge the safety of prolonged chelation regimens when treating lead-exposed children, as well as the safety of the drug in off-label uses with no evidence of lead poisoning (e.g. for treating autism), as advocated on numerous websites and organizations such as the American College for Advancement in Medicine. Overall, this study sheds light on the nature of the cognitive and affective changes produced by early lead exposure, provides one of the first tests of the efficacy of succimer chelation on cognitive outcomes in a rodent model, and provides the first evidence for lasting adverse effects of succimer chelation in a common off-label use of the therapy, namely for treating autism.

### Folk prescription for treating rhinitis as a rare cause of childhood lead poisoning: a case series [^116928nt]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Case 3

A 5-year-old boy had consulted the same TCM practitioner as in Cases 1 and 2 and was prescribed the same medication to be used twice a day for 7 days. Severe abdominal pain and vomiting followed. Prior to transfer to our hospital his initial laboratory data showed markedly elevated liver enzyme levels (ALT 1083 U/L, AST 972 U/L). No abnormality was found on abdominal x-ray. On examination, his liver was palpable 4 cm below the right costal margin. The BLL on admission was 105 μg/dL. The nasal spray contained 33.4% lead.

Chelation therapy was initially withheld because of the severely altered liver enzyme results as both drugs are potentially hepatotoxic. Initially, he received treatment aimed at improving liver function with glutathione and disodium glycyrrhetate (Table 1) and continued to receive these medications during the whole course of treatment. As his liver function tests improved, his BLL went down concomitantly, prior to chelation (Table 1, BLL of Day 1: 105 μg /dL; Day 4: 96 μg/dL; Day 8: 80 μg/dL) at which point chelation treatment was initiated with DMSA and CaNa 2 EDTA infusion (same usage as Case 1). The post-chelation lead level for this child was 34 μg/dL. No adverse events happened to all the three children.

### Succimer (Chemet) [^112bUFkg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of CHEMET in the treatment of lead poisoning in pediatric patients was established in a dose-ranging, actively controlled study of 15 pediatric patients aged 2 to 7 years with blood lead levels of 30–49 mcg/dL and positive CaNa2EDTA lead mobilization tests. Fifteen patients were assigned to a dose of 350 mg/m2or 233 mg/m2, or 116 mg/m2(5 patients per group) orally every 8 hours for 5 days. Six control patients received 1000 mg/m2/day CaNa2EDTA intravenously for 5 days. Following therapy, the mean blood lead levels decreased 78, 63, and 42% respectively in the three CHEMET treatment groups. The response of the 350 mg/m2every 8 hours (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) group was significantly better than that of the other CHEMET dose level groups as well as that of the control group, whose mean blood lead level fell 48%. Although other dosing regimens were used in the study described, only 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m2orally every 8 hours for five days followed by 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m2orally every 12 hours for an additional 14 days is the recommended dosage.

Patients experienced a rebound in blood lead levels after discontinuation of CHEMET. In these studies, after treatment with a dose of 350 mg/m2(10 mg/kg) every 8 hours for five days, the mean lead level rebounded and plateaued at 60–85% of pretreatment levels two weeks after therapy.

### Lead [^114aJAEr]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Children differ from adults in the relative importance of lead sources and pathways, lead metabolism, and the toxicities expressed. The central nervous system effects of lead on children seem not to be reversible. Periods of enhanced vulnerability within childhood have not consistently been identified. The period of greatest vulnerability might be endpoint specific, perhaps accounting for the failure to identify a coherent "behavioral signature" for lead toxicity. The bases for the substantial individual variability in vulnerability to lead are uncertain, although they might include genetic polymorphisms and contextual factors. The current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guideline of 10 micro g/dL is a risk management tool and should not be interpreted as a threshold for toxicity. No threshold has been identified, and some data are consistent with effects well below 10. Historically, most studies have concentrated on neurocognitive effects of lead, but higher exposures have recently been associated with morbidities such as antisocial behavior and delinquency. Studies of lead toxicity in experimental animal models are critical to the interpretation of nonexperimental human studies, particularly in addressing the likelihood that associations observed in the latter studies can be attributed to residual confounding. Animal models are also helpful in investigating the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms of the functional deficits observed in lead-exposed humans. Studies of adults who have been exposed to lead are of limited use in understanding childhood lead toxicity because developmental and acquired lead exposure differ in terms of the maturity of the organs affected, the presumed mechanisms of toxicity, and the forms in which toxicities are expressed.

Studies With Qualitative Outcomes of Chelation Therapy and Health Outcomes of in Patients With Prior Cardiovascular Disease

Overall, 17 suggested improved outcomes, † 5 reported no statistically significant effect of EDTA treatment, and 2 reported no qualitative benefit. Of the 10 studies reporting prevalence of diabetes, all 4 studies with prevalence of ≥ 25% suggested improved outcomes. Seventeen studies used disodium EDTA (Na 2 EDTA) as the chelating agent, ‡ 1 used calcium Na 2 EDTA, and 6 did not specify the EDTA salt used. A total of 11 of 17 of the studies using Na 2 EDTA indicated improved outcomes. The dose for the chelating agent ranged from 1 to 5 g. All RCTs used up to 3 g of Na 2 EDTA as the chelating agent, and 2 of 4 RCTs used a normal saline solution as the placebo.

Three studies analyzed urinary metal levels at baseline and posttreatment for lead. In 2 studies, lead was measured pretreatment and during follow‐up. Both studies indicated significant decreases in urinary lead from baseline to last point of follow‐up, with mean decreases of 8.40 μg/L (SD, 4.29 μg/L) (74.40% decrease)and 9.76 μg/g creatinine (SD, 13.48 μg/g creatinine) (58.04% decrease). In addition, one study also reported significant decrease in urinary cadmium following treatment, with a mean decrease of 0.34 μg/L (SD, 0.39 μg/L) (22.67% decrease). A third study measured urinary lead and cadmium immediately pretreatment and posttreatment at baseline and after the final infusion. After the first infusion, both urinary lead and cadmium significantly increased by 22.4 μg/g creatinine (SD, 15.17 μg/g creatinine) and 3.0 μg/g creatinine (SD, 1.59 μg/g creatinine), respectively. The corresponding increases following the last infusion were 7.2 μg/g creatinine (SD, 5.69 μg/g creatinine) for lead and 3.4 μg/g creatinine (SD, 1.94 μg/g creatinine) for cadmium.

### Individual-and community-level factors associated with detectable and elevated blood lead levels in US children: results from a national clinical laboratory [^113i7buL]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

No safe level of exposure to lead has been identified.

Objective

To evaluate individual- and community-level factors associated with detectable and elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional, retrospective study analyzed deidentified results from blood lead tests performed at a large clinical laboratory from October 1, 2018, to February 29, 2020. Participants were 1 141 441 children younger than 6 years living in all 50 US states and the District of Columbia who underwent blood lead testing during the study period. Children who underwent lead testing of unknown source and those with elevated BLLs who received capillary blood lead testing without confirmatory venous testing were excluded.

Exposures

Individual demographic categories included sex, age, and insurance type; community-level demographic categories included pre-1950s housing, poverty, predominant race and ethnicity, and geographical regions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Proportions of children with detectable (≥ 1.0 μg/dL) and elevated (≥ 5.0 μg/dL) BLLs, by exposure category.

Results

Of the 1 141 441 children (586 703 boys [51.4%]; mean [SD] age, 2.3 [1.4] years) in the study, more than half of the children tested (576 092 [50.5%; 95% CI, 50.4%-50.6%]) had detectable BLLs, and 21 172 children (1.9% [95% CI, 1.8%-1.9%]) had BLLs of 5.0 μg/dL or more. In multivariable analyses, children with public insurance had greater odds of having detectable BLLs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.01 [95% CI, 1.99–2.04]) and elevated BLLs (AOR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04–1.12]). The proportion of children with detectable and elevated BLLs increased significantly for progressive pre-1950s housing and poverty quintiles (P < .001). The odds of detectable BLLs were significantly higher among children in the highest vs lowest quintile of pre-1950s housing (AOR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.62–1.68]) and of poverty (AOR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.86–1.93]). A similar association was found for those with elevated BLLs, with an AOR of 3.06 (95% CI, 2.86–3.27) for the highest vs lowest quintile of pre-1950 housing and 1.99 (95% CI, 1.88–2.11) for the highest quintile of poverty. Children residing in zip codes with predominantly Black non-Hispanic and non-Latinx populations had higher odds of detectable BLLs (AOR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.11–1.15]) but lower odds for elevated BLL (AOR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.80–0.88]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that, despite progress in reducing pediatric lead exposure, substantial individual- and community-level disparities persist.

### Treatment of lead and arsenic poisoning in anuric patients-a case report and narrative review of the literature [^112Kb1iP]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

CaNa 2 EDTA has a molecular weight of 374 Da and the molecular weight of Pb-Na 2 EDTA complex is 542 Da. CaNa 2 EDTA is hydrophilic and has a small volume of distribution of 0.21 L/kg. The protein binding of EDTA in plasma is not well described, but ranges from 11 to 19%. These properties make CaNa 2 EDTA and its complexes theoretically ideal for extracorporeal removal. Despite this, however, a study demonstrated that a 4-h HD session with a high-flux dialysis membrane (even if the dialysis treatment continued to infinity) could only eliminate 60 to 65% of administered 1 g CaNa 2 EDTA and the rest of the administered compound could not be accounted for.

In reported cases of Pb poisoning in the setting of AKI and ESKF, clinical outcomes with CaNa 2 EDTA and various EBPs are largely favourable; only one patient death has been reported, and clinical manifestations induced by Pb poisoning in the remaining 9 patients had either resolved or improved. Negative outcomes have only been reported in a single older case series. In this report, 4 paediatric patients presented with encephalopathy and extremely elevated serum Pb levels, ranging from 7.72 to 14.97 umol/L (1.6 to 3.1 mg/g) as compared with 0.63 to 3.3 umol/L in the other reported cases. Although these patients had normal renal function, the severity of their presentation led to their treatment with 50 to 75 mg/kg of EDTA and adjunctive HD. In each of these patients, only 1 to 3.4 mg of chelated Pb were removed per HD session, probably due to the ineffectiveness of HD which was performed using a Kolff-Brigham rotating drum artificial kidney wound with 26 loops of cellophane. Unsurprisingly, two patients died and the other 2 remained significantly encephalopathic despite treatment.

### Very high blood lead levels among adults-United States, 2002–2011 [^115ATQJb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past several decades there has been a remarkable reduction in environmental sources of lead, improved protection from occupational lead exposure, and an overall decreasing trend in the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) in U.S. adults. As a result, the U.S. national BLL geometric mean among adults was 1.2 μ g/dL during 2009–2010. Nonetheless, lead exposures continue to occur at unacceptable levels. Current research continues to find that BLLs previously considered harmless can have harmful effects in adults, such as decreased renal function and increased risk for hypertension and essential tremor at BLLs < 10 μ g/dL. CDC has designated 10 μ g/dL as the reference BLL for adults; levels ≥ 10 μ g/dL are considered elevated. CDC's Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program tracks elevated BLLs among adults in the United States. In contrast to the CDC reference level, prevailing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) lead standards allow workers removed from lead exposure to return to lead work when their BLL falls below 40 μ g/dL. During 2002–2011, ABLES identified 11,536 adults with very high BLLs (≥ 40 μ g/dL). Persistent very high BLLs (≥ 40 μ g/dL in ≥ 2 years) were found among 2,210 (19%) of these adults. Occupational exposures accounted for 7,076 adults with very high BLLs (91% of adults with known exposure source) and 1,496 adults with persistent very high BLLs. Adverse health effects associated with very high BLLs underscore the need for increased efforts to prevent lead exposure at workplaces and in communities.

### Induction of labor at term for severe antenatal lead poisoning [^114AjmdQ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antenatal lead exposure is associated with multiple adverse maternal and fetal consequences. Maternal blood lead concentrations as low as 10 µg/dL have been associated with gestational hypertension, spontaneous abortion, growth retardation, and impaired neurobehavioral development. Current treatment recommendations for pregnant women with a blood lead level (BLL) ≥ 45 µg/dL include chelation. We report a successful case of a mother with severe gestational lead poisoning treated with induction of labor in a term infant.

Case Report

A 22-year-old G2P1001 female, at 38 weeks and 5 days gestation, was referred to the emergency department for an outpatient venous BLL of 53 µg/dL. The decision was made to limit ongoing prenatal lead exposure by emergent induction as opposed to chelation. Maternal BLL just prior to induction increased to 70 µg/dL. A 3510 g infant was delivered with APGAR scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 min. Cord BLL at delivery returned at 41 µg/dL. The mother was instructed to avoid breastfeeding until her BLLs decreased to below 40 µg/dL, consistent with federal and local guidelines. The neonate was empirically chelated with dimercaptosuccinic acid. On postpartum day 2, maternal BLL decreased to 36 µg/dL, and the neonatal BLL was found to be 33 µg/mL. Both the mother and neonate were discharged to an alternative lead-free household on postpartum day 4.

### Chelation therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease: a systematic review [^117NyPhG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Possible Role of EDTA in the Emerging Field of Environmental Cardiology

Numerous studies have linked metal exposure to CVD development. On entering the body, heavy metals, including lead and cadmium, affect multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms and result in downstream vascular changes. For example, elevated lead levels may cause a reduction in antioxidant effects, such as reduced glutathione activity, paraoxonase inactivation, and impaired calcium signaling, resulting in decreased ability of the cell to clear reactive oxygen species and free radicals as well as elevated expression of inflammatory markers. Similarly, cadmium has also been associated with reduced glutathione activity, cadmium‐induced cell death through apoptotic pathway activation, and DNA methylation, resulting in increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial cell death. Increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction have been previously associated with CVD. Epidemiological studies examining the role of heavy metals have also found that low‐level metal exposure is associated with adverse cardiovascular effects. EDTA chelation of heavy metals may therefore benefit patients with CVD through antioxidant effects by reducing toxic metal burden. Only 3 of the extracted studies measured metal levels following chelation. These 3 studies found decreases in lead levels, with 2 of the studies also reporting patient improvement following EDTA chelation.

In patients with diabetes, metal exposure can facilitate the worsening of vascular function. Numerous metals, including lead, cadmium, and arsenic, have been associated with a higher risk of diabetes onset because of their contribution to oxidative stress. The added benefit for patients with diabetes identified in this systematic review may stem from metal catalyzed oxygen chemistry promoting the formation of advanced glycation end products. Advanced glycation end products are oxidized, cross‐linked glucose molecules that interact with endothelial cells, contributing to increased inflammatory cytokine expression. These effects can subsequently contribute to subclinical changes, such as atherogenesis and hypertension, leading to clinical CVD effects. It is possible that EDTA reduces toxic metal burden and formation of oxidation products, thus improving patient outcomes more significantly among patients with diabetes. All of these hypotheses, however, must be taken cautiously, as they have not been demonstrated in patients.

### Assessing child lead poisoning case ascertainment in the US, 1999–2010 [^117XpiS8]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare prevalence estimates for blood lead level ≥ 10.0 μg/dL (elevated blood lead level [EBLL]) with numbers reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for children 12 months to 5 years of age from 1999 to 2010 on a state-by-state basis.

Methods

State-specific prevalence estimates were generated based on the continuous NHANES according to newly available statistical protocols. Counts of case reports were based on the 39 states (including the District of Columbia) reporting to the CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program during the study period. Analyses were conducted both including and excluding states and years of nonreporting to the CDC.

Results

Approximately 1.2 million cases of EBLL are believed to have occurred in this period, but 607000 (50%) were reported to the CDC. Including only states and years for which reporting was complete, the reporting rate was 64%. Pediatric care providers in 23 of 39 reporting states identified fewer than half of their children with EBLL. Although the greatest numbers of reported cases were from the Northeast and Midwest, the greatest numbers based on prevalence estimates occurred in the South. In southern and western states engaged in reporting, roughly 3 times as many children with EBLL were missed than were diagnosed.

Conclusions

Based on the best available estimates, undertesting of blood lead levels by pediatric care providers appears to be endemic in many states.

### Workplace lead exposure [^116mfEJA]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and lead exposure — thresholds for removal: ACOEM notes increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in populations with BLLs in the range of 10 to 20 μg/dL and, for pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant, believes that a lower threshold for medical removal should be mandated; it is medically inadvisable to continue exposures causing a BLL of more than 5 μg/dL, most physicians would recommend removal from further exposure, and maternal medical removal must occur when BLLs are more than 10 μg/dL.

### Lead encephalopathy presenting as status epilepticus: a case report [^112XTnEK]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for lead poisoning. The patient exhibited severe microcytic anemia, seizures, and developmental delay, each of which has a somewhat broad differential when considered independently. However, the combination led the clinicians to suspect lead poisoning and fortunately institute treatment rapidly.

This case, given availability of lead chelation therapies, is the first published to manage severe lead toxicity with encephalopathy with dual calcium disodium EDTA and succimer. Historically, succimer has been successfully utilized in severe lead toxicity in a resource limited setting. Thurtle et al. evaluated 148 succimer courses in patients with BLL > 120 mCg/dL, and found, similar to our case, that the first course of succimer was associated with the largest change in BLL compared to subsequent courses, and BLL rebound was seen in 82% succimer courses. Thurtle et al. also found monotherapy succimer elicited a decrease in BLL of approximately 25% overall and about 50% in hospitalized patients. In a similar case, published by Talbot et al. a 2 year old in the United Kingdom presented with febrile seizures and encephalopathy found to have a BLL of 364 mCg/dL (more than three-fold more than our patient) and was managed with monotherapy sodium edetate 75 mg/kg once daily. Despite declining lead levels (last documented BLL day 12 of admission or day 7 post sodium edetate in initiation between 40 and 80 mCg/dL), this patient ultimately did not make a neurological recovery and passed away.

### Recommended actions based… [^112iFQLU]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance CDC recommends testing blood for lead exposure. A patient's blood lead level is measured in micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood. Healthcare providers should follow recommendations based on initial screening capillary and confirmed venous BLLs. Learn more about the recommended actions after a blood lead level test. If the patient's BLL is < 3. 5 micrograms per deciliter
- Provide education about common sources of lead exposure and information on how to further prevent exposure.
- During well-child visits, check development to make sure age-appropriate milestones are being met.
- During well-child visits, discuss diet and nutrition with a focus on iron and calcium intake.
- Conduct follow-up blood lead testing at recommended intervals based on the child's age.
- Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires all children enrolled in Medicaid to get tested for lead at ages 12 and 24 months, or age 24.

If the patient's BLL is 20–44 micrograms per deciliter
- Follow the recommendations above for BLL is 3. 5–19 μg/dL.
- Perform a complete history and physical exam, assessing the child for signs and symptoms related to lead exposure.
- Arrange for or refer the family for an environmental investigation of the home and a lead hazard reduction program.
- Consider performing an abdominal X-ray to check for lead-based paint chips and other radiopaque foreign bodies. This is important for young children who tend to swallow or eat non-food items. Children may also put their mouths on surfaces that could be covered with lead dust. Initiate bowel decontamination if indicated. If the patient's BLL is ≥ 45 micrograms per deciliter
- Follow recommendations for BLL 20–44 μg/dL.
- Perform a complete history and physical exam including a detailed neurological exam.
- Perform an abdominal X-ray and, if needed, initiate bowel decontamination.
- If the patient exhibits signs or symptoms of lead poisoning, including, confusion, weakness, seizures, coma, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, admit them to a hospital as soon as possible.
- Gastrointestinal decontamination or
- Chelation therapy.
- Contact a PEHSU or Poison Control Center for assistance.

### Treatment of lead poisoning-AAP… [^113hVqxr]. AAP (2025). Medium credibility.

How is Lead Poisoning Treated. Primary prevention is the optimal treatment. However, as children are not found to have lead in their environment until they have an elevated blood lead level, treatment for lead exposure should be provided to all children with a blood lead level of 3. 5 micrograms per deciliter or greater. The primary management includes:

- finding and eliminating the source of the lead,
- instruction in personal and household hygiene measures,
- optimizing the child's diet and nutritional status,
- and close follow-up. Because most children with higher blood lead levels live in or visit regularly a home with deteriorating lead paint, successful therapy depends on eliminating the child's exposure. Any treatment regimen that does not control environmental exposure to lead is considered inadequate. Pediatricians should refer poisoned children to local public health offices for environmental assessment of the child's residence.

Public health staff should conduct a thorough investigation of the child's environment and family lifestyle for sources of lead. In children who have spent prolonged periods in a leaded environment, blood lead levels will decrease more slowly after exposure ceases, probably because bone stores are greater. The CDC Lead Poisoning and Prevention, Guidelines and Recommendations support effective childhood lead poisoning prevention programs. The case management guidelines issued by the CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention can be consulted for children with lead poisoning. Although there are no studies that have identified effective strategies to reduce blood lead levels less than 3. 5 micrograms per deciliter, guidelines for potential strategies for managing blood lead levels in that range have been published by the CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention.

Because nutritional deficiencies can influence lead absorption and may have their own associations with health outcomes independent of lead exposures, specific attention should be paid to identifying and treating iron deficiency and ensuring adequate calcium and zinc intake. Chelation therapy for children with blood lead levels of 20 to 44 micrograms per deciliter can be expected to lower blood lead levels, but it has not been shown to reverse or diminish cognitive impairment or other behavioral or neuropsychological effects of lead. If the blood lead level is greater than 45 micrograms per deciliter and the exposure has been controlled, treatment should begin.

Because of the risk of perforation from NG intubation, lavage is discouraged in children unless performed under endoscopic guidance. There is no antidote for lead. Treatment of lead poisoning consists of removal from the source of exposure. Chelation therapy should be considered for treatment of severe symptoms or markedly elevated blood lead levels. Chelation therapy is controversial in cases of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic intoxication and should never be given prophylactically or during ongoing lead exposure. Once initiated, chelation therapy should be continued until symptoms improve and acceptable blood lead levels are achieved. Adults: In the presence of severe encephalopathy or when blood lead levels exceed 100 µg/dL, chelation should start with dimercaprol followed in 4 hours by another dose of BAL and either succimer or CaNa2-EDTA.

BAL treatment is phased out while treatment with one of the other chelating agents is continued, followed by decreased or interrupted dosing because continued chelator usage is associated with decreasing amounts of urinary lead excretion. Therapy begins with BAL intramuscularly every 4 hours, establishment of adequate urinary output, followed by CaNa2-EDTA continuous infusion. CaNa2-EDTA may be administered intramuscularly in divided doses every 4 hours. This combined therapy is continued for 5 days while liver and renal functions and blood lead levels are monitored. If blood lead levels rebound after 2 days without chelation therapy, a second course of therapy may be necessary. Parameters to monitor during chelation therapy include hepatic transaminases, urinalysis, BUN, creatinine, and complete blood count.

After cessation of chelation therapy, if blood lead levels rebound, additional chelation therapy may be necessary. There is no antidote for lead. Seriously exposed persons may need to be hospitalized and undergo chelation therapy to accelerate the excretion of lead from the body. Chelation therapy is necessary when blood lead levels are higher than 45 µg/dL. Studies have shown that lead poisoning during infancy or childhood can result in diminished intellectual function and hypertension as adults.
