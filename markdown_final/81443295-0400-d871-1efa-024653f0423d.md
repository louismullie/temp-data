## Question

Can cetirizone prescribed for 33 months old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cetirizine can be prescribed for a 33-month-old child, and if so, what dose and formulation are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's age in months and how that maps to the FDA-labeled pediatric age groups. Then, I should verify the FDA-approved indications and whether efficacy is established for that age. Next, I will check the labeled dosing for the relevant pediatric group and confirm the formulation and frequency. After that, I need to review safety data, including adverse effects and any special cautions in very young children. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats about off-label use and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the age mapping. A 33-month-old is 2 years and 9 months, which places the child in the 2 to 5 year pediatric group for cetirizine labeling purposes, not the 6 months to less than 2 years group, so I should apply the 2 to 5 year dosing guidance rather than infant dosing [^f56bc274] [^30413c50].

> I need to verify the approved indications in this age range. The FDA labeling supports cetirizine for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria in children aged 6 months to 5 years, with efficacy extrapolated from adults and supported by pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety data, so use in a 33-month-old for these indications is on-label when dosed correctly [^5657147b] [^714065b1].

> Next, I should review the labeled dose. For children 2 to 5 years, the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 5 mg per day given either as 5 mg once daily or 2.5 mg every 12 hours. I should double-check that both the syrup and oral solution are appropriate formulations, and yes, the 1 mg/mL oral solution is suitable for pediatric use and can be given without regard to food [^f56bc274] [^30413c50] [^2286345f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I should confirm the pediatric safety profile. The FDA notes that safety has been demonstrated in children 6 months to 5 years, including placebo-controlled trials in toddlers and infants, with adverse reactions generally mild or moderate and discontinuations uncommon. Somnolence appears dose-related and is more frequent at higher doses, and there is no signal for clinically meaningful QT prolongation in young children at labeled doses, though higher doses have not been studied for QT effects in children under 12 years [^b8f03aef] [^767b7c2c] [^00924f39].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall. I initially wondered if the 6 months to 2 year maximum of 2.5 mg twice daily might apply here, but that would be incorrect for a 33-month-old. That BID regimen is specific to infants 6 to 23 months, whereas children 2 to 5 years may receive up to 5 mg total per day, either once daily or divided every 12 hours, so I should correct that earlier thought and stick to the 2 to 5 year schedule [^f56bc274] [^30413c50].

> I should also consider practical prescribing details. The oral solution concentration is 1 mg/mL, so 2.5 mg corresponds to 2.5 mL and 5 mg to 5 mL. If using a teaspoon-based device, 2.5 mg is ½ teaspoon and 5 mg is 1 teaspoon, which aligns with the labeled instructions and helps avoid dosing errors [^2286345f] [^f56bc274].

> But wait, what if the child has impaired renal or hepatic function. I need to ensure I note that dose adjustments may be necessary in significant renal or hepatic impairment, and while the oral solution labeling does not provide a pediatric adjustment table, clinicians should exercise caution and consider reduced dosing or alternative therapy in those contexts, especially if using IV formulations where pediatric impairment is specifically flagged as not recommended in children under 6 years with organ dysfunction [^3964d6f0].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, cetirizine can be prescribed for a 33-month-old child for approved indications such as allergic rhinitis or chronic urticaria, using the 2 to 5 year dosing: start with 2.5 mg once daily and increase to a maximum of 5 mg once daily or 2.5 mg every 12 hours if needed, using the 1 mg/mL oral solution or equivalent pediatric formulation, with monitoring for somnolence and general tolerability [^f56bc274] [^30413c50] [^767b7c2c].

---

Cetirizine can be prescribed for a 33-month-old child at **2.5 mg once daily** [^f56bc274], with the dose increased to **5 mg daily** (either once daily or divided every 12 hours) if needed [^30413c50]. The safety and efficacy of cetirizine are established in children aged 6 months to 5 years [^b8f03aef], and common adverse effects include mild somnolence, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^767b7c2c]. Use the oral solution or syrup formulation for accurate dosing, and avoid use in children under 6 months or those with severe renal or hepatic impairment [^5657147b].

---

## Recommended dosage for a 33-month-old child

According to the FDA, the **recommended dosage** of cetirizine for children aged 2 to 5 years is:

- **Initial dose**: 2.5 mg (½ teaspoon or 2.5 mL) once daily [^f56bc274].
- **Maximum dose**: 5 mg per day, given either as 5 mg once daily or 2.5 mg every 12 hours [^30413c50].

---

## Safety profile of cetirizine in pediatric patients

Cetirizine has been extensively studied in pediatric populations, and its safety profile is well established for children aged 6 months to 5 years [^b8f03aef]. Common adverse effects include:

- **Somnolence**: Mild drowsiness occurs in approximately 1.9% to 4.2% of children, depending on the dose [^767b7c2c].
- **Headache**: Occurs in about 2% of children.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are reported infrequently [^notfound].

Serious adverse effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias or severe hypersensitivity reactions, are **rare** [^notfound]. Cetirizine does not significantly affect the QT interval at therapeutic doses [^5d64fcea].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting cetirizine use in young children

Several clinical studies have demonstrated the **safety and efficacy** of cetirizine in young children:

- **ETAC study**: A large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving infants and young children with atopic dermatitis showed that cetirizine significantly reduced the incidence of acute urticaria and had no adverse effects on behavior or cognitive development [^0b2fcf17] [^334832b8].
- **Safety in infants**: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in infants aged 6 to 11 months demonstrated that cetirizine was safe and well-tolerated, with no significant differences in adverse events compared to placebo [^ab6f2ffb].
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Pediatric pharmacokinetic studies indicate that cetirizine has a favorable safety profile in young children, with no accumulation of the drug or unexpected adverse effects [^88c1e056].

---

## Formulations and administration considerations

Cetirizine is available in **multiple formulations**, including oral tablets, chewable tablets, and liquid syrup or solution. For a 33-month-old child, the liquid syrup or solution formulation is recommended for accurate dosing and ease of administration. The oral solution can be administered with or without food [^f56bc274].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Cetirizine is **contraindicated** in patients with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine or any of its components. Caution should be exercised in children with:

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment may be necessary in children with moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Hepatic impairment**: Caution is advised in children with hepatic impairment.
- **Seizure disorders**: Although rare, cetirizine may lower the seizure threshold in susceptible individuals.

---

## Comparison with other antihistamines

Cetirizine is a **second-generation antihistamine** with several advantages over first-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine:

- **Lower sedation**: Cetirizine causes significantly less sedation compared to first-generation antihistamines [^128eb0c2].
- **Longer duration of action**: Cetirizine has a longer half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing [^ba365cbb].
- **Favorable safety profile**: Cetirizine has fewer anticholinergic effects and a lower risk of cognitive impairment compared to first-generation antihistamines [^fa6605c4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) recommend **second-generation antihistamines**, including cetirizine, as first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria in pediatric patients. These guidelines emphasize the favorable safety profile and efficacy of cetirizine in young children [^eee76edd].

Special Populations

Pediatric Patients: In pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years who received 5 mg of cetirizine, the mean C max was 660 ng/mL. Based on cross study comparisons, the weight normalized, apparent total body clearance was 81–111% greater and the elimination half life was 33 to 41% shorter in the pediatric population than in adults. In pediatric patients aged 6 to 23 months who received a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg cetirizine oral solution (mean dose 2.3 mg), the mean C max was 390 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized, apparent total body clearance was 304% greater and the elimination half-life was 63% shorter in this pediatric population compared to adults. The average AUC(0-t) in children 6 months to < 2 years of age receiving the maximum dose of cetirizine solution (2.5 mg twice a day) is expected to be two-fold higher than that observed in adults receiving a dose of 10 mg cetirizine tablets once a day.

### A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of cetirizine in preventing the onset of asthma in children with atopic dermatitis: 18 months' treatment and 18 months' posttreatment follow-up [^7ca71d5a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Because asthma is not a curable condition, the development of strategies for prevention of the disease has a high priority. Atopic dermatitis is a common precursor to the development of asthma, and 2 studies have suggested that the use of an H(1) receptor antagonist might reduce the development of asthma while the treatment is being administered, at least in subgroups with evidence of high IgE levels. However, no trial to date has conducted follow-up after the initial treatment has been stopped to establish whether the intervention has merely suppressed symptoms or truly prevented disease.

Objective

We sought to establish whether the use of cetirizine compared with placebo for 18 months in infants with atopic dermatitis suppressed or truly delayed the onset of asthma, even after cessation of therapy.

Methods

The Early Treatment of the Atopic Child study was a double-blinded, parallel-group, randomized trial of 0.25 mg/kg body weight cetirizine administered twice daily compared with placebo given to infants between 1 and 2 years of age with atopic dermatitis. After 18 months of treatment, follow-up continued for a further 18 months. This article reports the outcome over the full 3 years of follow-up and relates the outcomes to the allergic status on the basis of IgE antibody measurements at recruitment.

Results

Although there was no difference in cumulative prevalence of asthma between active and placebo treatment in the intention-to-treat population (P = 0.7), those infants with evidence of sensitivity to house dust mite, grass pollen, or both who were treated with cetirizine were significantly less likely to have asthma compared with those treated with placebo over the 18 months of treatment (P = 0.005 and .002, respectively), and this effect was sustained for the grass pollen-sensitized infants over the full 36 months (P = 0.008). In the house dust mite-sensitized group there was a gradual narrowing of the difference between active and placebo treatment in terms of cumulative prevalence of asthma at the end of 36 months but no evidence of a rebound immediately after the treatment stopped (P = 0.04). In the placebo population there was a significantly higher risk of development of asthma in those sensitized at baseline to egg (relative risk, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1–1.7]), house dust mite (relative risk, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3–1.9]), grass pollen (relative risk, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.4–2.1]), or cat (relative risk, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2–1.9]). Early and persistent sensitization conferred a higher risk than transient or later sensitization.

Conclusions

Cetirizine compared with placebo truly delays or, in some cases, prevents the development of asthma in a subgroup of infants with atopic dermatitis sensitized to grass pollen and, to a lesser extent, house dust mite. Further studies are required focusing specifically on sensitized groups to substantiate this finding. The study also highlights risk factors for asthma in infants with atopic dermatitis and indicates that early and persistent aeroallergen sensitization confers a higher risk than later development of sensitivity.

### Cetirizine (cetirizine hydrochloride) [^0e75c432]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a fertility and general reproductive performance study in mice, cetirizine did not impair fertility at an oral dose of 64 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2basis).

Pediatric Use: The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride has been demonstrated in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years. The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride has been demonstrated in 168 patients aged 2 to 5 years in placebo-controlled trials of up to 4 weeks duration. On a mg/kg basis, most of the 168 patients received between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of cetirizine hydrochloride. The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride in 399 patients aged 12 to 24 months has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled 18-month trial, in which the average dose was 0.25 mg/kg bid, corresponding to a range of 4 mg/day to 11 mg/day. The safety of cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated in 42 patients aged 6 to 11 months in a placebo-controlled 7-day trial. The prescribed dose was 0.25 mg/kg bid, which corresponded to a mean of 4.5 mg/day, with a range of 3.4 mg/day to 6.2 mg/day.

### Cetirizine-induced dystonic reaction in a 6-year-old boy [^08deb56a]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes involuntary contractions of the muscles. Dystonia can affect just 1 muscle, a group of muscles, or all of the muscles. The most common cause acquired dystonia in childhood is drugs. Cetirizine is widely used for allergic disorders in childhood. It is without central nervous system side effects at recommended dosages. There is only 1 case of cetirizine-induced dystonia in the literature. We report a second case of cetirizine-induced acute acquired dystonia whose symptoms completely resolved after the discontinuation of the drug.

### Cetirizine (cetirizine hydrochloride) [^5657147b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of cetirizine hydrochloride for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 5 years is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of cetirizine hydrochloride in adults with these conditions and the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar between these two populations. Efficacy is extrapolated down to 6 months of age for perennial allergic rhinitis because this disease is thought to occur down to these ages in children. The recommended doses for the pediatric population are based on cross-study comparisons of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cetirizine in adult and pediatric subjects and on the safety profile of cetirizine in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended doses. The cetirizine AUC and Cmaxin pediatric subjects aged 6 to 23 months who received a mean of 2.3 mg in a single dose, and in subjects aged 2 to 5 years who received a single dose of 5 mg of cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution, was estimated to be intermediate between that observed in adults who received a single dose of 10 mg of cetirizine hydrochloride tablets and those who received a single dose of 20 mg of cetirizine hydrochloride tablets.

The safety and effectiveness of cetirizine hydrochloride in pediatric patients under the age of 6 months have not been established.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride (Quzyttir) [^8a6d6226]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

A mass balance study in 6 healthy male volunteers indicated that 70% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 10% in the feces. Approximately 50% of the radioactivity was identified in the urine as unchanged drug. Most of the rapid increase in peak plasma radioactivity was associated with parent drug, suggesting a low degree of first-pass metabolism.

Geriatric Patients: Following a single, 10-mg oral dose, the elimination half-life was prolonged by 50% and the apparent total body clearance was 40% lower in 16 geriatric subjects with a mean age of 77 years compared to 14 adult subjects with a mean age of 53 years. The decrease in cetirizine clearance in these elderly volunteers may be related to decreased renal function.

Pediatric Patients: When pediatric patients aged 7 to 12 years received a single, 5-mg oral cetirizine hydrochloride capsule, the mean Cmaxwas 275 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized, apparent total body clearance was 33% greater and the elimination half-life was 33% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults. In pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years who received 5 mg oral tablets of cetirizine hydrochloride, the mean Cmaxwas 660 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized apparent total body clearance was 81 to 111% greater and the elimination half-life was 33 to 41% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults. In pediatric patients aged 6 to 23 months who received a single dose of 0.25 mg/kg cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution (mean dose 2.3 mg), the mean Cmaxwas 390 ng/mL. Based on cross-study comparisons, the weight-normalized, apparent total body clearance was 304% greater and the elimination half-life was 63% shorter in this pediatric population compared to adults. The average AUC(0-t)in children 6 months to less than 2 years of age receiving the maximum dose of cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution (2.5 mg twice a day) is expected to be two-fold higher than that observed in adults receiving a dose of 10 mg cetirizine hydrochloride oral tablets once a day.

Male and Female Patients: The effect of gender of cetirizine pharmacokinetics has not been adequately studied.

Racial or Ethnic Groups: No race-related difference in the kinetics of cetirizine has been observed.

### Cetirizine (cetirizine hydrochloride) [^f325aee6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics: Cetirizine hydrochloride at doses of 5 and 10 mg strongly inhibited the wheal and flare caused by the intradermal injection of histamine in 19 pediatric volunteers (aged 5 to 12 years) and the activity persisted for at least 24 hours. In a 35-day study in children aged 5 to 12, no tolerance to the antihistaminic (suppression of wheal and flare response) effects of cetirizine hydrochloride was found. In 10 infants 7 to 25 months of age who received 4 to 9 days of cetirizine hydrochloride in an oral solution (0.25 mg/kg bid), there was a 90% inhibition of histamine-induced (10 mg/mL) cutaneous wheal and 87% inhibition of the flare 12 hours after administration of the last dose. The clinical relevance of this suppression of histamine-induced wheal and flare response on skin testing is unknown.

The effects of intradermal injection of various other mediators or histamine releasers were also inhibited by cetirizine hydrochloride, as was response to a cold challenge in patients with cold-induced urticaria. In mildly asthmatic subjects, cetirizine hydrochloride at 5 mg to 20 mg blocked bronchoconstriction due to nebulized histamine, with virtually total blockade after a 20-mg dose. In studies conducted for up to 12 hours following cutaneous antigen challenge, the late phase recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils, components of the allergic inflammatory response, was inhibited by cetirizine hydrochloride at a dose of 20 mg.

### Safety of cetirizine in infants 6 to 11 months of age: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^ab6f2ffb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

H(1)-antihistamines are widely used for symptom relief in allergic disorders in infants and children; however, there are few prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled studies of these medications in young children, and to date, no such studies have been conducted in infants.

Objective

This prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the safety of the H(1)-antihistamine cetirizine, particularly with regard to central nervous system and cardiac effects, in infants age 6 to 11 months, inclusive.

Methods

Infants who met the entry criteria for age and had a history of treatment with an H(1)-antihistamine for an allergic or other disorder were randomized to receive 0.25 mg/kg cetirizine orally or matching placebo twice daily orally for 1 week.

Results

The mean daily dose in cetirizine-treated infants was 4.5 ± 0.7 mg (SD). No differences in all-cause or treatment-related adverse events were observed between the cetirizine- and placebo-treated groups. A trend was observed toward fewer adverse events and sleep-related disturbances in the cetirizine group compared with the placebo group. No prolongation in the linear corrected QT interval was observed in cetirizine-treated infants compared with either baseline values or with values in placebo-treated infants.

Conclusions

We have documented the safety of cetirizine in this short-term investigation, the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of any H(1)-antihistamine in infants. Additional prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term studies of cetirizine and other H(1)-antihistamines are needed in this population.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^92fe3246]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough in children — therapeutic trial findings and safety: In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the two larger therapeutic studies described no significant difference between groups, whereas in the smallest RCT cetirizine (a second-generation anti-histamine) was significantly more efficacious than placebo for chronic cough associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis with an effect seen within 2 weeks of therapy; combined safety data showed a non-significant difference for cough as an adverse event between groups (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.7 to 3.82) with a trend favoring placebo, and a Cochrane review of pertussis-related cough found no significant benefit for diphenhydramine.

Outcome and follow-up

At the 8-month follow-up, she did not report any further episodes of symptoms, unless a dosage of cetirizine was missed. At the 14-month follow-up, the patient continued to report further improvement in her condition, which enabled her to participate in daily activities without any restrictions. Additionally, the administration of the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index yielded a score of 0, indicating no impairment of quality of life-related to her condition at this time.

How should CSU be managed in children?

Several studies have assessed the efficacy of treatment in paediatric patients with chronic urticaria, and recommendations for adults have been extrapolated to children. The treatment of choice is standard dosage of second-generation H 1 -antihistamines, according to the products' technical specifications. Currently, ketotifen and cetirizine can be used in infants from the age of 6 months; levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine can be used from 2 years of age; and rupatadine can be used from 6 years of age. Recent guidelines include specific recommendations to avoid first-generation H 1 -antihistamines due to the probable impact on school performance. There are reports of successful use of cyclosporine in children similar to the response found in adults. There is little evidence of the efficacy of other therapeutic alternatives, such as systemic corticosteroids, dapsone, omalizumab, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis; these options should be evaluated on an individual basis in cases of severe refractory chronic urticaria. None of the currently licensed antihistamines is contraindicated in children aged 12 or older, according to the British Association of Dermatologists Therapy Guidelines and Audit Subcommittee. As dosing and age restrictions for individual products vary in younger children, it is recommended that the relevant datasheets be consulted before prescribing antihistamines in children.

Key point: CSU in children should be managed in the same way as for adults.

A suggested treatment approach is included in Figure 1. It should be noted that as omalizumab is just approved as an add-on therapy, long-term data are needed to assess that omalizumab is safer and better cost-saving alternative than the remaining therapies available.

### Prevention of acute urticaria in young children with atopic dermatitis [^0b2fcf17]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

There are no published prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of urticaria prevention in children.

Objective

Our objective was to study the effect of long-term treatment with the H(1)-receptor antagonist cetirizine in the prevention of urticaria in young children with atopic dermatitis.

Methods

In the prospective, double-blind, parallel-group Early Treatment of the Atopic Child study, 817 children with atopic dermatitis who were 12 to 24 months of age at study entry were randomized to receive either cetirizine, 0.25 mg/kg, or matching placebo twice daily for 18 months and to be followed up for an additional 6 months, during which time the study medication code remained unbroken. During both these double-blind phases of the study, for a total of 24 months, caregivers prospectively recorded all symptoms and events, including hives, in a diary on a weekly basis when the child was well and on a daily basis when a symptom or event was observed. The diaries were reviewed and validated with the investigators at each regularly scheduled study visit.

Results

Acute urticaria occurred in 16.2% of the placebo-treated children and in 5.8% of the children treated with cetirizine (P < .001). The protective effect of cetirizine disappeared when treatment was stopped. In the study population as a whole, urticaria episodes were most commonly associated with intercurrent infection or with food ingestion or direct skin contact.

Conclusion

Acute urticaria is common in toddlers with atopic dermatitis and can be prevented with cetirizine in this high-risk population.

### Long-term evaluation of the impact of the h1-receptor antagonist cetirizine on the behavioral, cognitive, and psychomotor development of very young children with atopic dermatitis [^334832b8]. Pediatric Research (2002). Low credibility.

The impact of the prolonged use of cetirizine at high dose (0.25 mg/kg twice a day over 18 mo) on behavior and cognitive ability was examined in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ETAC-Early Treatment of the Atopic Child) designed to establish whether it was possible to prevent young children (1–2 y old at study entry) with atopic dermatitis from developing asthma. Well-validated and standardized measures of behavior (Behavior Screening Questionnaire) and cognition (McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities) were used. In addition, the ages of attainment of psychomotor milestones were established. These measures were taken between an average of 32 and 53 mo of age, both during the study treatment with cetirizine or placebo and after the study treatment had been discontinued. The Behavior Screening Questionnaire was completed at least once on approximately 300 children in each group and on approximately 200 children on five occasions. The McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities were administered to approximately 100 in each group at three different times. There were no significant differences between the cetirizine and placebo groups on either of the behavior and cognition measures or in psychomotor milestones during or after the study treatment. These findings suggest that there are no adverse effects on behavior or learning processes associated with the prolonged use of cetirizine in young children with atopic dermatitis.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution [^5b060b31]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Pediatric studies were conducted with cetirizine hydrochloride. More than 1300 pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years with more than 900 treated with cetirizine hydrochloride at doses of 1.25 to 10 mg per day were included in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials conducted in the United States. The duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. Placebo-controlled trials up to 4 weeks duration included 168 pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years who received cetirizine, the majority of whom received single daily doses of 5 mg. A placebo-controlled trial 18 months in duration included 399 patients aged 12 to 24 months treated with cetirizine (0.25 mg/kg bid), and another placebo-controlled trial of 7 days duration included 42 patients aged 6 to 11 months who were treated with cetirizine (0.25 mg/kg bid).

The majority of adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients aged 2 to 11 years with cetirizine hydrochloride were mild or moderate. In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of discontinuations due to adverse reactions in pediatric patients receiving up to 10 mg of cetirizine hydrochloride was uncommon (0.4% on cetirizine hydrochloride vs. 1.0% on placebo).

Table 1 lists adverse experiences which were reported for cetirizine hydrochloride 5 and 10 mg in pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years in placebo-controlled clinical trials in the United States and were more common with cetirizine hydrochloride than placebo. Of these, abdominal pain was considered treatment-related and somnolence appeared to be dose-related, 1.3% in placebo, 1.9% at 5 mg and 4.2% at 10 mg. The adverse experiences reported in pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years in placebo-controlled trials were qualitatively similar in nature and generally similar in frequency to those reported in trials with children aged 6 to 11 years.

### Long-term cetirizine treatment reduces allergic symptoms and drug prescriptions in children with mite allergy [^2ba37bfd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Experimental data demonstrate that mite allergy is characterized by persistent chronic inflammation, even during asymptomatic periods. This suggests that long-term continuous treatment be included in the global strategy of allergy treatment.

Objective

We conducted a study to evaluate whether regularly administered cetirizine reduces allergic symptoms and drug prescriptions in children with mite allergy.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, two parallel groups of 10 children with mite allergy (mean age: 6.5 years) received either cetirizine or placebo daily for 6 months. Participants were allowed to take rescue medications for rhinitis and/or mild asthma. The symptoms (nasal itching, sneezing, obstruction, rhinorrhea, conjunctival itching, lacrimation, conjunctival hyperemia, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness) were recorded on a diary card. The intake of cetirizine (as additional symptomatic treatment), antibiotics, acetaminophen, beta2-agonists, inhaled and systemic corticosteroids was also recorded.

Results

Symptom scores and drug consumption were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the cetrizine-treated group versus the placebo group. The greatest reductions were in cetirizine itself, inhaled corticosteroids, beta2-agonists, and antibiotics. No side effects were reported in either group.

Conclusions

In mite-allergic children, cetirizine administered daily for prolonged periods decreases symptoms of and drug prescriptions for allergic rhinitis and asthma compared with symptomatic treatment.

### Oculogyric crisis in patients taking cetirizine [^9559d457]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report oculogyric crisis in patients receiving cetirizine and inform clinicians on the characteristics of this drug-induced ocular side effect.

Methods

For this retrospective, observational case series, case reports were collected from the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects (Casey Eye Institute, Portland, Oregon). The World Health Organization Causality Assessment Guide of Suspected Adverse Reactions was used to categorize the cases.

Results

Nine cases were reported, with eight occurring in the pediatric age group. Dosage ranged from 5 to 10 mg orally and onset of symptoms ranged from 3 to 184 days. Six cases of oculogyric crisis had positive rechallenge data. Eight cases had complete neurologic consultation including radiographic studies.

Conclusions

Cetirizine can cause oculogyric crisis, especially in the pediatric age group. Extensive neurologic workups may be avoided if clinicians recognize this drug-induced ocular side effect.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride (Quzyttir) [^27030e8e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of QUZYTTIR have been established in patients 6 months to 17 years of age. The efficacy of QUZYTTIR for the treatment of acute urticaria down to 6 months of age is based on extrapolation of the efficacy of QUZYTTIR in adults with acute urticaria [see Clinical Studies (14)] and supported by pharmacokinetic data with oral cetirizine hydrochloride (the active ingredient in QUZYTTIR) in patients 6 months to 17 years of age. Based upon the known PK profile of oral cetirizine hydrochloride, the exposure of IV cetirizine hydrochloride in pediatric patients (6 months to 17 years of age) is expected to be similar to the exposure of IV cetirizine hydrochloride in adults at the labeled doses. Extrapolation of efficacy is based on the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are similar between these two populations.

The safety of QUZYTTIR in children 6 months to 17 years of age is supported by safety information from placebo-controlled clinical trials with oral cetirizine hydrochloride in patients 6 months of age and older [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. QUZYTTIR demonstrates a higher Cmaxcompared to oral cetirizine hydrochloride in adults [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. As QUZYTTIR is indicated for an acute condition administered in a medically supervised setting, the safety for higher Cmaxin children 6 months to less than 18 years of age is supported by the safety data from the clinical trial with IV cetirizine hydrochloride in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6)] and available safety information from pediatric overdose cases.

Because of the absence of pharmacokinetic and safety information for cetirizine hydrochloride in children below 6 years of age with impaired renal or hepatic function, the use of QUZYTTIR in this impaired patient population is not recommended [see Dosage And Administration (2)].

The safety and efficacy of QUZYTTIR in patients less than 6 months of age has not been established.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution [^5d64fcea]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics: Cetirizine hydrochloride at doses of 5 and 10 mg strongly inhibited the wheal and flare caused by intradermal injection of histamine in 19 pediatric volunteers (aged 5 to 12 years) and the activity persisted for at least 24 hours. In a 35 day study in children aged 5 to 12, no tolerance to the antihistaminic (suppression of wheal and flare response) effects of cetirizine hydrochloride was found. In 10 infants 7 to 25 months of age who received 4 to 9 days of cetirizine in an oral solution (0.25 mg/kg bid), there was a 90% inhibition of histamine-induced (10 mg/mL) cutaneous wheal and 87% inhibition of the flare 12 hours after administration of the last dose. The clinical relevance of this suppression of histamine-induced wheal and flare response on skin testing is unknown.

The effects of intradermal injection of various other mediators or histamine releasers were also inhibited by cetirizine, as was response to a cold challenge in patients with cold-induced urticaria. In mildly asthmatic subjects, cetirizine hydrochloride at 5 to 20 mg blocked bronchoconstriction due to nebulized histamine, with virtually total blockade after a 20 mg dose. In studies conducted for up to 12 hours following cutaneous antigen challenge, the late phase recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils, components of the allergic inflammatory response, was inhibited by cetirizine hydrochloride at a dose of 20 mg. In four clinical studies in healthy adult males, no clinically significant mean increases in QTc were observed in cetirizine hydrochloride treated subjects. In the first study, a placebo-controlled crossover trial, cetirizine hydrochloride was given at doses up to 60 mg per day, 6 times the maximum clinical dose, for 1 week, and no significant mean QTc prolongation occurred. In the second study, a crossover trial, cetirizine hydrochloride 20 mg and erythromycin (500 mg every 8 hours) were given alone and in combination. There was no significant effect on QTc with the combination or with cetirizine hydrochloride alone. In the third trial, also a crossover study, cetirizine hydrochloride 20 mg and ketoconazole (400 mg per day) were given alone and in combination. Cetirizine hydrochloride caused a mean increase in QTc of 9.1 msec from baseline after 10 days of therapy. Ketoconazole also increased QTc by 8.3 msec. The combination caused an increase of 17.4 msec, equal to the sum of the individual effects. Thus, there was no significant drug interaction on QTc with the combination of cetirizine hydrochloride and ketoconazole. In the fourth study, a placebo-controlled parallel trial, cetirizine hydrochloride 20 mg was given alone or in combination with azithromycin (500 mg as a single dose on the first day followed by 250 mg once daily). There was no significant increase in QTc with cetirizine hydrochloride 20 mg alone or in combination with azithromycin. In a four-week clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years, results of randomly obtained ECG measurements before treatment and after 2 weeks of treatment showed that cetirizine hydrochloride 5 or 10 mg did not increase QTc versus placebo. In a one week clinical trial (N = 86) of Cetirizine Hydrochloride Oral Solution, USP (0.25 mg/kg bid) compared with placebo in pediatric patients 6 to 11 months of age, ECG measurements taken within 3 hours of the last dose did not show any ECG abnormalities or increases in QTc interval in either group compared to baseline assessments. Data from other studies where cetirizine hydrochloride was administered to patients 6 to 23 months of age were consistent with the findings in this study.

Phase III safety evaluations

The two Phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group long-term safety and tolerability studies evaluated the safety and tolerability of BID (study 1) or three times daily (TID, study 2) dosing in adult and pediatric (≥ 2 to ≤ 18 years of age) populations for up to 6 weeks. Subjects were randomized (2:1) to receive one bilateral dose of either cetirizine or vehicle, respectively. Each study comprised four study visits over a period of ~6 weeks. A subset of subjects underwent specular microscopy to determine central corneal endothelial cell count (ECC) at the fifth study visit, extending the study length to 12 weeks.

At visit 1, one dose of cetirizine or vehicle was instilled. Thereafter, instillation was performed BID or TID for 6 weeks (with doses instilled by a trained staff technician at visits 2 and 3). In the BID study, the second daily dose was to be instilled ~8 hours, but no earlier than 7 hours, after the first dose of the day. In the TID study, doses were to be instilled approximately every 6 hours within 1 calendar day, but no earlier than 5 hours after the previous dose. The BID and TID studies were conducted at four and six investigative sites in the United States, respectively. All three studies complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 2013 and Good Clinical Practice E6 (R1) guidelines; all three studies were reviewed and approved by an external institutional review board (IRB; Alpha IRB, San Clemente, CA, USA).

### Cetirizine (cetirizine hydrochloride) [^00924f39]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a four-week clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years, results of randomly obtained ECG measurements before treatment and after 2 weeks of treatment showed that cetirizine hydrochloride 5 or 10 mg did not increase QTc versus placebo. In a one week clinical trial (N = 86) of cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution (0.25 mg/kg bid) compared with placebo in pediatric patients 6 to 11 months of age, ECG measurements taken within 3 hours of the last dose did not show any ECG abnormalities or increases in QTc interval in either group compared to baseline assessments. Data from other studies where cetirizine hydrochloride was administered to patients 6 to 23 months of age were consistent with the findings in this study.

The effects of cetirizine hydrochloride on the QTc interval at doses higher than 10 mg have not been studied in children less than 12 years of age.

In a six-week, placebo-controlled study of 186 patients (aged 12 to 64 years) with allergic rhinitis and mild to moderate asthma, cetirizine hydrochloride 10 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms and did not alter pulmonary function. In a two-week, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a subset analysis of 65 pediatric (aged 6 to 11 years) allergic rhinitis patients with asthma showed cetirizine hydrochloride did not alter pulmonary function. These studies support the safety of administering cetirizine hydrochloride to pediatric and adult allergic rhinitis patients with mild to moderate asthma.

Clinical Studies: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical trials comparing cetirizine hydrochloride 5 mg to 20 mg to placebo in patients 12 years and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were conducted in the United States. Two of these showed significant reductions in symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis for up to 8 weeks in duration. Two 4-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical trials comparing cetirizine 5 mg to 20 mg to placebo in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were also conducted and showed significant improvement in symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria. In general, the 10-mg dose was more effective than the 5-mg dose and the 20-mg dose gave no added effect. Some of these trials included pediatric patients aged 12 to 16 years. In addition, four multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 2 to 4 week trials in 534 pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis were conducted in the United States at doses up to 10 mg.

### Levocetirizine dihydrochloride [^f16253cd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients

Data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic study with oral administration of a single dose of 5 mg levocetirizine in 14 children age 6 to 11 years with body weight ranging between 20 kg and 40 kg show that Cmaxand AUC values are about 2-fold greater than that reported in healthy adult subjects in a cross-study comparison. The mean Cmaxwas 450 ng/mL, occurring at a mean time of 1.2 hours, weight-normalized, total body clearance was 30% greater, and the elimination half- life 24% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults.

Dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age. A retrospective population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted in 323 subjects (181 children 1 to 5 years of age, 18 children 6 to 11 years of age, and 124 adults 18 to 55 years of age) who received single or multiple doses of levocetirizine ranging from 1.25 mg to 30 mg. Data generated from this analysis indicated that administration of 1.25 mg once daily to children 6 months to 5 years of age results in plasma concentrations similar to those of adults receiving 5 mg once daily.

Geriatric patients

Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly subjects. Following once daily repeat oral administration of 30 mg levocetirizine for 6 days in 9 elderly subjects (65 to 74 years of age), the total body clearance was approximately 33% lower compared to that in younger adults. The disposition of racemic cetirizine has been shown to be dependent on renal function rather than on age. This finding would also be applicable for levocetirizine, as levocetirizine and cetirizine are both predominantly excreted in urine. Therefore, the levocetirizine dihydrochloride dose should be adjusted in accordance with renal function in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Gender

Pharmacokinetic results for 77 patients (40 men, 37 women) were evaluated for potential effect of gender. The half-life was slightly shorter in women (7.08 ± 1.72 hr) than in men (8.62 ± 1.84 hr); however, the body weight-adjusted oral clearance in women (0.67 ± 0.16 mL/min/kg) appears to be comparable to that in men (0.59 ± 0.12 mL/min/kg). The same daily doses and dosing intervals are applicable for men and women with normal renal function.

### Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis of infancy suppressed with cetirizine [^9dae5289]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis of infancy is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent, itchy sterile pustules mainly located on the scalp. Topical agents are mostly effective to suppress the symptoms in the majority of cases. However, systemic agents that are safe for long-term use are required for patients with widespread or resistant lesions. We present a case with eosinophilic pustular folliculitis of infancy whose disease was suppressed with cetirizine but recurred after ceasing the drug.

### The health-related quality of life effects of once-daily cetirizine HCl syrup in children with seasonal allergic rhinitis [^857730cd]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) can adversely impact children's physical, psychological, and social functioning and well-being, that is, their health-related quality of life (HRQL). This study assessed HRQL in children 6 to 11 years treated with cetirizine HCl syrup, while concurrently assessing symptomatic relief and safety. In an open-label, non-comparative study, 544 children from 124 centers in the United States were instructed to take cetirizine HCl syrup (10 cc of 1 mg/mL) each evening for 4 weeks. Children experienced statistically significant improvements in HRQL with significant reductions in mean symptom score (p < 0.001) during the treatment period. Results were consistent across age groups (6–7, 8–9, 10–11 years). These results suggest that the symptomatic relief and tolerability profile of cetirizine HC1 syrup daily translates into improvements in the HRQL of children with SAR. This 4-week open label study is among the first to evaluate the effect of antihistamine treatment on HRQL outcomes in children.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reaction is described elsewhere in the labeling:

Somnolence/Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Oral cetirizine hydrochloride

The following adverse reactions associated with the use of oral cetirizine hydrochloride were identified in clinical trials.

In clinical trials in patients 12 years and older the most common adverse reactions to oral cetirizine hydrochloride occurring with a 2% or greater incidence and greater than placebo were somnolence (14%), fatigue (6%), dry mouth (5%), pharyngitis (2%), and dizziness (2%). In clinical trials in children 6 to 11 years of age with oral cetirizine hydrochloride the most common adverse reactions occurring with a 2% or greater incidence and greater than placebo were headache, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, coughing, somnolence, diarrhea, epistaxis, bronchospasm, nausea, and vomiting. Somnolence appeared to be dose related. Adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled trials with oral cetirizine hydrochloride in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years were qualitatively similar in nature and generally similar in frequency to those reported in trials with children 6 to 11 years of age. In placebo-controlled trials of pediatric patients 6 to 24 months of age, the incidences of adverse experiences were similar in the oral cetirizine hydrochloride and placebo treatment groups in each trial. In a trial of 1 week duration in children 6 to 11 months of age patients who received oral cetirizine hydrochloride exhibited greater irritability/fussiness than patients on placebo. In a trial of 18 months duration in patients 12 months and older, insomnia occurred more frequently in patients who received oral cetirizine hydrochloride compared to patients who received placebo.

Patients and methods

Study design

PK study

The PK study was a prospective, single-center, open-label study designed to characterize the plasma PK and safety profile of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% after a single bilateral dose (ie, one drop in each eye) and after twice-a-day (BID) bilateral dosing for 1 week in healthy, adult subjects. The study comprised five study visits over a period of ~3 weeks. After screening, subjects received one dose of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% or vehicle and were queried for safety and tolerability. At visit 3, subjects (or their caregiver) instilled one dose under the observation of a trained staff technician. Thereafter, subjects (or their caregiver) administered cetirizine BID for up to 6 days; instillation of the second daily dose was to be administered ~8 hours but no earlier than 7 hours after the first dose of the day. The final dose at visit 4 was instilled by a trained staff technician.

### Guidance on completing a written allergy and anaphylaxis emergency plan [^128eb0c2]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Allergy and anaphylaxis — second-generation antihistamines and cetirizine use are characterized by fewer central nervous system effects and comparable efficacy to diphenhydramine for certain mild reactions, as sedation and impairment in cognitive function can complicate assessment; second-generation H1 antihistamines are significantly less likely to cause these adverse effects, and in a randomized double-blind study of 70 allergic reactions during oral food challenge cetirizine had similar efficacy and onset of action compared with diphenhydramine in treating cutaneous symptoms during acute food-induced allergic reactions, supporting that cetirizine is a good option to consider for isolated mild symptoms.

### Paediatric severe chronic spontaneous urticaria: successful management through conventional drug therapy [^61472f5e]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) can occur in children and the clinical management is quite challenging. Here, we described a paediatric clinical case of CSU successfully managed by conventional therapy, including systemic steroids, cetirizine, anti-leukotriene drug and dietary restriction (for histamine-releasing foods). This patient showed neither atopy nor any allergic sensitisation; moreover, the autologous serum skin test resulted negative. This category of patients with no comorbidity and no evidence of atopy might benefit from the conventional drug management; however, a protracted course of steroid treatment with very slow and gradual tapering may be needed. This approach was successful and safe in our clinical case, but a careful follow-up, due to the potential side effects of steroids, should be recommended.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^9108e90d]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Summary of therapies for non-specific cough — this controlled-trial table reports time to response, level of evidence, and key considerations by therapy. Anti-histamines for acute cough list 1 wk with a systematic review (with OTC medications) and adverse events (especially with H1 antagonists). For chronic cough with anti-histamines, time to response is 2 wk with a systematic review, noted as non-beneficial, although a single small study showed benefit by 2 wk in children with pollen allergy with cetirizine. Anti-microbials for chronic wet/productive cough report 2 wk from systematic reviews and meta-analysis, with some requiring 4 wks. Inhaled corticosteroids show 2–4 wks supported by RCTs and a systematic review, with small benefit if any and adverse event. Theophylline indicates 1–2 wk based on observational studies and a systematic review, with no RCTs and adverse events. GERD therapy includes motility agents with time to response not relevant and a single controlled trial showing no benefit and adverse events; acid suppression marked not relevant with systematic reviews and adverse events; and food thickening or anti-reflux formula showing 1 wk with a systematic review and RCTs but inconclusive data (one increase in cough and a second reduction). Nasal therapy with nasal steroids shows 1–2 wk with an RCT and mainly adults and older children (> 12 y), beneficial when combined with antibiotics for sinusitis. Over-the-counter acute cough therapies are marked not relevant with a systematic review stating honey maybe beneficial while other OTC medications were non-beneficial. Footnotes define OTC as over-the-counter and RCT as randomized controlled trial and clarify that time to response is the expected reduction in cough severity if treatment is effective, as reported by trialists.

### Double-blind multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of cetirizine compared with oxatomide in chronic idiopathic urticaria in preschool children [^e0cd3b29]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

There are no studies on the use of cetirizine in children under the age of 6.

Objective

We compared the efficacy and tolerability of cetirizine in patients with idiopathic chronic urticaria to the more widely used antihistamine, oxatomide.

Methods

This double-blind study was performed on 62 patients (38 male and 24 female) with idiopathic chronic urticaria, recruited from four different medical centers of the national territory (Ancona, Cagliari, Catania, and Messina). The children's ages ranged from 2 to 6 years (mean 3.85). The patients were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: one group treated 31 children with cetirizine at a dosage of 5 mg q.d., and a second group treated 31 children for the same amount of time with oxatomide, at a dosage of 25 mg q.d. Sixty-two children began the treatment, but five did not finish the study (three in the cetirizine and two in the oxatomide group). Thus, the clinical study and the statistical evaluation were conducted on 57 children (28 cetirizine and 29 oxatomide). The Student's t test was used to compare severity of the illness and changes in the hematochemical tests.

Results

Overall, the effectiveness of the two medications in treating erythema, papules, edema, and itching showed comparable therapeutic activity (P < 0.001). Neither medication produced significant side effects.

Conclusions

The results of the present study suggest that cetirizine may represent an effective and safe pharmacologic therapy for chronic urticaria in preschool children. There was no evidence for changes in hematochemical and urinary values, demonstrating the safety and the tolerability of the two antihistamines, even when given to young children.

Table I
The initial laboratory evaluation

It was later determined that the patient's father was ill with COVID-19 when she stayed with him the weekend prior to developing urticaria. Over the course of the 11 days prior to her COVID-19 diagnosis, several immediate and extended family members developed COVID-19 infections, which were eventually traced back to exposure to the patient. She presented for follow-up to an outpatient allergy practice for further evaluation of her acute urticaria. As she was now asymptomatic with her hives resolved with the rest of her viral symptoms, she was advised to continue using cetirizine as needed.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There were no adequate or well-controlled studies with ZERVIATE®in pregnant women.

Cetirizine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Data

Animal Data

Cetirizine was not teratogenic in mice, rats, or rabbits at oral doses up to 96, 225, and 135 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 1300, 4930, and 7400 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose (MRHOD), on a mg/m2basis).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Cetirizine has been reported to be excreted in human breast milk following oral administration. Multiple doses of oral dose cetirizine (10 mg tablets once daily for 10 days) resulted in systemic levels (Mean Cmax = 311 ng/mL) that were 100 times higher than the observed human exposure (Mean Cmax = 3.1 ng/ mL) following twice daily administration of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% to both eyes for one week [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Comparable bioavailability has been found between the tablet and syrup dosage forms. However, it is not known whether the systemic absorption resulting from topical ocular administration of ZERVIATE®could produce detectable quantities in human breast milk.

There is no adequate information regarding the effects of cetirizine on breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production to inform risk of ZERVIATE®to an infant during lactation. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ZERVIATE®and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZERVIATE®.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of ZERVIATE®(cetirizine ophthalmic solution) 0.24% has been established in pediatric patients two years of age and older. Use of ZERVIATE®in these pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of ZERVIATE®in pediatric and adult patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

### Cetirizine hydrochloride oral solution [^f0f18cad]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The effects of cetirizine hydrochloride on the QTc interval at doses higher than 10 mg have not been studied in children less than 12 years of age.

In a six-week, placebo-controlled study of 186 patients (aged 12 to 64 years) with allergic rhinitis and mild to moderate asthma, cetirizine hydrochloride 10 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms and did not alter pulmonary function. In a two-week, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a subset analysis of 65 pediatric (aged 6 to 11 years) allergic rhinitis patients with asthma showed cetirizine hydrochloride did not alter pulmonary function. These studies support the safety of administering cetirizine hydrochloride to pediatric and adult allergic rhinitis patients with mild to moderate asthma.

Clinical Studies: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical trials comparing cetirizine 5 to 20 mg to placebo in patients 12 years and older with perennial allergic rhinitis were conducted in the United States. Two of these showed significant reductions in symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis for up to 8 weeks in duration. Two 4-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, clinical trials comparing cetirizine 5 to 20 mg to placebo in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were also conducted and showed significant improvement in symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria. In general, the 10 mg dose was more effective than the 5 mg dose and the 20 mg dose gave no added effect. Some of these trials included pediatric patients aged 12 to 16 years. In addition, four multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 2–4 week trials in 534 pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis were conducted in the United States at doses up to 10 mg.

### Anti-histamines for prolonged non-specific cough in children [^89d2a37b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Non-specific cough is defined as non-productive cough in the absence of identifiable respiratory disease or known aetiology. It is commonly seen in paediatric practice. These children are treated with a variety of therapies including anti-histamines. Also, anti-histamines are advocated as an empirical treatment in adults with chronic cough.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of anti-histamines in treating children with prolonged non-specific cough.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in November 2005.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing anti-histamines with a placebo or placebo-like medication with cough as an outcome, where cough is not primarily related to an underlying respiratory disorder such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, or suppurative lung disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. Two independent reviewers selected, extracted and assessed data for inclusion. Three eligible trials were identified.

Main Results

The three included studies varied in age of subjects, sample size, inclusion criteria, type of anti-histamine and length of intervention. These 3 studies included 182 randomised subjects with 162 completing the trials although in one study, children with recurrent wheeze were also included. Clinical heterogeneity was evident and limited data prevented combining data for meta-analysis. The two larger studies described significant improvement in both the intervention and the placebo/placebo-like arms with no significant difference between the two groups. In the study with the smallest sample size, cetirizine (a second generation anti-histamine) was significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing chronic cough in children associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, and the effect was seen within 2 weeks of therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

This review has significant limitations. However, our finding of uncertain efficacy of anti-histamines for chronic cough are similar to that for acute cough in children. In contrast to recommendations in adults with chronic cough, anti-histamines cannot be recommended as empirical therapy for children with chronic cough. If anti-histamines were to be trialled in these children, current data suggest a clinical response (time to response) occurs within 2 weeks of therapy. However the use of anti-histamines in children with non-specific cough has to be balanced against the well known risk of adverse events especially in very young children.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^3eda5685]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis

The EAACI/ARIA guidelines outline the clinical properties of the ideal oral H 1 -antihistimines, and most modern H 1 -antihistimines meet these requirements. A comparison of the clinical profiles of various second-generation antihistamines indicates that bilastine in particular has the highest number of ARIA-recommended antihistamine properties.

Their pharmacologic profiles support the preference for second-generation H 1 -antihistimines in managing pediatric allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. They address the immediate allergic symptoms and align well with the therapeutic goals for children, which include maintaining normal activity levels and minimizing adverse effects.

Treatment of acute and CU

As with AR, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines are efficacious in both acute urticaria and CU and are recommended as first-line therapy. For CU, the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline recommends antihistamines be taken daily until no longer needed. The dosing regimen is essential to patient adherence, as patients often hesitate to continue treatment if they do not experience immediate relief. Thus, a nonsedating antihistamine that restores a patient's QoL is essential to enhance the treatment experience.

For all types of urticaria, standard-dosed modern, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines like bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine are supported by clinical evidence. However, there is no clear recommendation on which to choose as a result of the lack of well-designed clinical trials comparing their efficacy and safety.

In children, antihistamines with proven efficacy and safety include bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine. Prescriber selection should consider age restrictions and availability, as some are not licensed for children under 6 months in many countries, and not all are formulated for pediatric use.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^cd8daea5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% provides an alternative to other ophthalmic solutions currently available for the indication of ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis commonly results in divergent and patient-dependent symptoms; thus, the ideal therapeutic for one patient may not ease the symptoms of all patients, supporting the need for a broad anti-allergics market. Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% comes with the added benefit of patient and physician familiarity, above and beyond its demonstrated efficacy and safety. The high comfort upon instillation, low incidence of AEs, minimal systemic exposure, and lack of clinically relevant changes in safety measures suggest that cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% will add to and improve the currently marketed therapeutics for allergic conjunctivitis.

Statistical analyses

In all the three studies, analyses were conducted with all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of medication; analyzed as treated with no data excluded for any reason. Safety was assessed by change from baseline (the last assessment prior to the first instillation). PK, comfort, and quantitative safety analyses were summarized using descriptive statistics with the data for BCVA, SLE, dilated ophthalmoscopy, IOP, ECC, ECC density, and drop comfort, stratified by age and treatment group. BCVA and IOP were summarized by categories quantified by degree of change from baseline. Physical examination and pregnancy test results were summarized descriptively. The qualitative safety variables were summarized using counts and percentages. Drop comfort was analyzed using Fisher's exact test or chi-squared test as appropriate. P -values for safety, drop comfort, and age group comparisons were calculated using a two-sample t -test comparing changes from baseline in the cetirizine group to the vehicle group with an α equal to 0.05. For IOP, a chi-squared test was utilized to compare the active treatment group with the vehicle treatment group for subjects categorized as having changes from baseline pressures ≥ 10 mmHg. Hypothesis testing was not performed in the long-term safety studies.

### Urticarial intolerance reaction to cetirizine [^cdcd1f6f]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The paradoxical acute exacerbation of pre-existing chronic idiopathic urticaria accompanied by intense generalized pruritus, facial oedema, and dyspnoea in a 36-year-old-woman 3–4 h after a single oral dose of 10 mg cetirizine (Zyrtec tablets), suggested the presence of an underlying intolerance reaction. However, a type I hypersensitivity reaction also had to be excluded. Detailed allergy testing supported the view that the patient had suffered an intolerance reaction to cetirizine. This is the third known case of most probably a nonallergic generalized urticaria following the administration of cetirizine, a drug with extensive usage worldwide. However a type I sensitization to cetirizine is indeed possible, as has been demonstrated in this research with the verification of cetirizine-specific IgE antibodies in one of the control sera.

Subject disposition and demographics

Subject disposition

In the PK study, eleven subjects were enrolled and ten subjects (90.9%) completed the study. One subject (9.1%) was discontinued from the study prior to completion because of a lack of venous access. In the BID study (study 1), the study population comprised 512 subjects (123 pediatric): 341 subjects received cetirizine and 171 subjects received vehicle. Of the 512 randomized subjects, 488 subjects (95.3%) completed the study and 24 subjects (4.7%) were discontinued from the study prior to completion. Two discontinuations in the cetirizine group were due to AEs. In the TID study, the study population comprised 516 subjects (128 pediatric): 343 subjects received cetirizine and 173 subjects received vehicle. Of the 516 subjects enrolled in the study, 493 subjects (95.5%) completed the study and 23 subjects (4.5%) were discontinued from the study prior to completion. Four discontinuations were due to AEs in the cetirizine treatment group.

Introduction

Allergies affect ~30% of populations in industrialized countries. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most prevalent allergic condition and the cause of approximately one-third of all allergic disorders. The key ocular symptom is ocular itching. Other troublesome ocular sequelae include conjunctival, episcleral and ciliary hyperemia, eyelid swelling, chemosis, mucous discharge, and tearing; the set of accompanying sequelae varying among the afflicted. The causative agent of allergies include perennial allergens (such as cat dander, cockroach, dog dander, and dust mite) and seasonal allergens (such as Kentucky bluegrass, maple, meadow fescue, oak, ragweed, rye grass, timothy grass, and white birch). In susceptible individuals, these common allergens, and other environmental insults, trigger a well-characterized allergic response: the multifactorial type 1 hypersensitivity reaction characterized by an early, acute phase activated by mast cell degranulation and release of histamine, and a late phase induced by pro-inflammatory mediators (ie, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines, and ILs).

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^5b5018a8]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Results

In total, our combined searches yielded 1996 citations (see Figure 1). After screening, no studies were identified that met all inclusion criteria. The vast majority of references were not articles primarily relating to anaphylaxis, or anaphylaxis treatment. References relating to specifically to anaphylaxis treatment were reviews, systematic reviews, case reports, case series, and other types of observational (usually retrospective) studies. There were a number of controlled trials relating to anaphylaxis prevention, but none about treatment of pediatric anaphylaxis.

Figure 1
Search flow diagram.

The search of the UK National Research Register, Current Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials using anaphylaxis as a keyword identified no useful proposed, ongoing, or completed studies.

One study registered in the Australia/New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry in March 2011 met inclusion criteria. This was an RCT of intravenous versus intramuscular (control) epinephrine treatment of acute anaphylaxis in an emergency department in patients 15 years of age and older. The status of the trial in the database indicated that the investigators were not yet recruiting as of April 2011. Attempts to contact the primary investigator via email were unsuccessful.

One additional study identified through the search was an RCT comparing the sedative properties of cetirizine versus diphenhydramine in the treatment of acute food-induced allergic reactions in children. The full text of this article was extracted and reviewed and, ultimately, excluded because the condition being studied was not anaphylaxis, but rather all allergic reactions.

Subjects

All three studies were performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference of Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice Guidance, and all applicable local, state, and federal requirements. Each subject or their legally acceptable representative provided informed written informed consent/assent (for subjects under the age of 18 years) prior to any study-related procedures. The study protocols, informed consent forms, HIPPAA forms, and related documents were approved by the IRB (Alpha IRB).

The PK study (N = 11) enrolled healthy adult subjects of either sex ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age with ocular health within normal limits and a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.6 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better in each eye as measured using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. No subjects had any active systemic or ocular disorder other than refractive disorder; any abnormality of the lids, ocular surface, or lacrimal duct system that, in the opinion of the investigator, could have affected ophthalmic drop absorption.

The Phase III studies enrolled healthy adult and pediatric subjects (≥ 2 to ≤ 18 years of age) with a history or family history of atopic disease, including allergic conjunctivitis. In both the studies, the primary inclusion criteria were as follows: the ability to self-administer eye drops or have a caregiver, legal guardian, or school healthcare provider (eg, nurse) do so, and a calculated visual acuity of 0.3 logMAR or better in each eye as measured using an ETDRS chart. In subjects aged < 10 years who were developmentally unable to use the ETDRS chart, a best attempt at visual acuity was made using the LEA symbols or visual behavior. Subject participating in the ECC evaluation was required to have a baseline corneal ECC ≥ 2,200/cells/mm 2.

Both the studies excluded females who were currently pregnant, currently breast feeding or planning to breast feed during the study period; subjects with ongoing active ocular infection; current or historical ocular morbidity, recent ocular surgery; and subjects with any ocular condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could have affected the subjects' safety or trial parameters. Subjects were disallowed any topical ophthalmic agents or contact lens use for 5 days prior to visit 1, and any systemic corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, or systemic medications that the investigator felt may have confounded study data or interfered with the subjects' participation within 14 days prior to visit 1.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^781ec405]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

All subjects had detectable systemic cetirizine throughout the 24-hour period following single and multiple dosing (Figure 1). The mean extent of exposure was 7.4 (± 2.11) days of BID dosing. After a single bilateral dose of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24%, the mean peak plasma concentration (C max) was 1.7 ng/mL and the mean time to maximum concentration (T max) was 2.2 hours. After a week of bilateral BID dosing, C max of cetirizine increased to 3.1 ng/mL, and T max dropped to 1.6 hours. Therefore, a week of BID dosing yielded a C max ~1.8 times greater than that of a single dose. The mean AUC (0–24) was proportionally consistent with the C max when comparing a single to 1 week dosing period. After a single dose the mean AUC (0–24) was 18.972 (± 10.4329) ng⋅h/mL which increased to 31.688 (± 18.3170) ng⋅h/mL after 1 week of exposure. Total drug exposure over time (AUC (0–∞)) was 22.453 (± 12.5063) ng⋅h/mL which similarly increased to 36.486 (± 20.3550) ng⋅h/mL after 1 week of exposure. The terminal half-life (T 1/2) of cetirizine was short. T 1/2 after a single dose was 8.6 and 8.2 hours after a week of BID dosing. Overall, these data demonstrate low systemic exposure following bilateral BID dosing of cetirizine 0.24% ophthalmic solution.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^86b85d9c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% is the first topical ophthalmic formulation of cetirizine hydrochloride approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the indication of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The findings reported here demonstrate a favorable safety profile of cetirizine as an ophthalmic solution. Coupled with its strong efficacy in the relief of ocular itching, eyelid swelling, and nasal symptoms (Meier et al 2018, co-submitted), cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% is a robust addition to the alternatives that eye care providers have for allergic conjunctivitis.

Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% showed a suitable safety profile when administered BID to TID for up to 12 weeks in patients ≥ 2 years of age. The PK study demonstrated low systemic exposure of cetirizine, 100-fold less than oral administration, when administered as an ophthalmic solution in support of the minimal systemic AEs that were reported in the BID and TID studies. There were no clinically relevant changes in BCVA, SLE, dilated ophthalmoscopy, IOP, physical examination, or vital signs in any study. The most common AEs in BID dosing were mild to moderate cases of conjunctival hyperemia, instillation site pain (all mild), and ocular hyperemia. These AEs were also reported in the TID study at similar severity and also resolved within the study period. An even lower incidence of AEs was reported in pediatric patients aged 2–18 years. Together these data provide the safety basis for FDA approval of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24%.

Cetirizine has been approved as a tablet since 1995 with a long-standing systemic safety profile. As a tablet or liquid formulation, cetirizine may cause drowsiness and, in more rare instances, undesired cardiac, gastrointestinal, and renal disorders. Furthermore, oral cetirizine can lead to ocular accommodation disorder, blurred vision, and oculogyration. The ophthalmic solution of cetirizine 0.24% reported here caused no undesirable systemic AEs nor did it cause any of the ocular disorders above. As an ophthalmic solution, cetirizine offers a unique advantage over the tablet formulation by limiting systemic exposure and AEs. Further studies comparing or combining oral and ophthalmic cetirizine may prove useful to patients with unmet ocular symptoms caused by allergic conjunctivitis or those that would benefit from a reduced systemic exposure.

Most commonly used drugs in each anatomical class

In the most commonly used anatomical classes (dermatology, anti-infectives, and respiratory system), the most common individual dermatological drugs were fusidic acid (except for Italy), topical steroids, and topical imidazole/triazole derivatives (tables 4, 5, and 6). The topical triazoles/imidazoles were off label in most countries for at least one or more age categories. In the anti-infectives group (J), penicillin derivatives (amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, and phenoxymethylpenicillin) followed by macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin) were the most common, cefalexin (UK, < 2 year) was the only off label drug. Oral aciclovir was one of the top five anti-infective drugs in Italy. Among the respiratory drugs, salbutamol and inhaled steroids (beclometasone, fluticasone, flunisolide), antihistamines (cetirizine, loratidine, clorpheniramine), and xylometazoline were most commonly prescribed. Beclometasone, xylometazoline, and cetirizine were off label in the youngest children (< 2 years) in the UK and the Netherlands.

### Antihistamines: do they work? Further well-controlled trials involving larger samples are needed [^1073f102]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Histamine is one of the most important steps in the phlogistic allergic reaction. Its activity is due to the link to specific receptors on the cellular surface. H1-receptors of second generation are the most currently prescribed drugs in allergic diseases for their high selectivity, little or no central sedative effect, rapid onset of action and long half lives. Antihistamines can modulate part of immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation reducing mediator release and expression of adhesion molecules, regulating the release of cytokines, chemokines and consequently inflammatory cells recruitment. The anti-inflammatory effects of cetirizine, desloratadine and levocetirizine are reviewed. Quality of life is considered too, as a main parameter in a global evaluation of the antihistamine's effects.

No formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed with levocetirizine. Studies have been performed with the racemic cetirizine [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Pediatric patients

Data from a pediatric pharmacokinetic study with oral administration of a single dose of 5 mg levocetirizine in 14 children age 6 to 11 years with body weight ranging between 20 and 40 kg show that Cmaxand AUC values are about 2-fold greater than that reported in healthy adult subjects in a cross-study comparison. The mean Cmaxwas 450 ng/mL, occurring at a mean time of 1.2 hours, weight-normalized, total body clearance was 30% greater, and the elimination half-life 24% shorter in this pediatric population than in adults.

Dedicated pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age. A retrospective population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted in 323 subjects (181 children 1 to 5 years of age, 18 children 6 to 11 years of age, and 124 adults 18 to 55 years of age) who received single or multiple doses of levocetirizine ranging from 1.25 mg to 30 mg. Data generated from this analysis indicated that administration of 1.25 mg once daily to children 6 months to 5 years of age results in plasma concentrations similar to those of adults receiving 5 mg once daily.

### Current concepts and therapeutic strategies for allergic rhinitis in school-age children [^fa6605c4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common debilitating disorder that can adversely affect the quality of life and the academic performance of school-age children. Symptoms during the day can hamper concentration and lead to learning problems. Nocturnal symptoms can cause sleep loss and secondary daytime fatigue, further undermining a child's ability to function well during the school day Oral antihistamines are the foundation of pharmacologic therapy, but there are important differences between the agents.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the diagnostic and treatment challenges posed by AR in school-age children. The paper discusses and compares the available treatment modalities for this age group, with a focus on their beneficial and adverse effects.

Methods

Pertinent articles were identified in the literature through a MEDLINE search (1990–2003). Keywords used were antihistamines cetirizine fexofenadine loratadine desloratadine intranasal corticosteroids and CNS effects. Results of numerous clinical trials of first-generation early second-generation and the newer antihistamines were identified.

Results

This review established that the socioeconomic costs of AR are considerable. In children aged ≥ 12 years, direct US expenditures (eg, physician visits, medications) in 1996 amounted to $2.3 billion. Indirect costs measured by variables such as missed school days and poor performance also have an impact Major concerns include underdiagnosis and inadequate treatment, increasing the risk of serious comorbid conditions such as asthma. Advantages and drawbacks of antihistamines show that first-generation agents (eg, hydroxyzine) are effective and readily available over the counter, but are associated with sedation and the potential for suboptimal dosing. Newer agents, such as cetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, and fexofenadine are effective and safer than the older drugs tie, no cardiotoxicity and less sedation). Of these, fexofenadine has been shown to be beneficial and nonsedating, even at higher-than-recommended doses. Other therapies reviewed include intranasal corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers.

Conclusions

AR has a considerable negative impact on children in terms of their physical, social, and psychological well-being and academic performance. An appropriate treatment must be effective and tolerable. Of particular importance for enhancing treatment adherence in the school-age population are pleasant taste and ease of use of medication. A drug that has minimal or no sedative or anticholinergic effects is optimal.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^c7fcf1bf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The studies reported here aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24%, a new topical ophthalmic medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

Patients and methods

Three clinical studies evaluated cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% administration: a Phase I prospective, single-center, open-label, pharmacokinetic (PK) study (N = 11) evaluating single-dose administration and twice-daily (BID) administration for 1 week in healthy adults, and two Phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group studies evaluating the safety and tolerability in adult and pediatric populations (2–18 years of age) for up to 6 consecutive weeks. The first safety and tolerability study evaluated cetirizine BID (study 1, N = 512), while the second study examined cetirizine three times daily (TID) (study 2, N = 516). Each study assessed best corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, IOP, dilated ophthalmoscopy, treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, urine pregnancy test, and physical examination (general health, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat). The PK study also measured hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis, while the two Phase III studies additionally assessed corneal endothelial cell counts (ECC) and ECC density in a subset of subjects (via specular microscopy), and drug administration tolerability.

Results

Bilateral administration of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% resulted in low systemic exposure in the PK study and was associated with a low incidence of mild adverse events. There were no drug-related severe or serious adverse events. The tolerability scores between the active and vehicle groups were comparable, demonstrating high comfort in the administration of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24%.

Conclusion

Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% dosed BID or TID demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was well-tolerated when administered to subjects aged ≥ 2 years.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^9b5ddfe9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Most of the approved treatments for ocular allergies are antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, or both, and act to reduce the signs and symptoms of the early-phase reaction. Cetirizine hydrochloride (Zyrtec ®; Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc; New Brunswick, NJ, USA) is the number one oral antihistamine allergy treatment recommended by allergists. Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% used in these studies was a sterile, buffered, clear, colorless aqueous solution containing cetirizine 0.24% (equivalent to cetirizine hydrochloride 0.29%) and 0.010% benzalkonium chloride (preservative). Cetirizine hydrochloride selectively inhibits H1 histamine receptors to treat seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, idiopathic urticaria, and itching due to chronic hivesand has a long-standing record of approval in different formulations. Cetirizine hydrochloride is safe and well tolerated and was approved in tablet form (5 and 10 mg) in USA in 1995, as a syrup formulation in 1996, for children aged 2–5 years in 1998, for children aged 6 months and older in 2002, and for nonprescription use as a chewable tablet and syrup in 2007. The long-standing therapeutic success and safety of cetirizine hydrochloride in different formulations and pronounced ocular symptoms of allergic conjunctivitissupported the development of cetirizine hydrochloride as an ophthalmic solution to combat the ocular effects of allergic conjunctivitis.

In 2018, cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% (Zerviate™) was approved by the Food and Drug Agency for the treatment of ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Here, we report two Phase III efficacy studies that were the basis of this approval. These two studies show strong and similar anti-itch efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared with vehicle using the CAC model. Study 2 expanded the efficacy assessment in Study 1 to subjects with more severe allergic conjunctivitis symptoms including eyelid swelling. Together these studies show reproducible success of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of ocular and nasal signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis in diverse patient populations. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated with a 15-minute onset of action and añ8-hour duration of action.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^5b4ec3e8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Given that allergic reactions are driven by histamine, the therapeutic market has yielded several efficacious systemic antihistamine products. Cetirizine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with a well-characterized systemic safety and efficacy profile due to its use for over 20 years. The anti-allergic efficacy of cetirizine has been documented in various animal and human models. In vitro receptor binding studies have shown no measurable affinity for histamine receptors other than H1 and negligible induction of anticholinergic and anti-serotonergic activity, supporting an on-target product with minimal adaptive immune response. As a result, cetirizine has been approved for use in the United States since 1995 and has since been adapted to various formulations.

Individual patient response to antihistamines can be highly variable, and the efficacy for which systemic antihistamines are valued, including the relief of ocular allergy, is frequently accompanied by ocular adverse events (AEs) such as pupillary changes, blurred vision, and dry eye syndrome. For example, oral cetirizine in patients with normal ocular health has been shown to induce signs and symptoms associated with ocular dryness, including corneal and conjunctival staining, decreased tear film breakup time, and increased ocular discomfort when exposed to a controlled adverse environment (CAE ®). Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% was developed to minimize systemic effects by using a concentration of cetirizine hydrochloride specifically designed for targeted and comfortable ocular administration.

Here we report the results from one pharmacokinetic (PK) and two safety and tolerability studies conducted as part of the drug development program of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% (Zerviate ®). Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% used in these studies was a sterile, buffered, clear, colorless aqueous solution containing cetirizine 0.24% (equivalent to cetirizine hydrochloride 0.29%) and 0.010% benzalkonium chloride (preservative). The vehicle used in these studies was identical to cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% except it did not contain the active drug. Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% demonstrated broad safety and tolerability along with compelling efficacy (Meier et al, 2018, co-submitted) in the relief of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in pediatric (2–18 years of age) and adult subjects.

Pediatric allergic rhinitis — treatment approach and approval ages: For children, management parallels adults and "includes allergen avoidance, AIT in appropriate cases (see Recommendations 34 and 35) for AR, and pharmacotherapy," with approvals noting that "Most pharmacologic treatments for AR are approved for children down to age 5 years, and many down to age 2 years or even younger," and that "Special care must be given to dosage adjustment, adverse effects, and long-term safety." The guideline approach has evolved: "Historically there has been a shift in guidelines from recommending that oral antihistamines generally should be the first-line agents for treatment of AR in children to a broader approach that positions other agents including INCS as first-line considerations in shared decision making with patients and families."

### Safely reducing hospitalizations for anaphylaxis in children through an evidence-based guideline [^9d3cd4f6]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency department visits for anaphylaxis have increased considerably over the past few decades, especially among children. Despite this, anaphylaxis management remains highly variable and contributes to significant health care spending. On the basis of emerging evidence, in this quality improvement project we aimed to safely decrease hospitalization rates, increase the use of cetirizine, and decrease use of corticosteroids for children with anaphylaxis by December 31, 2019.

Methods

A multipronged intervention strategy including a revised evidence-based guideline was implemented at a tertiary children's teaching hospital by using the Model for Improvement. Statistical process control was used to evaluate for changes in key measures. Length of stay and unplanned return visits within 72 hours were monitored as process and balancing measures, respectively. As a national comparison, hospitalization rates were compared with other hospitals' data from the Pediatric Health Information System.

Results

Hospitalizations decreased significantly from 28.5% to 11.2% from preimplementation to implementation, and the balancing measure of 72-hour revisits was stable. The proportion of patients receiving cetirizine increased significantly from 4.2% to 59.7% and use of corticosteroids decreased significantly from 72.6% to 32.4% in patients without asthma. The proportion of patients meeting length of stay criteria increased from 53.3% to 59.9%. Hospitalization rates decreased nationally over time.

Conclusions

We reduced hospitalizations for anaphylaxis by 17.3% without concomitant increases in revisits, demonstrating that unnecessary hospitalizations can be safely avoided. The use of a local evidence-based guideline paired with close outcome monitoring and sustained messaging and feedback to clinicians can effectively improve anaphylaxis management.

approved in the U. S. on October 4, 2019. Quzyttir is currently indicated for the treatment of acute urticaria in adults and children 6 months of age and older. This pediatric postmarketing safety review was prompted by pediatric labeling on approval for Quzyttir on October 4, 2019. The efficacy of Quzyttir was established in patients aged 6 months. – 17 years from extrapolation of efficacy in adults with acute urticaria. The safety of Quzyttir in pediatric patients is supported by information from placebo-controlled clinical trials with oral cetirizine hydrochloride in pediatric patients aged 6 months and older. The safety and efficacy of Quzyttir in patients less than 6 months of age has not been established. A pediatric safety review. efficacy is based on the likelihood that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are similar between these two populations.

The safety of QUZYTTIR in children 6 months to 17 years of age is supported by safety information from placebo-controlled clinical trials with oral cetirizine hydrochloride in patients 6 months of age and older. QUZYTTIR demonstrates a higher Cmax compared to oral cetirizine hydrochloride in adults. As QUZYTTIR is indicated for an acute condition administered in a medically supervised setting, the safety for higher Cmax in children 6 months. to less than 18 years of age is supported by the safety data from the clinical trial with IV cetirizine hydrochloride in adults and available safety information from pediatric overdose cases. Because of the absence of pharmacokinetic and safety information for cetirizine hydrochloride in children.

below 6 years of age with impaired renal or hepatic function, the use of QUZYTTIR in this impaired patient population is not recommended. The safety and efficacy of QUZYTTIR in patients less than 6 months of age has not been established.

### New oral H1 antihistamines in children: facts and unmeet needs [^30c42a8b]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Second-generation antihistamines differ from first-generation ones because of their elevated specificity and affinity for peripheral H1-receptors and because of their lower penetration to the central nervous system, having fewer sedative effects as a result. Over the last few years, new compounds with different pharmacokinetic properties have been synthesized. More recent improvements of the molecules, generally in the form of active metabolites, led to the synthesis of new-generation antihistamines.

Methods

Recommendations on the minimum criteria that would have to be met for compounds to be classified as new-generation antihistamines have been recently established by a consensus statement. In the past, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of H1 antihistamines have not been optimally investigated in the pediatric population, especially in infants and young children.

Results

The pharmacology of second-generation H1 antihistamines has been investigated relatively deeper than old antihistamines in children. In the pediatric population, clinical studies with new-generation antihistamines are still limited in number and, with rare exceptions, of brief duration. Comparative trials on the efficacy and safety between different compounds are also lacking.

Conclusions

Properly designed, long-term trials with new-generation H1 antihistamines need to be performed in single age groups, in order to better define the effects of these drugs in all pediatric population.

Assessments

The PK study evaluated dilated ophthalmoscopy, IOP, physical examination, hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis at visit 1 (post single exposure) and visit 5 (post 1 week continuous BID exposure). BCVA, slit lamp bio-microscopy (SLE), and vital signs were evaluated at visit 1 (screening), and pre- and post-instillation at visits 2, 4, and 5. AEs were recorded at visits 2 through 5. Blood samples for PK measurements were collected 1 hour prior to study drug instillation, and post-instillation of a single dose at 15 ± 3 minutes, 30 ± 5 minutes, 1 hour ± 10 minutes, 1.5 hours ± 10 minutes, 2 hours ± 10 minutes, 3 hours ± 15 minutes, 4 hours ± 20 minutes, 6 hours ± 20 minutes, 8 hours ± 20 minutes, 12 hours ± 60 minutes, 18 hours ± 60 minutes, and 24 hours ± 60 minutes. PK parameters included maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), measured in ng/mL, area under the plasma concentration– time curve (AUC), time to peak plasma concentration (T max), and elimination half-life (T 1/2), the latter two measured in hours.

In the Phase III studies, the safety parameters (IOP, dilated ophthalmoscopy, ECC evaluations among participating subjects, physical examination, and vital signs) were evaluated at visits 1, 4, and 5. BCVA, SLE, and AE queries were performed at every study visit. The Phase III studies also evaluated tolerability (ie, drop comfort) at visits 1, 2, and 3. Drop comfort was self-assessed by subjects immediately upon instillation, 30 seconds post-dose, and 1 minute post-dose by using a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 = very comfortable and 10 = very uncomfortable. For each subject, the average score between eyes at each time point was used for analysis.

### Chronic unremitting urticaria: is the use of antihistamines above the licensed dose effective? A preliminary study of cetirizine at licensed and above-licensed doses [^b86deb1a]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Recently, several authors have suggested an off-label increase of antihistamine dosage should be given to patients with chronic urticaria (CU) not responding to the usual, recommended doses, in order to gain better control of the disease. However, this recommendation is not evidence-based. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of increased doses of antihistamines in patients with CU showing poor control at recommended doses. In total, 22 adult patients with moderate/severe CU not controlled with the usual antihistamine doses were studied. These subjects recorded urticaria severity on a visual analogue scale (range 0–10) for 2 weeks. During the first week, they were treated with cetirizine at the licensed dose (10 mg/day), and with a three-fold increased dose (10 mg x 3/day) during week 2. Only 1 patient (5%) responded satisfactorily to the increased dosage of antihistamine; in the remaining 21 subjects, urticaria scores did not change, and these patients had to be treated with steroids, ciclosporin, and in 1 case with cyclophosphamide. Disease control was eventually gained in all cases. This study suggests that the proportion of patients with severe CU that may gain a better control of their disease with high, off-label doses of antihistamines is probably small, and that most patients will eventually have to undergo more aggressive treatments.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenesis

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, cetirizine hydrochloride was not carcinogenic at dietary doses up to 20 mg/kg (approximately 20, 10, 25, and 6 times the MRHDs in adults, children 6 to 11 years of age, children 2 to 5 years of age, and children 6 months to less than 2 years of age, respectively, on a mg/m2basis). In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, cetirizine hydrochloride caused an increased incidence of benign hepatic tumors in males at a dietary dose of 16 mg/kg (approximately 8, 4, 9, and 2 times the MRHDs in adults, children 6 to 11 years of age, children 2 to 5 years of age, and children 6 months to less than 2 years of age, respectively, on a mg/m2basis). No increased incidence of benign hepatic tumors was observed in mice at a dietary dose of 4 mg/kg (approximately 2, 1, 2, and 0.5 times the MRHDs in adults, children 6 to 11 years of age, children 2 to 5 years of age, and children 6 months to less than 2 years of age, respectively, on a mg/m2basis). The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of QUZYTTIR is not known.

Mutagenesis

Cetirizine hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames test, and not clastogenic in the human lymphocyte assay, the mouse lymphoma assay, and in vivo micronucleus test in rats.

Impairment of Fertility

Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male and female mice and rats that received cetirizine hydrochloride at oral doses up to 64 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 30 and 190 times the MRHD in adults on a mg/m2basis).

Subject demographics

In the PK study, the study population had a mean age of 25.3 (± 6.62) years with a range from 19 to 38 years, slightly more female (54.5%) than male subjects, and a majority of subjects who were ethnically not Hispanic or Latino (81.8%). Racially, white subjects predominated (72.7%) with two subjects classified as other (18.2%), and one subject as Black or African American (9.1%).

Demographics in the BID (study 1) and TID (study 2) were comparable across treatment groups. In the BID study, the mean age was 35.4 (± 19.42) years with more females (60.4%) than males. Ethnically, the majority of subjects were non-Hispanic/Latino (93.9%). The majority of subjects were white (87.3%), followed by Black or African American (7.2%) and other (3.5%), with Asian and American Indian or Alaskan Native accounting for 1% each. In the TID study, the study population had a mean age of 32.2 (± 17.31) years and also contained more females (57.9%) than males. Ethnically, the majority of the subjects were non-Hispanic/Latino (81.0%). The majority of the subjects were white (76.7%) and Black or African American (16.5%), with the races of unknown, Asian, Multiracial, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native accounting for the remaining 6.8% of the population.

### Desloratadine for chronic idiopathic urticaria: a review of clinical efficacy [^b3a5239f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a disabling affliction that considerably limits patients' daily activities and interferes with sleep. Clinical studies have shown that histamine H1-receptor antagonists (antihistamines) are highly effective for inhibiting the hives/wheals and pruritus associated with CIU, as well as improving patients' quality of life. Desloratadine is a rapid-acting, once-daily, nonsedating selective H1-receptor antagonist/inverse receptor agonist with proven clinical efficacy in patients with CIU. It has 10–20 times the in vivo H1 receptor-binding affinity of loratadine, its parent compound, and 52–194 times the H1 receptor-binding affinity of cetirizine, ebastine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. Desloratadine displays linear pharmacokinetics after oral administration. Age and sex have no apparent effect on the drug's metabolism and elimination, and food does not affect its bioavailability or absorption. Desloratadine also exerts anti-inflammatory effects via mechanisms that are independent of H1-receptor antagonism. Results from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 6 weeks' duration in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe CIU indicate that desloratadine significantly minimizes the severity of pruritus, reduces the number and size of hives, and improves disease-impaired sleep and daily activities. Improvements were noted after a single dose of desloratadine and were maintained over 6 weeks of treatment. Desloratadine was safe and well tolerated in clinical trials of patients with CIU. The adverse effect profile of desloratadine in adults, as well as in children aged from 6 months to 11 years, is comparable to that of placebo. Evaluations of cognitive and psychomotor performance in adults indicate no impairment of function with dosages of desloratadine 5 mg/day. In conclusion, desloratadine is an important therapeutic option for prompt and enduring symptom relief in patients with moderate-to-severe CIU. In addition to efficacy and safety, desloratadine affords a convenient administration regimen, rapid onset of action, and an absence of drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Other important prescribing considerations are that, unlike all first-generation and some second-generation antihistamines, desloratadine is nonsedating at its clinically approved dosage and does not impair psychomotor function.

### Two unique cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in childhood treated with anti-interleukin-5 therapy: infantile-onset and submandibular salivary gland involvement [^150f798f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Few pediatric cases of EGPA have been reported in the literature, with most presenting in the mid to late teens with a mean age of around 12-years-old and one post-mortem report of a 2-year-old from 1998. EGPA can present conspicuously at any age with non-specific signs and symptoms that masquerade as common entities such as asthma and allergies. Variation in disease presentation and limited published reports likely contribute to delays in diagnosis, with some children going undiagnosed until they develop life-threatening disease.

We provide two unique cases of EGPA in children that demonstrate the breadth of presentations seen in pediatric EGPA as well the successful use of anti-IL5 therapies. The first had eosinophilic infiltration of the submandibular gland with granulomas and fibrosis, a manifestation not previously reported in a pediatric patient, as well as tracheal nodules with eosinophilic infiltrates. The second is the youngest successfully treated patient with EGPA reported in the literature after presenting at 19 months of age.

Case one: salivary gland involvement

A 13-year-old male with history of environmental allergies presented to his outpatient pediatrician with cough, sinusitis, and periorbital swelling. He was prescribed cetirizine, triamcinolone nasal spray, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (10 days), and oral prednisone (2 days). After 10 days, the periorbital swelling resolved, but his nasal congestion, rhinitis, and dry cough (not responsive to beta-agonist therapy) progressively worsened over the next month, with the addition of fatigue and low-grade fevers. He was again treated with the same antibiotic (14 days), as well as a one-time dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone without resolution of symptoms.

Soon after, he developed submandibular swelling. Flexible nasal endoscopy showed adenoiditis and mucoid rhinorrhea without purulence. Dental evaluation including panoramic x-ray of his teeth did not show evidence of oral disease. A trial of albuterol provided mild improvement in cough. Given ongoing respiratory symptoms in the context of worsening submandibular swelling and pain, fatigue, and a 10-pound weight loss for one month prior, he was admitted to our quaternary care hospital for expedited multidisciplinary evaluation.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^2c2267ad]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% is a strong therapeutic, with an ability to provide quick and extended relief of ocular and nasal symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. There are no safety concerns identified with cetirizine treatment and drop comfort ranged from very comfortable to comfortable. As an ophthalmic solution, cetirizine offers a faster onset of action for ocular and nasal signs and symptoms than the oral formulation and is aided by patient and physician familiarity.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^e123c774]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

BID study (study 1)

BID dosing study, similar to the PK study, supported an acceptable safety profile for cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24%. The mean extent of exposure was 41 days in both the cetirizine and the vehicle groups. No clinically or statistically significant differences in safety parameters were observed between the cetirizine and vehicle groups, with the exception of AEs. AEs were primarily mild. Severe AEs were unrelated to study drug or were resolved at follow-up.

Ocular TEAEs were reported by 121 subjects (23.6%) with 141 ocular TEAE incidences. Events occurring at ≥ 1% in any treatment group are summarized in Table 1. The prevalence of ocular TEAEs among the cetirizine group (22.9%) was lower than that of vehicle group (25.1%). Of the 91 ocular TEAEs reported by 78 subjects in the cetirizine group, 88 were classified as mild and three moderate (Table 2). The most common ocular TEAEs (≥ 1%) in the cetirizine group were conjunctival hyperemia, instillation site pain, and ocular hyperemia, collectively accounting for 61 of 91 ocular disorders in the cetirizine group (Table 1). Similarly, TEAEs in the vehicle group ≥ 1% also included conjunctival hyperemia, instillation site pain, and ocular hyperemia. Blurred vision, dry eye, reduced visual acuity, and eye discharge occurred in up to five subjects from both treatment groups. Although conjunctival hyperemia was the most prevalent TEAE, its prevalence in the cetirizine group was lower than that in the vehicle group (7.9% vs 11.1%, respectively). No incidents of reduced visual acuity were suspected to be related to cetirizine. All other ocular TEAEs occurred in < 1% of subjects in both the treatment groups.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^3e5060cf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatric TEAEs

There were no safety concerns in the pediatric population dosed BID with cetirizine or vehicle. In the pediatric population of the BID study, TEAEs were reported by only one subject aged 2–6 years, eight subjects aged 7–12 years, and one subject aged 13–17 years (Table 4). The majority of incidences were mild in intensity and largely unrelated to study drug. One incidence of conjunctival hyperemia occurred with moderate intensity in the vehicle group.

The TID study comprised a larger pediatric population (128 subjects) and confirmed the safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% in a pediatric population dosed TID with cetirizine or its vehicle. No ocular or non-ocular events occurred in subjects aged 2–6 years and only one event occurred in subjects aged 7–12 years (Table 5). The non-ocular TEAE, which occurred in subjects aged 7–12 years, was streptococcal pharyngitis in the cetirizine group. In subjects aged 13–17 years, one ocular TEAE of meibomian gland dysfunction occurred in one subject and three non-ocular TEAEs of atrial tachycardia, sinusitis, and dermatitis contact occurred in three subjects (Table 5). None of these events were suspected of being related to study treatment. Thus, both BID or TID dosing demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in patients aged 2–18 years.

Tolerability

Drop comfort (tolerability) was graded using an 11-point scale wherein 0 = very comfortable and 10 = very uncomfortable. Higher scores indicated less comfort. The difference in comfort scores between treatment groups was not clinically significant (ie, < 1 unit change). In the BID study, mean scores across subgroups and whole groups ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 in the cetirizine group vs 0.1–0.5 in the vehicle group. Both cetirizine and vehicle groups were comfortable upon administration (Figure 2). The TID study showed similar results with mean scores across subgroups and whole groups of 0.6–0.9 in the cetirizine group compared to 0.2–0.5 in the vehicle group (Figure 2). Thus, cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% instillation was comfortable relative to vehicle and well tolerated.

### Secondary care specialist visits made by children and young people prescribed antidepressants in primary care: a descriptive study using the QResearch database [^9119f623]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study included 33,031 children and young people in England who were prescribed an antidepressant in primary care between January 2006 and December 2017. Of these, 12,149 (37%) had a record of visiting a secondary care paediatric or psychiatric specialist less than 12 months before or 6 months after their first primary care antidepressant prescription. The percentage of 5–17-year-olds prescribed antidepressants with a record of visiting a specialist increased between 2006 and 2012, before levelling off at approximately 39%. Considering only those aged 12–17 years old prescribed SSRIs, 24.4% had a record of visiting a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Although the proportion of visiting a child and adolescent psychiatrist initially increased, it began to decrease after 2013.

These results suggest a significant proportion of children and young people receive prescriptions for antidepressants without the involvement of a relevant specialist, such as a mental health specialist or paediatrician. This is contrary to the NICE guidelines for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which recommend assessment and diagnosis by a child and adolescent psychiatrist before the initiation of antidepressants, and nocturnal enuresis, which recommends referral for further review and assessment of possible underlying factors before initiation of imipramine. There could be several reasons for this, including the lack of awareness of relevant guidelines by GPs. However, one small qualitative study suggested good understanding of the depression guidelines amongst GPs in interviews. Another explanation for GPs initiating antidepressants without the involvement of a specialist could be a lack of prompt access to secondary care services or evidence-based non-pharmacological treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy. There is limited availability of specialist services leading to long waiting times (average 57 days in 2017/2018) and strict acceptance criteria. According to reports by the Children's Commissioner for England, provision of low-level (non-specialist, preventative, and early intervention) mental health services is complicated and variable across the country. If a GP feels a child or young person needs urgent treatment for their mental health condition, and other non-pharmacological options and specialist assessment are not immediately available, they may choose to prescribe antidepressants despite the recommendations of clinical guidelines. In addition, patients or their parents may decline other treatment options or request antidepressants. For example, some of the adolescents in one qualitative study described that without SSRIs, they felt too low to benefit from alternative therapies.

### Safety of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in adult and pediatric subjects [^1c321e4d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-ocular TEAEs that were related to the study drug occurred in < 3% of the study population. Overall, 44 subjects (8.6%) reported 56 non-ocular TEAEs. The percentage of subjects with non-ocular TEAEs was comparable between treatment groups (8.5% cetirizine; 8.8% vehicle). Only two TEAEs occurred at a frequency ≥ 1%: headache and dizziness (Table 1). Of the 37 non-ocular TEAEs reported by 29 subjects in the cetirizine group, 23 non-ocular TEAEs were classified as mild, eleven as moderate, and three as severe (Table 2). These three severe non-ocular TEAEs were trigeminal neuralgia, headache, and herpes zoster. Of severe TEAEs, only headache was suspected to be of related to cetirizine administration.

TID study (study 2)

TID dosing further supported a safe profile for cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24%. In the TID study, the extent of exposure was a mean of 41 days in both the groups. As with the BID study, no significant differences in safety measures were observed between the cetirizine and the vehicle groups, except AEs. Overall, 37 subjects (7.2%) reported 45 ocular TEAEs. As with the BID study, the prevalence of ocular TEAEs among subjects in the cetirizine group (6.7%) was lower than in the vehicle group (8.1%). In both the groups, the majority of the TEAEs were classified as mild. No ocular TEAEs of severe intensity or of serious designation were reported. In the cetirizine group, the ocular TEAEs occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects were reduced visual acuity, conjunctival hyperemia, and instillation site pain (Table 3). In the vehicle group, reduced visual acuity, conjunctival hyperemia, punctate keratitis, and instillation site erythema were all above a frequency of 1% (Table 3). Notably, among the most common ocular TEAEs, only instillation site pain (all classified as mild) had a higher prevalence with cetirizine than with vehicle. All other ocular TEAEs occurred in < 1% of subjects in each treatment group.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^8f9b9ba5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — pregnancy: antihistamines and nasal saline — There is little data on the safety of intranasal antihistamines (INAH) in pregnancy, but a randomized study in pregnant women with allergic rhinitis (AR) found nasal saline lavage safe and effective with symptom, medication use, and resistance reductions, and nasal saline therefore is a good first-line option. As a whole, oral antihistamines still appear to be safe for use in pregnancy; cetirizine was not associated with increased rates of major malformations or teratogenic risk, safety was reaffirmed in a UCB Pharma Patient Safety Database analysis up to February 2015, a 2013 multicenter case-control study of birth defects did not support previously postulated associations between diphenhydramine, loratadine, and chlorpheniramine and major congenital anomalies, and loratadine does not appear to increase hypospadias risk, with a 2014 systematic review identifying the most safety data for loratadine and no evidence of increased risk of hypospadias.

### Comparative activity of cetirizine and desloratadine on histamine-induced wheal-and-flare responses during 24 hours [^eae9522c]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Cetirizine and desloratadine are antihistamines active in the treatment of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria.

Objective

To compare the antihistamine activity of desloratadine, the active metabolite of loratadine, with that of cetirizine in the skin wheal-and-flare responses during 24 hours.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single oral dose, crossover study. Skin reaction to histamine (100 mg/mL), administered by prick tests, was measured by the wheal and flare surface areas for 24 hours (before treatment and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours). Eighteen healthy volunteers (mean age, 33.9 years; 13 women) participated in this study. The areas under the curves of the wheal-and-flare responses as a function of time (primary efficacy variables) were compared using analysis of variance.

Results

A highly significant overall treatment effect (P < .001) was detected for wheal and flare inhibition, with the activity of cetirizine and desloratadine significantly superior to that of placebo (P < .001). In addition, the activity of cetirizine was significantly superior to that of desloratadine (P < .001). With desloratadine, only 3 of the 18 subjects achieved a wheal inhibition of at least 70%, occurring between 2 and 4 hours, whereas all subjects using cetirizine reached a wheal inhibition of at least 70% between 0.5 and 3 hours (median time, 1.7 hours). The difference between the 2 active drugs was highly significant (P < .001). The median duration of wheal inhibition of at least 70% was zero with placebo and desloratadine and was 21.9 hours with cetirizine (P < .001). No serious adverse events were reported, and no subject withdrew from the study due to an adverse event.

Conclusion

Cetirizine was associated with significantly greater suppression of skin reactivity to histamine compared with desloratadine during 24 hours after a single dose, with a consistent duration of action for cetirizine, as previously reported.

### A randomized, double-blind, crossover comparison among cetirizine, levocetirizine, and ucb 28557 on histamine-induced cutaneous responses in healthy adult volunteers [^ba365cbb]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cetirizine is a highly efficacious and long-acting second-generation H1-receptor antagonist for the treatment of allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, in adults and children. Pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that cetirizine, a racemate mixture composed of equal amounts of two enantiomers, does not undergo hepatic metabolism to any significant level. The enantiomers are excreted mainly unchanged, predominantly in the urine and to a lesser extent in the faeces.

Methods

The pharmacologic activity and potency of the two enantiomers of cetirizine in the management of allergic skin conditions were investigated by studying the effect of treatment with 5.0 mg cetirizine; 2.5 mg levocetirizine, the (R)-enantiomer; and 2.5 mg ucb 28557, the (S)-enantiomer, on histamine-induced wheal and flare response in 18 healthy volunteers. Each treatment was administered as a single oral dose in randomized, double-blind, and crossover manner, and the efficacy of treatment was assessed over a period of 32 h, as per cent inhibition of the histamine-induced wheal and flare areas before treatment. Blood and urine samples were collected in a time-dependent manner and analyzed for the total amounts of each study drug, to elucidate their pharmacokinetic profiles.

Results

Both cetirizine and levocetirizine caused a marked inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and flare, whereas ucb 28557 was inactive in this model. Inhibition of the wheal response observed for cetirizine and levocetirizine was apparent by 1 h after dosage and lasted for mean durations of 24.4 and 28.4 h, respectively. In addition, the response for cetirizine and levocetirizine became maximal by 6 h after treatment, rising to 79.5% and 83.8%. Similarly, cetirizine and levocetirizine also markedly inhibited the histamine-induced flare response. This effect was evident for both drugs by 1 h after dosage and lasted over a mean period of 28.4 and 26.0 h, respectively, for cetirizine and levocetirizine. The inhibitory effect of these compounds on histamine-induced flare response was also maximal by approximately 6 h after dosage, peaking at 88.5%) and 83.6%, respectively. Statistical evaluation showed that cetirizine and levocetirizine were equivalent for maximum inhibition of histamine-induced wheal and flare. However, levocetirizine was found to be superior to cetirizine when area under the curve was compared. In contrast, ucb 28557 was not found to inhibit histamine-induced wheal and flare responses at any time during the study period. Plasma concentrations of levocetirizine were found to be approximately double those of ucb 28557 at 4 and 8 h after dosing, and 50–60% of the drugs were excreted unchanged in urine over a period of 32 h.

Conclusions

The finding that, in this model, levocetirizine 2.5 mg has comparable antihistaminic activity to cetirizine 5 mg, whereas its other enantiomer ucb 28557 has no pharmacodynamic effect, suggests that the antihistaminic properties of cetirizine observed in the management of allergic skin conditions are likely to be attributable to levocetirizine.

### Are one or two dangerous? Phenothiazine exposure in toddlers [^202d1311]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Traditionally, pediatric phenothiazine exposures are considered dangerous even at low doses. The actual risk of exposure to 1–2 tablets is unclear. In an attempt to determine this risk, the authors performed a literature search, review of the American Association of Poison Control Center data, and evaluation of related resources (e.g., textbooks, bibliographies of relevant papers). This review reveals only sparse data from case reports regarding morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population despite years of clinical experience. Serious toxicity from exposure to low doses is rare and nearly always the result of chlorpromazine ingestion. Although the risk to the toddler ingesting 1–2 tablets seems to be extremely low, several factors should be considered when determining the need for triage to a health care facility.
