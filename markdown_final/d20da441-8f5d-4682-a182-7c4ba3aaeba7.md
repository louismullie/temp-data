## Question

Seborrheic keratosis of scalp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about seborrheic keratosis of the scalp, seeking guidance on diagnosis, differentiation, key clinical and dermoscopic features, when to biopsy, and treatment options, preserving the thinking process and self-verification steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the diagnosis and distinguishing seborrheic keratosis from seborrheic dermatitis. Then, I should verify the clinical features and dermoscopic clues that support SK on the scalp. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis and when to biopsy. After that, I should review treatment options, including cryotherapy, electrosurgery/curettage, lasers, and topical hydrogen peroxide 40%, and weigh efficacy, safety, and cosmetic outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered algorithm and highlight special considerations for skin of color and recurrence risk, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a common benign epidermal tumor with a "stuck-on" waxy appearance, whereas seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is an inflammatory scalp condition with greasy scaling and erythema; mixing these up would lead to entirely different management, so I need to keep SK in focus here.

> I will now examine the clinical features of SK on the scalp. Typical SKs are well-demarcated, round or oval, brown to black, verrucous papules or plaques with a "stuck-on" feel; on the scalp, they may be pigmented and can catch on combs or be irritated by hair care, prompting removal requests. Wait, let me verify the dermoscopic hallmarks that help at the bedside: milia-like cysts, comedo-like openings, and hairpin vessels with whitish halos are classic and support the diagnosis when the clinical picture is equivocal, which is especially useful when considering melanoma mimics [^111h7d7i].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the differential diagnosis and indications for biopsy. SK can mimic melanoma, pigmented basal cell carcinoma, or even actinic keratosis clinically, so any atypical features, rapid change, bleeding, or diagnostic uncertainty warrant histopathology. I need to ensure I remember that melanoma can rarely arise within or be masked by an SK, reinforcing the threshold for biopsy when the story doesn't fit. For suspected actinic keratosis on the scalp, field-directed therapies like tirbanibulin are guideline-supported, but that is a different entity and should not distract from SK management here [^113cCvKZ] [^1113Ae9v] [^113nBG96].

> Next, I should review treatment rationale. Since SK is benign, treatment is optional and typically driven by cosmetic concerns, symptoms such as pruritus or bleeding, or diagnostic uncertainty. Let me consider patient-specific factors: lesion thickness, number, location on the scalp, skin type, tolerance for downtime, and cost, because these will shape modality choice and counseling about risks like dyspigmentation or scarring [^114A2qnw] [^113Ch48A].

> Cryotherapy is historically the most common in-office approach, so I should verify its pros and cons. Cryosurgery is quick, inexpensive, and requires no anesthesia, with high clearance for thin SKs; however, risks include hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and occasionally scarring, and efficacy can be lower for thick, hyperkeratotic lesions. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought cryotherapy achieves about 50% clearance, but I should double-check; prospective comparative data show clearance around 50% for propane-butane cryotherapy, whereas clinical experience with liquid nitrogen often yields higher rates for thin lesions, so I should frame cryotherapy as effective for appropriately selected thin SKs with pigment change risk, especially in lighter skin types [^112DwMCs] [^114wvKNX] [^1138tcRP].

> Let me consider electrosurgery and curettage next. Curettage with or without electrodesiccation offers high clearance, often exceeding 80–90%, and provides tissue for histology when the diagnosis is uncertain. I should confirm cosmetic trade-offs: these methods can cause scarring and dyspigmentation, and patients may prefer alternatives on the scalp where hair-bearing skin and visibility matter. Still, for thick, hyperkeratotic SKs, curettage remains a workhorse due to efficacy and pathologic confirmation capability [^1138tcRP] [^113Ch48A].

> I will now examine laser options, especially when cosmesis is paramount. Ablative CO2 and Er:YAG lasers achieve high single-session clearance with favorable cosmetic outcomes, though transient erythema and, in darker skin, dyspigmentation can occur. Nonablative pigment-selective lasers (alexandrite, Nd:YAG, KTP, pulsed-dye, picosecond) often require 1–3 sessions but can minimize scarring; picosecond 532 nm has emerging case-based evidence in Asian skin with good results and careful fluence selection. Hold on, I should verify that patient satisfaction is generally high with lasers; yes, reports show 64–95% satisfaction, supporting their role when patients prioritize appearance and are counseled on multiple sessions and costs [^115YLrmb] [^116Asqow] [^114uUygE] [^111BM2wA].

> Topical hydrogen peroxide 40% (HP40, Eskata) is an FDA-approved in-office topical for raised SKs, so I should review its performance and limitations. Phase III trials showed 4–8% complete clearance of all treated SKs at day 106 versus 0% with vehicle, with a favorable safety profile but modest efficacy and notable cost; it is particularly attractive for facial lesions where scarring risk from destructive methods is higher. I need to ensure administration details are correct: apply four times, one minute apart, avoiding eyes, and retreat if needed at three weeks. Given the modest clearance, patient selection and counseling about expectations are essential [^116QRmWY] [^117SNhta] [^114tCmMo].

> But wait, what about other topical or energy-based innovations. Nanosecond pulsed electric field (NPS) technology shows promising clearance and high satisfaction in early studies, and a nitric-zinc solution has preliminary data suggesting clearance after serial applications, though both remain investigational and not first-line. I should confirm that these are options for select patients or centers with access and appropriate counseling on off-label status and limited evidence [^111QUqUw] [^116YvwvU].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm while keeping patient preferences front and center. For thin, minimally symptomatic SKs on the scalp, cryotherapy is reasonable with counseling on dyspigmentation risks. For thick or numerous lesions, or when diagnostic confirmation is desired, curettage with or without electrodesiccation offers high efficacy and histology. For patients prioritizing cosmetic outcomes, especially in visible scalp regions, laser therapy provides excellent results with multiple sessions and careful parameter selection. For small, raised lesions where patients wish to avoid surgery and cost is acceptable, HP40 is a safe, albeit modestly effective, in-office topical alternative. Throughout, I should screen for atypia and biopsy when the story deviates from classic SK to avoid missing melanoma or other malignancies [^113cCvKZ] [^1138tcRP] [^115YLrmb] [^116QRmWY].

> I should double-check special considerations. In patients with skin of color, I need to emphasize higher risks of hypopigmentation with cryotherapy and certain lasers, and consider test spots or pigment-sparing approaches like picosecond lasers with conservative fluences. Recurrence after any modality is possible, though rates are generally low; counseling on expectations and follow-up is prudent. Finally, if a patient presents with a sudden eruption of multiple SK-like lesions, I must consider the Leser-Trélat sign and evaluate for internal malignancy, even though contemporary evidence is mixed and some cases reflect inflammatory regression rather than paraneoplasia [^114uUygE] [^111BM2wA] [^113cCvKZ] [^notfound] [^112V9mkV].

> In summary, seborrheic keratosis of the scalp is a benign epidermal tumor best approached with a patient-centered plan that balances efficacy, safety, cosmesis, and cost. Cryotherapy, curettage/electrosurgery, laser therapies, and HP40 each have roles; selection should be individualized, with heightened vigilance for atypical features that warrant biopsy to exclude malignancy. I need to ensure shared decision-making documents pigment change risks, downtime, number of sessions, and likelihood of clearance so expectations align with outcomes [^111Cgh9r] [^113Ch48A] [^115YLrmb] [^116QRmWY].

Seborrheic keratosis of the scalp is a **benign epidermal tumor** with a waxy, "stuck-on" appearance and variable pigmentation. It is **diagnosed clinically** [^111SzmsJ] and confirmed with dermoscopy [^111h7d7i]; biopsy is reserved for atypical or rapidly changing lesions to exclude malignancy [^113cCvKZ]. Treatment is **not medically necessary** unless for cosmetic reasons, symptoms, or diagnostic uncertainty [^114A2qnw]; options include cryotherapy, electrosurgery, curettage, laser therapy [^115YLrmb], or topical hydrogen peroxide 40% (HP40) [^117SNhta] [^116QRmWY]. Recurrence is common, and patients should be monitored for changes that could indicate malignancy [^111Cgh9r].

---

## Clinical features

- **Appearance**: Waxy, raised, "stuck-on" lesions with a rough, verrucous surface; variable pigmentation (light tan to dark brown/black) [^115CsnuC] [^111Jmb87].
- **Size**: Typically 0.5–3 cm, but can be larger [^115CsnuC].
- **Symptoms**: Usually asymptomatic; may itch, bleed, or become irritated with friction or trauma [^114xo1cV] [^111JuTAk] [^111SzmsJ].
- **Distribution**: Often multiple; commonly on the scalp, face, chest, back, and extremities [^115CsnuC].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on appearance and history [^111Gx4ND]. Dermoscopy shows **comedone-like openings, milia-like cysts, and hairpin vessels** [^111h7d7i]. Biopsy is indicated for **atypical lesions**, rapid growth, bleeding, ulceration, or diagnostic uncertainty to exclude melanoma or other malignancies [^111SzmsJ] [^1113Ae9v].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Melanoma**: Irregular borders, variegated color, recent change [^notfound].
- **Basal cell carcinoma**: Pearly, translucent, telangiectasias [^notfound].
- **Squamous cell carcinoma**: Hyperkeratotic, indurated, ulcerated [^notfound].
- **Warts**: Rough, cauliflower-like, often multiple [^notfound].
- **Solar lentigines**: Flat, uniformly pigmented macules [^notfound].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment is **optional** and based on cosmetic preference, symptoms, or diagnostic uncertainty [^111Gx4ND]. Cryotherapy is commonly used, effective, and well tolerated, though it may cause hypopigmentation or recurrence [^114wvKNX]. Electrosurgery and curettage offer high clearance with potential scarring or pigment change [^1112gvtN]. Laser therapy (CO2, Er:YAG, or pigment-specific lasers) provides good cosmetic results, especially for multiple lesions [^115YLrmb]. Topical hydrogen peroxide 40% (HP40) is FDA-approved for raised SKs, with moderate efficacy and minimal scarring [^117SNhta] [^116QRmWY].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **excellent** because lesions are benign and slow-growing [^114A2qnw]. Recurrence is **common** after treatment, and new lesions may develop over time [^notfound]. Monitoring should include regular skin examinations and patient education on signs of malignant transformation (rapid growth, bleeding, ulceration, color change) [^111SzmsJ].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education should emphasize the **benign nature** of seborrheic keratosis and the lack of malignant potential [^115CsnuC]. Counseling should review treatment options, expected outcomes, and potential side effects. Patients should be advised to seek care if lesions change rapidly, bleed, ulcerate, or develop atypical features [^111SzmsJ].

---

Seborrheic keratosis of the scalp is a **benign lesion** with a characteristic appearance and a favorable prognosis [^115CsnuC]. Treatment is optional and should be individualized based on cosmetic concerns, symptoms, and diagnostic uncertainty [^111Gx4ND].

### Treating seborrheic dermatitis: review of mechanisms and therapeutic options [^115vd4L9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is one of those conditions that dermatologists and patients alike tend to find a routine for, and in many cases those routines are hard to break. And, unlike the new treatment paradigms for eczema, acne, and even actinic keratoses, combination therapies for addressing the disease process typically have not been a part of the approach to treating seborrheic dermatitis. However, with the advent of new therapies and vehicles as well as a better understanding of how neutrophils and free oxygen radicals impact inflammation,1 there are new options to maintain and control the disease process of seborrheic dermatitis to minimize flares. Although the needs of the scalp, face and chest are different, as are the variations in skin types, the fundamental mechanisms of the inflammatory process are often the same. If it is understood that seborrheic dermatitis is histologically classified as a papulosquamous disorder with paucineutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrates, and if the trigger and etiologic agent most likely is Malassezia furfur, then the ideal mechanisms of action of therapies should be directed as such

### Managing seborrheic keratoses: evolving strategies for optimizing patient outcomes [^113Ch48A]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The seborrheic keratosis is the most common benign skin tumor of middle-aged and elderly adults, affecting nearly 83 million individuals in the US alone. Although these are benign lesions, many patients still undergo some form of treatment. Clinicians are frequently presented with a challenge when determining whether to remove a seborrheic keratosis, and which treatment modality to use when doing so. The most commonly used method of removal is cryotherapy, however there are numerous other options that can be employed with varying degrees of efficacy. In this article, we highlight the use of topical keratolytics, vitamin D analogues, and lasers, to name a few. We also address potential side effects associated with these treatment options, as well as discuss patients' preferences and concerns. We conclude with the most recent advances in topical treatments currently under clinical investigation, and offer treatment strategies aimed at maximizing patient satisfaction.

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp [^115R8Rrf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting primarily the skin of the scalp, face, chest, and intertriginous areas, causing scaling and redness of the skin. Current treatment options include antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and keratolytic agents, as well as phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical pharmacological interventions with established anti-inflammatory action for seborrhoeic dermatitis occurring in adolescents and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to September 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database. We searched five trials databases and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs in adults or adolescents (> 16 years) with diagnosed seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp or face, comparing topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and lithium salts) with other treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses if feasible.

Main Results

We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound, and zinc, as well as different anti-inflammatory treatments compared against each other. Our outcomes of interest were total clearance of symptoms, erythema, scaling or pruritus scores, and adverse effects. The risk of bias in studies was most frequently classified as unclear, due to unclear reporting of methods. Steroid treatment resulted in total clearance more often than placebo in short-term trials (four weeks or less) (relative risk (RR) 3.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 11.56, three RCTs, 313 participants) and in one long-term trial (lasting 12 weeks). Steroids were also more effective in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Adverse effects were similar in both groups. There may be no difference between steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in total clearance in the short-term (RR 1.08, 95% 0.88 to 1.32, two RCTs, 60 participants, low-quality evidence). Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors were found comparable in all other assessed efficacy outcomes as well (five RCTs, 237 participants). Adverse events were less common in the steroid group compared with the calcineurin group in the short-term (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.89, two RCTs, 60 participants). There were comparable rates of total clearance in the steroid and azole groups (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32, eight RCTs, 464 participants, moderate-quality evidence) as well as of adverse effects in the short-term, but less erythema or scaling with steroids. We found mild (class I and II) and strong (class III and IV) steroids comparable in the assessed outcomes, including adverse events. The only exception was total clearance in long-term use, which occurred more often with a mild steroid (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98, one RCT, 117 participants, low-quality evidence). In one study, calcineurin inhibitor was more effective than placebo in reducing erythema and scaling, but there were similar rates in total clearance or adverse events for short-term treatment. In another study, calcineurin inhibitor was comparable with azole when erythema, scaling, or adverse effects were measured for longer-term treatment. Lithium was more effective than placebo with regard to total clearance (RR 8.59, 95% CI 2.08 to 35.52, one RCT, 129 participants) with a comparable safety profile. Compared with azole, lithium resulted in total clearance more often (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90 in short-term treatment, one RCT, 288 participants, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical steroids are an effective treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults, with no differences between mild and strong steroids in the short-term. There is some evidence of the benefit of topical calcineurin inhibitor or lithium salt treatment. Treatment with azoles seems as effective as steroids concerning short-term total clearance, but in other outcomes, strong steroids were more effective. Calcineurin inhibitor and azole treatment appeared comparable. Lithium salts were more effective than azoles in producing total clearance. Steroids are similarly effective to calcineurin inhibitors but with less adverse effects. Most of the included studies were small and short, lasting four weeks or less. Future trials should be appropriately blinded; include more than 200 to 300 participants; and compare steroids to calcineurin inhibitors or lithium salts, and calcineurin inhibitors to azoles or lithium salts. The follow-up time should be at least one year, and quality of life should be addressed. There is also a need for the development of well-validated outcome measures.

### Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrheic dermatitis of the face or scalp: summary of a cochrane review [^1173T5tQ]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Are there differences in effectiveness between topical anti-inflammatory treatments (steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or lithium salts) and placebo or azoles in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adults?

Bottom Line

The topical anti-inflammatory treatments were more effective in achieving total clearance of symptoms than placebo by 1.4-fold to 8.5-fold, but there are no considerable differences in the anti-inflammatory topical treatments or in comparison with azoles for short-term treatment. There is no evidence of treatment effects in long-term, continuous, or intermittent use of these compounds despite the chronic nature of the disease.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113cGFMQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is distributed worldwide. It commonly affects the scalp, face and flexures of the body. Treatment options include antifungal drugs, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytic agents and phototherapy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults. A secondary objective is to assess whether the same interventions are effective in the management of seborrhoeic dermatitis in patients with HIV/AIDS.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to December 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, Issue 11), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982). We also searched trials registries and checked the bibliographies of published studies for further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of topical antifungals used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis in adolescents and adults, with primary outcome measures of complete clearance of symptoms and improved quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review author pairs independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for studies with low statistical heterogeneity and used a random-effects model when heterogeneity was high.

Main Results

We included 51 studies with 9052 participants. Of these, 45 trials assessed treatment outcomes at five weeks or less after commencement of treatment, and six trials assessed outcomes over a longer time frame. We believe that 24 trials had some form of conflict of interest, such as funding by pharmaceutical companies. Among the included studies were 12 ketoconazole trials (N = 3253), 11 ciclopirox trials (N = 3029), two lithium trials (N = 141), two bifonazole trials (N = 136) and one clotrimazole trial (N = 126) that compared the effectiveness of these treatments versus placebo or vehicle. Nine ketoconazole trials (N = 632) and one miconazole trial (N = 47) compared these treatments versus steroids. Fourteen studies (N = 1541) compared one antifungal versus another or compared different doses or schedules of administration of the same agent versus one another. KetoconazoleTopical ketoconazole 2% treatment showed a 31% lower risk of failed clearance of rashes compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.81, eight studies, low-quality evidence) at four weeks of follow-up, but the effect on side effects was uncertain because evidence was of very low quality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64, six studies); heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I² = 74%). The median proportion of those who did not have clearance in the placebo groups was 69%. Ketoconazole treatment resulted in a remission rate similar to that of steroids (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, six studies, low-quality evidence), but occurrence of side effects was 44% lower in the ketoconazole group than in the steroid group (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.96, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence). Ketoconozale yielded a similar remission failure rate as ciclopirox (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.26, three studies, low-quality evidence). Most comparisons between ketoconazole and other antifungals were based on single studies that showed comparability of treatment effects. CiclopiroxCiclopirox 1% led to a lower failed remission rate than placebo at four weeks of follow-up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94, eight studies, moderate-quality evidence) with similar rates of side effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.11, four studies, moderate-quality evidence). Other antifungalsClotrimazole and miconazole efficacies were comparable with those of steroids on short-term assessment in single studies. Treatment effects on individual symptoms were less clear and were inconsistent, possibly because of difficulties encountered in measuring these symptoms. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that dose or mode of delivery influenced treatment outcome. Only one study reported on treatment compliance. No study assessed quality of life. One study assessed the maximum rash-free period but provided insufficient data for analysis. One small study in patients with HIV compared the effect of lithium versus placebo on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face, but treatment outcomes were similar.

Authors' Conclusions

Ketoconazole and ciclopirox are more effective than placebo, but limited evidence suggests that either of these agents is more effective than any other agent within the same class. Very few studies have assessed symptom clearance for longer periods than four weeks. Ketoconazole produced findings similar to those of steroids, but side effects were fewer. Treatment effect on overall quality of life remains unknown. Better outcome measures, studies of better quality and better reporting are all needed to improve the evidence base for antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

### Managing seborrheic keratosis: evolving strategies and optimal therapeutic outcomes [^114xo1cV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is the most common skin tumor seen by dermatologists in everyday practice. Although the lesions are mostly benign, many patients still elect to have asymptomatic SK removed. The historical standards of treatment are cryosurgery and electrocautery, two surgical options that are effective at lesion removal but have high rates of postoperative adverse events such as treatment-site scarring and pigmentary alterations. The cosmetic outcomes of SK treatment modalities are of keen interest to dermatologists, as the American population becomes increasingly more diverse. In this article, the inclusion of darker Fitzpatrick skin types into clinical studies investigating post-treatment side effects of SK therapy is reviewed. The recent approval of a 40% hydrogen peroxide topical formulation is discussed in light of these issues, and several non-invasive topical treatments that optimize cosmetic outcomes of SK lesion removal are highlighted. Finally, treatment strategies aimed at reducing cost and minimizing the burden of adverse sequelae are provided. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(9):933–940.

### Diagnosis and treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^1122SeT6]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition in infants, adolescents, and adults. The characteristic symptoms-scaling, erythema, and itching-occur most often on the scalp, face, chest, back, axilla, and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the location and appearance of the lesions. The skin changes are thought to result from an inflammatory response to a common skin organism, Malassezia yeast. Treatment with antifungal agents such as topical ketoconazole is the mainstay of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body. Because of possible adverse effects, anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors should be used only for short durations. Several over-the-counter shampoos are available for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, and patients should be directed to initiate therapy with one of these agents. Antifungal shampoos (long-term) and topical corticosteroids (short-term) can be used as second-line agents for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis.

### Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp: etiology and treatment [^115XB8Fi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common chronic infection of the lipid-rich areas of skin. While seborrheic dermatitis has been a recognized clinical entity for decades, its etiology is far from clear. Early investigators of the development of seborrheic dermatitis focused on the role of the Malassezia (previously Pityrosporum) yeasts. These yeasts are also normal skin commensals, thus their importance as pathogens in this disorder came to be doubted. However, it was subsequently found that treatment of seborrheic dermatitis with an antifungal agent not only resulted in clinical improvement but also reduced the number of Malassezia yeasts on the skin. This has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the Malassezia yeasts. It has been hypothesized that there is an immunological component to seborrheic dermatitis, possibly representing an abnormal host response to the Malassezia yeasts. This paper will discuss the role of Malassezia in the etiology of seborrheic dermatitis, as well as the various treatment options.

### Current understanding of seborrheic keratosis: prevalence, etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management [^114A2qnw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is among the most common cutaneous lesions, affecting some 83 million Americans. Biologically benign, SK lesions do not require removal for medical reasons unless histologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is required or the lesions are traumatized and/or become symptomatic. These macular or popular pigmented lesions are often of cosmetic concern to patients. In addition, their natural history of gradually increasing in size, thickness, and/or pigmentation often serves as the impetus compelling patients to present to a dermatologist for evaluation and skin cancer screening; SK is diagnosed and managed primarily by dermatologists. Data regarding SK prevalence and management from a survey of 594 practicing, board-certified dermatologists are summarized herein: Dermatologists report they diagnose an average of 155 patients per month with SK. Among SK patients presenting to dermatologists, 33% have more than 15 SK lesions and 67% have 15 or fewer SK lesions. On average, dermatologists treat 43% of their SK patients to remove lesions. Cryosurgery is the most common removal method. Other commonly employed removal methods include shave excision, electrodessication, curettage or a combination of these. While these procedures can be used to remove SK lesions effectively, each has potential drawbacks and careful patient selection is required to optimize cosmetic results particularly in skin of color patients and patients with thick or numerous lesions. While there is great interest from both patients and providers in a topical non-invasive treatment for SK, no effective topical therapeutic agent has been developed, and this remains an area of unmet need.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors [^111Cgh9r]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for benign skin lesions, more specifically with respect to management of seborrheic keratosis, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that seborrheic keratoses are common benign lesions that may be treated cosmetically. However, consider evaluating for an underlying malignancy if there is a sudden increase in seborrheic keratosis lesions.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (including cross-over trials and cross-over trials of body parts) of antifungal agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Types of participants

We included studies conducted with adults or adolescents who had been diagnosed by a healthcare practitioner, as explicitly stated or implied within context, as having seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD) of the scalp, face or both based on clinical case definition, with or without laboratory confirmation. The term 'healthcare practitioner' as used implies physicians or another cadre of care providers who used well-defined guidelines for making the diagnosis. We included studies that had described the diagnosis as seborrhoeic eczema or seborrhoeic dermatitis. No consensus has been reached on the difference between seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp and dandruff, which are seen by many as part of a continuous spectrum of dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we also included studies with patients who were diagnosed with dandruff.

### A novel foam formulation of ketoconazole 2% for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis on multiple body regions [^114jm39G]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A novel topical foam formulation of ketoconazole has been developed for use on the scalp, body, and face.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of twice-daily treatment with ketoconazole 2% foam for seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp, body, and face.

Methods

One thousand one hundred sixty-two subjects, aged 12 years or older, with mild to severe seborrheic dermatitis were randomized to receive ketoconazole foam (n = 427), vehicle foam (n = 420), ketoconazole cream (n = 210), or vehicle cream (n = 105) twice daily for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving an Investigator's Static Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 at week 4 (treatment success).

Results

A significantly greater percentage of subjects achieved treatment success using ketoconazole foam than vehicle foam (56% and 42%, respectively; P < .0001); ketoconazole foam was shown to be equivalent to ketoconazole cream. Ketoconazole foam was well-tolerated with a low incidence of treatment-related adverse events (14%; 59/427).

Conclusion

Ketoconazole foam 2% is a safe, effective, and versatile formulation for use on the scalp, body, and face for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis in patients aged 12 years or older.

### Hydrogen peroxide 40% for the treatment of seborrheic keratoses [^117SNhta]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hydrogen peroxide 40% (HP40) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for topical treatment of seborrheic keratosis (SK) in December 2017. This article will review phase II and III clinical trials to assess the drug's efficacy, safety, and clinical application.

Data Sources

A systematic literature review was performed using the terms "Eskata AND seborrheic keratosis", and "hydrogen peroxide AND seborrheic keratosis" in the OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify ongoing or nonpublished studies.

Study Selection and Data Abstraction

Articles written in English between January 2000 and mid-June 2020 discussing phase II and phase III clinical trials were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

In 2 phase III clinical trials, 4% and 8% of patients treated with HP40 had a Physician Lesion Assessment score of zero for all 4 SKs, respectively, compared with 0% in both vehicle groups at the primary end point of day 106 (P < 0.01; P < 0.0001).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

HP40, although less effective, has a better safety profile than other treatment options. It should be especially considered for treatment of facial SKs, where it is most efficacious and where other treatment modalities, such as cryotherapy, are more challenging.

Conclusions

HP40 is a new, safe alternative treatment for SKs, although it is expensive and only modestly effective, both of which somewhat limit its overall utility. HP40 is a promising topical alternative, particularly for cosmetically sensitive locations, such as the face.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: etiology, treatment challenges, and the role of scalp and haircare in managing dandruff [^117K79r2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis are associated with a disrupted scalp barrier that contributes to irritation, pruritus, and flaking of the scalp. The flaking and itch associated with dandruff can significantly impact an individual's self-esteem and quality of life. While the exact pathogenesis of dandruff is still not completely understood, scalp barrier health and its microbiome are thought to play significant roles in disease propagation. Five expert dermatologists with extensive experience in hair, dandruff, and seborrheic dermatitis were selected to participate in discussions that would result in five consensus statements focused on scalp barrier health and dandruff. Results of a systematic literature search and expert panel discussion are presented. These consensus statements aim to reflect expert opinions on the current understanding of scalp health in the context of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. The panel addressed challenges to promote scalp health, improve patient comfort, and prevent flares during dandruff management and maintenance. The presented consensus statements urge reframing our current understanding of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis treatment by refocusing attention on global scalp and hair health.

### Update of pathophysiology and treatment options of seborrheic keratosis [^1112gvtN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a common, benign tumor that can occur on everybody site and can be conservatively managed. Cosmetic concerns, especially when a lesion involves the facial area, are the most common reason for excision. SK shows male gender preponderance and increasing age is an independent association with the condition. Even though more prevalent in the elderly, it has also been reported in younger age groups like adolescents and young adults. Precise pathogenesis is still obscure, but ultra-violet exposure represents a predisposing factor to SK by altering the biochemical concentration and expression of factors like Glutamine deaminases, endothelin, and stem cell factor. Moreover, the accumulation of amyloid-associated protein has also been postulated. Involvement of genitalia has been associated with human papillomavirus infection. Recently, Merkel cell polyomavirus nucleic acid was also detected in SK. Several oncogenic mutations involving FGFR-3 and FOXN1 have been identified. SKs are usually classified clinically and histologically. Dermatoscopy is a noninvasive alternative diagnostic technique widely used in differentiating SK from other benign and malignant tumors. In terms of treatment, topical agents, shave dissection, cryosurgery, electrodesiccation, laser application and curettage under local anesthesia are safe methods for eradication of SKs, mostly for cosmetic purposes. Though generally safe, the latter techniques may occasionally cause post-procedure depigmentation, scarring, and recurrence. Nanosecond-pulsed electric field technology is a promising new technique with fewer side-effects.

### Clinical efficacies of topical agents for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp: a comparative study [^115SuhBA]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that topical steroid and shampoo containing zinc pyrithione provide clinical benefits for treatment of scalp seborrheic dermatitis. But the clinical efficacy of topical tacrolimus, a newly developed calcineurin inhibitor on seborrheic dermatitis, is not well investigated yet. We wanted to compare the clinical efficacy of topical tacrolimus with that of conventional treatment (zinc pyrithione shampoo and topical betamethasone) for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. Patients with seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp were randomly allocated to receive topical betamethasone, topical tacrolimus or zinc pyrithione shampoo. Some patients were instructed to continue the treatments for 8 weeks and the others to discontinue the treatments at week 4. We evaluated the efficacy using a clinical severity score, dandruff score and sebum secretion at baseline, week 4 and week 8. All treatment groups showed significant improvements in clinical assessment after 4 weeks. While the patients treated by zinc pyrithione improved continuously even after cessation of the treatment, the patients treated by betamethasone lotion or tacrolimus ointment were aggravated clinically. Topical tacrolimus was as effective as topical betamethasone, and showed more prolonged remission than topical betamethasone. To treat seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, we think that the combination therapy of topical steroid or topical tacrolimus, and zinc pyrithione is recommended.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Five review authors (EOO, JHV, JHR, OAO and VNB) working in independent pairs screened titles and abstracts of references to identify studies presented as RCTs or controlled trials. We further retrieved full-text articles of such references and ran in-depth checks on study methodology to support our decision on which to include. To ensure that the study selection process was systematic, we developed and used a study selection form that operationalised the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We discussed conflicts between pairs of review authors to resolve them, and when no consensus was reached, a third review author from another pair arbitrated. The same pair of review authors assessed studies for risk of bias with recourse to a third review author when conflicts arose. JHV, JHR and colleagues within The Cochrane Collaboration (see Acknowledgements) translated studies published in languages other than English.

### Efficacy and safety of precision cryotherapy to treat seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp [^1112tJRh]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recently, a new cryotherapy device that precisely controls skin temperature was developed. Precision cryotherapy (PC) can be a safe and alternative treatment modality for immune-related skin diseases that are difficult to treat by conventional cryotherapy because of serious adverse events.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PC in scalp seborrheic dermatitis (SD).

Methods

A single-arm, prospective trial was designed. Twenty-four patients with SD underwent 3 PC interventions 2 weeks apart. At the baseline, Week 6, and Week 8, overall improvements in Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and clinical severity scores were assessed. At each visit, the erythema index (EI) and transepidermal water loss were evaluated. The patients scored 9 subjective symptoms using a visual analog scale (VAS).

Results

The itch VAS score decreased by 50.4% at Week 8. Blinded investigators reported improvement of PGA scores from 2.86 ± 0.62 to 1.66 ± 0.61 and clinical severity scores from 4.55 ± 1.30 to 2.45 ± 1.37. The average EI decreased by 19.6% at Week 8 (p < .05).

Conclusion

This study not only demonstrated the efficacy and safety of PC in scalp SD but it also revealed insights for PC being a promising treatment modality in immune-related skin diseases.

### A review of existing therapies for actinic keratosis: current status and future directions [^112rh3WT]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Features and Diagnosis

The prototypical clinical features of AKs are erythematous scaling patches or plaques located on sun-exposed areas such as the face, scalp, or upper extremities in middle-aged and elderly males. The presence of AK is considered a clinical mark of skin photoaging; they often present as multiple lesions and less frequently as single or a few, either circumscribed or scattered. AK lesions are usually asymptomatic but may occasionally be pruritic or stinging (Fig. 1). The presence of numerous and/or recurrent AK lesions on sun-exposed skin is known as "field cancerization or field cancer", which is defined as an area surrounding the visible AK that may phenotypically appear as normal skin but instead harbors genetic changes similar to those observed in AK. In the context of AK, the FC may be independently initiated by many cells following a mutagenic insult caused by ultraviolet radiation within p53, promoting a clonal expansion of cells and formation of a contiguous patch of cancer-primed cells.

Fig. 1

The different histomorphologic variants include atrophic, hypertrophic, acantholytic, pigmented, lichenoid, and Bowenoid AK.

The diagnosis of AK is mainly based on clinical appearance, although imaging techniques are useful noninvasive diagnostic tools. Among these, dermatoscopy can be used to differentiate AK from invasive cutaneous SCC and to diagnose lesions at an early stage. In addition, reflectance confocal microscopy and high-definition optical coherence tomography may allow the detection of clinically invisible subclinical lesions and monitoring of treatment efficacy. Biopsy of an AK lesion is recommended in equivocal cases in which differential diagnosis — including basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, invasive cutaneous SCC, amelanotic melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, and superficial seborrheic keratosis — cannot be ruled out with clinical examination and imaging techniques.

### Enhancing outcomes in seborrheic keratosis: using a novel treatment solution [^112Wv4tX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is an extremely common benign cutaneous lesion that often appears on individuals older than the age of 50. SK lesions can appear in numerous clinical variations, but typically, SKs present with a well-demarcated, "stuck-on" appearance having a waxy or keratotic surface. Even though SK lesions are usually benign, many individuals elect for SK treatment or removal due to cosmetic concerns. One study regarding SK appearance reported that 61% of women tried to conceal the appearance of the SKs by using certain hairstyles, make-up, and clothes. Conventional treatment for SK lesions ranges from cryosurgery to curettage. Although these removal methods are effective for SK treatment, each method contains a potential for side effects such as pigmentation changes, scarring, and discomfort before and after the procedure. Due to many of these concerns, patients prefer topical treatments for SKs, which has led to a new emerging topical containing hydrogen peroxide topical solution 40% (HP40; Eskata™). Here, we report the methods and results from an HP40 treatment for two individuals, each over 70 years old. Application of the topical solution was performed on each target SK, up to four times, with a 20-second application and 1 minute between applications. The two participants reported moderate success of HP40 in the removal of their SKs with minimal adverse effects.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^117KTgcX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Given the extensive search and absence of language restrictions, we are confident that we located most of the studies on topical antifungal treatments for seborrhoeic dermatitis. However, we found sufficient evidence to draw conclusions only for ketoconazole-, ciclopirox- and bifonazole-based treatments. For several classes of antifungals, no studies at all were conducted. Studies with long-term follow-up were particularly sparse. Various studies were carried out over a wide time span, with the oldest study dating as far back as 1985. Many studies did not report our primary outcomes; when this occurred, we included studies that reported only our secondary outcomes. When studies were so poorly reported that we could not use the data in meta-analyses, we reported study findings in the text of this review. Studies used a wide range of doses and application modes of topical antifungal agents. We included studies on seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp, and on dandruff, which is considered a mild form of seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp. Therefore, we are confident that we have included all available evidence.

In most studies, participants were of widely ranging age groups and of both sexes. Results from most studies were given for all participants without stratification on the basis of sex, age and so forth. Thus we could not explore the role of these personal characteristics in treatment outcomes. Most studies used pregnancy as an exclusion criterion; therefore it is unclear whether antifungals are efficacious in pregnant women within a similar range as in non-pregnant women, given known changes in hormone profiles.

Studies included in this review were conducted in different countries, but these were nations with predominantly light-skinned populations. No study analysed outcomes on the basis of ethnicity of participants; thus it was unclear which segments of study participants were of darker skin. It should be borne in mind that seborrhoeic dermatitis in people with darker skin is less easy to diagnose than in those with lighter skin.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^115sHh3W]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to roflumilast foam, 0.3%, or a vehicle foam. Assignment to treatment group was based on an interactive response technology system using a computer-generated randomization list generated by an unblinded statistician not involved in the trial and stratified by study site and baseline disease severity. The study design included an initial screening period (up to 4 weeks), randomization, 8-week treatment phase, and follow-up phase of 1 week. At week 8, patients who met eligibility requirements were given the option to enroll in an open-label, single-arm, long-term safety extension of the current trial.

Roflumilast foam is uniquely formulated to contain 0.3% roflumilast in an emollient, water-based (65% water) foam without fragrances, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, or ethanol. The foam has a propellant that dissipates rapidly when applied. Vehicle foam was identical to roflumilast foam, 0.3%, without the active ingredient. Each patient received blinded, uniquely numbered kits, each containing 2 blinded, 60-g canisters of the assigned product. The number of kits dispensed to each patient was based on BSA involvement.

Study staff instructed patients how to apply the treatment foam at the randomization (baseline) visit. Investigational product was applied to seborrheic dermatitis lesions as a thin film and rubbed in thoroughly but gently until the product disappeared. The foam was self-administered once daily, in the evening 20 or more minutes before going to bed, except when treatment was applied at the study site on day 0 and week 2. For scalp lesions, treatment was applied when the skin and hair were dry, with special attention given to ensure the treatment was applied to scalp skin and not rubbed off on hair. Patients were to maintain treatment for the duration of the trial regardless of whether treatable areas of seborrheic dermatitis cleared. The study was conducted in accordance with ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council for Harmonisation tripartite guideline. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients at screening prior to trial enrollment. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

### Advances in laser treatments for seborrheic keratosis: a scoping review of efficacy, safety, and patient outcomes [^115YLrmb]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Seborrheic keratoses (SKs) are ubiquitous benign epidermal tumors that prompt cosmetic and symptomatic concerns.

Objective

To map existing evidence on laser-based management of SKs and identify knowledge gaps.

Materials and Methods

A PRISMA-guided search (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CENTRAL) retrieved 22 studies (1,492 patients) that met prespecified inclusion criteria.

Results

Ablative CO2 and Er:YAG devices achieved single-session clearance in up to 90% of lesions, whereas pigment-selective nonablative modalities (755-nm alexandrite, 1,064-nm Nd:YAG, 532-nm KTP, 585-nm pulsed-dye, 730-nm and 755-nm picosecond) required a mean of 1 to 3 sessions. Recurrence ranged from 0% to 6% at ≤ 12-month follow-up. Patient-reported satisfaction varied from moderate to high (64%-95%). Adverse events were generally mild and transient (erythema, edema, postinflammatory dyschromia).

Conclusion

Current evidence supports laser therapy as a safe, effective alternative to cryotherapy, curettage, and electrosurgery, especially when cosmesis is paramount. Standardized parameters and trials that enroll diverse skin types are overdue.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^116nvdrA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice

Ketoconazole was more effective than placebo at four weeks of follow-up and possibly at three months of follow-up, but few longer-term studies have been conducted. Evidence for this was of low quality. Evidence was insufficient to suggest a dose effect. The most often applied dose was 2%, but the frequency of application of treatments varied between studies from once or twice daily to once or three times weekly for varying lengths of time, and it is unclear which regimen works best.

Ketoconazole did not cause more side effects than were observed with placebo. Topical ketoconazole showed similar efficacy when compared with steroids, but steroids showed a two-fold greater risk of side effects than was seen with ketoconazole. Compared with other antifungals, we cannot say that ketoconazole consistently resulted in a more or less effective outcome because most of these comparisons involved single studies.

Ciclopirox was more effective than placebo but with a comparable incidence of side effects. Evidence was insufficient to reveal an effect of increased dose. Evidence was of moderate quality. Ciclopirox showed effects similar to those of ketoconazole. No comparisons of ciclopirox versus steroids were reported.

Bifonazaole was also found to be more effective than placebo.

Outome variables in this review were stratified according to site (scalp, face or scalp and face). Treatment outcomes were fairly consistent for ketoconazole and other antifungals across different application sites. Studies provided insufficient evidence that the mode of delivery accounted for consistent differences in treatment effect.

### Clinical experience with 40% hydrogen peroxide topical solution for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis [^111JuTAk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite reassurances about the benign nature of seborrheic keratoses (SKs), patients often request treatment due to cosmetic concerns or for symptomatic relief when SKs become irritated or pruritic. Treatment options include cryotherapy, surgical techniques, and topical therapies. In this study, we present two patients with SKs located on their face and neck who received in-office treatment with 40% Hydrogen Peroxide Topical Solution (Eskata™, HP40), a new FDA-approved topical therapy that has demonstrated efficacy in phase 3 trials. Compared to non-topical, more invasive techniques, HP40 may lead to less pigmentary changes, and may be more efficacious for SKs on the face and neck. Both patients received two treatment courses of HP40, which resulted in positive therapeutic outcomes, including the absence of scarring and pigmentary changes. In addition to the case presentations, we will discuss considerations for appropriate administration of HP40 to maximize clinical outcomes.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^111YTBVx]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibition may be effective for seborrheic dermatitis based on its capacity to suppress proinflammatory cytokines implicated in seborrheic dermatitis pathophysiology by elevating cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. Limited evidence from case reports and a small clinical trial supported efficacy of the topical PDE4 inhibitor crisaborole and the oral PDE4 inhibitor apremilast, both used off label, for treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. Roflumilast is a selective, highly potent PDE4 inhibitor with between 25- and more than 300-fold greater potency than crisaborole or apremilast in vitro. An oral formulation of roflumilast is approved for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Topical roflumilast is under investigation for long-term management of various dermatologic conditions, including atopic dermatitis, scalp psoriasis, and chronic plaque psoriasis (approved July 29, 2022, by the US Food and Drug Administration). We present results of a phase 2a randomized clinical trial of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, for once-daily treatment of seborrheic dermatitis on scalp and nonscalp locations.

### Dermatologic procedures for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis [^112Z4vVX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This paper examines alternative procedural interventions for Seborrheic Dermatitis (SD), aiming to offer clinicians more treatment options and encourage further research.

Method

A search was conducted on PubMed using specific search terms related to SD and various dermatological procedures. Studies in English, focusing on SD in human patients, and in-office treatments were included. Data were analyzed for procedure type, effectiveness, and side effects.

Results

Nine studies were reviewed, covering phototherapy, indole-3-acetic acid photodynamic therapy (IAA-PDT), Picosecond Nd:YAG laser, botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections, triamcinolone injections, hair growth factor therapy, and precision cryotherapy. Most showed significant efficacy in small cohorts with high patient satisfaction. Hair growth factor therapy had long-term benefits, while narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy showed relapse within one month. Intense pulsed light with supramolecular salicylic acid, IAA-PDT, and laser therapy reduced sebum output and Malassezia furfur. Triamcinolone injections were effective against SD's immunological aspects. Hair growth factor therapy and precision cryotherapy have been successfully used to treat scalp SD. The role of BoNT in SD is still being explored; however, current evidence does not support its use.

Conclusion

Limited data reveal the need for further research on dermatological procedures for SD. These methods show promise for better patient compliance but face challenges such as cost, variable effectiveness, and unknown long-term safety. Future research should focus on protocol standardization and comprehensive evaluation of long-term outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(10):819–824. doi:10.36849/JDD.8116.

### Efficacy of roflumilast foam, 0.3%, in patients with seborrheic dermatitis: a double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 2a randomized clinical trial [^113pznTx]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects patients of all ages, with a global prevalence of 5% or greater. Cardinal features are erythematous, scaly, pruritic patches and plaques, with a yellowish, greasy appearance, affecting areas with abundant sebaceous glands, often accompanied by dyspigmentation in patients with darker skin. Seborrheic dermatitis can have deleterious effects on quality of life, particularly in patients with more severe disease.

Treatment options for seborrheic dermatitis include topical antifungals, corticosteroids, and sulfur/sulfacetamide; topical calcineurin inhibitors are also used off label. Coal tar is less commonly used and is associated with safety concerns. Treatments are available as creams, lotions, ointments, foams, shampoos, gels, and solutions/topical suspensions. Corticosteroids are effective, but should not be used long term due to risk of atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, rosacea, and ocular toxic effects when used on the eyelid. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat seborrheic dermatitis; however, efficacy and safety have been assessed in patients with severe facial seborrheic dermatitis. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are associated with short-term warmth and burning sensations, and labeling includes a warning for rare cases of lymphoma and skin cancer, although clinical data do not suggest higher risk compared with the general population. Scalp seborrheic dermatitis is often treated with shampoos containing antifungal agents, selenium sulfide, or zinc pyrithione. Nonpharmacologic treatments, such as prescription nonsteroidal medical device creams, may also be useful to treat erythema, scaling, and itching associated with seborrheic dermatitis.

### Safety and efficacy of nanosecond pulsed electric field treatment of seborrheic keratoses [^111QUqUw]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nanosecond pulsed electric field technology (also known as Nano-Pulse Stimulation or NPS) is a nonthermal, drug-free, energy-based technology that has demonstrated effects on cellular structures of the dermis and epidermis in previous clinical studies.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single NPS treatment for clearing seborrheic keratoses (SKs).

Materials and Methods

This study was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multisite, nonsignificant risk trial in which each subject served as their own control. Fifty-eight subjects had 3 of 4 confirmed SK lesions treated, resulting in 174 total treated lesions. Subjects returned for 5 to 6 follow-up evaluations and photographs.

Results

At 106 days after NPS treatment, 82% of treated seborrheic keratoses were rated clear or mostly clear by the assessing physician. Seventy-one percent of lesions were rated clear or mostly clear by the 3 independent reviewers based on the 106-day photographs. All treated subjects returned for all study visits, and 78% of the subjects were satisfied or mostly satisfied with the outcome of the treatment. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

The NPS procedure was well tolerated and effective in the removal of SKs.

### The evolving role of therapeutic shampoos for targeting symptoms of inflammatory scalp disorders [^114Y5j4o]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Scalp lesions are common among patients with psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and a number of other inflammatory and fungal conditions. Topical corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment for many scalp dermatoses and they significantly reduce erythema, scaling and pruritus. Conventional corticosteroid formulations such as cream and ointments are often difficult or time consuming for patients to apply and may produce undesirable cosmetic effects. Medicated shampoos provide a more convenient alternative for patients who require topical administration of corticosteroids for scalp conditions. Tar shampoos have long been used to treat psoriasis and are effective for the long-term maintenance of remission in patients who respond to therapy. Antifungal shampoos are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and other mycotic conditions. A shampoo formulation containing fluocinolone acetonide, 0.01% is also approved for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. One superpotent corticosteroid shampoo (clobetasol propionate 0.05%; Clobex Shampoo) is approved in the United States (U.S.) for once-daily treatment of psoriasis of the scalp. The results of a 2007 pilot study also demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo improved the signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. These findings suggest that high-potency corticosteroid shampoos may provide an important option for topical corticosteroid therapy in dermatologic conditions affecting the scalp.

### Use of the alexandrite laser for treatment of seborrheic keratoses [^112dEHrw]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Seborrheic karatoses are benign lesions that are easily irritated and often cosmetically objectionable. Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy and other surgical methods are useful in treating these lesions, but are difficult to tolerate in patients who have large numbers of lesions requiring treatment. The alexandrite laser was used in one patient to quickly and efficiently destroy hundreds of seborrheic keratoses. The treatment was tolerable and excellent cosmetic results were achieved.

### Efficacious and safe management of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis using clobetasol propionate shampoo 0.05% combined with ketoconazole shampoo 2%: a randomized, controlled study [^112e1W3R]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Topical antifungals and corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis. The short-contact clobetasol propionate 0.05% shampoo (CP) is an efficacious and safe once-daily treatment for scalp psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CP alone and combined with ketoconazole shampoo 2% (KC) in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Methods

This randomized and investigator-blinded study consisted of three phases, each lasting 4 weeks. During the treatment phase, subjects were randomized to receive KC twice weekly (K2), CP twice weekly (C2), CP twice weekly alternating with KC twice weekly (C2 + K2) or CP four times weekly alternating with KC twice weekly (C4+K2). All subjects received KC once weekly during the maintenance phase and were untreated during the follow-up phase.

Results

At the end of the treatment phase, all three CP-containing regimens were significantly more efficacious than K2 in decreasing the overall disease severity (P < 0.05). Both combination regimens were also significantly more efficacious than K2 in decreasing each individual sign of the disease (P < 0.05). While the C2 and C4 + K2 groups experienced slight worsening during the maintenance phase, the efficacy of C2 + K2 was sustained and remained the highest among all groups. All regimens were well tolerated without inducing any skin atrophy. Similarly low incidences of telangiectasia, burning and adverse events were observed among the four groups.

Conclusions

The combination therapy of twice-weekly CP alternating with twice-weekly KC provided significantly greater efficacy than KC alone and a sustained effect in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Seborrheic keratoses are superficial epithelial lesions. They are usually pigmented and often warty, but sometimes they appear as smooth papules. These lesions frequently occur on the face during middle and old age. We report an unusual case of a large seborrheic keratosis of the auricle. We also emphasize the importance of the differential diagnosis, and we discuss the treatment strategy for these usually benign but disfiguring tumors.

### Successful use of picosecond laser treatment for seborrheic keratosis in three Asian patients [^116Asqow]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic keratosis is the most common benign tumor of the epidermis and is clinically defined by their sharp demarcation from the neighboring skin, resulting in its distinctive "stuck-on" appearance. Although benign, many patients desire to have these lesions removed due to site irritation, pruritus, or cosmesis. Common treatment options for seborrheic keratosis include cryotherapy, curettage, blunt dissection, and the use of laser therapy. Treatment with erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser has demonstrated a significantly lower rate of post treatment hyperpigmentation when compared to cryotherapy.

Historically, there has been a hesitancy to use laser treatments for patients with skin of color due to an increased risk of postinflammatory dyspigmentation or scarring. In this series, we demonstrate successful use of 532 nm picosecond laser (PicoWay Candela) in the treatment of seborrheic keratosis in three Asian patients. This laser delivers ultrashort pulse durations in the 250 to 450 picosecond range.

Rationale and scope — The Work Group determined that the overall balance of benefits and potential harms as reported at 57 days favors using tirbanibulin for the management of AKs on the face and scalp and that the certainty of the available short-term evidence is high. Future availability of long-term safety data may impact the direction or strength of the recommendation, and the Work Group recognizes that the evidence is restricted to the treatment of a limited field applicable for commonly affected smaller areas such as the central scalp, forehead, or cheek. The Work Group recommends the use of topical tirbanibulin for the management of AK.

### Underdiagnosed and undertreated psoriasis: nuances of treating psoriasis affecting the scalp, face, intertriginous areas, genitals, hands, feet, and nails [^115YnLF4]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

2 METHODS

PubMed literature searches were conducted with the following terms: psoriasis and face/facial, psoriasis and palmoplantar, psoriasis and intertriginous or inverse, psoriasis and genital, psoriasis and scalp, and psoriasis and nail. Abstracts from English‐language articles in the last 10 years were screened for relevance.

2.1 Scalp

Scalp involvement occurs in 45–56% of individuals with psoriasis (Merola, Li, et al. 2016). It is typically among the first affected areas of the body, with the frequency of lesion formation increasing with disease duration. The diagnosis of scalp psoriasis can be delayed due to overlapping features with other papulosquamous disorders of the scalp, particularly seborrheic dermatitis (Treadwell, 2011). Psoriasis lesions on the scalp are usually asymmetrical and sharply demarcated, and exhibit silvery‐white scaling.

The symptoms of scalp psoriasis can result in decreased QoL by causing pain, itching, bleeding, feelings of embarrassment, and restricting clothing choices (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014). QoL is more adversely affected in women than men, and individuals younger than 40 years are more adversely affected compared with patients 60 years or older (Sampogna, Linder, et al. 2014).

Common treatment options for patients with scalp psoriasis include topical agents such as vitamin D analogs, corticosteroids, and coal tar. However, these agents are challenging to use on the scalp because hair makes application burdensome, and many patients find them cosmetically unacceptable (Menter et al. 2011). These issues can lead to nonadherence and dissatisfaction with treatment options.

In a recent systematic review of topical therapies for chronic plaque psoriasis of the scalp, vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy, and corticosteroid monotherapy were found to be more effective and safer than vitamin D monotherapy (Schlager et al. 2016). However, monotherapy with generic topical steroids may be acceptable for short‐term therapy due to the slim efficacy benefit of vitamin D and corticosteroid combination therapy over steroid therapy alone. Targeted phototherapy with an excimer laser can provide an effective alternative to topical therapy when used with a blower device that displaces hair (Menter et al. 2010).

### Successful use of picosecond laser treatment for seborrheic keratosis in three Asian patients [^114uUygE]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These cases demonstrate the successful use of picosecond laser in the treatment of seborrheic keratosis in Asian skin types. The 532 nm wavelength was selected due to the superficial nature of these lesions and high melanin targeting. In contrast to the treatment of lentigines, high fluences can be tolerated because of the nature of seborrheic keratosis being lesions at the epidermal surface that absorb the energy with relative sparing of endogenous melanin. Ensuring effective counseling with patients about periprocedural and postprocedural care facilitates a more successful outcome while reducing the risk of adverse events.

Despite the known additional risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, skin texture changes, or scarring in patients with more pigmented skin types, these cases demonstrate the successful use of an ultrashort pulse duration (250–450 picosecond range) picosecond laser for the treatment of seborrheic keratoses in patients with skin of color and should be considered as a potential treatment option. Future directions include evaluation of a larger sample size and inclusion of a wider range of Asian skin phenotypes to further evaluate the safe use of laser treatment for seborrheic keratoses in skin of color.

### Seborrheic pemphigoid [^112hPHB8]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Seborrheic pemphigoid (SP) is a very rare variant of BP with only 4 cases reported in the literature. The first reported case was an elderly woman described by Schynder in 1969. SP is characterized by vesicles, bullae, and erosions involving the seborrheic areas of the body. Goldberg et alfound that in BP, expression of the BP antigens was variable, with greatest levels on sites of predilection and lowest levels on the scalp, face, and extensor arms. In SP, it is possible that expression of BP antigens is high at the seborrheic areas producing the typical vesicles and bullae. Other findings suggest that the presence of Malassezia and the excess sebum production on seborrheic areas may contribute to the development of SP via koebnerization, acting as a trigger for the disease. In addition, Malassezia is known to activate the classical or alternative complement pathways, possibly augmenting the complement-mediated inflammation seen in typical BP. Because of the rarity of this disease, there are no specific established treatment regimens. However, according to Errichetti et al, treatment with low-dose systemic corticosteroids is effective in SP. Our patient started oral prednisone at 0.2 mg/kg/d with a subsequent taper.

### A novel topical agent in the treatment of seborrheic keratoses: a proof of concept study by clinical and dermoscopic evaluation [^116YvwvU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

In this proof of concept study, 50 lesions from 15 patients with multiple seborrheic keratoses (SKs) were treated with a novel aqueous solution containing nitric acid, zinc and copper salts, and organic acids (acetic, lactic, and oxalic acid). Treatment consisted in the application of an amount of the solution sufficient to obtain a whitening/yellowish reaction. Application of the nitric-zinc solution was performed every other week until clinical and dermoscopic clearance or crust formation, for a maximum of 4 applications. Efficacy evaluation was performed at 8 weeks (T1) and 6 months (T2). All subjects, who reported no or minimal discomfort during and after the application of the solution, completed the study. At T1, a complete clinical and dermoscopic resolution was observed in 37 lesions after an average of 3 applications/lesion (range 2–4). A partial response, with minimal persistent residual spots, was detected in the remaining 13 lesions. All patients with complete clearance showed no relapses at a 6-month follow-up (T2). The positive preliminary results indicate that this novel solution may represent a promising alternative option for SKs especially in patients not keen or eligible to undergo invasive tissue-destructive procedures.

### Practical approaches for seborrheic keratosis treatment: curettage versus 532-nm lithium borate laser versus cryotherapy: a prospective interventional study [^1138tcRP]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is the most prevalent benign skin tumor associated with aging, posing esthetic concerns and potential discomfort. The rising demand for cosmetic interventions prompts the exploration of effective removal methods. This study compares three treatment modalities: curettage, 532nm laser, and propane-butane cryotherapy.

Methods

A prospective interventional clinical study was conducted with 30 subjects, treating 123 SK using curettage, 532nm laser, and propane-butane cryotherapy. Randomized allocation and evaluations at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks were employed. Objective measures included clearance rates (assessed by a dermatologist) and blinded cosmetic ratings by 125 observers. Subjective outcomes encompassed patient-reported pain (VAS), side effects, satisfaction, and preferences.

Results

Curettage achieved the highest clearance rate (87.5% vs. laser: 55%, cryotherapy: 50%; p < 0.01). However, patients perceived complete healing most frequently with laser (90% vs. curettage: 87%, cryotherapy: 53%). Despite lower efficacy, 67% favored laser for future treatments, valuing minimal bleeding and no dressings. Observers rated curettage's cosmetic outcomes superior (50% vs. laser: 22.5%). Laser caused the fewest side effects (mean 0.93/lesion) but highest pain (VAS: 4.62 vs. cryotherapy: 3.85). Cryotherapy showed efficacy comparable to laser (50% vs. 55%) but more adverse events.

Conclusion

Curettage remains optimal for thick, hyperkeratotic SKs, enabling histopathological confirmation. The 532nm laser, preferred subjectively for convenience, may suit small, non-hyperkeratotic lesions but warrants further validation. Propane-butane cryotherapy offers a cost-effective alternative. The discordance between patient preferences (prioritizing convenience) and clinical efficacy underscores the need for personalized treatment strategies balancing outcomes, tolerability, and cosmetic expectations.

### The status of the seborrheic keratosis [^111SzmsJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Seborrheic keratosis (SK), whose appearance is generally a small roundish reddish to brownish scaling lesion ranging in size from a few mm to many mm, may have a single presentation or be one of many such lesions. Because it is a commonly encountered lesion on the face, trunk, or extemities and is readily recognized clinically, it is infrequently biopsied. When the lesion has an unusual pattern or has become irritated, it may rarely mimic a malignancy, Most patients ignore such common age spots; however, others may have concern about their appearence, in which case the SKs have been surgicaly excised. In recent retrospective studies and case reports, SKs have rarely been found to have malignant characteristics. Although these studies are inconclusive, lesions that are inflamed, bleeding, ulcerated, or sufficiently irritated may require being biopsied to rule out melanoma or other malignancies.

### Giant seborrheic keratoses on penis [^112AGj19]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Seborrheic keratoses are very common benign epidermal tumors. Despite the high frequency, the pathogenesis is still unknown. They are extremely rare in the genital area. The participation of human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in pathogenesis of seborrheic keratoses is being discussed.

Aims

The aims of this case report are to inform about extremely rare lesion in genital area in a young man and evaluate the association of HPVs in the development of seborrheic keratoses.

Methods

We used histopathological examination to establish the correct diagnosis, which revealed signs of seborrheic keratosis. The real-time polymerase chain reaction method confirmed low-risk HPV 6 from the lesions.

Main Outcome Measures

HPVs may play a role in pathogenesis of seborrheic keratoses.

Results

The patient was successfully treated with shave excision under spinal anesthesia. Six-month follow-up was without any recurrence. We suggest that HPVs can be considered as etiologic factor in creation of seborrheic keratosis.

Conclusions

Seborrheic keratoses are very common on sun-exposed skin, but they are rare in the genital area, such as on the shaft of penis. This localization may lead to misdiagnosis. Seborrheic keratoses in genital area might negatively influence the sexual life of the patient. Containing HPV 6 low-risk virus, they never lead to malignant transformation.

### Facial seborrheic dermatitis: a report on current status and therapeutic horizons [^1146Q6Ry]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis, characterized by erythema and/or flaking or scaling in areas of high sebaceous activity, affects up to 5% of the US population and often appears in conjunction with other common skin disorders, such as rosacea and acne. Despite ongoing research, its etiology is puzzling. Increased sebaceous and hormonal (androgenic) activity is thought to play a part. Recent evidence suggests an important role for individual susceptibility to irritant metabolites of the skin commensal Malassezia, most probably M globosa. Current approaches thus include agents with antifungal as well as antikeratinizing, and anti-inflammatory activity. Azelaic acid, which has all 3 properties, may be a useful addition to first-line management, which now comprises of topical steroids, the immunosuppressant agents tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, azoles and other antifungals, and keratolytic agents. A recent exploratory study supports the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid 15% gel in seborrheic dermatitis. Azelaic acid may be especially valuable in this application because of its efficacy in treating concomitant rosacea and acne.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors [^111Gx4ND]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Patients will experience a wide range of skin growths and changes over their lifetime. Family physicians should be able to distinguish potentially malignant from benign skin tumors. Most lesions can be diagnosed on the basis of history and clinical examination. Lesions that are suspicious for malignancy, those with changing characteristics, symptomatic lesions, and those that cause cosmetic problems may warrant medical therapy, a simple office procedure (e.g., excision, cryosurgery, laser ablation), or referral. Acrochordons are extremely common, small, and typically pedunculated benign neoplasms. Simple scissor or shave excision, electrodesiccation, or cryosurgery can be used for treatment. Sebaceous hyperplasia presents as asymptomatic, discrete, soft, pale yellow, shiny bumps on the forehead or cheeks, or near hair follicles. Except for cosmesis, they have no clinical significance. Lipomas are soft, flesh-colored nodules that are easily moveable under the overlying skin. Keratoacanthomas are rapidly growing, squamoproliferative benign tumors that resemble squamous cell carcinomas. Early simple excision is recommended. Pyogenic granuloma is a rapidly growing nodule that bleeds easily. Treatment includes laser ablation or shave excision with electrodesiccation of the base. Dermatofibromas are an idiopathic benign proliferation of fibroblasts. No treatment is required unless there is a change in size or color, bleeding, or irritation from trauma. Epidermal inclusion cysts can be treated by simple excision with removal of the cyst and cyst wall. Seborrheic keratoses and cherry angiomas generally do not require treatment.

Tirbanibulin efficacy — In phase III trials at day 57, tirbanibulin achieved higher complete clearance of AKs than vehicle, with pooled clearance rate 174 [49.3%] of 353 vs 30 [8.6%] of 349 (risk ratio, 6.14; 95% CI, 2.73–13.80; P < .0001). Tirbanibulin also produced higher partial clearance (≥ 75% reduction in the number of treated AKs), with pooled partial clearance rate 255 [72.2%] of 353 vs 63 [18.1%] of 349 (risk ratio, 3.99; 95% CI, 3.16–5.04; P < .00001). At 12 months, estimated recurrence among previously cleared participants was 47%, and the estimate for recurrent or new lesions in the treatment area was 73%. An open-label phase II study in adults with AKs on the face and scalp reported a complete clearance rate of 43% for participants (n = 84) treated with tirbanibulin 1% for 5 consecutive days at day 57.

### Reconstruction of the defect at temporal hairline by a scalp keystone island flap: clinical experience on 14 cases [^113JJxA1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The reconstructions of defects at the temporal hairline always require more complicated designs and higher surgical skills to acquire better aesthetic results. By taking advantage of the unique anatomy of the temporal region, the authors designed a scalp keystone island flap pedicled by superficial temporal fascia to repair defects on the temporal hairline.

Methods

The authors retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 14 patients who had lesions adjacent to the temporal hairline between April 2018 and June 2020. Patients were diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, or seborrheic keratosis. These lesions were resected and reconstructed by scalp keystone island flaps. The defects ranged from 2.0 cm × 1.5 cm to 3.0 cm × 3.5 cm.

Results

All patients were satisfied with postoperative morphology and reported no recurrence at the 6 to 24 months follow-up. Flaps in two patients were partially necrosed but eventually healed by dressing changes. The rest had the first intention of healing.

Conclusions

The scalp keystone island flap is a very useful method to repair small or medium defects at the temporal hairline. This flap can be flexibly designed and easily performed with a high survival rate and good aesthetic results. It provides another surgical option for complicated reconstruction.

### Cryosurgery for common skin conditions [^112DwMCs]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Cryosurgery is a highly effective treatment for a broad range of benign skin problems. With appropriate instruction and supervised experience, family physicians can master the technique quickly. Cryosurgery is best suited for use in patients with light skin and for treatment of lesions in most non-hair-bearing areas of the body. Spray methods include the timed spot freeze technique, the rotary or spiral pattern, and the paintbrush method. Benign skin lesions that are suitable for freezing include actinic keratosis, solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis, viral wart, molluscum contagiosum, and dermatofibroma. Cryosurgery requires little time and fits easily into the physician's office schedule. Advantages of this treatment include a short preparation time, low risk of infection, and minimal wound care. In addition, cryosurgery requires no expensive supplies or injectable anesthesia, and the patient does not have to return for suture removal. Potential side effects include bleeding, blister formation, headache, hair loss, and hypopigmentation, but rarely scarring. Skin lesions often can be treated in a single session, although some require several treatments.

### Frequency of seborrheic keratosis biopsies in the United States: a benchmark of skin lesion care quality and cost effectiveness [^117Mt8dh]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Most seborrheic keratoses may be readily clinically differentiated from skin cancer, but occasional lesions resemble atypical melanocytic neoplasms.

Objective

To evaluate the frequency, cost, and intensity of procedures performed that result in the removal and histopathologic evaluation of seborrheic keratoses.

Methods

Episodes of surgical removal of lesions that were identified as seborrheic keratoses by histologic identification were determined using Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data from 1998 to 1999. These episodes were defined by a histopathology procedure code that is associated with a diagnosis code for seborrheic keratosis. We then identified what procedure(s) generated the histopathology specimen. Biopsy and shave procedures were considered "low intensity", whereas excision and repair procedures were considered "high intensity".

Results

Dermatologists managed 85% of all episodes of seborrheic keratoses. Dermatologists managed 89% of seborrheic keratosis episodes using low-intensity procedures compared with 51% by other specialties. For nondermatologists, 46% of the treatment cost (9 million US dollars) to Medicare was generated from high-intensity management compared with 15% by dermatologists (6 million US dollars).

Conclusion

There is a significant difference in the management of suspicious pigmented lesions between dermatologists and other specialists. This affects both the cost and quality of care.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors [^113cCvKZ]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients commonly present to family physicians with skin findings, and distinguishing common benign skin tumors from potentially malignant tumors is important. Benign skin tumors can often be diagnosed by their history, distribution, and characteristic morphology. A biopsy or excision is indicated if there is diagnostic uncertainty or the lesion undergoes uncharacteristic or rapid change. A keratoacanthoma is a dome-shaped nodule with a central crater and can be difficult to distinguish from squamous cell carcinomas even with dermoscopy. Pilar cysts are typically benign, but rapidly growing types could have malignant qualities. Dermoid cysts, depending on their location, can have intracranial extension if untreated. Although dermatofibromas and seborrheic keratoses are benign, atypical presentations must be differentiated from melanomas. Sebaceous hyperplasia can mimic early basal cell carcinoma. Treatment options for cherry angiomas, acrochordons, slow-growing pilar cysts, and dermatofibromas should be individualized to skin type, lesion characteristics, and the patient's cosmetic preference. Generally, excision is the treatment of choice for keratoacanthomas, rapidly proliferating pilar cysts, and dermoid cysts. Cherry angiomas are treated with laser therapy and sebaceous hyperplasia with electrodesiccation. Common treatments for acrochordons and seborrheic keratoses are shave excision and cryotherapy. Pyogenic granulomas sometimes self-involute but bleed easily and often recur at the original site. They generally respond to shave excision and electrodesiccation. In patients with darker skin, treatment with cryotherapy and laser therapy should include discussions about hypopigmentation risk.

### Intradermal botulinum toxin A injection for scalp sebum secretion regulation: a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in Chinese subjects [^1122MVpJ]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Patients

From October 2020 to November 2021, this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, prospective study recruited Chinese patients (Fitzpatrick skin types II-IV) aged 25 to 45 years who complained of oily scalp and/or hair. The baseline calvarium scalp sebum levels of the patients, according to the measurement at 24 hours postshampooing, exceeded 100 μg/cm². The exclusion criteria included the presence of scalp infection or skin abnormality, seborrheic dermatitis, AGA, trichotillomania, scarring alopecia, and alopecia areata. Patients with symptoms or history of autoimmune disease, neuromuscular disease, cancer, bleeding tendency, coagulation disorder, diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis, immunocompromise, severe systemic disease, and hypersensitivity to botulinum toxin or any of its components were excluded. Patients who were prone to scarring, were pregnant or lactating, or had received laser, chemical peeling, soft tissue filling, mesotherapy, BTX-A injection, or other surgeries on the head within 3 months of screening were excluded. Patients who had had their hair permed and/or dyed within 1 month of screening were also excluded. The exclusion criteria also included history of systemic corticosteroids, antifungals, isotretinoin, or oral contraceptive use in the last 3 months. Patients who had used topical corticosteroids or antifungal shampoos or solutions within the past 4 weeks were excluded as well.

The study was approved by the Sichuan Shesays Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Hospital Institutional Ethical Committee (No. 2020–07–02) and was conducted in compliance with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.

Treatment

The patients were randomly allocated to either the intradermal BTX-A injection group or the NS injection group. The randomization was achieved by means of a random number table. 9–11 Briefly, a number was selected randomly in the random number table, and the following 49 numbers were then selected sequentially. Each selected number represented 1 enrolled patient. A patient was randomly allocated to the BTX-A treatment if the number was odd, or to the NS treatment if the number was even. Both the patients and the physicians were blinded to treatment.

### Successful use of picosecond laser treatment for seborrheic keratosis in three Asian patients [^115LLA5i]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case reports

Three Asian patients were treated for seborrheic keratoses on the face with a 532-nm picosecond laser. Lesions were diagnosed as seborrheic keratoses based on clinical exam, and a thorough history was obtained prior to treatment to exclude other forms of pigmentation such as melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. When there was diagnostic uncertainty regarding the diagnosis (lentigo vs macular seborrheic keratosis), a test spot was performed. The exact test spot locations varied by patient; however, all were performed away from the central areas of the face. Patients were re-evaluated six-eight weeks later at which time treatment was carried out if no adverse effects were noted. All test spots were completed without any postinflammatory hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation.

No topical anesthesia was used as treatment was well-tolerated. The treatment endpoint was a light white frost. After treatment, all patients were instructed to apply petrolatum ointment and sunscreen directly after the treatment and throughout the duration of treatment. Digital photographs were taken before and after each treatment. Time between treatments was variable and ranged from 1 to 10 months depending on each patient's schedules. There was marked improvement in the size, number, and color of the lesions following treatment (Fig 1). No postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, significant swelling, or other adverse events were noted. Postprocedural monitoring ranged from 4 to 24 months during which time no recurrences were noted.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^112T6VKe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Implications for research

The following issues should be attended to in future trials.

Methodological quality - Trial investigators should describe random sequence allocation, allocation concealment and blinding when reporting trials, as would this would make for greater certainty of conclusions.
Completeness of reporting - Side effects and conflicts of interest should be better reported.
Validated outcome measures - This review has emphasised the applicability of validated outcome measures. Expert committees of dermatologists should consider what outcome measures would most objectively assess treatment efficacy in seborrhoeic dermatitis. These should be streamlined and validated. In the interim, all trials should report the proportions of participants with complete clearance of symptoms.
Participant-oriented outcome variables - Measures such as quality of life index would enhance the objectivity of the assessment of efficacy and would provide participants' perspectives on level of efficacy. Future research should consider using these measures, albeit in a standardised way, for outcome assessment.
Compliance with treatment regimen - This clearly impacts outcomes for any mode of treatment. A summary documentation of actual compliance among participants completing trials could be used to stratify analyses of efficacy.
Longer-term assessments with follow-up of at least one year are needed because seborrhoic dermatitis is a chronic condition with a high relapse rate. This plan will also enable better long-term assessment of side effects. A treatment regimen is needed for the intermittent delivery of active agent to a site at a rate that would compromise neither efficacy nor participant compliance. This consideration would address and define parameters for sustained remission.
Economic evaluations - As most of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries, the suitability of evidence so obtained for providers in resource-constrained settings, where prescribers often have to decide between effectiveness and affordability of care, remains questionable. Good economic evaluations would give an indication regarding which option would best suit the collective objectives of patients, providers and the financing system.
We found various kinds of placebo favoured by different trial investigators. Given the high rate of resolution of symptoms under placebo treatment (about 25%), it is important to find out which aspects of treatment could account for this. Some of these placebos were vehicles and bases commonly used as carriers for the active agent. Specific formulations of many placebos were unstated. We considered that the formulation of the placebo may have implications for efficacy. Although this review did not include an analysis based on choice of comparative placebo, it would seem a reasonable undertaking. Subsequent reviews on this topic should explore this question.

### Hydrogen peroxide (eskata) [^114tCmMo]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

2.1	Important Administration Information

ESKATA is to be administered by a health care provider.

For topical use only. Not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.

Do not apply ESKATA topical solution to open or infected seborrheic keratoses.

Prior to application of ESKATA, ensure the surface of seborrheic keratosis lesion is clear of oil and debris (an alcohol wipe can be used).

During a single in-office treatment session, apply ESKATA to seborrheic keratosis lesions 4 times, approximately 1 minute apart. After one use, replace the cap and discard the unit dose applicator.

When treating seborrheic keratoses on the face, take appropriate actions to ensure that ESKATA will not come into contact with the eyes.

If the treated lesions have not completely cleared approximately 3 weeks after treatment, another treatment may be administered following the same procedure.

2.2 Dosage and Administration Instructions

Preparation of the ESKATA applicator

Wear nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the activation of the ESKATA applicator and during the administration of the solution to the lesion(s).

The method for preparing the ESKATA applicator for use is illustrated below. While activating the applicator, hold it away from the patient. Do not remove the cap until after completion of Step 4 (below).

Application of ESKATA topical solution

Following release of the solution from the ampule, remove the cap from the ESKATA applicator. Gently squeeze the applicator barrel to express the solution to the applicator tip. Using the applicator, apply the solution directly to the seborrheic keratosis in a circular motion. Apply enough solution to uniformly wet the lesion surface, including the edges without excess running or dripping. Wait 1 minute and observe. Whitening of the lesion may occur.

Do not progress to subsequent applications if severe erythema/edema or pain occur. Apply again in the same manner 3 additional applications 1 minute apart.

Minimize the amount of drug that comes into contact with surrounding skin. If ESKATA does come into contact with surrounding skin, use an absorbent wipe to remove any excess solution (do not use paper towels or tissue).

### Clearance of seborrhoeic keratoses with topical dobesilate [^1117dDjV]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A patient with two seborrhoeic keratoses in the face received a single daily application of dobesilate cream during 6 months. Dobesilate achieved complete clearance of the seborrhoeic keratosis lesions with good cosmoses, suggesting that this compound is a safe and efficient candidate in the treatment of seborrhoeic keratoses.

### Management of seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis versicolor [^116vTSgv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis are two very common skin diseases. Pityriasis versicolor is a chronic superficial fungal disease usually located on the upper trunk, neck, or upper arms. In pityriasis versicolor, the lipophilic yeast Malassezia (also know as Pityrosporum ovale or P. orbiculare) changes from the blastospore form to the mycelial form under the influence of predisposing factors. The most important exogenous factors are high temperatures and a high relative humidity which probably explain why pityriasis versicolor is more common in the tropics. The most important endogenous factors are greasy skin, hyperhidrosis, hereditary factors, corticosteroid treatment and immunodeficiency. There are many ways of treating pityriasis versicolor topically. Options include propylene glycol, ketoconazole shampoo, zinc pyrithione shampoo, ciclopiroxamine, selenium sulfide, and topical antifungals. In difficult cases, short term treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole is effective and well tolerated. To avoid recurrence a prophylactic treatment regimen is mandatory. Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by red scaly lesions predominantly located on the scalp, face and upper trunk. There are now many studies indicating that Malassezia plays an important role in this condition. Even a normal number of Malassezia will start an inflammatory reaction. Mild corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. However, the disease recurs quickly, often within just a few days. Antifungal therapy is effective in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and, because it reduces the number of Malassezia, the time to recurrence is increased compared with treatment with corticosteroids. Antifungal therapy should be the primary treatment of this disease.

### Neurodermatitis of the scalp associated with trichotillomania treated with roflumilast cream 0.3 [^111p1DTC]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Neurodermatitis of the scalp is a chronic skin condition that can result in features of lichen simplex chronicus. This can manifest as thickened and hyperpigmented plaques marked by accentuated scaling and alopecia as a result of hair breakage. In this condition, the intense urge to scratch is a hallmark and is precipitated by pruritus secondary to either psychological stress, scalp dysesthesia, chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, or pruritic skin diseases. The feeling of satisfaction that ensues after the act of scratching precipitates an itch-scratch cycle, which contributes to the persistence and progression of the lesions.

Management is usually very challenging and should first be directed towards interrupting the itch-scratch cycle. This can be attempted by targeting the trigger, be it a psychological or a medical one, through proper psychological and medical evaluation. Treatment options aiming at decreasing the itching include topical or systemic steroids, antihistamines, topical tacrolimus, salicylic acid, capsaicin, gabapentin, and antipsychotic drugs, each with different efficacy and side effect profiles. Thus, other treatment options with similar effect and more tolerated side effect profile might be of benefit.

Studies have shown that phosphodiesterase-4, an enzyme expressed in keratinocytes and inflammatory cells, is upregulated in some inflammatory conditions. Normally, this enzyme catabolizes cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a signaling molecule for multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, inhibiting phosphodiesterase-4 will cause an accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in inflammatory cells and, in turn, a decrease in the inflammatory profile dictated by the production of cytokines. Clinical trials were successful in proving the efficacy of roflumilast cream in reducing itch-related sleep loss and improving the quality of life of patients with psoriasis. The foam formulation of the drug showed similarly promising outcomes when it comes to itching in the context of seborrheic dermatitis.

In our patient's case, roflumilast cream 0.3% could represent an alternative topical treatment for neurodermatitis of the scalp with less pronounced side effects. This case report also highlights the importance of identifying other coexisting diseases that can help provide the best treatment option with a multidisciplinary approach tailored to the patient. Further research is warranted to better understand the interaction between this disease and other common diseases of the scalp as well as the benefits and risks of roflumilast cream or foam in its treatment.

### Successful use of picosecond laser treatment for seborrheic keratosis in three Asian patients [^111BM2wA]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 1 is a 70-year-old male with numerous brown patches and plaques consistent with seborrheic keratoses on the face (Table I). He had previously used fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%, hydroquinone 4%, and tretinoin 0.05% combination cream without significant improvement. The patient underwent 5 treatments with a 532 nm picosecond laser over 2 years. The fluences used ranged between 0.7 and 0.8 J/cm² with a 4 mm spot size.

Table I

Case 2 is a 67-year-old male with seborrheic keratoses on the bilateral cheeks (Table I). He underwent 3 treatments with a 532 nm picosecond laser over the course of 5 months. The fluences used ranged between 1.2 and 1.4 J/cm² using a 3 mm spot size.

Case 3 is a 69-year-old-female with seborrheic keratoses on the bilateral cheeks and temples. She had 4 treatments over the course of 2 years with a 532 nm picosecond laser (Table I). The fluences used ranged between 0.5 and 1.2 J/cm² using a 4 mm spot size. The patient also used hydroquinone 6% cream concurrently.

### Comparative evaluation of topical diclofenac sodium versus topical ibuprofen in the treatment of seborrheic keratosis [^116a6p5T]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2016, a case of seborrheic keratosis was successfully treated with diclofenac gel 3%. Diclofenac gel mechanism of action is most likely through induction of apoptosis. This study included 30 patients with multiple seborrheic keratosis. One lesion was treated with topical diclofenac sodium gel 1% and another lesion with topical ibuprofen gel applied twice daily for 8weeks. Adobe photoshop CS6 was used to measure the surface area of the lesions before treatment and after 8weeks. There was a highly statistically significant difference in the surface area of the lesions before and after treatment with topical diclofenac 1% gel (P = 0.001) but there was no statistically significant difference with topical ibuprofen gel (P = 0.057). There was a highly significant difference between the two treatment regimens as regard the percentage of change in surface area of the lesions, with higher change in the diclofenc 1% gel-treated group (P = 0.001). No patients complain from any side effect from either treatment.

### Tirbanibulin 1% ointment for the treatment of hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis [^113q2LM5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, tirbanibulin reached 54.9% of CC and 28% of PC in 51 hyperkeratotic AKs on the face and scalp. Tirbanibulin appears to be more effective in treating facial AKs than scalp AKs, possibly due to differences in skin structure and drug absorption. Facial skin is thinner and more permeable, which may allow for better drug penetration into the epidermal layers where AKs develop. In contrast, the scalp has a thicker stratum corneum, which can act as a barrier, thus reducing tirbanibulin absorption, potentially limiting its efficacy.

Tirbanibulin has shown unique features in terms of mechanism of action, including its dual activity on microtubule dynamics and Src kinase signaling, short treatment duration, clinical outcomes, and favorable tolerability profile. These characteristics may support its use across various AK presentations, including hyperkeratotic forms, maintaining an excellent safety profile even when applied on a large field of up to 100 cm².

Although recently approved, tirbanibulin is demonstrating great versatility in addressing various dermatological conditions, including viral lesions and neoplastic entities such as cSCC and BCC. Additionally, an emerging body of evidence suggests that tirbanibulin may have anti‐aging and skin‐lightening properties. Therefore, it is unsurprising that, even in this case, tirbanibulin can show efficacy for pathologies other than its initial approval, including hyperkeratotic AKs. In our study, no mechanical pre‐treatment (e.g. curettage or ablative techniques) or prior application of keratolytic agents was performed before starting the treatment with tirbanibulin ointment, to directly assess treatment efficacy without the confounding effect of lesion debridement. Nonetheless, the results have been encouraging, consistent with those observed in non‐hyperkeratotic lesions, confirming the good therapeutic efficacy previously observed in both clinical trials and real‐world studies.

### Exuberant scale crust of the scalp [^117QrhUK]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

An otherwise healthy 19-year-old African-American man presented with a 6-month history of unremitting scabbed lesions on the scalp. Physical examination found hyperkeratotic plaques with matted, powdery, white crust along the scalp (Fig 1, A and B). He did not respond to antibiotic therapy with cephalexin and doxycycline or topical antifungal therapy with ketoconazole 2% shampoo. A punch biopsy was obtained. On histopathology, suprabasilar acantholysis was seen (Fig 2). Additional studies were subsequently done, including a direct immunofluorescence (DIF), which indicated epidermal IgG and C3 deposition with sparse junctional C3 deposition. Periodic acid–Schiff was suggestive of superficial colonization.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Seborrheic dermatitis
B. Tinea capitis
C. Pemphigus vulgaris
D. Scalp psoriasis
E. Bullous pemphigoid
Anwers:
A. Seborrheic dermatitis – Incorrect. This diagnosis is not supported given histopathology findings and the positive DIF.
B. Tinea capitis – Incorrect. This diagnosis is not supported given histopathology findings and the positive DIF. Superficial colonization is a nonspecific finding and may represent biocontamination.
C. Pemphigus vulgaris – Correct. This is the most likely diagnosis given histopathology findings of suprabasilar acantholysis, which is consistent with pemphigus vulgaris. Findings of epidermal IgG and C3 deposition is also consistent with this diagnosis.
D. Scalp psoriasis – Incorrect. This diagnosis is not supported given histopathology findings and the positive DIF.
E. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. Suprabasilar acantholysis is absent in bullous pemphigoid. However, loss of intercellular connections is expected in a disease such as pemphigus vulgaris.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^115pKAiH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The rationale for certain treatment regimens was seldom given; most studies simply stated that participants were treated for four weeks with a 2% solution to be applied twice daily. However, wide variation in dose and mode of delivery was observed without a clear explanation for this. It is interesting no relationship between dose and the outcome 'clearance of symptoms' was obvious at the study level as an indirect comparison. It was only when individual symptom outcomes were assessed that higher doses seemed to produce a better treatment effect. However, this observation was based only on single studies. In direct comparisons of dose effect, no reason was found to conclude that different doses had different treatment effects.

The major problem with the quality of the evidence was how outcomes were measured. We failed to identify any validated outcome measure for seborrhoeic dermatitis or outcome measures conventionally endorsed by expert committees or ranking specialist fora. This situation also applies to other dermatological disorders, as our consultation with experts in the field revealed. Our principal outcome measure, namely, total clearance, has face validity, but we do not know how reliably it can be measured. Global severity scores have the drawback that they can be based on assessment of any symptom/affected area combination, which could weaken the reliability of the measure. Therefore, we excluded studies that measured outcomes in this way. They are listed under excluded studies. Although we undertook rigorous assessment of treatment outcomes, considerable heterogeneity was observed in most comparisons, which we could explain only by attributing differences to the absence of validated outcome measures.

Reliable quality of life measurements, which constitute one of our prespecified outcome measures, could prevent in part measurement at symptom level and indicate how treatment influences a more general outcome. However no studies used this outcome. In addition, what constitutes a clinically relevant change in scores for symptoms is unclear. A validated scale should take the clinically relevant change into account.

### Common benign skin tumors [^112szV61]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Benign skin tumors are commonly seen by family physicians. The ability to properly diagnose and treat common benign tumors and to distinguish them from malignant lesions is a vital skill for all family physicians. Any lesions for which the diagnosis is uncertain, based on the history and gross examination, should be biopsied for histopathologic examination to rule out malignancy. Lipomas are technically subcutaneous soft tissue tumors, not skin tumors, and controversy exists about whether keratoacanthomas have malignant potential; however, both are discussed in this article because they are common tumors evaluated by family physicians. Diagnosis usually is based on the appearance of the lesion and the patient's clinical history, although biopsy is sometimes required. Treatment includes excision, cryotherapy, curettage with or without electrodesiccation, and pharmacotherapy, and is based on the type of tumor and its location. Generally, excision is the treatment of choice for lipomas, dermatofibromas, keratoacanthomas, pyogenic granulomas, and epidermoid cysts. Cherry angiomas and sebaceous hyperplasia are often treated with laser therapy and electrodesiccation. Common treatments for acrochordons and seborrheic keratoses are cryotherapy and shave excision. Referral is indicated if the family physician is not confident with the diagnostic evaluation or treatment of a lesion, or if a biopsy reveals melanoma.

### Tirbanibulin (Klisyri) [^1127dnF4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Actinic Keratosis of the Face or Scalp

Two double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials (NCT03285477 and NCT03285490) were conducted with 702 adult subjects with actinic keratosis on the face or scalp. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to KLISYRI or vehicle. Subjects enrolled had 4 to 8 clinically typical, visible, and discrete AK lesions in a contiguous area of 25 cm² on the face or scalp. Subjects had an average age of 70 years (range 45 to 96 years), were predominantly White (99%), male (87%), with Fitzpatrick skin types I or II (72%) and actinic keratosis on the face (68%) or scalp (32%). Treatment groups were comparable across all demographics and baseline characteristics, including AK lesion count and distribution on the face or scalp.

Subjects received 5 consecutive days of once daily treatment with either KLISYRI (353) or vehicle control (349) to the treatment field. Subjects with complete (100%) clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 returned to the clinic for recurrence assessment every 3 months for a total of 12 months post-Day 57.

The primary efficacy endpoint was complete (100%) clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area, defined as the proportion of subjects at Day 57 with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area and the secondary endpoint was partial (≥ 75%) clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area. Results from both trials are presented below.

Efficacy was consistent across sex and age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years) subgroups.

Subjects who achieved 100% clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 continued to be followed for up to 12 months following Day 57 to determine the recurrence rate. Recurrence was defined as the proportion of subjects with any identified AK lesion (new or previous lesion) in the previously treated area who achieved 100% clearance at Day 57. Of the 174 subjects treated with KLISYRI who were followed, the recurrence rate at 12 months post-Day 57 was 73%.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^113uC6oN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Differences between protocol and review

Title

We changed the review title from 'Interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis' to 'Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis'. In the protocol, we presented this review as an all-encompassing interventions review for seborrhoeic dermatitis. We had to modify that goal and limit ourselves to topical antifungal agents used for treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis. This decision was made because of the multiplicity of comparisons and the equally diverse outcome variables that we encountered. We reasoned that for meaningful comparisons, leading to coherent conclusions, it was best to split the review into segments focusing on major classes of treatment as we identified them from the trials that we scoured, which will be published in series, at the end of which an overview can be written.

Searches

We had proposed to conduct a search for side effects of various interventions used to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis. We did not carry out this search because we lacked the resources. In the included studies, adverse effects that were reported were non-specific; therefore with hindsight, we believe that a search for specific adverse effects would have been difficult to perform. We also decided that searching grey literature and conference proceedings, as proposed in the protocol, would not yield extra information. The quality of reporting of published trials was already low, which made analysis difficult. Conference proceedings that were covered by the electronic search provided very little in terms of data, and we believe that it was not useful to further pursue this search approach.

Excluded studies

We decided to exclude studies in which antifungals were combined with other active medicines in the same treatment; this was not specified in the protocol. This decision was made when it became clear that with these combination treatments, treatment effect could not be attributed to the antifungal when in combination with an active agent of another class, or to a specific antifungal when in combination with another antifungal.

Interventions

We set out to include all interventions for seborrhoeic dermatitis but later reconsidered this proposal and rather split the review into two parts. This part is related only to topical antifungals.

### Seborrheic keratoses: the rodney dangerfield of skin lesions, and why they should get our respect [^1166Pxiz]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Neel et al. have demonstrated that seborrheic keratosis, the most common of all skin tumors, is dependent on acutely transforming retrovirus AKT8 in rodent T-cell lymphoma signaling. The authors found that these lesions are hypersensitive to Akt inhibitors which bind to the ATP binding site of Akt. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is resistant to Akt inhibitors. The implications of this study are not limited to seborrheic keratosis. The presence of wild type p53 (seborrheic keratosis) or mutant p53 (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma) appears to dictate whether a lesion is sensitive to Akt inhibition or not.

### Differential diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis: clinical and dermoscopic features [^111Jmb87]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a benign epidermal keratinocytic tumor that is extremely common, particularly in individuals over the age of 50. Most individuals with SK will have more than one lesion and the presence of over 10 lesions in the same person is not uncommon. Although the clinical morphology of most SK with their stuck-on, symmetric, keratotic, and waxy appearance makes them easy to identify, many manifest a morphology resembling melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. One can argue that such cases will ultimately not prove to be problematic since a simple biopsy will easily reveal their benign nature and eliminate any concerns. However, the cost and morbidity associated with the biopsy of benign lesions should not be underestimated. Methods to improve our in vivo ability to correctly identify SK will prove beneficial not only to the health care system in general but to the individual patient specifically. The issue of greater concern resides with skin cancers that mimic SK or when skin cancers arise in association with SK. Needless to say, in vivo methods to help identify malignancy and differentiate them from benign lesions would be welcomed by all. Fortunately, we do now have in vivo imaging methods such as dermoscopy that can improve the clinician's diagnostic accuracy. In this article, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the clinical and dermoscopic features of SK, and provide clues to aid in their diagnosis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(9):835–842.

### Neurodermatitis of the scalp associated with trichotillomania treated with roflumilast cream 0.3 [^113eCRyT]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurodermatitis of the scalp is a chronic skin condition that results in lichenification of the skin secondary to excessive scratching or excoriations. It affects mostly women over the age of 35. Treatment options include topical and intralesional steroids, topical capsaicin, or topical tacrolimus. Systemic treatments such as sedative antihistamines or antipsychotics have also been used. Roflumilast cream 0.3% is a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 for the treatment of psoriasis, and later in its foam form for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. We report the case of a 76-year-old female with neurodermatitis of the scalp associated with trichotillomania that was successfully treated with roflumilast cream 0.3%.

2.2 Facial

Facial psoriasis typically presents at a younger age and is estimated to affect nearly 50% of patients with psoriasis (Canpolat et al. 2008). Further, the presence of highly visible lesions can result in considerable psychosocial problems (Beattie & Lewis‐Jones, 2006). The treatment of facial psoriasis is complicated by underappreciation of its prevalence despite being a marker of more severe disease (Canpolat et al. 2008). In patients with facial psoriasis, whole‐body PASI scores are typically higher (15.6) than in patients without facial involvement (6.9), and they are also more likely to have a Koebner phenomenon (70.2% vs. 29.8%) (Canpolat et al. 2008). Additionally, psoriasis in this area is associated with longer disease duration, earlier onset, and frequently requires more extensive treatment, and it may sometimes be dismissed as seborrheic dermatitis or sebopsoriasis (Young Park, Hyun Rim, Beom Choe, & Il Youn, 2004).

Facial psoriasis is classified into 3 categories based on lesion distribution: mixed (39.1%), peripherofacial (37.1%), and centrofacial (23.7%) (van de Kerkhof et al. 2007). Centrofacial involvement likely indicates patients with the most severe form of facial psoriasis because it is associated with higher mean total‐body PASI scores, a lower age of onset, and requires more extensive treatment than the peripherofacial variant (Woo, Choi, Yoon, Jo, & Youn, 2008). Patients with mixed type had significantly higher facial, scalp, and total‐body PASI scores than the other 2 forms (Woo et al. 2008). Patients with facial involvement are more likely to report nail involvement, pruritus, symptoms that worsen with trauma, and hospitalization due to psoriasis (Young Park et al. 2004).

### Melanoma within the seborrheic keratosis [^1113Ae9v]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic keratoses (SKs) are common benign nonmelanocytic epidermal tumors with characteristic clinical features, which are thought to allow a straightforward diagnosis in most situations. As a result, it is an accepted practice to destroy them without histopathologic confirmation. However, systematic reviews of histologic specimens reveal an erroneous clinical diagnosis or associated malignant tumors in a number of cases, including malignant melanomas. We describe a patient with a clinically typical-appearing SK, which was biopsied and histologically proven to be a malignant melanoma arising in the SK. Our report is a reminder that the reliability of clinical diagnosis of SKs needs to be questioned. In addition, a biopsy of SKs is not only warranted but necessary in order to identify a malignant melanoma that would otherwise be misdiagnosed or even completely missed.

### Cutaneous cryosurgery for common skin conditions [^114wvKNX]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Cryosurgery is the application of freezing temperatures to achieve the destruction of tissue. Cutaneous cryosurgery has become a commonly performed outpatient procedure because of the combination of its safety, effectiveness, low cost, ease of use, lack of need for injectable anesthetic, and good cosmetic results. Cryosurgery may be performed in the outpatient setting using dipstick, spray, or cryoprobe techniques to treat a variety of benign, premalignant, and malignant skin lesions with high cure rates. Benign lesions such as common and plantar warts, anogenital condylomas, molluscum contagiosum, and seborrheic keratoses can be treated with cryotherapy. Basal and squamous cell carcinomas with low-risk features may be treated with cryosurgery. Contraindications to cryosurgery include neoplasms with indefinite margins or when pathology is desired, basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas with high-risk features, and prior adverse local reaction or hypersensitivity to cryosurgery. Potential adverse effects include bleeding, blistering, edema, paresthesia, and pain and less commonly include tendon rupture, scarring, alopecia, atrophy, and hypopigmentation.

### Guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis [^111yP7K4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Actinic keratoses (AKs) natural history and malignant progression — distribution, evolution, risk markers, and molecular drivers are described: "AKs are typically absent in the first decades of life unless genetic or environmental factors predispose an individual to increased skin damage from UV exposure", and they "typically present in areas of highest solar damage in fair-skinned individuals" including "the head, ears, neck, dorsal aspects of the arms and hands, and the lower extremities", with the scalp "particularly in areas of hair loss" also frequently involved. AKs "often persist as chronic skin lesions" but "can spontaneously involute, or most importantly, evolve into keratinocyte carcinoma if left untreated", a concern "in patients with a previous history of skin cancer, advanced age", and "immunosuppression". AKs "represent an indication for risk of developing skin cancer and are a clear target for skin cancer prevention, as the successful treatment of AKs is associated with a lower incidence of skin cancer". At the molecular level, keratinocyte hyperplasia is "driven by acquired somatic mutations in the keratinocyte DNA, induced by UV mutagenesis", featuring "C to T and CC to TT changes" linked to "direct DNA damage from UVB" and spectra "initiated by the results of reactive oxygen species… due to UVA-induced reactive oxygen species production"; characterized mutations include "mutations in TP53, the gene encoding the p53 protein", which has "an important role in tumor suppression" and is noted "including SCC".

### Psoriasiform keratosis [^116V7org]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Presented herein are 18 cases of erythematous, scaly papules or plaques with microscopic features of both seborrheic keratosis and psoriasis. There was, however, no known clinical diagnosis of psoriasis in any patient, neither at initial presentation nor on follow-up examination. Most lesions were solitary, present for 6–7 months, and identified on the upper or lower extremities. Other sites included the scalp, neck, shoulders, and back. Men were affected slightly more often than women. The mean age at diagnosis was 66.8 years. The most common diagnoses, clinically, were seborrheic keratosis, followed by basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, actinic (solar) keratosis, and squamous cell carcinoma, among others. The lesions averaged less than a centimeter in diameter and were dome shaped, scaly, and yellow to gray-tan. Histologic examination revealed irregular verrucous epidermal acanthosis, with hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, hypergranulosis, and intracorneal collections of neutrophils, often in alternating tiers. Vascular dilatation and lymphocytic chronic inflammation were present in the superficial dermis. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain for yeasts or dermatophytes was negative in all cases. There was no clinical evidence of disseminated psoriasis in any patient; the mean follow-up duration was 22.6 months. We have coined the term psoriasiform keratosis as a provisional appellation until the nature of these lesions is determined more definitively. It is unclear whether a psoriasiform keratosis is a rudimentary manifestation of psoriasis or a lesion sui generis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 6. guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^116SXSSX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Scalp psoriasis — treatment challenges and formulation considerations are outlined for topical therapy. Psoriasis frequently manifests initially on the scalp, and the presence of hair makes the use of ointments and cream-based products particularly difficult and messy; the recent availability of shampoo, gel, solution, oil, foam, and other formulations has allowed for easier to use and more acceptable scalp therapies. Scalp psoriasis remains one of the most frustrating, difficult to manage, and resistant forms of the disease, and this is not easily explained by poor penetration because the normal scalp has a weak barrier function compared with normal-appearing skin. Koebnerization of the scalp from repetitive scratching frequently leads to unilateral fixed, well-circumscribed hypertrophic plaques, causing further difficulties in control with resistance to therapy aggravated by poor adherence related to time restraints, frustration, and lack of clinical response.

### Focused update: guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis [^112DRqDL]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Actinic keratosis — tirbanibulin background, regimen, and supporting trials indicate that a first-in-class microtubule inhibitor, tirbanibulin, was approved for the topical, field-directed treatment of AK on the scalp or face by the US Food and Drug Administration in December of 2020, and tirbanibulin 1% ointment is indicated for a once-daily application for 5 consecutive days. A systematic literature search identified 2 phase III randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials; both trials compared a standard regimen of topical tirbanibulin 1% applied once daily to a 25 cm2 treatment field containing 4 to 8 AKs on the face or scalp for 5 consecutive days to vehicle, and the trials included 702 adult participants with AKs; tirbanibulin's mechanism of action addresses 2 pathways upregulated in AK and squamous cell carcinoma by inhibiting tubulin polymerization and disrupting Src kinase signaling.

### Efficacy and safety of cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, CO ₂ laser, and Er: YAG laser in the treatment of seborrheic keratosis [^114edV1a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a common benign skin epidermal lesion. Different treatment modalities have been proposed for this lesion. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of electrodesiccation, cryotherapy, CO2 laser, and Er:YAG laser in the treatment of SK. The study was carried out on 30 patients each with four similar facial SKs. Each lesion was assigned to be treated with cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, CO2 laser, and Er:YAG laser in a random fashion. Therapeutic results were evaluated 8weeks after the interventions through clinical and dermatoscopic assessment. Treatment improvement criteria for each lesion included the texture of the lesion, severity of the pigmentation, and an overall assessment of the healing. The severity of burning, pain, erythema, and the duration of the erythema after the procedures were documented. A survey of the patients' satisfaction with the treatments was also performed. In the assessment of overall lesion healing by two dermatologists, the improvement rate was significantly higher in the CO2, Er:YAG lasers and electrodesiccation group compared to the cryotherapy (p < 0.001). However, the CO2 and Er:YAG laser and the electrodesiccation groups showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was observed in posttreatment pigmentation and texture between the groups (p > 0.05). The pain and burning severity after the interventions were negligible in all four groups. Prolonged erythema was not observed in any of the cases; however, the duration of erythema in the Er:YAG laser group was significantly longer (p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction in the cryotherapy group was significantly lower than the other three groups (p < 0.001). The efficacy of treatment and patient satisfaction rate is highly comparable between electrodesiccation, CO2 laser, and Er:YAG laser but significantly higher than cryotherapy.

### Dermatosis papulosis nigra: treatment options [^113cz4EC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Dermatosis papulosis nigra (DPN) is a very prevalent skin condition among certain ethnic groups, especially African-Americans and Afro-Caribbeans. The histology is not significantly different from that of seborrheic keratosis. DPN does not pose any health dangers, but patients often seek removal due to aesthetic concerns since it occurs commonly on the face. When performing any elective procedure, it is important that great care is taken to prevent complications so as to not merely exchange one defect for another such as a scar or discoloration. This article will outline options for management of this common cosmetic problem.

### Focused update: guidelines of care for the management of actinic keratosis [^11715KVL]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Actinic keratosis guidelines focused update — tirbanibulin addition: A strong recommendation for the use of topical tirbanibulin was added to the list of recommended therapies for actinic keratosis. The focused guideline update considers the evidence on the use of topical tirbanibulin to treat actinic keratosis. The page notes short-term efficacy and safety evidence specific to the management of AKs on the face and scalp and states that the future availability of long-term safety data may impact the direction or strength of the recommendation.

### Chronic nonscarring scalp folliculitis responding to topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast [^114fB6bk]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

In our case, the patient was treated with roflumilast 0.3% topical foam once daily and achieved nearly complete clearance of scalp folliculitis within 10 days. Roflumilast is a once-daily topical medication available in various formulations, including a 0.3% concentration approved for treating plaque psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, and a 0.15% concentration recently approved for atopic dermatitis. It inhibits PDE-4, leading to the downregulation of multiple inflammatory mediators including several key cytokines involved in neutrophil activation and chemotaxis such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8. The effect of topical roflumilast on CNSSF may therefore be due in part to its immunomodulatory impact, reducing neutrophilic inflammation.

In conclusion, the topical PDE-4 inhibitor roflumilast offers a promising treatment option for patients who have exhausted other topical therapies and prefer to avoid or cannot tolerate systemic treatments. Further comprehensive studies are needed to confirm the overall efficacy of roflumilast in treating CNSSF and other scalp folliculitis conditions.

### Seborrheic keratoses… [^112V9mkV]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

† We observed a patient in whom large numbers of seborrheic keratoses developed in the course of a generalized dermatitis that progressed into an exfoliative erythroderma. A renal mass was finally discovered and was surgically excised. On microscopic examination, the kidney tumor proved to be a benign fibrous-walled, multilocular cyst. After removal of the renal cyst, the erythroderma and exfoliation subsided. A few months later, the seborrheic keratoses were noted to have become smaller, flatter, and fewer in number. Microscopic examination of five such involuting lesions showed, in each instance, mononuclear cell infiltration of the seborrheic keratoses. Our findings confirm earlier reports that seborrheic keratosis-like lesions developing during the course of widespread inflammatory cutaneous disorders may regress after control of the dermatosis and suggest that mononuclear cell inflammation may be the mechanism by which regression of these lesions is accomplished.

### Dermoscopy of pigmented seborrheic keratosis… [^111h7d7i]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A, Macroscopic photograph of a seborrheic keratosis. B, Dermoscopy shows a sharply demarcated lesion with multiple fissures that give the lesion a brainlike appearance. A, Macroscopic photograph of a seborrheic keratosis. B, Dermoscopy shows a sharply demarcated lesion with multiple hairpin blood vessels surrounded by a whitish halo, some milialike cysts, and comedolike openings. The most common dermoscopic characteristics for seborrheic keratoses are comedolike openings and milialike cysts. Milialike cysts are round, whitish or yellowish structures that correspond to small intraepidermal, keratin-filled cysts. 17, 31–35 They may also be seen in some congenital nevi and in some papillomatous melanocytic nevi. Comedolike openings are mainly seen in seborrheic keratosis or papillomatous melanocytic nevi.

Keratin-filled invaginations of the epidermis correspond histopathologically to comedolike structures. 17, 31–35. The elementary lesion was identified on the clinical image. The reticulated type of seborrheic keratosis was mainly found in patch lesions and the acanthotic type was mainly found in thicker lesions. Hairpin vessels were found in 129 lesions. They were mainly found in thicker lesions. Of the 203 seborrheic keratoses, 183 lesions were sharply demarcated. Hairpin blood vessels were found in 129 of the pigmented seborrheic keratoses. According to Kreusch and Koch39 they correspond to long capillary loops, commonly seen in keratinizing tumors, and are mainly found at the border or in the periphery of the lesions.

In most of the cases, clusters of blood vessels are grouped together and each of them has a whitish halo that gives them almost a "grapelike" appearance. This typical vascular architecture is predominantly seen in seborrheic keratosis.

### Seborrheic keratoses… [^115CsnuC]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

SEBORRHEIC keratoses, sometimes designated as verrucae seniles, seborrheic warts, pigmented papillomas, or verrucae pigmentosae, are relatively benign lesions which should be differentiated from precancerous senile keratoses. Seborrheic keratoses are sharply circumscribed, oval or round elevations, varying in size from 0. 25 to 3 cm. These lesions are flat and multiple, but as their size increases they sometimes become pedunculated and covered with a greasy, friable scale. Common sites are the chest, interscapular region, waistline, and face. Early lesions are grayish-yellow; older lesions become yellowish-brown or black. They usually occur in persons aged 40 years or older. Textbooks on genetics, such as those of Snyder1 and of Gates, 2 do not contain any specific reference to this condition as being congenital.

Recent observations on seven families, including those of two local physicians, have impressed me with the belief that Jadassohn's3 hereditary concept is at present among the more plausible REICHES AJ. SEBORRHEIC KERATOSES: Are They Delayed Hereditary Nevi. AMA Arch Derm Syphilol. 1952; 65: 596–600.

### Differential diagnosis… [^112RM7Lo]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis can affect patients from infancy to old age. 1–3 The condition most commonly occurs in infants within the first three months of life and in adults at 30 to 60 years of age. In adolescents and adults, it usually presents as scalp scaling or as mild to marked erythema of the nasolabial fold during times of stress or sleep deprivation. The latter type tends to affect men more often than women and often is precipitated by emotional stress. An uncommon generalized form in infants may be linked to immunodeficiencies. Classification Adolescent and adult seborrheic dermatitis usually starts as mild greasy scaling of the scalp with erythema and scaling of the nasolabial folds. or the postauricular skin. The scaling often is concurrent with an oily complexion and appears in areas of increased sebaceous gland activity.

Sometimes the central face is involved. Blepharitis, with meibomian gland occlusion and abscess formation, otitis externa, and coexistent acne vulgaris or pityriasis versicolor, may be evident. In infants, seborrheic dermatitis may present as thick, greasy scales on the vertex of the scalp. This presentation often is the only sign of seborrheic dermatitis in infants and usually occurs in the third or fourth week after birth. However, the scalp, central face, forehead, and ears may have fine, widespread scaling. The dermatitis may become generalized. The flexural folds may be involved, often with a cheesy exudate that manifests as a diaper dermatitis that also may become generalized. ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS The conventional treatment for adult seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp starts with topical steroids or a calcineurin inhibitor.

These therapies may be administered as a shampoo, such as fluocinolone, topical steroid solutions, lotions applied to the scalp, or creams applied to the skin. Patients should leave these shampoos on the hair for at least five minutes to ensure that it reaches the scalp. Patients also may use it on other affected sites, such as the face. Infantile seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp requires a gentle approach 3.
