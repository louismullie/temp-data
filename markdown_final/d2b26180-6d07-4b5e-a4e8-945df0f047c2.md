## Question

Condition occurs on eldary people couses ecssive imagination

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition in older adults causes excessive imagination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "excessive imagination" means clinically versus colloquially. Then, I should identify the most likely conditions that fit this description in the elderly. Next, I will verify key diagnostic features and common mimics or confounders. After that, I should review risk factors, pathophysiology, and epidemiology to confirm plausibility. Finally, I will consider management principles and conclude with the most probable diagnosis, while noting important alternatives to keep in mind.

> Let me first confirm the terminology because "excessive imagination" is imprecise in medicine; wait, let me verify how best to translate this into a psychiatric/neurologic symptom construct. The closest clinical entities typically include vivid, intrusive mental imagery, pseudohallucinations with retained insight, and hallucinations in the absence of external stimuli, which in older adults commonly arise from Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS), Parkinson's disease and Lewy body disease, delirium, medication-induced psychosis, or psychiatric disorders such as late-onset schizophrenia and OCD with intrusive mental images; importantly, these phenomena need to be distinguished from illusions, which are misperceptions of real stimuli rather than spontaneous imagery [^112QCcFN] [^113k5TGX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should prioritize the differential for an older adult with apparent "excessive imagination". The leading candidate is Charles Bonnet syndrome, defined by complex visual hallucinations with preserved insight in the context of visual impairment and otherwise normal cognition; CBS is underrecognized, often persistent for years, and frequently misattributed to psychiatric disease, so I need to ensure vision status and cognitive screening are addressed up front [^1164mfQ9] [^114axcUh]. Visual hallucinations are also common in Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementias, typically reflecting multisystem mechanisms including dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance, sleep-wake dysregulation, and visual pathway dysfunction, so I should check for parkinsonism, RBD, and cognitive changes before concluding CBS [^113bnmpL] [^115faHJa]. Finally, delirium and medication effects are common in older adults and can produce vivid perceptual disturbances, so I need to review drugs and medical precipitants carefully before labeling a primary syndrome [^114FPH1w].

> Let me consider CBS more closely because it best matches the description of vivid, unsolicited perceptual experiences that patients may describe as "seeing things that aren't there", which can be misconstrued as "excessive imagination". CBS is characterized by recurrent, vivid visual hallucinations — people, animals, scenes, or geometric patterns — with intact insight and no primary psychiatric disorder; it occurs in the setting of visual loss from conditions like macular degeneration, glaucoma, or cataract, and is common in older adults due to age-related eye disease burden [^1164mfQ9] [^114axcUh]. Prevalence estimates vary widely (roughly 11–15% or higher in some visually impaired cohorts), likely reflecting ascertainment bias, and the course is often chronic, with more than three-quarters of patients experiencing hallucinations beyond five years, so I should counsel about chronicity and self-management up front [^113cXCt1] [^1145s1xG].

> Wait, I should double-check mimics that can masquerade as CBS or "imagination" problems. In Parkinson's disease, minor hallucinations (presence, passage) and complex visual hallucinations are frequent, particularly with cognitive impairment and sleep disturbances; medication exposure (levodopa, dopamine agonists) can worsen them, and age amplifies risk, so I need to ask about parkinsonian signs, RBD, and dopaminergic regimens before concluding CBS [^113bnmpL] [^111amme1]. In dementia with Lewy bodies, visual hallucinations are a core feature and insight may wane with progression, so preserved insight favors CBS, whereas evolving delusional content and broader cognitive decline would redirect me toward Lewy body disease rather than isolated CBS [^notfound]. I should also keep in mind that pseudohallucinations, illusions, and intrusive mental imagery can be seen in psychiatric disorders and in medication-induced states, reinforcing the need for a careful medication review and cognitive/behavioral assessment in any older adult reporting "excessive imagination" [^111BUjLk].

> Next, I should review pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. CBS is best explained by deafferentation of visual pathways leading to disinhibition and hyperexcitability of visual cortex with spontaneous activity generating hallucinations; neuroimaging work in related contexts supports endogenous triggers and anticipatory activity in visual networks preceding hallucinations, which fits the clinical picture of spontaneous imagery without external stimuli [^114HtAbS]. In PD and LBD, converging mechanisms include dopaminergic-cholinergic imbalance, brainstem sleep-wake dysregulation, impaired visual processing, and attentional deficits; these mechanistic strands can overlap with CBS when visual loss coexists, so mixed etiologies are plausible in older adults with eye disease and parkinsonism or cognitive change [^113bnmpL] [^116JpfUS].

> I need to ensure I address epidemiology and risk modifiers accurately. CBS risk rises with the severity of visual impairment and is common in age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, while prevalence estimates in low-vision cohorts can approach 11–17% or more, with likely underreporting due to stigma and lack of clinician inquiry; age itself is a proxy risk via cumulative eye disease burden rather than an independent biological driver, so optimizing vision and education materially alters outcomes [^112skkZ1] [^1145s1xG]. Environmental and social factors also modulate burden: loneliness, stress, and isolation — exacerbated during events like COVID-19 lockdowns — can intensify hallucinations and reduce coping, so social connection and carer support are integral parts of management, not adjuncts [^116TikLZ] [^113MQKUi].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic differentiators to avoid premature closure. CBS requires preserved insight, absence of delusional elaboration, and no better explanation from neurodegenerative disease, delirium, or medication; atypical features such as interactive hallucinations, multimodal hallucinations, or declining insight should prompt evaluation for Lewy body disease, Alzheimer's disease, delirium, or substance/medication effects, including dopaminergic agents, anticholinergics, and other psychoactive drugs common in older adults [^114axcUh] [^114FPH1w]. But wait, what if the patient is on a dopamine agonist for RLS or PD? I should confirm pramipexole, ropinirole, or tolcapone exposure, as hallucinations are more frequent with these agents and increase with age, which could shift management toward dose reduction or switching rather than adding antipsychotics [^113gcvcS] [^113w98t4] [^111eAWth].

> I will now examine management principles because they help validate the working diagnosis in practice. For CBS, first-line care is education, reassurance, and optimization of visual function; self-help strategies like rapid eye movements, changing lighting, or focused distraction can abort episodes, and low-vision rehabilitation or cataract surgery may reduce frequency by improving input; pharmacotherapy lacks robust evidence, though case series suggest possible benefit from agents such as cholinesterase inhibitors or atypical antipsychotics in selected, distressed cases, used cautiously given risks in older adults [^114axcUh] [^1145s1xG]. For PD-related hallucinations, I should confirm whether dopaminergic therapy can be reduced, consider cholinesterase inhibitors in PDD/DLB, and reserve atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine or clozapine for significant distress, balancing falls, metabolic, and cerebrovascular risks in the elderly; importantly, quetiapine carries an FDA boxed warning for increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, so shared decision-making is essential [^113bnmpL] [^111GNrvG]. Throughout, I need to ensure a medication review for anticholinergics, opioids, and other deliriogenic drugs, and screen for medical precipitants of delirium when the presentation is acute or fluctuating [^114FPH1w].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CBS might be "transient", but I should correct that impression; large surveys show that more than 75% of patients have persistent hallucinations beyond five years, and about one-third experience negative outcomes related to fear, activity limitation, or misattribution to mental illness, underscoring the need for early education and longitudinal support rather than reassurance alone [^1145s1xG] [^113k8qCK]. I also need to remember that CBS can occur at any age with vision loss, though it is more prevalent in older adults due to the burden of age-related eye disease, so age is a risk proxy rather than a pathognomonic feature [^113cXCt1].

> Putting this together, the most likely condition corresponding to "excessive imagination" in an older adult with preserved insight and visual impairment is Charles Bonnet syndrome, characterized by vivid, complex visual hallucinations with intact reality testing in the setting of eye disease; however, I should confirm visual acuity, screen for parkinsonism and cognitive decline, review medications for dopaminergic and anticholinergic contributors, and consider delirium or psychiatric etiologies if features are atypical or insight is lost before finalizing the diagnosis [^1164mfQ9] [^114axcUh] [^112QCcFN].

---

The condition in elderly people that causes excessive imagination is **Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS)** [^1164mfQ9], characterized by vivid, complex visual hallucinations in patients with significant vision loss and preserved insight [^114axcUh]. CBS is common in older adults with age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, or cataracts, and is thought to result from sensory deprivation leading to cortical hyperexcitability [^115Ht7vb] [^113cXCt1]. Hallucinations are typically non-threatening and patients usually recognize them as unreal, distinguishing CBS from psychiatric or neurological disorders [^1164mfQ9]. Management focuses on **education, reassurance, and vision optimization** [^114axcUh]; medications are reserved for distressing cases [^116J7qGV].

---

## Clinical features of Charles Bonnet syndrome

- **Visual hallucinations**: Patients experience vivid, complex visual hallucinations, such as people, animals, objects, or scenes [^1164mfQ9]. These hallucinations are typically well-formed and detailed, occurring in the absence of external visual stimuli [^114HtAbS].

- **Preserved insight**: Patients with CBS maintain insight into the unreal nature of their hallucinations, distinguishing them from psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia or dementia-related psychosis [^1164mfQ9].

- **Absence of psychiatric or neurological disorders**: CBS occurs in individuals without underlying psychiatric or neurological conditions, although it is associated with significant vision loss [^1164mfQ9].

---

## Prevalence and risk factors

CBS is **relatively common** among elderly individuals with vision impairment, with prevalence estimates ranging from 10% to 60% depending on the population studied and the severity of visual impairment [^114axcUh] [^112skkZ1]. Risk factors include:

- **Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)**: AMD is the most common underlying visual impairment associated with CBS [^notfound].

- **Glaucoma**: Chronic glaucoma leading to significant vision loss is another common risk factor [^112skkZ1].

- **Cataracts**: Severe cataracts causing substantial visual impairment can also predispose individuals to CBS [^1145s1xG].

---

## Pathophysiology

The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CBS are not fully understood; proposed theories include **sensory deprivation**, in which vision loss leads to reduced visual input, causing the visual cortex to become hyperexcitable and generate spontaneous hallucinations [^114HtAbS] [^113cXCt1]. Cortical hyperexcitability with increased spontaneous activity in visual cortical areas may also contribute to hallucinations [^114HtAbS]. Additionally, neurotransmitter imbalances — including dopaminergic and serotonergic dysregulation — have been implicated in the development of CBS [^113MQKUi].

---

## Differential diagnosis

It is essential to differentiate CBS from other conditions that cause visual hallucinations in elderly individuals, including:

- **Dementia-related psychosis**: Visual hallucinations associated with dementia, particularly Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease dementia, are common and often accompanied by cognitive impairment and loss of insight [^115faHJa].

- **Psychiatric disorders**: Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders can cause visual hallucinations, but these are typically accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms and loss of insight [^notfound].

- **Medication-induced hallucinations**: Certain medications, particularly dopaminergic agents used in Parkinson's disease, can induce hallucinations [^114dRajb] [^113w98t4].

---

## Management strategies

Management of CBS primarily involves **education and reassurance**, as most patients experience minimal distress once they understand the benign nature of their hallucinations [^114axcUh]. Additional strategies include:

- **Vision optimization**: Improving visual acuity through corrective lenses, cataract surgery, or other interventions may reduce the frequency and severity of hallucinations [^1145s1xG].

- **Environmental modifications**: Increasing lighting, reducing sensory deprivation, and engaging in social activities may help minimize hallucinations [^112vkBSH].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: In cases where hallucinations cause significant distress, medications such as antipsychotics or antidepressants may be considered, although evidence for their efficacy is limited and they should be used cautiously due to potential side effects [^1145s1xG].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for CBS is **generally favorable**, as most patients experience minimal distress and maintain insight into the unreal nature of their hallucinations [^1164mfQ9]. However, some individuals may experience persistent or distressing hallucinations, necessitating ongoing management and support [^113k8qCK].

Charles Bonnet syndrome is a condition characterized by vivid visual hallucinations in elderly individuals with significant vision loss and preserved insight. It is relatively common among older adults with visual impairment and is managed primarily through education, reassurance, and vision optimization [^114axcUh].

Management and Treatment Approaches

Current guidelines and treatment recommendations are largely based on expert consensus. The focus is typically on the overall management of a specific clinical condition, with hallucinations one of the symptoms covered, eg, NICE Guidelines for Parkinson's disease. To date, few guidelines have focused on hallucinations specifically (eg,) and the forthcoming SHAPED (Study of Hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, Eye disease, and Dementia) consensus guidelines will be the first to focus on visual hallucinations in older adults.

All guidelines for hallucinations take the view that different treatments for hallucinations are required at different disease or hallucination stages and that experiencing hallucinations may not, in itself, require a specific treatment beyond general measures (eg, education, reassurance, physical, and medication review). For example, the SHAPED guidelines suggest including a review of cognitive and ophthalmological health, given that these may be masked by other conditions: ie, cognitive impairment may be missed in a patient with eye disease with their decline in functional ability attributed to visual loss. Early provision of information about the risk of hallucinations is emphasized as a way of reducing stigma and for healthcare professionals to routinely ask about hallucinations — to shift the onus of reporting hallucinations away from the patient. The point at which specific pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for hallucinations are required is not clearly defined in guidelines but based on clinical judgment.

Differential Diagnosis

Before commencing treatment, it must be clear that hallucinations are causing distress, ie, that there is a need for treatment. If this is the case, the second point of attention is whether it is indeed hallucinations. Especially in older adults with cognitive dysfunction, it can be difficult to disentangle hallucinations from obsessions, misperceptions/misunderstandings (ie, illusions), or involuntary mental imagery, such as the so-called "earworms" (ie, songs in the mind that continually repeat).

### Ill or just old? Towards a conceptual framework of the relation between ageing and disease [^114xZ3Hy]. BMC Geriatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Is this person ill or just old? This question reflects the pondering mind of a doctor while interpreting the complaints of an elderly person who seeks his help. Many doctors think that ageing is a non-disease. Accordingly, various attempts have been undertaken to separate pathological ageing from normal ageing. However, the existence of a normal ageing process distinct from the pathological processes causing disease later in life can be questioned.

Discussion

Ageing is the accumulation of damage to somatic cells, leading to cellular dysfunction, and culminates in organ dysfunction and an increased vulnerability to death. Analogously, chronic diseases initiate early in life and their development is slow before they become clinically apparent and culminate in disability or death. The definition of disease is also subject to current opinions and scientific understanding and usually, it is an act of individual creativity when physical changes are recognised as symptoms of a new disease. New diseases, however, are only rarely really new. Most new diseases have gone undiagnosed because their signs and symptoms escaped recognition or were interpreted otherwise. Many physical changes in the elderly that are not yet recognised as a disease are thus ascribed to normal ageing. Therefore, the distinction between normal ageing and disease late in life seems in large part arbitrary.

Summary

We think that normal ageing cannot be separated from pathological processes causing disease later in life, and we propose that the distinction is avoided.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^112QCcFN]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

General Introduction

By 2050, it is estimated that 16% of people will be aged above 65 years, compared with 9% in 2019. Population aging is driving increased attention to the physical and mental health needs of older adults. Here, our focus is on hallucinations — given the wide range of health and aged-care service providers who encounter people with these experiences in their workplace. Hallucinations can be defined as "a perception-like experience with the clarity and impact of a true perception but without the external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ"(cf.), though this belies the difficulty in discerning the boundaries between normal and abnormal perception. Hallucinations need to be distinguished from illusions, which are perceptual experiences in which an external stimulus is misperceived or misinterpreted. In practice, hallucinations vary in content (eg, perception of people, animals, or objects), character (eg, frequency, emotional valence, location), duration (from seconds to chronically present), complexity (eg, perception of simple stimuli vs organized scenes or objects), and quality (eg, perceived reality, intrusiveness) and occur in all sensory modalities. The terms used to refer to hallucinations are equally diverse (see table 1).

Table 1.
Key Terms and Definitions of Hallucinations

Hallucinations occur in people with sensory, neurological, medical, neurodegenerative, and psychological disordersas well as in those with no mental disorder at all. In healthy (nonclinical) samples, hallucination prevalence (across modalities) is lower in older than younger adults. In contrast, hallucinations are common in many clinical disorders associated with older age, with specific prevalence rates varying by condition, stage of illness, and symptom type. For example, visual hallucinations are common in dementia, Parkinson's disease, and in eye or visual pathway disease, while auditory hallucinations are prevalent with hearing loss. Similarly, multimodal visual, tactile, and auditory hallucinations tend to be more prominent in late- (between 40 and 60 years age) or very-late onset (60+ years) compared with early-onset schizophrenia. Across conditions, both similarities and differences have been reported, suggesting that the same assessments and treatments may not be appropriate for all presentations of hallucinations in older adults, which may be linked to the diversity of risk factors involved.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^117WYbtY]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

DSM-IV-TR 300.3 obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnostic criteria require either obsessions or compulsions, with obsessions involving intrusive, inappropriate thoughts, impulses, or images that are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems, attempts to ignore, suppress, or neutralize them, and recognition that they are a product of one's own mind; compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules, aimed at preventing or reducing distress or a dreaded event but not realistically connected or clearly excessive. Additional criteria are that the person has recognized the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable (note: this does not apply to children), symptoms cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with routine, functioning, or relationships, content is not restricted to another Axis I disorder, and the disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition; specify With Poor Insight when for most of the time during the current episode the person does not recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable.

### Tolcapone (Tasmar) [^111eAWth]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallucinations/Psychotic-Like Behavior:

In clinical trials, hallucinations developed in approximately 5% of patients treated with placebo, compared to 8% and 10% of patients treated with 100 mg or 200 mg three times per day, respectively. Hallucinations led to drug discontinuation and premature withdrawal from clinical trials in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, compared to 1.4% and 1.0% of patients treated with TASMAR 100 mg or 200 mg TASMAR three times per day, respectively. Hallucinations led to hospitalization in 0.0% of patients in the placebo group, compared to 1.7% and 0.0% of patients treated with 100 mg or 200 mg TASMAR three times per day, respectively.

In general, hallucinations present shortly after the initiation of therapy with tolcapone (typically within the first 2 weeks). Clinical trial data suggest that hallucinations associated with tolcapone use may be responsive to levodopa dose reduction. Patients whose hallucinations resolved had a mean levodopa dose reduction of 175 mg to 200 mg (20% to 25%) after the onset of the hallucinations. Hallucinations were commonly accompanied by confusion and to a lesser extent sleep disorder (insomnia) and excessive dreaming. The incidence of hallucination may be increased in elderly patients over 75 years treated with TASMAR (see Geriatric Use).

Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during TASMAR treatment or after starting or increasing the dose of TASMAR. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease may have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior may present with one or more symptoms, including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.

Ordinarily, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with TASMAR because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of TASMAR.

### Optimism and mental imagery: a possible cognitive marker to promote well-being? [^1175iBtD]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

We propose that a candidate cognitive marker for optimism is the ability to generate vivid mental images of positive events occurring in the future. Imagining the future may play a key role in our day-to-day functioning and has been the subject of much recent research interest (e.g.). Compared to verbal thought, mental imagery has a powerful effect on emotion, and thus mental images may be a particularly powerful form of future thinking. What evidence might support our hypothesis?found that participants reporting higher levels of optimism were more likely to expect the positive events they imagined to happen closer in the future than negative events, and were more likely to imagine them with a greater sense of "pre-experiencing". On the other hand, people with depressed mood showed reduced ability to generate vivid mental images of positive future events. Further, found that patients with major depressive disorder and those with anxiety disorders showed reduced ability to generate vivid mental images of positive future events compared to healthy controls, and also rated the events as less likely to occur in the near future.

Support for a link between imagery of the future and optimism also comes from experimental studies that have investigated the potential of imagery tasks to boost optimism.investigated the impact on optimism of practising a "Best Possible Self" (BPS) imagery exercise every day for 2 weeks. This built on work bydemonstrating that optimism was manipulable in an experimental setting, and a subsequent study bythat showed an immediate impact on optimism of engaging in a BPS imagery exercise. The BPS imagery exercise involved imagining a future self in which everything had turned out in the most optimal way. In the study by, participants were asked to repeat the imagery exercise for 5 min each day at home over a 2-week period. In a control condition participants instead carried out the imagery exercise about their daily activities in the past 24 h. Participants in the BPS imagery condition (n = 28) showed significant increases in self-reported optimism over the 2 weeks, whereas participants in the control condition (n = 26) did not show this increase. This therefore provides some evidence that engaging in positive future imagery may lead to increases in optimism in the short term, whereas engaging in past imagery does not.

### How do the blind' see'? The role of spontaneous brain activity in self-generated perception [^114HtAbS]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

It could also be argued that the slow build-up of activity observed in the hallucination condition may simply reflect a delay between hallucination onset and its report, due to the elusive nature of the hallucination. However, all CBS participants included in this condition indicated that they could report their hallucinations as promptly as they could report visual stimuli before their vision deteriorated. Moreover, if this hypothetical confound actually held, hallucinations should evoke an increase in BOLD signal, similarly to veridical vision (Fig. 1B). A consequence of this is that there should be rapid propagation of activation across the visual system leading to an 'artificial build-up' of activity across the entire visual hierarchy. However, this possibility is contradicted by our findings of a decaying activity build-up across the visual hierarchy (Figs 4 and 5). It is therefore more likely that the anticipatory signals reflect accumulation of spontaneous activity prior to hallucination onset, rather than hallucination-evoked activity which precedes the onset of report.

While our findings indicate an endogenous trigger for visual hallucinations in CBS, a recent EEG study proposed that hyperexcitability in the early visual cortex of elderly, partially blind CBS individuals, is related to external visual stimulation. Another case study of an elderly individual with CBS and mild sensorineural deafness ascribed hallucinations to external auditory stimulations of the early visual cortex. Given the difficulty in recruiting large samples of CBS participants, and given the demographic and clinical differences in the recruited samples in the three studied, we cannot exclude the possibility of a heterogeneous mechanism for hallucinations, combining both internal and external stimulation of the hyperexcitable early visual cortex. However, in our sample of participants, the observation of a slow, anticipatory build-up of activity in the visual cortex prior to hallucination onset cannot be accounted for by external stimulation. Our study clearly demonstrates that hallucinations in CBS can be evoked in the absence of external visual information.

### Hallucinations and sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease [^111amme1]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations (VHs) occur frequently in Parkinson's disease (PD). VHs occur more frequently in elderly patients with longer duration of illness, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances. The relationship between the use of antiparkinsonian drugs and VHs is complicated, but most drugs used to treat parkinsonian motor symptoms induce VHs and psychosis in some PD patients. The "continuum hypothesis" proposing that medication-induced psychiatric symptoms in PD begin with drug-induced sleep disturbances, followed by vivid dreams, with progression to hallucinatory and delusional experiences has been challenged. In some patients, VHs may represent intrusion of REM sleep-related imagery into wakefulness. Improving REM sleep abnormalities in PD (e.g., stimulants, anticholinesterase inhibitors) is one strategy now being tested to improve VHs in PD.

### What do we know about pseudodementia? [^1158HDGh]. General Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Depression and dementia can lead to generalised cognitive and memory dysfunction. Thus, differentiating these disorders is important and challenging. Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^115QFP82]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5. **Visual Problems**:

eye pain
changes in vision
swelling or redness in or around the eye

Only some people are at risk for these problems. You may want to undergo an eye examination to see if you are at risk and receive preventative treatment if you are.

6. Seizures or convulsions

7. **Manic episodes**:

greatly increased energy
severe trouble sleeping
racing thoughts
reckless behavior
unusually grand ideas
excessive happiness or irritability
talking more or faster than usual

8. Changes in appetite or weight. Children and adolescents should have height and weight monitored during treatment.

9. Low salt (sodium) levels in the blood. Elderly people may be at greater risk for this. Symptoms may include:

headache
weakness or feeling unsteady
confusion, problems concentrating or thinking or memory problems

10. Changes in the electrical activity of your heart (QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including Torsades de Pointes). This condition can be life threatening. The symptoms may include:

fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat
shortness of breath
dizziness or fainting

Do not stop fluoxetine without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping fluoxetine too quickly may cause serious symptoms including:

anxiety, irritability, high or low mood, feeling restless or changes in sleep habits
headache, sweating, nausea, dizziness
electric shock-like sensations, shaking, confusion

### Pramipexole dihydrochloride [^113gcvcS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Some people taking the medicine in pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets have had car accidents because they fell asleep while driving.

- Some patients did not feel sleepy before they fell asleep while driving. You could fall asleep without any warning.

Tell your doctor right away if you fall asleep while you are doing activities such as talking, eating, driving, or if you feel sleepier than normal for you.

- low blood pressure when you sit or stand up quickly. You may have:

- dizziness

- nausea

- fainting

- sweating

Sit and stand up slowly after you have been sitting or lying down.

- unusual urges. Some people who take certain medicines to treat Parkinson's disease or RLS, including pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, have reported problems, such as gambling, compulsive eating, compulsive buying, and increased sex drive.

### Visual hallucinations in neurological and ophthalmological disease: pathophysiology and management [^114LJQS2]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Visual hallucinations are common in older people and are especially associated with ophthalmological and neurological disorders, including dementia and Parkinson's disease. Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research programme to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high burden areas of eye disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease, culminating in a workshop to develop a unified framework for their clinical management. Here we summarise the evidence base, current practice and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop. Irrespective of clinical condition, case ascertainment strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided. Not all hallucinations require intervention but for those that are clinically significant, current evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations. Key areas for future research include the development of valid and reliable assessment tools for use in mechanistic studies and clinical trials, transdiagnostic studies of shared and distinct mechanisms and when and how to treat visual hallucinations.

### No exaggerated tremor severity perception in functional tremor [^115ZriSe]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptoms of functional neurological disorder tend to be variable, yet patients often report them being present constantly and of permanently severe intensity. Furthermore, they typically worsen when they are mentioned or during clinical examination. Such phenomena are sometimes interpreted as indicating symptom exaggeration or even fabrication.

Methods

To test the notion of inaccurate symptom perception or reporting, we directly compared subjective to objective tremulousness of reaching movements in people with a functional action tremor, people with an organic action tremor and healthy controls. Identical subjective and objective measures were used, thus eliminating any potential metacognitive confounders. Furthermore, we assessed both immediate perceptual experience with a real-time perceptual task, offering the most direct comparison; and near-time retrospective reports as the latter contribute to peoples' overall judgement of their condition.

Results

There was no significant difference in subjective compared to objective tremor severity between the three groups for either the real-time or retrospective conditions.

Conclusion

People with functional tremor do not perceive or report their tremor in an exaggerated manner, compared to people with an organic tremor or healthy controls. We propose that symptom exacerbation through attentional mechanisms provides an alternative explanation for findings that are frequently attributed to 'exaggeration'.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^112vkBSH]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Step 2: Risk Factor Management

Risk factors for hallucinations include physical health, environmental, psychological, and social factors. Any obvious triggers to the hallucinations should be identified. Comorbid physical health factors increase the risk of hallucinations, including visual and hearing impairment and physical illnesses (eg, some metabolic and endocrine disorders, and psychiatric disorders such as depression and psychotic disorders). Optimize sensory modes by using glasses, perhaps cataract operation is an option, use hearing aids. Good sleep hygiene is key, with darkness in nighttime and bright lights (preferably sunlight) at day. In terms of environment, it is key to provide well-lit rooms, without dark corners. Reduce background noise as much as possible, especially during conversations. At the social level, good company is an excellent prevention for hallucinations and may reduce their frequency and intensity.

### Anomalies of imagination and development of psychosis: a phenomenological account [^116Bp2TK]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In 20th century psychiatry, various disturbances of imagination were discussed in the context of schizophrenia. Today, these notions have almost completely vanished from mainstream psychopathology. However, recent work has suggested that specific phenomena within this area have a relevance for differential diagnosis and early detection of psychosis. This paper first provides an overview of 20th century psychopathological literature, as well as more recent neurocognitive studies, addressing disturbances of imagination and their role for symptom formation in schizophrenia. It then discusses recent empirical investigations of subjective anomalies of imagination in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and suggests a clinical-phenomenological account of their role in the development of psychotic symptoms. Empirically and conceptually, these subjective anomalies are linked with disturbances of basic self. Patients' descriptions of the development of their anomalous experiences and symptoms indicate that increased spatial (object-like) articulation and instability of the first-personal manifestation of imaginative experience can be involved in the emergence of delusions and hallucinatory phenomena. Finally, a potential link between subjective anomalies of imagination and the neurocognitive construct of source monitoring deficits is discussed.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnostic features from DSM-IV-TR describe the essential features as recurrent obsessions or compulsions that are time consuming — i.e., they take more than 1 hour a day — or cause marked distress or significant impairment, with obsessions defined as intrusive, persistent, unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that give rise to marked anxiety or distress, and compulsions — also known as rituals — carried out repetitively, excessively, and usually according to rules or in a rigid manner that the patient feels driven to perform to prevent some feared event, undo some thought, or reduce anxiety or distress.

### Testing an aetiological model of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease [^116JpfUS]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

The exact pathogenesis of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease is not known but an integrated model has been proposed that includes impaired visual input and central visual processing, impaired brainstem regulation of sleep-wake cycle with fluctuating vigilance, intrusion of rapid eye movement dream imagery into wakefulness and emergence of internally generated imagery, cognitive dysfunction and influence of dopaminergic drugs. In a clinical study, we assessed motor and non-motor function, including sleep, mood, autonomic and global, frontal and visuoperceptive cognitive function in patients with and without visual hallucinations. A subgroup of patients underwent detailed ophthalmological assessment. In a separate pathological study, histological specimens were obtained from cases of pathologically proven Parkinson's disease and a retrospective case notes review was made for reporting of persistent formed visual hallucinations. An assessment of Lewy body and Lewy neurite pathology was carried out in five cortical regions as recommended by diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy Bodies and in brainstem nuclei. Ninety-four patients (mean age 67.5 ± 9.5 years) participated in the clinical study of whom 32% experienced visual hallucinations. When corrected for multiple comparisons, patients with visual hallucinations had significantly greater disease duration, treatment duration, motor severity and complications, sleep disturbances, in particular excessive daytime somnolence and rapid eye movement sleep behavioural disorder, disorders of mood, autonomic dysfunction and global, frontal and visuoperceptive cognitive dysfunction. Of the 94 patients, 50 (53%) underwent ophthalmological assessment. There were no differences in ocular pathology between the visual hallucination and non-visual hallucination groups. In a logistic regression model the four independent determinants of visual hallucinations were rapid eye movement sleep behavioural disorder (P = 0.026), autonomic function (P = 0.004), frontal cognitive function (P = 0.020) and a test of visuoperceptive function (object decision; P = 0.031). In a separate study, post-mortem analysis was performed in 91 subjects (mean age at death 75.5 ± 8.0 years) and persistent visual hallucinations were documented in 63%. Patients in the visual hallucinations group had similar disease duration but had significantly higher Lewy body densities in the middle frontal (P = 0.002) and middle temporal gyri (P = 0.033) and transentorhinal (P = 0.005) and anterior cingulate (P = 0.020) cortices but not parietal cortex (P = 0.22). Using a comprehensive assessment of the clinical, demographic and ophthalmological correlates of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, the combined data support the hypothesized model of impaired visual processing, sleep-wake dysregulation and brainstem dysfunction, and cognitive, particularly frontal, impairment all independently contributing to the pathogenesis of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease. These clinical data are supported by the pathological study, in which higher overall cortical Lewy body counts, and in particular areas implicated in visuoperception and executive function, were associated with visual hallucinations.

### False memories in schizophrenia? An imagination inflation study [^116HBwkr]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

Data showing how schizophrenia patients tend to be more susceptible to false memories have been rather mixed and, as far as we know, no studies have investigated whether patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder are particularly prone to imagination inflation effects, that is, whether repeatedly imagining an action increases the likelihood of remembering the action as having been performed. In this study, a group of patients with psychosis and a group of normal controls were asked to perform or to imagine performing simple action statements one or four times in a single study session. In a test session that occurred 24 h later, participants were instructed to discriminate whether the action statement had been carried out, imagined or whether it was new (a source monitoring task). The primary finding was that patients were more susceptible to source-monitoring errors than controls, especially in terms of considering an imagined action as having been performed. However, both groups showed comparable levels of imagination inflation effects. Results add evidence to the hypothesis that the nature of patients' false memories may be particularly linked to poor use of source-monitoring processes.

### Visual hallucinations [^112xJeBF]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Visual hallucinations have intrigued neurologists and physicians for generations due to patients' vivid and fascinating descriptions. They are most commonly associated with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, but also occur in people with visual loss, where they are known as Charles Bonnet syndrome. More rarely, they can develop in other neurological conditions, such as thalamic or midbrain lesions, when they are known as peduncular hallucinosis. This review considers the mechanisms underlying visual hallucinations across diagnoses, including visual loss, network dysfunction across the brain and changes in neurotransmitters. We propose a framework to explain why visual hallucinations occur most commonly in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and discuss treatment approaches to visual hallucinations in these conditions.

Consensus framework for the management of VH

The general framework for managing VH and related symptoms is summarised in figure 1. It begins before the onset of hallucinations with forewarning and pre-emptive questioning to encourage their reporting. Once VH are identified, a staged approach is suggested with a review of cognitive and ophthalmological health as well as a physical health/delirium screen. Medication should be reviewed, focussing on anti-muscarinic and opiate drugs and, in PD, dopaminergic therapy. Support including reassurance, psychoeducation, normalisation (explaining VH are part of a disease and have a basis in brain function) and optimisation of visual functioning should be offered. This should be person-centred, identifying the particular triggers and settings that increase the risk of VH and avoiding these situations by planning alternative meaningful and rewarding activities.

Figure 1
The consensus framework for the management of visual hallucinations in different conditions. Recommendations not supported by meta-analysis are indicated in white. Orange boxes indicate hallucination characteristics and therapeutic targets. AD, Alzheimer's disease; CBS, Charles Bonnet syndrome; CBT, cognitive behavioural therapy; DLB, dementia with Lewy bodies; PD, Parkinson's disease; PDD, PD dementia.

VH that become clinically significant by causing distress to the patient or their carers require further intervention. Given the current limitations in both our understanding of the underlying mechanism(s) of VH susceptibility or the neurophysiological changes coincident with VH and the clinical trial evidence base, the workgroup were unable to make definitive medication recommendations. There is a theoretical basis for pharmacological interventions targeting cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems and for reducing cortical excitability through non-invasive stimulation or anticonvulsant medication. Treatment might aim to reverse long-term changes associated with VH susceptibility or to reduce the frequency or duration of transient changes coincident with VH.

### Targeting neural hyperactivity as a treatment to stem progression of late-onset Alzheimer's disease [^111aywaD]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most common form of dementia in the elderly, causes progressive and severe loss of cognitive abilities. With greater numbers of people living to advanced ages, LOAD will increasingly burden both the healthcare system and society. There are currently no available disease-modifying therapies, and the failure of several recent pathology-based strategies has highlighted the urgent need for effective therapeutic targets. With aging as the greatest risk factor for LOAD, targeting mechanisms by which aging contributes to disease could prove an effective strategy to delay progression to clinical dementia by intervention in elderly individuals in an early prodromal stage of disease. Excess neural activity in the hippocampus, a recently described phenomenon associated with age-dependent memory loss, was first identified in animal models of aging and subsequently translated to clinical conditions of aging and early-stage LOAD. Critically, elevated activity was similarly localized to specific circuits within the hippocampal formation in aged animals and humans. Here we review evidence for hippocampal hyperactivity as a significant contributor to age-dependent cognitive decline and the progressive accumulation of pathology in LOAD. We also describe studies demonstrating the efficacy of reducing hyperactivity with an initial test therapy, levetiracetam (Keppra), an atypical antiepileptic. By targeting excess neural activity, levetiracetam may improve cognition and attenuate the accumulation of pathology contributing to progression to the dementia phase of LOAD.

### Ropinirole hydrochloride [^113w98t4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hallucinations/Psychotic-Like Behavior

In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson's disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole tablets reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole tablets and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa.

The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release ropinirole tablets [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Postmarketing reports indicate that patients with Parkinson's disease or RLS may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole tablets or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole tablets. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease or RLS can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, symptoms of mania (e.g., insomnia, psychomotor agitation), disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.

Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.5 Dyskinesia

Ropinirole tablets may cause or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia in patients treated with L-dopa for Parkinson's disease. In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, dyskinesia was much more common in patients treated with ropinirole tablets than in those treated with placebo. Among those patients receiving both ropinirole tablets and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson's disease trials, 34% were reported to experience dyskinesia, compared with 13% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Decreasing the dose of dopaminergic medications may ameliorate this adverse reaction.

### Chronic challenges: picturing chronic disease by the World Health Organization [^1157GNVY]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This article has sought to address the imbalance in coverage between the representation of communicable diseases and chronic conditions. There is still much to be done in this regard, and while WHO was not the only organisation releasing such content, its significant role and reach make it an ideal starting point. We can see that as the aetiology of chronic conditions was still being explored, WHO followed a trusted method of representing them as 'enemies' that were intangible, amorphous and sometimes difficult for lay people to understand fully. They were less united by their risk factors as much as how they could be tackled, predominantly by technology. The emphasis was on chronic conditions as something to be cured or palliated rather than prevented despite growing evidence within and outside the organisation. The imagery was not challenging or controversial, but fitted into set organisational beliefs and goals. Over time, WHO's media teams developed this narrative to bring in a human angle, telling stories about lives affected by chronic disease. Yet as in the case of the shift to primary healthcare, 'community' proved challenging to define visually, and the visual vocabulary also turned to a more vociferous blaming of faulty habits.

### Exacerbation of visual hallucinations in charles bonnet syndrome due to the social implications of COVID-19 [^116TikLZ]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen countries around the world in a state of mass quarantine (ie, 'lockdown') in an attempt to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. In the UK, public health measures have recommended people stay at home, restrict visitations and shield vulnerable groups leading to the social isolation of millions. These measures disproportionately affect certain populations, for example, older adults whose primary social contact is outside of the home, and the visually impaired, many of whom rely on face-to-face or tactile interaction. Negative consequences of social isolation may be felt most by individuals living with Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS), a condition where social interaction, loneliness and anxiety play a key role in the manifestation of symptoms and individuals' ability to self-manage the disorder.

CBS refers to the presence of visual hallucinations experienced by individuals with reduced vision. Depending on the study, the reported prevalence ranges from 0.4% to 30% among those with sight loss. Any underlying ocular pathology can precipitate CBS, though literature consistently identifies age-related macular degeneration as a risk factor. The condition is typically associated with older age; however, the pathogenesis of CBS suggests patients of any age may be affected. Typical phenomenology includes transient episodes of simple (ie, shapes and patterns) or complex (ie, life-like scenes, animals and people) hallucinations. Symptoms may persist for many years, with significant detriment to quality of life. Hallucinations occur without conscious volition and may be triggered by external factors such as trauma and stress. In these circumstances, symptoms may be aggravated and more overwhelming to patients, resulting in a reduced ability to cope and maladaptive behavioural responses.

Evidence suggests visual hallucinations occur as a response to changing sensory input to specific areas of the brain. This theory is supported by studies identifying reduced visual acuity as a risk factor for CBS. Yet, not all visually impaired individuals experience hallucinations, and CBS has been described in those with preserved visual acuity. Related theories suggest sensory deprivation as a result of social isolation may be responsible for visual hallucinations. For example, several studies associate living alone with onset of visual hallucinations. Due to the theoretical background underpinning social isolation as a potential risk factor in CBS, we sought to explore how the national lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected individuals with CBS. The aim of this study was to investigate hallucinatory episodes of patients with CBS during the lockdown and identify potential triggers for symptom exacerbations and to understand the well-being implications to enable better patient support.

### Decoding individual identity from brain activity elicited in imagining common experiences [^117KoQ9P]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Beyond basic science, we contend that the current methods could contribute to clinical studies where the ability to detect individual differences is essential at various levels. This could be in helping to characterize and diagnose disorders associated with episodic memory and imagery deficits e.g. Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression, and perhaps even personalizing treatments and predicting outcomes (e.g. refs.). This study would suggest the current approach is feasible for use in healthy agers at least. How the current results extend to younger adults remains untested. We naturally expect interpersonal differences to also be discernable in younger adults' fMRI data (who are less prone to neural atrophy). However, we also anticipate there will be systematic differences associated with socioecological factors, life experience, and neurophysiology. In particular we hypothesize that younger adults' fMRI data will be characterized by the presence of relatively more episodic features, based on behavioral studies showing that older adults' verbal descriptions of pastand future-hypotheticalscenarios contain more semantic details (not specific in time and place), and fewer episodic details (specific in time and place).

In conclusion, this study has both revealed and predicted meaningful interpersonal differences in fMRI activity elicited as personal experiences were imagined. Firstly, we hope that our approach will help provide a unified modeling foundation for future studies seeking to predict interpersonal differences in the neural correlates of episodic and semantic memory as well as other related cognitive domains. Secondly, we hope that our approach will improve the predictive power of future fMRI studies by demonstrating how person-specific between-stimulus variation can be modeled and explained in terms of model features/scenarios. Finally, we hope that that this work presents a step towards future methods that enable detailed information elicited in mental imagery to be read directly from the brain.

### Complex visual hallucinations (charles bonnet syndrome) in the hemianopic visual field following occipital infarction [^113eJ8pW]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Charles Bonnet syndrome is characterised by the occurrence of complex visual hallucinations in the presence of normal cognition in elderly individuals. It commonly happens following conditions where there has been a profound loss of vision or interruption of visual input into the occipital cortex. It is important to distinguish this largely innocuous condition from psychiatric conditions that exist in the same age group. This article describes a rare variant of this condition where such hallucinations occur in the hemianopic visual field of a patient with an occipital infarct whose visual acuity is largely unimpaired. The article details the various conditions where this phenomenon has been experienced; the theories that have been postulated for its aetiology and the treatment options. The variations of this case from the commonly observed scenarios are highlighted questioning previously held convictions as well as providing an insight into the widening spectrum of the phenomenon as more cases are described. The article hopes to raise awareness of this condition, which is much commoner than perceived by healthcare practitioners, as most patients in that age group are reluctant to be forthcoming with their symptoms for fear of being diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder.

### The imaginative mind [^114Mpn56]. Human Brain Mapping (2016). Low credibility.

The astounding capacity for the human imagination to be engaged across a wide range of contexts is limitless and fundamental to our day-to-day experiences. Although processes of imagination are central to human psychological function, they rarely occupy center stage in academic discourse or empirical study within psychological and neuroscientific realms. The aim of this paper is to tackle this imbalance by drawing together the multitudinous facets of imagination within a common framework. The processes fall into one of five categories depending on whether they are characterized as involving perceptual/motor related mental imagery, intentionality or recollective processing, novel combinatorial or generative processing, exceptional phenomenology in the aesthetic response, or altered psychological states which range from commonplace to dysfunctional. These proposed categories are defined on the basis of theoretical ideas from philosophy as well as empirical evidence from neuroscience. By synthesizing the findings across these domains of imagination, this novel five-part or quinquepartite classification of the human imagination aids in systematizing, and thereby abets, our understanding of the workings and neural foundations of the human imagination. It would serve as a blueprint to direct further advances in the field of imagination while also promoting crosstalk with reference to stimulus-oriented facets of information processing. A biologically and ecologically valid psychology is one that seeks to explain fundamental aspects of human nature. Given the ubiquitous nature of the imaginative operations in our daily lives, there can be little doubt that these quintessential aspects of the mind should be central to the discussion.

### Is the perception of illusions abnormal in schizophrenia? [^112mpZ5R]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

There seems to be no common factor for visual perception, i.e., performance in visual tasks correlates only weakly with each other. Similar results were found with visual illusions. One may expect common visual factors for individuals suffering from pathologies that alter brain functioning, such as schizophrenia. For example, patients who are more severely affected by the disease, e.g., stronger positive symptoms, may show increased illusion magnitudes. Here, in the first experiment, we used a battery of seven visual illusions and a mental imagery questionnaire. Illusion magnitudes for the seven illusions did not differ significantly between the patients and controls. In addition, correlations between the different illusions and mental imagery were low. In the second experiment, we tested 59 patients (mostly outpatients) with ten visual illusions. As for the first experiment, patients and controls showed similar susceptibility to all but one visual illusion. Moreover, there were no significant correlations between different illusions, symptoms, or medication type. Thus, it seems that perception of visual illusions is mostly intact in schizophrenia.

### Exacerbation of visual hallucinations in charles bonnet syndrome due to the social implications of COVID-19 [^113MQKUi]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

People with CBS have experienced changes in visual hallucination phenomenology during the national lockdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no established cure for CBS; however, patient education and reassurance play a vital role in improving quality of life. Treatment pathways in persistent cases include patient counselling and cognitive–behavioural therapy, with a theoretical basis for pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. An important health priority for people with CBS will be to mitigate the impact of the lockdown and subsequent isolation, ensuring they remain socially connected. The challenge will be to ensure all those struggling with visual hallucinations are promptly identified through effective surveillance and signposted to appropriate social support.

Loneliness has been a significant and longstanding societal challenge, which has been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study found that loneliness was considered the most concerning aspect of the pandemic among the general population, more so than contracting the virus itself. Our results show that people who were lonelier during the lockdown were, on average, statistically significantly older than those reporting no change in loneliness (mean age 73.3 ± 17 vs 60.2 ± 19 years, respectively). This is perhaps unsurprising given the well-established association between loneliness and ageing. There was also evidence that respondents who had become more fearful and agitated by their hallucinations were, on average, statistically significantly older (mean age 73.9 ± 19 years) compared with those without changes in their emotional reaction (mean age 65.5 ± 16 years), which may partly be explained by increased loneliness. Circumstances in which poor health outcomes may be particularly acute occur when people find themselves unexpectedly alone, such as death of a spouse or partner and separation from friends and family; conditions which have become highly prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. The biological response to loneliness is also significant, for example, alterations in the immune system cellular mechanisms contribute to a weakened immune response, suggesting lonely individuals become more vulnerable to infectious diseases.

Some nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions [false beliefs] or hallucinations [seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear]) may occur months to years after beginning efavirenz tablets therapy. Promptly contact your health care provider should any of these symptoms occur.

- Skin rash is common with efavirenz but can sometimes be severe. Skin rash usually goes away without any change in treatment. If you develop a rash with any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor right away:

- skin rash, with or without itching
- peeling skin

- fever
- mouth sores

- swelling of your face
- red or inflamed eyes, like "pink eye (conjunctivitis)

- blisters or skin lesions

- Liver problems, including liver failure and death can happen in people who take efavirenz. Liver problems can happen in people without a history of liver problems. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your liver before you start efavirenz and during treatment. Tell your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms:

- your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice)
- you don't feel like eating food for several days or longer

### Negative outcome charles bonnet syndrome [^113k8qCK]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is widely considered a transient condition without adverse consequence, questioning the need for treatment. Yet, while this view may be true of the majority of people with CBS, it is recognised that some have negative experiences and outcomes. Here, we attempt to better understand negative outcome CBS and the factors that influence it.

Methods

4000 members of the Macular Society were sent a structured questionnaire covering the phenomenology of CBS, its prognosis and impact, symptom reporting, patient knowledge and sources of information.

Results

492 people with CBS were identified. Kaplan–Meier analysis suggested 75% had CBS for 5 years or more. Thirty-two per cent had negative outcome. Factors associated with negative outcome were: (1) frequent, fear-inducing, longer-lasting hallucination episodes, (2) one or more daily activities affected, (3) attribution of hallucinations to serious mental illness, (4) not knowing about CBS at the onset of symptoms. Duration of CBS or the type of content hallucinated were not associated with negative outcome.

Conclusions

CBS is of longer duration than previously suspected with clinically relevant consequences in a third of those affected. Interventions that reduce the frequency, duration or fear of individual hallucination episodes and education prior to hallucination onset may help reduce negative outcome.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^1174Axeh]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Older adults experience hallucinations in a variety of social, physical, and mental health contexts. Not everyone is open about these experiences, as hallucinations are surrounded with stigma. Hence, hallucinatory experiences in older individuals are often under-recognized. They are also commonly misunderstood by service providers, suggesting that there is significant scope for improvement in the training and practice of professionals working with this age group. The aim of the present article is to increase knowledge about hallucinations in older adults and provide a practical resource for the health and aged-care workforce. Specifically, we provide a concise narrative review and critique of (1) workforce competency and training issues, (2) assessment tools, and (3) current treatments and management guidelines. We conclude with a brief summary including suggestions for service and training providers and future research.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^115e4CKm]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) — DSM-IV-TR disease definition and symptom differentiation state that DSM-IV-TR identifies the essential features of OCD as recurrent obsessions or compulsions (Criterion A) that are severe enough to be time consuming, i.e., they take more than 1 hour a day, or cause marked distress or significant impairment (Criterion C). DSM-IV-TR describes obsessions as intrusive, persistent, unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that give rise to marked anxiety or distress, and describes compulsions as physical or mental acts that the patient feels driven to perform in order to magically prevent some feared event, undo some thought, or reduce anxiety or distress. Compulsive acts — also known as rituals — are carried out repetitively, excessively, and usually according to rules or in a rigid manner, and the psychiatrist should differentiate between obsessions and mental rituals or compulsions since the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches to these symptoms differ. Obsessions occur spontaneously or are evoked by a feared environmental stimulus or event and generate anxiety or distress, whereas mental compulsions such as counting, praying, or reviewing actions, conversations, or lists are initiated by the patient willfully, albeit sometimes reluctantly, with the aim of feeling safer or reducing anxiety or distress.

### Visual hallucinations and the charles bonnet syndrome [^117DN8Es]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

After dividing clinicians for almost 70 years, Charles Bonnet syndrome has reached an impasse. Defined by a neurologist in the 1930s, the syndrome was intended to eponymize the association of visual hallucinations with age, but evolved into one describing their association with eye disease or, more recently, an etiologically neutral phenomenologic description. Each tradition has its merits but none has defined a specific clinical entity or accounted for visual hallucinations across the spectrum of associated clinical conditions. Recent insights into the neurobiology of vision have shed new light on the problem. Viewed from a neuro-phenomenologic perspective, clinical evidence reveals two distinct hallucination syndromes: one directly related to visual system pathology, the other to pathology in the brainstem or ascending neurotransmitter pathways. The implication is of two independent but interacting pathophysiologic mechanisms and of a need to reassess the classification and management of this common psychopathologic symptom.

### Long COVID and older people [^114MyZjB]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Long COVID is a poorly understood condition, with a wide spectrum of effects on multiple body systems and variable presentation in different individuals. Long COVID is of particular concern among older people (ie, aged 65 years or older), who are at greater risk than younger people of persisting symptoms associated with COVID-19. In addition, COVID-19 might trigger or exacerbate chronic conditions that occur commonly in older people, such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, neurodegenerative conditions, and functional decline. In addition, the disruptive effects of COVID-19 for older people should not be underestimated; lockdowns and other restrictions might have reduced the social interactions of older people, and they are also likely to have lost a spouse or loved one during the pandemic, which can contribute to mental and physical decline. COVID-19 vaccination appears to reduce the effects of long COVID, and older people, especially those living in aged care facilities, should remain up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations. Health-care staff should also consider long COVID in the differential diagnosis of relevant symptoms in older people, rather than assume increasing frailty, and should pursue early multidisciplinary assessment and management of persisting symptoms. Addressing physical, psychological, and functional sequelae will mitigate the effect of long COVID and improve the health and quality of life of older people.

### How people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease perceive their illness: a qualitative study between mind and body [^1169pnvr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Future

For what concerns the future, some negative expectations about the body have been highlighted by participants:

'There is no optimism, you know it only gets worse' [ID:8]; 'These things exist and will remain. I have no illusion that I will be better in this sense' [ID:10].

Cognitive impairment is also imagined:

'I think they would go in tandem' [ID:25]; 'The body gets old, so does the mind' [ID:16].

Only a few participants see the passing of the years as a positive expedient to get better through therapies over time.

Another aspect is that of worries. The main causes of this apprehension are related to the ideas of change and unknown, to the fear of not being able to take care of the own physical condition or to the scare of not receiving adequate support.

Finally, the last category that emerged from the analysis concerns hopes and wishes. The most desired thing is positive aging: physically, a reasonable recovery; mentally, a certain degree of wisdom and acceptance, as well as good cognitive skills. Talking about relations, most of the participants hope to spend the years to come together with their loved ones, especially watching their grandchildren grow. Finally, a common wish is to come back doing some activities quitted because of the disease: taking pictures, swimming, going for walks. To sum up with the words of a woman:

'I hope to regain a life worth living' [ID:12].

Finally, the semantic analysis of the corpus resulted in two distinct word-clouds. In the following graphic outputs, words are shown as bigger when their occurrence in the text is higher. Respectively, they represent the emotional experience of participants (Fig. 3) and the ten most used keywords (Fig. 4).

### People, systems and safety: resilience and excellence in healthcare practice [^112nAsWs]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

This article outlines recent developments in safety science. It describes the progression of three 'ages' of safety, namely the 'age of technology', the 'age of human factors' and the 'age of safety management'. Safety science outside healthcare is moving from an approach focused on the analysis and management of error ('Safety‐1') to one which also aims to understand the inherent properties of safety systems that usually prevent accidents from occurring ('Safety‐2'). A key factor in the understanding of safety within organisations relates to the distinction between 'work as imagined' and 'work as done'. 'Work as imagined' assumes that if the correct standard procedures are followed, safety will follow as a matter of course. However, staff at the 'sharp end' of organisations know that to create safety in their work, variability is not only desirable but essential. This positive adaptability within systems that allows good outcomes in the presence of both favourable and adverse conditions is termed resilience. We argue that clinical and organisational work can be made safer, not only by addressing negative outcomes, but also by fostering excellence and promoting resilience. We outline conceptual and investigative approaches for achieving this that include 'appreciative inquiry', 'positive deviance' and excellence reporting.

### The patient with excessive worry [^117Jm44j]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Worry is a normal response to uncertainty. Education, empathetic support, reassurance, and passage of time usually ameliorate ordinary worries. However, these common-sense strategies for dealing with transient worries often prove ineffective for patients with excessive worry, many of whom meet the criteria for disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. Evidence-based treatments for such disorders can assist family physicians in management of persistent worry as a self-perpetuating habit across diagnostic categories. Antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy are effective treatments for various disorders characterized by excessive worry. Cognitive behavioral strategies that may be adapted to primary care contacts include education about the worry process, repeated challenge of cognitive distortions and beliefs that underpin worry, behavioral exposure assignments (e.g., scheduled worry periods, worry journals), and learning mindfulness meditation.

### Visual hallucinations and sight loss in children and young adults: a retrospective case series of charles bonnet syndrome [^113cXCt1]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterised by the subjective experience of visual hallucinations secondary to sight loss. Hallucinations are often associated with sudden or progressive loss of vision, with no psychiatric or cognitive basis. Studies of cortical function suggest that changes in the visual cortex may have a role in the onset of visual hallucinations. A common theory for the genesis of CBS relates to 'deafferentation', whereby reduced visual input due to systemic or retinal dysfunction results in spontaneous hyperexcitability and disinhibition of the visual cortex, producing hallucinatory experiences. However, the precise pathophysiology of CBS remains poorly understood. Visual hallucinations in CBS are diverse and may manifest in a number of ways, including scenes of landscapes or moving patterns, small figures, distorted faces and delayed palinopsia. Symptoms of CBS may persist for several yearsand can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life.

The prevalence of CBS is estimated to be in the range of 11–15% of adults with visual impairmentand is typically associated with elderly patients, likely because age is a risk factor for a number of sight-threatening eye diseases including age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Yet, the causal theories suggest that CBS can affect individuals with visual loss at any age, inclusive of children. Indeed, a small number of case reports have described young patients experiencing CBS. This may reflect the lack of awareness among healthcare professionals or a difficulty in diagnosis, for example, CBS may be investigated as schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, migraines, seizures or tumours. Moreover, diagnosis of CBS can be confused with childhood imaginings, and children may have difficulties describing symptoms. Consequently, ascertainment of CBS in paediatric patients remains low and seldom discussed in the context of a routine clinical eye consultation. The purpose of this report is to expand on the associated clinical background and evidence of CBS in paediatric and young persons through a retrospective case series identified at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

### Visual symptoms in Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia [^117JAJKx]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Visual symptoms are common in PD and PD dementia and include difficulty reading, double vision, illusions, feelings of presence and passage, and complex visual hallucinations. Despite the established prognostic implications of complex visual hallucinations, the interaction between cognitive decline, visual impairment, and other visual symptoms remains poorly understood. Our aim was to characterize the spectrum of visual symptomatology in PD and examine clinical predictors for their occurrence. Sixty-four subjects with PD, 26 with PD dementia, and 32 age-matched controls were assessed for visual symptoms, cognitive impairment, and ocular pathology. Complex visual hallucinations were common in PD (17%) and PD dementia (89%). Dementia subjects reported illusions (65%) and presence (62%) more frequently than PD or control subjects, but the frequency of passage hallucinations in PD and PD dementia groups was equivalent (48% versus 69%, respectively; P = 0.102). Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity was impaired in parkinsonian subjects, with disease severity and age emerging as the key predictors. Regression analysis identified a variety of factors independently predictive of complex visual hallucinations (e.g., dementia, visual acuity, and depression), illusions (e.g., excessive daytime somnolence and disease severity), and presence (e.g., rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and excessive daytime somnolence). Our results demonstrate that different "hallucinatory" experiences in PD do not necessarily share common disease predictors and may, therefore, be driven by different pathophysiological mechanisms. If confirmed, such a finding will have important implications for future studies of visual symptoms and cognitive decline in PD and PD dementia.

### Looking while imagining: the influence of visual input on representational neglect [^113fnd1v]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Subjects with hemispatial neglect often exhibit representational neglect: a failure to report details from the left side of mentally visualized images. This failure could reflect impaired ability to generate the left side of the mental image, or it could reflect failure to explore the left side of a normally generated mental image. When subjects with hemispatial neglect look at pictures or drawings, their attention tends to be drawn to objects on the right side, thereby aggravating their failure to explore the left side. If representational neglect represents a failure to explore the left side of a normally generated mental visual image, then it should be improved by blindfolding, which removes the attention-catching right-sided stimuli. However, if representational neglect represents a failure to generate the left side of the mental visual image, then blindfolding should have little impact on reporting of details of the image.

Methods

To determine which of these explanations is correct, we asked eight normal participants and eight brain-damaged patients with left representational neglect to imagine the map of France and to name as many towns as possible in 2 minutes. In different sessions, participants performed the task with eyes open or while blindfolded.

Results

Normal participants mentioned more towns while blindfolded than with vision, thus suggesting a distracting effect of visual details on mental imagery. Patients with neglect, however, showed no appreciable effect of blindfolding on reporting of details from either side of mental images.

Conclusion

Representational neglect may represent a failure to generate the left side of mental images.

### Dementia: what pharmacists need to know [^117FbAK5]. Canadian Pharmacists Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dementia:

- **Definition**: Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive cognitive decline that interferes with the ability to function independently.
- **Pathophysiology**: Dementia is mostly caused by Alzheimer's disease (60–80%), vascular injury (stroke; 20%), Lewy bodies (5–15%), and frontotemporal impairment (Pick's disease).
- **Disease course**: Alzheimer's disease, vascular injury, Lewy body deposition, and frontotemporal lobe impairment result in dementia, which causes clinical manifestations of gradual, persistent, and progressive decline in cognition and function. Cognitive deficits may present as memory loss, communication and language impairments, agnosia, apraxia, and impaired executive function (reasoning, judgment, and planning). Dementia progression may lead to behavioral and psychological symptoms including wandering, hoarding, sexual disinhibition, eating inappropriate objects, repetitive behaviors, restlessness, agitation, apathy, aggression, psychosis, hallucinations, and delusions causing considerable distress and safety risk for the patient and their caregivers.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Annual mortality associated with dementia in men and women is 38.3% and 30.5%, respectively.

### Distinguishing neuroimaging features in patients presenting with visual hallucinations [^113WJZ9f]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations are relatively uncommon presentations in medical and psychiatric clinics, where they are generally regarded as a marker of possible underlying "organic" brain disease. Thus, patients with visual hallucinations are often referred for imaging of the brain. This article presents a pragmatic approach for the radiologist reviewing such imaging. Because conditions that can present with visual hallucinations are legion, a familiarity with the features of the hallucinations themselves, which can serve as clues to the underlying cause, can be helpful in interpreting such cases. We consider the nature of visual hallucinations and the mechanisms underlying their formation. We then provide a framework to guide the search for their cause, first in terms of focal lesions along the visual pathway and then global conditions affecting > 1 region.

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^114axcUh]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

CBS hallucinations in visually impaired patients — Education, management options, and evaluation are highlighted as follows: Experiencing CBS hallucinations can cause anxiety or fear, and patients who have CBS and their family/caregivers should be educated and reassured that this phantom vision is common in visually impaired people; discussion often leads to significant relief and decreased anxiety. Hallucinations can occur in patients who have reduced visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, or visual field loss and can occur in patients with monocular vision loss. The reported prevalence of CBS among patients with a range of ophthalmologic disorders varies widely from 15% to 60%, depending on the definition and population studied. Limited evidence from a case series suggests that techniques such as eye movements, changing lighting, or distraction may reduce hallucinations in some patients, and these self-management methods can be recommended for such patients. A recent trial of 16 subjects with CBS reported reduced frequency of hallucinations in subjects receiving inhibitory transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), and both the tDCS and the control group reported reduced impact of hallucinations, suggesting that education and support for patients with CBS is therapeutic. Although a range of pharmacological treatments is reported in case reports, there is currently no significant evidence of efficacy. Atypical features that should raise suspicion of a diagnosis other than CBS include lack of insight into the unreal nature of the images, images that interact with the patient, or other associated neurological signs or symptoms; other entities including Parkinson's disease, dementias (including dementia with Lewy Bodies and Alzheimer's disease), psychiatric disease, or medication side effects can also cause hallucinations, and patients with atypical features require a medical or neuropsychiatric evaluation for accurate diagnosis.

### Is there truth in fiction? Lessons from readers' responses to dementia fiction [^114YstmM]. Medical Humanities (2025). Medium credibility.

This paper addresses the question 'is there truth in fiction?', by synthesising a range of disciplinary approaches to the issue, as well as drawing on empirical research carried out with readers of fiction about dementia (hereafter, dementia fiction). We argue that fiction-perhaps because of its fictional status and apparatus-invites readers to consider its truth value, to explore the possibilities of human experience and interrogate issues relative to their subjective experience, community or society. The findings have significant implications for the Medical Humanities' use of fictional texts to explore lived medical conditions and experiences, as well as claims made about the potential for fiction to affect real-world understandings, awareness and empathy around the conditions depicted. We show that the techniques used in fictional language may be artifice, but they simulate a truth that corresponds with reality.

### Degraded EEG decoding of wrist movements in absence of kinaesthetic feedback [^112DEbjf]. Human Brain Mapping (2015). Low credibility.

Here, we addressed this question by decoding from EEG activity attempted movements impaired by nerve block and imagined movements that lack movement reafference. Both conditions are relevant to our goal, but have their limitations. Ischemic nerve block provides a well‐established reversible model of short‐term amputation‐induced cortical reorganization in humans [Brasil‐Neto et al. 1993; Reilly et al. 2006] and provides a valid model for the loss of feedback from large diameter sensory fibers. However, the rapid onset of feedback loss, including the tonic level of drive seen in the steady state, could produce acute changes in cortical function not directly related to loss of movement‐related feedback. In addition, even over these short timescales, some cortical plasticity may occur; it was notable that the pattern of activation during maximum decoding was more bilateral in MoveAfter compared with Move. Such rapid and reversible cortical reorganization probably relies on the modulation of existent intracortical connections by afferent input [Ridding and Rothwell, 1999], potentially through a decrease of GABA‐mediated inhibition [Chen et al. 1998].

Conversely, imagined movements lack movement reafference, but preserve tonic feedback about the (unchanging) limb state. In imagined movements, central mechanisms presumably are also acting to prevent overt motor outflow [Guillot et al. 2012]. Importantly, imagined movements have been used to calibrate decoders for people with tetraplegia [Hochberg et al. 2006, 2012]. Using both of these noninvasive techniques in healthy subjects we were able to compare, for the first time, decoding of unimpaired, impaired and imagined movements. This overcomes some of the limitations presented by experiments with paralyzed patients and nonhuman primates: paralyzed patients are unable to perform goal‐directed movements (an essential condition to which all others should ideally be compared); by contrast, it is virtually impossible to control for nontask related movements and to assess the quality of motor imagery in nonhuman primates.

### Decoding individual identity from brain activity elicited in imagining common experiences [^111wSeZJ]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Almost everyone can imagine themselves at a wedding, however each person does so differently because they have been to different weddings and hence draw upon memories that no one else has. Our personal history of episodic memories contributes to defining us as individuals and in extreme cases — where memories are of traumatic events — can profoundly affect our psychological health and quality of life. A principal goal of cognitive science is to understand how such memories are represented and manipulated in the human brain. Memories of past experiences can be activated and relived through recollection and are thought to be pieced together to support the mental simulation of hypothetical scenarios –. Functional brain imaging now enables the systematic study of brain activation elicited during recall and imagination. A long-term vision for the future might therefore be to devise technology that provides a comprehensive neural readout of the information that one voluntarily activates in mental imagery. More humble prerequisites for this are to establish that neural activity elicited during imagery captures meaningful differences between different individuals' mental simulations of similar kinds of events, and to devise quantitative methods that can predict the information represented in neural activation.

In previous work, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies of brain activity have identified a core distributed network of neuroanatomical regions that are reliably activated during the recollection and/or imagination of different experiences and scenarios –. Regions that are activated in episodic recollection and simulation strongly overlap, which suggests that similar neural machinery is engaged in both cases,– (although activation patterns elicited in remembering, and imaging possible past and future events are still distinguishable). This core episodic recollection and simulation network includes regions of medial parietal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and medial and lateral temporal lobe –. Researchers seeking to decipher what information is represented in brain activity within regions of this network have shown that different types of event can be distinguished from multiple network regions –, as well different components of individual events – (e.g. people, places, objects, space/time of occurrence). However, it has remained unclear whether differences in activation patterns between individuals imagining similar types of event represent anything more than functionally-irrelevant between-subject noise.

### Charles bonnet syndrome: three cases in the emergency department [^116EM6yo]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a cause of visual hallucinations in elderly patients that is often unrecognized by emergency physicians and has a relatively benign course. As the population ages, it is likely that the number of cases of CBS will increase (and thus, the numbers of those who present to an Emergency Department [ED] will be increasing).

Objectives

The case reports presented in this article will facilitate the recognition of CBS by the emergency physician.

Case Report

We describe 3 patients who presented to one ED for visual disturbances and were diagnosed with CBS in a 4-month time period.

Conclusion

Recognition of this unusual but stereotypical cause of visual disturbances facilitates an accurate diagnosis, and spares patients the time and expense of blood testing, imaging, and consultations. If emergency physicians begin to recognize this benign entity, we can provide improved (and safer) patient care with appropriate ED interventions.

### Delirium in a 74-year-old man: correct imaging revealed the truth [^114FPH1w]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Delirium is a cognitive disorder. DSM-IV criteria for delirium must include both acute onset and fluctuating symptoms; disturbance of consciousness (including inattention); at least one of the following: disorganised thinking, disorientation, memory impairment or perceptual disturbance; and evidence of a putative causal medical condition. Traditionally, the course has been described as transient in which recovery is likely to be complete if the underlying aetiological factor is promptly corrected or is self-limited. The most common precipitating causes in elderly include sepsis, dehydration and drugs. Work-up for delirium is limited to septic screening, baseline investigations and imaging. Patients with delirium without focal signs and with either evidence for a medical aetiology of delirium or pre-diagnosed dementia are at a very low risk of having focal lesions in their contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. We are presenting an interesting case of delirium with urosepsis whose imaging revealed milliary brain tuberculomas on contrast-enhanced MRI.

### Hallucinations in parkinson disease [^113bnmpL]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) can experience hallucinations (spontaneous aberrant perceptions) and illusions (misinterpretations of real perceptual stimuli). Of such phenomena, visual hallucinations (VHs) and illusions are the most frequently encountered, although auditory, olfactory and tactile hallucinations can also occur. In cross-sectional studies, VHs occur in approximately one-third of patients, but up to three-quarters of patients might develop VHs during a 20-year period. Hallucinations can have substantial psychosocial effects and, historically, were the main reason for placing patients in nursing homes. Concomitant or overlapping mechanisms are probably active during VHs, and these include the following: central dopaminergic overactivity and an imbalance with cholinergic neurotransmission; dysfunction of the visual pathways, including specific PD-associated retinopathy and functional alterations of the extrastriate visual pathways; alterations of brainstem sleep-wake and dream regulation; and impaired attentional focus. Possible treatments include patient-initiated coping strategies, a reduction of antiparkinson medications, atypical neuroleptics and, potentially, cholinesterase inhibitors. Evidence-based studies, however, only support the use of one atypical neuroleptic, clozapine, and only in patients without dementia. Better phenomenological discrimination, combined with neuroimaging tools, should refine therapeutic options and improve prognosis. The aim of this Review is to present epidemiological, phenomenological, pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects of hallucinations in PD.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^114PoTp7]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Practitioner-Centered Factors

Low levels of knowledge about aging and hallucinations remain an ongoing issue amongst many professionals. For example, some ophthalmologists and general practitioners remain unfamiliar with visual hallucinations arising from eye disease (ie, Charles Bonnet syndrome) — and consequently rarely discuss the possibility of hallucinatory experiences in patients with visual loss. Similarly, auditory hallucinations are common in people with hearing impairment, which suggests that clinicians should enquire about hallucinations in hearing-impaired patients and assess hearing ability in older people with recent-onset auditory hallucinations.

Biased thinking about hallucinations can also occur, despite the good intentions of staff to help their clients/patients. For example, fear that people with hallucinations might be dangerous may lead to less willingness to discuss voice-hearing experiences with patients. In general, negative stereotypes have been shown to be associated with less focus on the patient (than the disease), lower endorsement of recovery as an outcome of care, and fewer referrals for specialist treatment(see also reference). Consequently, a growing number of programs are being trialed that promote stigma reduction and supportive, nonjudgmental attitudes toward hallucinations in healthcare professionals and students(see table 2).

Table 2.
Recommendations for Training and Practice

Finally, it is important for clinicians to think about the needs of the caregivers as well as the patient. For example, informal caregivers can find managing visual hallucinations in Parkinson's challenging, which can have a negative impact on their quality of life. Consequently, the focus of "treatment" sometimes must shift from the person experiencing hallucinations to providing psychoeducation (eg, about causes of hallucinations) and support (eg, coping methods) for the person who cares for them.

### Charles bonnet syndrome: two case reports and review of the literature [^1166h5J2]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations (VHs) can be associated with a variety of clinical conditions, and are also experienced by healthy people due to visual impairment. The condition is known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS). The circumstances favoring VHs support the hypothesis that sensory deprivation enhances the ongoing activity of the visual system after sensory loss. Clinician should be aware that a significant proportion of visually impaired patients experience complex VHs, which are sometimes distressing. Herein, we report two cases of CBS. Case 1 is a 60-year-old man with visual impairment due to orbit pseudotumor in autoimmune hypothyroidism. Case 2 is an 87-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease and a 15-year history of intermittent complex VHs due to age-related macular degeneration in both eyes. In both cases investigations for alternative pathological causes of VHs were negative and, therefore, the aetiology of hallucinations was attributed to CBS. The course and treatment of CBS patients vary according to the nature of the visual dysfunction. Drug treatments remain partially satisfactory, with individual cases successfully treated with atypical antipsychotics. Nonpharmacological interventions aimed to reduce the visual pathway deprivation. Reassurance of the benign nature of CBS is essential to support patients and reduce caregiver's burden.

### Prevalence and correlates of dizziness in community-dwelling older people: a cross sectional population based study [^1171vqDY]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study can be considered one of the first ones to investigate dizziness in a representative sample of elderly adults living in the community in a developing country. We observed a higher prevalence of dizziness when compared with other population-based studies. It is suspected that this prevalence difference is due to the heterogeneity on the scope of the questions used to identify participants with dizziness in population-based studies. Elderly adults with depressive symptoms, perceived fatigue, excessive sleepiness and recurring falls were more likely to report dizziness in the past year. Among the outcomes in the final model, the presence of five or more depressive symptoms was the main contributor for reporting dizziness, followed by falls and fatigue. Our findings suggest that dizziness in community-dwelling elderly adults might be considered a complex geriatric condition, rather than a geriatric syndrome which co-occurs and interacts with other common conditions in elderly adults, exposing them to adverse health events, such as recurring falls.

### The economic and social burden of depression [^1176X1kE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Depressive disorders are a major public health problem. They occur frequently and produce severe suffering for those affected and for their families. They are ubiquitous and appear at all ages. The consequences of depressive disorders in terms of excessive mortality, disability, and secondary morbidity are grave. There are indications that the frequency of depressive disorders will increase in the years to come, for a variety of reasons, including demographic changes, extended life expectancy of people suffering from chronic physical disorders, and iatrogenic causes. The essential criterion for designating a condition as a major public health problem — that there should be an effective intervention that will diminish or eliminate the problem-has now also been met. Recent years have seen the development of a variety of new treatments that can be applied even in situations where highly specialized mental health staff are scarce. These developments make training in the use of new treatment methods of proven value and their wide application a public health priority and an ethical obligation.

### Vision loss and hallucinations: perspectives from neurology and ophthalmology [^116nW596]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to summarize the evidence for visual impairment as a risk factor for visual hallucinations in neurologic disease and recent advances in our understanding of the central visual pathways that mediate this association.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have described the prevalence Charles Bonnet syndrome and questioned its lack of association with cognitive impairment, used advanced neuroimaging to show that disinhibition of the occipital lobe is involved in the pathogenesis of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, and demonstrated that visual impairment because of eye disease is a consistent risk factor for visual hallucinations across a number of different neurodegenerative disease populations.

Summary

Through connections between the primary visual cortex and other brain structures, visual function is closely tied to visual hallucinations. Given that the vast majority of vision loss is caused by ophthalmic disease, much of which is preventable or treatable, the detection and treatment of vision loss in at-risk populations may reduce the burden and consequences of visual hallucinations in older adults.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^115faHJa]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

APA practice guideline — Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia are defined by whether Parkinson's disease precedes cognitive impairment by more than 1 year (Parkinson's disease dementia) or whether cognitive impairment is the dominant symptom (dementia with Lewy bodies), and whether these entities are one condition or distinct ones remains unresolved. Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neurological condition characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability with onset typically in middle to late life. In one large longitudinal study, dementia developed in nearly 80% of patients followed for 8 years. The dementia associated with Parkinson's disease has an insidious onset and slow progression with cognitive and motor slowing, executive dysfunction, and impairments in memory retrieval and flexibility; Parkinson's disease is important to psychiatrists because of the high prevalence of associated depression and the frequent occurrence of psychotic symptoms such as visual hallucinations during pharmacological treatment of the primary motor deficit.

### Filling in the blind spot: integrating charles bonnet syndrome screening in ophthalmology [^112skkZ1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is an ophthalmic condition characterized by complex visual hallucinations in patients with significant visual impairments, but otherwise preserved cognitive function and insight. It was initially recognized by the Swiss naturalist Charles Bonnet, who was attempting to describe the condition in his grandfather Charles Lullin. Today, CBS remains a fascinating yet underrecognized phenomenon in clinical practice. Patients often report vivid hallucinations of people, animals, or geometric patterns. Interestingly, patients with CBS retain complete insight about the hallucinations, which makes this syndrome distinct from other neurologic or psychiatric conditions that may cause visual hallucinations.

With an increasingly aging population, the incidence of conditions that may lead to CBS is expected to increase. Some of these include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma. Therefore, there is a growing patient population that may be at risk of developing CBS in the future. Some studies have reported the prevalence of CBS to be from 11.8% to as high as 17.7% among patients with retinal diseases, low vision, and glaucoma, and it can be as high as 24.6% among visual rehabilitation patients. Additionally, the true prevalence of the disorder is likely underestimated due to underreporting. Many patients are reluctant to admit to having symptoms of the disorder due to fear of psychiatric labeling, and clinicians may fail to recognize the etiology of these symptoms during routine care. As a result, CBS is frequently misdiagnosed or missed entirely, preventing patients from receiving education and resources that could substantially improve quality of life.

### Shadowing behavior may Be associated with an inability to recognize the external world: a case report of shadowing in a patient with posterior cortical atrophy [^114jsxef]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Follow-up brain images. (a) Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging of the head of the patient at 66 years of age shows progressive atrophy of the right lateral temporal and parietal lobes as well as the left parietal lobe. (b) 123 I-labeled N-isopropyl-p-iodo-amphetamine (123 I-IMP) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of the head of the same individual at 65 years of age and subsequent three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) analysis show that the relative hypoperfusion of both parietal lobes has progressed.

This case involved posterior cortical atrophy, which is a rare form of degenerative disease with visuospatial dysfunction. However, because shadowing is a relatively common symptom in dementia, it may occur not only in cases of posterior cortical atrophy but also in some cases of dementia, particularly typical Alzheimer's disease. Compared to the behavioral symptoms observed in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, which are associated with frontal and anterior temporal atrophy, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a broader range of cognitive dysfunctions, including deficits in episodic memory, visuospatial abilities, visual perception, and receptive language skills. The cognitive impairments observed in Alzheimer's disease are associated with atrophy in posterior brain regions, such as the medial temporal, parietal, parieto-temporal, and temporo-occipital regions, which play a role in recognizing stimuli from the external world and contribute to visuospatial and visual perception, as well as verbal comprehension. Consistent with this perspective, the present case experienced severe visuospatial deficits, visual perception dysfunction (several types of agnosia), disorientation, and difficulties in verbal comprehension, collectively resulting in challenges in perceiving the external stimuli. These difficulties significantly impede the patient's ability to recognize external world as a whole. In such circumstances, patients often become reliant on others, leading to a fear of being left alone in some cases. This fear may contribute to the development of shadowing behavior, which is considered an adaptive response to mitigate excessive anxiety in these individuals. This perspective aligns with the previous understanding that shadowing behavior can arise from both cognitive and psychological factors. Moreover, in the present case, we provide more detailed and specific information about dysfunctions that may be associated with this shadowing behavior. It is important to note that these dysfunctions are not limited to a single domain, but rather encompass several aspects of recognition functions.

### Imag (in) ing multiple sclerosis: time to take better pictures [^115PadNV]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2017). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to the identification of widespread brain abnormalities in multiple sclerosis (MS) that extend far beyond the classic white matter lesion. These findings have generated the idea that MS should be understood as a disease of the whole brain, not just the white matter. While it is no doubt the case that many different pathways are ultimately involved in the destruction of brain tissue that occurs in MS, the implications of the accumulated evidence for understanding disease pathophysiology - and hence the overall significance of these imaging findings - are doubtful. Here, I argue that the principled use of imaging can, in fact, address questions about the genesis of these whole-brain abnormalities, rather than simply describe them.

### From research to action: recommendations for charles bonnet syndrome care and policy [^114NXLt6]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Outcome measures used in research

The growing body of research into CBS necessitates careful consideration regarding outcome measures. Outcome measures refer to specific metrics or criteria used to assess the effectiveness of interventions, the severity of symptoms or patient quality of life. While uniform adoption of measures is seldom possible, unity would facilitate comparability between studies and ensure that interventions and therapeutics are evaluated in a standardised way. Generally, CBS is operationalised using specific phenomenological aspects of the condition, such as duration, frequency and intensity of hallucinations. Alongside these phenomenological features, it is important to consider individual differences in appraisal and emotional response. For example, a patient can experience visually disturbing content, but may not necessarily feel concerned by the hallucination. They might appraise these experiences as harmless despite the unsettling nature of the images. Conversely, some individuals may experience relatively mundane or trivial hallucinations (eg, simple patterns or everyday objects), but their personal interpretation might provoke feelings of fear, anxiety or concern. By broadening the focus of outcome measures to include individual differences in appraisal and emotional response, researchers can gain a more holistic understanding of the condition. One approach is to assess perceived threat to physical or psychological well-being and measure whether safety-seeking behaviours are adopted, such as distraction from or interaction with the hallucination. This approach acknowledges that the same hallucination can have varying psychological impacts on different patients, depending on how they interpret and respond to their experiences.

Conclusions

The first CBS scientific symposium served as a cornerstone event for reviewing research and policy in the UK, emphasising both the progress made and the gaps which remain. Among the key issues identified were the need for standardised outcome measures across studies, consistent and appropriate terminology, as well as the importance of exploring individual variations in the experience and appraisal of the condition. Future priorities focused on developing an interdisciplinary and harmonised approach to patient management, integrating ophthalmology, psychiatry, general practice and community services, ensuring that both the visual and emotional impact of CBS are addressed. Continued collaboration between researchers, clinicians and patient groups will be essential in advancing these efforts and shaping the future directions of research and clinical care in people with CBS.

### Visual hallucinations and sight loss in children and young adults: a retrospective case series of charles bonnet syndrome [^111sSwc5]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We report the largest case series of 13 paediatric and young persons affected with CBS visiting a single centre between 2011 and 2020. The majority of patients were suffering with progressive severe sight impairment, mostly due to non-syndromic IRDs, which collectively are the most common cause of blind registrations in the working-age population in England and Wales. The most frequent underlying condition was STGD (OMIM #248 200), a macular dystrophy which is typically associated with loss of central vision within the first two decades of life. There is currently no approved treatment for STGD, although several trials are underway that hold promise of halting disease progression, but patients will still have residual sight loss depending on the stage of the disease when intervention becomes available. Similarly, no treatments exist for the other conditions observed in this review; therefore, patients' vision will either remain stable or continue to deteriorate. It remains unclear if the small numbers of cases identified in this review are reflective of a lower prevalence of CBS in younger people compared to the elderly, or if these numbers are due to factors such as substantial under-reporting and difficult case ascertainment. We do not yet understand why certain individuals are affected with CBS, or in whom they will resolve with time or persist longterm.

The cohort of paediatric and adolescent patients susceptible to CBS is likely considerable in size. Yet, the extent to which CBS is age-dependent is open to debate. In previous research, older age has emerged as a risk factor for visual hallucinations, while other studies have identified younger patients more likely to report CBS. Explanations for these differences may relate to the interaction between age and deafferentation, or older patients' decreased capability to recollect, or willingness to disclose hallucinations. Although our sample is too small to interrogate with statistical analysis, the results provide convincing evidence of the need for paediatric ophthalmologists, specialists in ocular genetics and clinical geneticists involved in the care pathways of patients with genetic eye disease or poor vision during childhood, to provide information on CBS at the point of contact. The visual hallucinations may not necessarily manifest in the initial stages of the disease but could trigger during the active sight loss phase. Hence, providing patients and families with information on CBS and hallucinatory experiences, including strategies for symptom management and sources of emotional support, may reduce the psychological impact if they do develop symptoms.

### Association of the number of minor hallucinations and well-structured visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease [^116fLHeM]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, the burden of which has been increasing globally. It is estimated that by 2050, 25.2 million people worldwide will suffer from PD, placing a heavy economic burden on healthcare systems. Non-motor symptoms of PD are a significant component of the disease burden, with their impact often surpassing that of motor symptoms. Hallucinations are among the most common non-motor symptoms in PD and have received increasing attention in recent years. A longitudinal study found that after 20 years of follow-up, up to three-quarters of PD patients developed well-structured visual hallucinations (VH). VH not only seriously affect the quality of life of patients but are also associated with a worse disease prognosis, increased healthcare costs, and greater social burdens. Therefore, early identification and intervention for VH are crucial for improving the management of these patients.

Minor hallucinations (MH) generally occur early in PD, often pre-dating motor symptoms, and are specifically categorized into three types: presence hallucinations (i.e. the sensation of someone nearby in the absence of an actual stimulus), passage hallucinations (i.e. the brief perception of a shadow rapidly passing through the peripheral vision without a real stimulus), and visual illusions (i.e. transient and momentary misperceptions of objects or living beings that are inconsistent with objective reality). Due to their transient, occasional nature and preserved insight, MH usually do not cause distress to patients and are often overlooked or underrecognized. In contrast, VH involve more realistic and vivid visual experiences, typically consisting of well-formed images of people, animals, objects, or scenes. These hallucinations are characterized by greater frequency, longer duration, and increased severity, and are closely associated with higher care burden, dementia incidence, and mortality.

### Pramipexole dihydrochloride [^114dRajb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors

Case reports and the results of a cross-sectional study suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, binge eating, and/or other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets for Parkinson's disease or RLS. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets.

5.4 Hallucinations and Psychotic-like Behavior

In the three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving placebo. In the four double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in advanced Parkinson's disease, where patients received pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets and concomitant levodopa, hallucinations were observed in 16.5% (43 of 260) of patients receiving pramipexole dihydrochloride tablets compared with 3.8% (10 of 264) of patients receiving placebo. Hallucinations were of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation of treatment in 3.1% of the early Parkinson's disease patients and 2.7% of the advanced Parkinson's disease patients compared with about 0.4% of placebo patients in both populations.

Age appears to increase the risk of hallucinations attributable to pramipexole. In the early Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 1.9 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 6.8 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years. In the advanced Parkinson's disease patients, the risk of hallucinations was 3.5 times greater than placebo in patients younger than 65 years and 5.2 times greater than placebo in patients older than 65 years.

### Atropine and pralidoxime chloride (duoDote) [^1147Lw5A]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

6.4 Inadvertent Injection

In cases where DuoDote is inadvertently administered to people who are not poisoned with nerve agent or organophosphorus insecticide, the following effects on their ability to function normally may occur.

Atropine 2 mg IM, roughly the equivalent of one DuoDote autoinjector, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with minimal effects on visual, motor, and mental functions, though unsteadiness walking and difficulty concentrating may occur. Atropine reduces body sweating and increases body temperature, particularly with exercise and under hot conditions.
Atropine 4 mg IM, roughly the equivalent of two DuoDote autoinjectors, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with impaired visual acuity, visual near point accommodation, logical reasoning, digital recall, learning, and cognitive reaction time. Ability to read is reduced or lost. Subjects are unsteady and need to concentrate on walking. These effects begin about 15 minutes to one hour or more post-dose.
Atropine 6 mg IM, roughly the equivalent of three DuoDote autoinjectors, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with the effects described above plus additional central effects including poor coordination, poor attention span, and visual hallucinations (colored flashes) in many subjects. Frank visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, disorientation, and ataxia occur in some subjects. Skilled and labor-intense tasks are performed more slowly and less efficiently. Decision making takes longer and is sometimes impaired.

It is unclear if the above data, obtained from studies of healthy adult subjects, can be extrapolated to other populations. In the elderly and patients with co-morbid conditions, the effects of ≥ 2 mg atropine on the ability to see, walk, and think properly are unstudied; effects may be greater in susceptible populations.

Patients who are mistakenly injected with DuoDote should avoid potentially dangerous overheating, avoid vigorous physical activity, and seek medical attention as soon as feasible.

### Negative outcome charles bonnet syndrome [^117PxRQB]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the largest phenomenological survey of CBS reported to date, with 492 people identified, compared to an average of 42 people (range 4–150) in previous surveys. The scaling in sample size allows us to explore issues less amenable to investigation in smaller studies due to their limitations of statistical power. Although our sample is derived from members of a voluntary society, the phenomenology of the hallucinations reported (ie, relative frequency of each content category, distribution of emotional responses, temporal characteristics etc) match those of previous surveys in clinical settings giving us confidence the findings are representative of CBS as a whole.

How long does CBS continue?

CBS continued for 5 years or more in 75% of the sample. This seems inconsistent with previous longitudinal studies suggesting 28% recovery at 1 yearor an average duration of 18 months. However, the former study relates to resolution over the course of a year without specifying prior duration of CBS, while the latter study does not take into account participants with on-going CBS (censored observations). Our study indicates the typical duration of CBS is far longer than these estimates, and questions the traditional view that CBS is a transient condition. It is possible our estimate is biased by people with shorter-duration CBS choosing not to participate in the survey. However, this seems unlikely, as the estimate of CBS prevalence based on the total number of questionnaires sent (12%) is similar to previous prevalence estimates for ophthalmic populations (∼10%)suggesting we were not missing a large proportion of respondents.

### Understanding hallucinations in probable Alzheimer's disease: very low prevalence rates in a tertiary memory clinic [^114R6zbg]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Averaging at 13.4%, current literature reports widely varying prevalence rates of hallucinations in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is still inconclusive on contributive factors to hallucinations in AD.

Methods

This study assessed prevalence, associated factors and clinical characteristics of hallucinations in 1227 patients with probable AD, derived from a tertiary memory clinic specialized in early diagnosis of dementia. Hallucinations were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory.

Results

Hallucination prevalence was very low, with only 4.5% (n = 55/1227) affected patients. Hallucinations were mostly visual (n = 40/55) or auditory (n = 12/55). Comorbid delusions were present in over one-third of cases (n = 23/55). Hallucinations were associated with increased dementia severity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a lifetime history of hallucination-evoking disease (such as depression and sensory impairment), but not with age or gender.

Discussion

In the largest sample thus far, we report a low prevalence of hallucinations in probable AD patients, comparable to rates in non-demented elderly. Our results suggest that hallucinations are uncommon in early stage AD. Clinicians that encounter hallucinations in patients with early AD should be sensitive to hallucination-evoking comorbidity.

### Visual hallucinations in neurological and ophthalmological disease: pathophysiology and management [^1145s1xG]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Visual hallucinations and their management

Eye disease

Charles Bonnet syndrome VH are associated with diseases affecting the retina, light transmission within the eye (eg, cataract, corneal opacity) or visual pathways and visual cortex. They do not relate to a specific ocular pathology subtypeand can occur in monocular disease. Typical phenomenology includes simple hallucinations (colours and elementary shapes) geometrical patterns, disembodied faces and costumed figures. Charles Bonnet syndrome risk increases in patients with severe impairment of visual acuity. The frequency of VH occurrence in Charles Bonnet syndrome reduces over time, but more than 75% of patients will continue to experience hallucinations beyond 5 years after their onset. Clinical impression, supported by patient surveysis that Charles Bonnet syndrome is under-recognised with the fear of stigma reducing self-report. Around a third of Charles Bonnet syndrome patients have symptoms requiring clinical intervention beyond reassurance and education (negative outcome Charles Bonnet syndrome). Compared with patients with eye disease but no VH, Charles Bonnet syndrome adversely affects quality of life.

Current practice

For Charles Bonnet syndrome, ophthalmology services will explain symptoms, reassure and signpost for further support and self-help techniques, with limited evidence from a case series that this may reduce VH in some people. The self-help techniques aim to stop hallucinations at the time they occur and include eye-movements, changing lighting levels to increase visual input and alerting/distraction strategies. If clinically significant through causing distress, referral to other specialities may occur. A staged approach to treatment is used with a health screen and medication review and optimisation of vision (eg, cataract removal). For people with VH associated with acute visual loss due to macular degeneration, a study of ranibizumab found improvement in 23%, with an association with improved visual acuity. There is case-report evidence for treatment with anticonvulsants, cholinesterase inhibitors,5HT antagonists (ondansetron), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, atypical neuroleptics, Yi-Gan San (a Chinese traditional medicine with multiple neurotransmitter effects)and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, none can be recommended for routine clinical use without further evidence for their efficacy.

### What do we know about pseudodementia? [^116Xwse7]. General Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Presentation/Characteristics

Depression in old age is clinically heterogeneous, and the severity of depressive symptoms does not directly relate to the level of cognitive impairment. Despite the heterogeneity, there are some distinctive neurocognitive and behavioural changes that appear to be attributable to geriatric depression and that are characteristic of a large group of patients who do not have neurological disease.

Pseudodementia typically encompasses memory issues, impairments in executive functioning and speech deficits. Notable cognitive symptoms may include difficulties in remembering words or remembering things in general, reduced attention and concentration, challenges in task completion or decision-making, decreased speech fluency and speed and impaired processing speed. Individuals with pseudodementia commonly experience significant distress due to the cognitive impairments they encounter.

Key symptoms of pseudodementia comprise speech impairments, memory lapses or deficits, attention difficulties, emotional regulation challenges and problems with organisation or task planning. Remarkably, these symptoms are also highly prevalent among individuals with dementia. Consequently, doctors may often lean towards diagnosing and treating individuals exhibiting these symptoms as if they have dementia.

In addition, cognitive tasks that require sustained effort and elaborate cognitive processing may be more affected in depression than tasks that can be accomplished more automatically.

As pseudodementia is often linked to depression, the person may also experience symptoms that include depressed mood, fatigue or anergy, insomnia or hypersomnia, anhedonia, anorexia or hyperphagia and suicidal thoughts or behaviours.

Memory deficits

It is now generally accepted that depression presents with a series of deficits in the domains of episodic memory and learning.

Both explicit verbal and visual memory functions exhibit deficits in individuals with both melancholic (endogenous) and non-melancholic (non-endogenous) depression. Nevertheless, these patients demonstrate intact performance on implicit memory tasks, and certain other memory functions appear to remain unaffected.

The neurobiological underpinnings of these memory deficits remain uncertain. Temporal lobe lesions are known to result in episodic memory deficits. Furthermore, reductions in hippocampal volume are found in patients with major depression. These findings may point to a temporal lobe deficit as the reason for cognitive decline.

However, most researchers suggest that such deficits may be primarily due to attention problems and not due to structural problems.

### Visual hallucinations in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism [^113k5TGX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical phenomenology and differential diagnosis

Hallucinations are sensory perceptions in the absence of an external stimulus and may manifest as visual, auditory, olfactory or tactile phenomena. In comparison, illusions are distortions of perception in the presence of an external stimulus.

Hallucinations occur in 15–75% of patients with PD. The variability in reported prevalence depends in part on study methodology. Most published reports included patients referred to specialist movement disorders clinics and report hallucinations in between 25% and 50% of all PD patients. In contrast, a community survey of a geographically defined cohort in Norway with case ascertainment of 96% revealed a much lower rate of reported hallucinations of 16%. Longitudinal studies have reported a higher prevalence than cross sectional studies, increasing over the course of the disease.

PD was originally described in terms of motor disturbance but non-motor features, including cognitive and mood disturbances, sleep disturbance, constipation and anosmia, are prominent and may predate the onset of motor symptoms by up to 10 years. Other parkinsonian diseases often present with the same motor features and clues to alternative diagnoses may remain obscured for some months or years. PSP, MSA and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are often misdiagnosed as PD or DLB early in their course because of this.

The clinical signs of PD are usually asymmetric in onset, often with rest tremor, and a good response to dopaminergic medications is expected. The pathology is characterised by nigrostriatal deficiency with neuronal loss predominantly in the substantia nigra pars compacta, among other brainstem nuclei, with accumulation of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies and neurites. DLB is used to designate patients with dementia and parkinsonism that occur together. The pathological difference between DLB and PD can be subtle and relates to the distribution of synuclein pathology and the extent of neuronal loss.

In contrast, PSP is characterised by prominent akinesia, impaired postural reflexes, falls and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy or slowing of vertical saccades. These symptoms do not improve with dopaminergic medications. PSP is a primary tauopathy with neurofibrillary degeneration most severe in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and pons. Up to a third of patients with PSP tau pathology have other clinical presentations, including: PSP–parkinsonism (PSP-P) with dominant early features of asymmetry, tremor, bradykinesia, dystonia and levodopa responsiveness; and pure akinesia with gait freezing characterised by early gait freezing without rigidity, tremor, dementia or supranuclear gaze palsy, which is somewhat less common.

### How can hearing loss cause dementia? [^115Gawtw]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

Listening to speech under difficult conditions, when subjects have hearing impairment, therefore has a likely acute effect on cognitive domains that are deficient in dementia. In terms of the brain basis for speech perception under difficult listening conditions, meta-analyses of functional imaging studies demonstrate the involvement of auditory cortex and the left inferior frontal lobe. Individual studies have identified the involvement of other neocortical areas and the hippocampus.

The behavioral data therefore support the greater use of cognitive resources during listening in difficult conditions, and imaging studies support the use of a broad network of areas, including auditory cortex, the language network, and the hippocampus. The possible relevance of these observations to the development of dementia cannot be dismissed. However, these resources appear to be used in the short term, especially when listening to difficult speech, not when speech is easy (or when the subject is not actively listening or no longer "trying" to listen). The question thus arises as to how the increased use of these resources in the short term contributes to the development of dementia, defined as a cognitive phenotype with specific and enduring pathology, generally based on testing with single tasks. In other words, how does the interfering effect of speech in noise on cognition persist and affect cognitive tests for dementia that are generally carried out without any distracting task? In our view, this mechanism is a more compelling basis for hearing loss as a potential cause for the wide range of cognitive deficits in elderly people (considered in) that can occur in the absence of the specific molecular and neuronal pathology of AD. In the case of cognitive deficits in the elderly, the idea is that elderly people with hearing impairment are forced continually to carry out a dual task, which impairs cognition. Even then, there is a question as to how such immediate effects translate to a persistent impact on cognition when this is tested with single tasks, particularly non-auditory ones.

### Osteoporosis: an evolutionary perspective [^1137UPTx]. Human Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Increased life expectancy has led to an overall aging of the population and greater numbers of elderly people. Therefore, the number of people with osteoporosis has increased substantially, accompanied with an epidemic of hip fractures. Osteoporosis is an age-related systemic condition that naturally occurs, among mammals, only in humans. Osteoporosis is known to be highly heritable. However, assuming a genetic determinant for this post-reproductive disease to be transmitted from one generation to the next is counter-intuitive, based on the principles of human evolution, I will attempt to provide an explanation of the phenomenon from the point of view of evolution, selection, and changed environment in humans, which contributed to human longevity, while on other hand, contribute to diseases of civilization, including osteoporosis. There is a need to delve into evolution of human species in search for adaptive patterns to a specific environment that humans are operating in the last couple of millennia, to clarify whether "good" and "bad" genes exist, and how to find and correct them. The answer to the above questions will help us to identify causes of the current epidemic of osteoporosis and to pin-point a tailored treatment.

### Seeing ophthalmologic problems in parkinson disease: results of a visual impairment questionnaire [^1131KWzb]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ophthalmologic symptoms in the intraocular and optic nerve domain were twice as frequent among patients with PD than controls. These symptoms are caused most commonly by cataract formation. This higher prevalence of symptoms possibly caused by cataract in patients with PD could result from the disease process of PD itself, since prominent α-synuclein accumulation is present in residual lens fragments of patients with PD. Other possible contributing factors include deposition of abnormally phosphorylated α-synuclein in the inner retinal layers, leading to retinal dopamine depletion and retinal dysfunction, or damage to the ganglion cell axons, leading to optic nerve head atrophy. Also, there may be a relationship between PD and neovascular macular degeneration. All these factors could cause changes in color and contrast vision, metamorphopsia, or impaired night vision. In our population, 26% of patients reported problems when reading a text on a colored or gray background, suggesting impaired contrast sensitivity, while 11% did not see colors as brightly as before, suggesting decreased color vision. This supports the association of impaired contrast sensitivity and decreased color vision with the neurodegenerative process in PD. Oculomotor symptoms were also frequently reported by patients with PD. Diplopia is a well-established nonmotor symptom in PD. Oculomotor deficits in PD are thought to arise from deficits in oculomotor pathways in the brainstem, basal ganglia, and frontal lobes. Some may arise from dopamine depletion in the basal ganglia, causing excessive inhibition of the superior colliculus, which may lead to hypometric eye movements. In addition, cortical involvement in the disease process of PD may affect the cortical visual areas (including the frontal and parietal eye fields), which play an important role during the initiation of eye movements, anticipation of visual stimuli, target selection, and suppression of automatic responses to visual stimuli. As with many other ophthalmologic symptoms, patients with PD generally do not report diplopia spontaneously, hence treating physicians should actively ask for double vision and other ophthalmologic symptoms. In our study, 22% of patients reported visual hallucinations, compared with 30%–60% in previous studies. This discrepancy may be caused by underreporting of visual illusions — having the feeling that someone is in the room or interpreting a shadow as a person — which were part of earlier studies, but not explicitly surveyed by the VIPD-Q. Visual hallucinations may result from the disease process itself, as well as from its treatment. Risk factors for visual hallucinations include ophthalmologic disorders, underlining the importance of recognizing ophthalmologic symptoms and starting early treatment when possible.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^1121rpid]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline 9 — psychologists strive to be familiar with current knowledge about normal and disease-mediated cognitive changes in older adults — emphasizes that one of the greatest challenges is knowing how to attribute subtle observed cognitive changes to normal developmental shifts versus an underlying neurodegenerative condition, that several moderating and mediating factors contribute to and confound age-associated changes within and across individuals, and that psychologists' knowledge about cognitive changes in older adulthood is critical to their ability to provide services. Application indicates that most cognitive changes older adults experience as part of normal aging are mild and do not significantly interfere with daily functioning, that for most older adults some abilities remain relatively stable into late life while others change beginning decades earlier, that the vast majority continue to engage in longstanding pursuits, interact intellectually, solve real-life problems, and achieve new learning, and that functions better preserved with age include aspects of language such as vocabulary and general semantic knowledge and other skills relying primarily on stored information, while psychologists aim to inform themselves about this process.

In the multiple dose studies, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.5, 7.6)].

5.4 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms

Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions have been reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations.

5.5 Interaction with CYP1A2 Inhibitors

Because of potential drug interactions, tizanidine is contraindicated in patients taking potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin. Adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness can occur when tizanidine is taken with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than ciprofloxacin (which is contraindicated), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine). Concomitant use should be avoided unless the necessity for tizanidine therapy is clinically evident. In such a case, use with caution [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.3) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

### Decoding individual identity from brain activity elicited in imagining common experiences [^115cMEEU]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Reason to hypothesize that neural correlates of person-specific imagery may be readable from fMRI data comes in part from a recent thrust of research that has exposed individual differences in other cognitive domains. Prominent examples include: using resting-state fMRI data to predict individual differences in the cortical distribution of activity elicited in multiple (gambling/motor/language etc.) task-related studies, matching representational similarity of fMRI elicited viewing photos of personal belongings to behavioral measures of object similarity; and using measures of brain activity scanned during a picture-based mechanical engineering task to predict individuals' physics/engineering exam results. Research has even begun to characterize brain network activity in terms of the nature of individual differences in ongoing thought, reflecting whether current thoughts are detailed, correspond to the past or future, are verbal or in images and so on. However, whilst these studies do demonstrate that individual differences can be discerned using fMRI, it is unclear that the methods utilized to elicit individual-differences (e.g. picture interpretation, resting) and detect them (e.g. exam results, object similarity judgments, ratings on components of thought) would generalize to the current case of imagining oneself in multiple different scenarios when cued by generic prompts such as "a wedding" or "a funeral".

In addition, a number of studies have cataloged between-group differences in autobiographical memory-related fMRI activation. For instance, altered activation has been observed in Alzheimer's disease, semantic dementia, and epilepsy. Relating more to conceptual knowledge, machine learning methods have discriminated between young suicidal ideators thinking about suicide and emotion concepts and healthy controls, and students contemplating objects' mechanical function at different phases of education. However, whilst all of the previous between-group differences must be built on top of an accumulation of individual-differences (neural features that appear in one group but not the other), and whilst both group-average and trait-level individual difference studies have revealed the engagement of similar brain networks, group-averages cannot explain detailed differences in event representations between pairs of individuals from within the same group.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^115v76ho]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, clinician-administered interviews are often already in a suitable and convenient format for older adults — difficulty reading due to visual loss/impairment, items can be repeated for those with hearing loss — though clinicians sometimes lack confidence in talking about hallucinations, so formal training is required to learn how to approach this topic and to administer items in a standardized way. For example, the QPE, which was developed with input from patient associations in several countries, provides 50 fully structured questions about hallucinations and is scripted to be low in stigma. However, interviews can be time-consuming, which may be a problem for adults with cognitive or motivational difficulties. To conclude, there is a clear need for an increased interest in hallucinations in older adults, both in terms of research in general and in terms of clinical practice (eg, the development and validation of optimal hallucination assessment tools for older adults and the existence of formal clinical training related to hallucinations in older adults). We encourage those working in a clinical setting to use the information presented here to choose the optimal hallucination assessment tools for their working context. These assessment issues are as important in a clinical setting as they are in research. Also, we recommend that clinicians strive to further adapt, refine, and validate these tools to reduce the gap in evidence-based assessment tools available for older adults.

### Atropine (Atropen auto-injector) [^1144FsRe]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Inadvertent Injection

In cases where ATROPEN is inadvertently administered to people who are not poisoned with nerve agent or organophosphorus insecticide, the following effects on their ability to function normally may occur. Patients with cardiac disease may be at risk for serious adverse events, including death.

Atropine 2 mg IM, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with minimal effects on visual, motor, and mental functions, though unsteadiness walking and difficulty concentrating may occur. Atropine reduces body sweating and increases body temperature, particularly with exercise and under hot conditions.

Atropine 4 mg IM, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with impaired visual acuity, visual near point accommodation, logical reasoning, digital recall, learning, and cognitive reaction time. Ability to read is reduced or lost. Subjects are unsteady and need to concentrate on walking. These effects begin about 15 minutes to one hour or more post-dose.

Atropine 6 mg IM, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with the effects described above plus additional central nervous system effects including poor coordination, poor attention span, and visual hallucinations (colored flashes) in many subjects. Frank visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, disorientation, and ataxia occur in some subjects. Skilled and labor-intense tasks are performed more slowly and less efficiently. Decision making takes longer and is sometimes impaired.

It is unclear if the above data, obtained from studies of healthy adult subjects, can be extrapolated to other populations. In the elderly and patients with co-morbid conditions, the effects of ≥ 2 mg atropine on the ability to see, walk, and think properly are unstudied; effects may be greater in susceptible populations.

Patients who are mistakenly injected with ATROPEN should avoid potentially dangerous overheating, avoid vigorous physical activity, and seek medical attention as soon as feasible.

### Negative outcome charles bonnet syndrome [^115EZs5K]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Negative outcome CBS

While the majority of people with CBS felt it had no real effect on their life (60%), a subset judged it to have a fairly negative (25%) or very negative (8%) effect, and 6% reported a fairly pleasant or very pleasant effect (1%). We collapsed these responses into three outcome valencies: negative (fairly and very negative, n = 156), positive (fairly and very pleasant, n = 36) and neutral (n = 289). Negative outcome was not associated with gender or diagnosis (wet, dry, wet and dry AMD; p > 0.05). It was associated with longer-duration hallucination episodes (χ² = 38.9, p < 0.00 001) and more frequent hallucination episodes (χ² = 31.7, p = 0.0001). There was no difference in mean overall duration of CBS (CBS onset to cessation) for subgroups with negative outcome (mean duration 2.7 ± 2.0 years), positive outcome (1.9 ± 1.3 years) and neutral outcome (3.3 ± 3.9 years) (F(2,75) = 0.452; p = 0.638 — censored data excluded). Negative outcome was not associated with a particular type of hallucination content (p corr > 0.05 for patterns, faces, people, animals and objects). Fear-inducing hallucinations at CBS onset were associated with negative outcome (45% of the subgroup with fear-inducing hallucinations at onset had negative outcome vs 25% of the subgroup without fear-inducing hallucinations; χ² = 23.2, p corr = 0.00001). CBS affecting one or more daily activities was associated with negative outcome (52% of the subgroup with an activity affected had negative outcome vs 16% of the subgroup with no activities affected, χ² = 75.3, p < 0.000001). Attributing CBS to mental illness or, at trend significance, Alzheimer's disease was associated with negative outcome (58% of the subgroup attributing CBS to mental illness had negative outcome vs 30% of the subgroup not attributing CBS to mental illness, χ² = 12.0, p corr = 0.01). Attributing CBS to sight loss was not associated with negative outcome (χ² = 0.087, p corr > 0.05). Lack of prior knowledge about CBS at symptom onset was associated with negative outcome (25% of the subgroup familiar with CBS at onset had negative outcome vs 35% of the subgroup unfamiliar with CBS at onset; χ² = 6.4, p = 0.04). There was also a trend association between the quality of information given by medical professional and negative outcome (47% of the subgroup not given a clear account, had negative outcome vs 36% of the subgroup given a clear account; χ 2 = 4.5, p = 0.10).

### Vision rehabilitation preferred practice pattern ® [^1164mfQ9]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Charles Bonnet syndrome hallucinations — clinical features in vision impairment — are characterized by recurrent, vivid visual hallucinations with insight that what is seen is not real, no other neurological or medical diagnosis to explain the hallucinations, and some degree of vision loss; patients with any level of vision impairment may experience recurrent hallucinations as part of Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS).

### Benefit of psychiatric evaluation on anxiety in patients with charles bonnet syndrome [^115Ht7vb]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Charles Bonnet, a Swiss philosopher, biologist and natural scientist, reported in 1760 the case of his grandfather, who had visual hallucinations (VHs). The patient was 89 years old, mentally and physically fit, suffering from bilateral cataracts and had VH describing people, birds or houses. The patient was aware of the fact that these hallucinations were unreal.

Georges des Morsier gave the name 'Charles Bonnet syndrome' (CBS) to VH, which occur in elderly, mentally fit patients. Much later, different authors suggested that VH in patients with CBS occur due to vision loss caused by ophthalmological diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), other retinal diseases, cataract or glaucoma.

Literature about CBS shows a large scale of diagnostic, inclusion and exclusion criteria. There is no commonly applied definition about CBS but most authors agree that patients have eye pathologies but no psychopathological disease (eg, dementia, psychosis or other neurological disease), have full insight that VH are unreal and VH are complex (eg, objects, faces, animals, plants or figures), repetitive and disappear when the eyes are closed, and there are no hallucinations affecting other sensory modalities.

The current literature states that there are many different hypotheses about pathophysiology of CBS. VH may result from disorders in the visual cortex, visual perceptual disorders, overactivity in cortical areas or ageing.

Patients fear being believed to be mentally ill, so they do not tell medical staff or even their relatives about their symptoms.

Due to a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), no evidence-based treatment for patients with CBS is available. It is presumed that VH would disappear with a better vision (eg, cataract surgery). Cox and Ffytche showed in 2014 that about one-third of patients with CBS are distressed from their VH. Better information and awareness and an informative medical consultation may have a significant impact treating patients with CBS.

This study is a RCT of patients with CBS, using concrete diagnostic criteria. The intention of the authors was to assess the potential beneficial effect of an additional psychiatric evaluation (compared with a consultation between patient and ophthalmologist) for patients suffering from CBS.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: a roadmap for designing interventions [^111Kz6y6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

In LBD, including both Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), VH have a high prevalence and heterogeneous phenomenology. Thus, visual experiences in LBD can be grouped into minor hallucinations, illusions, passage and presence hallucinations, and complex hallucinations. Illusions are perceptions of something objectively existing in such a way as to cause misinterpretation of its actual nature. One type of illusion, pareidolia, is defined as the tendency to perceive a specific, often meaningful image in a random or ambiguous visual pattern (like seeing faces in clouds). The passage hallucinations are referred to as unformed shadows of something or someone passing fast in the periphery of the eye field. The presence hallucinations consist of the sensation/vision that someone is behind oneself. Minor hallucinations may also arise as precursors of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may appear even in the absence of dopaminergic treatment. Complex VH in LBD consist of well-formed recurrent and stereotyped visions of insects, people (familiar or unfamiliar, alive or dead), animals or animated figures (often children). They can move but rarely talk, are mostly annoying or amusing before becoming threatening, and predominantly appear in low stimuli environments, usually crepuscular or at night. The phenomenology of these visual experiences may be linked with LBD disease progression according to Braak stages. Indeed, minor hallucinations occur when alterations mainly involve the brainstem and can be due to an alteration in the interaction between subcortical and cortical regions, including areas part of the dorsal visual stream, involved in visuospatial elaboration leading to passage and presence phenomena. Then as the disease progresses, alterations involve high brain stem loci and forebrain, leading to a deafferentation from subcortical regions to ventral visual stream and limbic areas, which may account for complex VH. When the neuropathological process affects cortical regions, the complex hallucinations become recurrent, insight is lost, and delusions can also appear. This hypothesis suggests that VH phenomenology may represent a clue of the different mechanisms involved in producing these disorders. With increasing severity of PD, hallucinations in other modalities — auditory, tactile, and olfactory — are more common. Though less well studied, AH have been reported in up to 20% of people with PD and in more than one third of people with LBD. The most commonly reported AH in this context have been described as sounds of a doorbell ringing, music, human voices, or footsteps. AH seldom appear in the absence of VH, and are sometimes perceived as a soundtrack to the scene. They are associated with a higher co-occurrence of other NPS. Patients with hearing impairment are at a higher risk for AH, potentially suggesting uninhibited spontaneous activity as observed in VH in the context of Charles Bonnet syndrome.

6.4	Inadvertent Injection

In cases where ATNAA is inadvertently administered to service members who are not poisoned with susceptible organophosphorus nerve agents having anticholinesterase activity, the following effects on their ability to function normally may occur.

Atropine 2 mg IM, roughly the equivalent of one ATNAA injection, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with minimal effects on visual, motor, and mental functions, though unsteadiness walking and difficulty concentrating may occur. Atropine reduces body sweating and increases body temperature, particularly with exercise and under hot conditions.

Atropine 4 mg IM, roughly the equivalent of two ATNAA injections, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with impaired visual acuity, visual near point accommodation, logical reasoning, digital recall, learning, and cognitive reaction time. Ability to read is reduced or lost. Subjects are unsteady and need to concentrate on walking. These effects begin about 15 minutes to one hour or more post-dose.

Atropine 6 mg IM, roughly the equivalent of three ATNAA injections, when given to healthy male volunteers, is associated with the effects described above plus additional central effects including poor coordination, poor attention span, and visual hallucinations (colored flashes) in many subjects. Frank visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, disorientation, and ataxia occur in some subjects. Skilled and labor-intense tasks are performed more slowly and less efficiently. Decision making takes longer and is sometimes impaired.

It is unclear if the above data, obtained from studies of healthy male subjects, can be extrapolated to other populations. In the elderly and individuals with co-morbid conditions, the effects of ≥ 2 mg atropine on the ability to see, walk, and think properly are unstudied; effects may be greater in susceptible populations.

Service members who are mistakenly injected with ATNAA should avoid potentially dangerous overheating, avoid vigorous physical activity, and seek medical attention as soon as feasible.

### The rarity of charles bonnet syndrome [^1131fWcm]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2004). Low credibility.

Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterized by complex visual hallucinations in otherwise psychologically normal people. Estimates of the prevalence of CBS in different samples vary from a small percentage (around 1%), to a relatively large percentage (about 10%). The purpose of the present study is to determine whether CBS is rare or not. One-thousand ophthalmologic and optometric outpatients at a university hospital were consecutively screened by a questionnaire to identify patients possibly experiencing visual hallucinations. The mean corrected visual acuity in the best eye was 1.1. Those who positively responded to the questionnaire were further investigated to determine whether their symptoms were consistent with CBS. As a result, the prevalence of CBS was 0.5% (5/1000). In subclass analyses, the prevalence was 3 of 372 (0.8%) in the low vision group, 2 of 346 (0.6%) in the elderly, and 1 of 120 (0.8%) in both conditions. These were not significantly different from each other or from the overall prevalence (0.5%). This low prevalence of CBS in our subjects may be due to their relatively good visual acuity because previous studies with high prevalence of CBS investigated patients with a visual acuity of less than 0.3. The prevalence of CBS may be low in patients with these particular characteristics, and this syndrome seems to be rare in even ophthalmologic and optometric patients if they do not have seriously low vision. Further studies are needed to investigate the prevalence of CBS in general population.

### Melatonin-responsive complex nocturnal visual hallucinations [^1139HTyQ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations are vivid, dramatic, intricate visual hallucinations occurring during sleep onset or awakenings at night, generally lasting for a few minutes at most and disappearing with increased levels of light. They may occur in a number of neurological conditions, as well as in normal individuals. The optimal treatment for this condition remains unclear. We describe three patients with complex nocturnal visual hallucinations in whom melatonin brought about a dramatic improvement in symptoms. Our report suggests that melatonin may be a safe, effective treatment for this rare but often distressing and anxiety-provoking condition.

### Economic segregation is associated with reduced concerns about economic inequality [^116hLceQ]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Study 5a

Both real and hypothetical levels of economic segregation in wages and neighborhoods reduced concerns about otherwise identical levels of inequality. Study 5a replicates these findings with a new design and examines one proposed mechanism for this effect. Beyond distorting perceptions of inequality, we examine whether a hypothetical level of high economic segregation reduces concerns about inequality through an additional pathway: reduced social comparisons.

Participants (N = 303) imagined living in each of four cities of a given country. For each city, participants saw images of a busy street and the incomes of 12 individuals who live in that city, amounting to a total of 48 individuals across all four images. We randomly assigned participants to one of two conditions, keeping the overall level of inequality across cities constant but varying whether it mostly occurred within each city or between them. In the Economic Segregation condition, participants saw a segregated country where inequality mainly occurred between cities (i.e. the highest-income people live in a different city from second highest-income people, who live in a different city from the next highest-income people, and so on). In the Economic Integration condition, participants saw a country where inequality mainly occurred within each city (i.e. the highest and lowest income residents live in the same cities). Thus, participants saw the same level of overall inequality (as measured by the dispersion of incomes among all 48 people) but varied in whether it mostly occurred between cities (Economic Segregation condition) or within cities (Economic Integration condition).

As a manipulation check, participants rated the level of inequality within each city. Then, after seeing all four cities, participants considered the country as a whole, rating the fairness of the distribution of income in the country and their concerns about it. Finally, to examine the role of economic comparisons, participants imagined living in this country and indicated how often they would think about the amount of money that they and other people make.

As before, the manipulation was successful, leading participants to see lower inequality in the Economic Segregation condition (M = 2.56, SD = 1.34) than the Economic Integration condition (M = 4.78, SD = 1.25; two-tailed independent-sample t (286) = 14.54, p < 0.001, d = 1.714, 95% CI[1.92, 2.52]).

### CDC science and the public health approach to long COVID… [^111sKsYd]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Findings Prevalence Long COVID estimates vary due to different study criteria, symptoms investigated, patient populations, and timing of when symptoms are assessed. CDC collects and analyzes data through several public health surveys. In 2022, 6. 9% of adults and

1. 3% of children in the United States ever reported experiencing Long COVID. 5 6. While Long COVID can occur in anyone who gets a SARS-CoV-2 infection, some people or groups of people are at higher risk of developing Long COVID. These include women, people with underlying conditions, people who experienced more severe outcomes of COVID-19, and people of Hispanic ethnicity. 5 7 Approximately 1 in 5 adults with Long COVID reported experiencing significant limitations in their daily activity. 8 9. Symptoms More than 200 Long COVID symptoms have been identified.

However, fatigue, brain fog, and exhaustion are among the commonly reported symptoms of Long COVID. 10 11 Prevention COVID-19 vaccination is the best available tool to reduce the risk of Long COVID. Research shows that COVID-19 vaccination prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces the risk of developing Long COVID among both children and adults. 12 13 14.

### Family practice international… [^112YRxn7]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Peyronie's Disease Patients with Peyronie's disease develop thick plaques on the dorsal shaft of the penis, resulting in painful erection. These plaques can also lead to fibrous scarring and curvature of the penis. The condition occurs in about 1 percent of men, most of whom are middle aged. Although the cause is unknown, previous trauma has been implicated. Histologically, Peyronie's disease causes inflammation that results in collagen deposition and the formation of fibrous plaques. The condition progresses slowly, stabilizing after about one year in some patients and resolving spontaneously in others. Use of tamoxifen may relieve pain on erection and surgery may be indicated to correct curvature of the penis, but no definitive therapy has been identified to prevent progression or hasten resolution of this condition. Use of Opiates in Patients with Cancer Although opiates are the mainstay of analgesia in patients with cancer, they are frequently not given in adequate doses or are used inappropriately. Patients with cancer may experience different types of pain. Opiates are highly effective against visceral pain, partially effective in somatic and neuropathic pain, and not effective for pain caused by muscle spasm or psychosocial distress. Traveling Abroad Safely Physicians should advise prospective travelers to avoid risk-taking behavior while visiting other countries. About 25 percent of all deaths of U. S. citizens who travel to other countries are caused by accidents. The leading causes of accidental deaths in tourists are motor vehicle crashes, drowning and homicide. Multiple Glomangiomas Glomangiomas arise from the glomus, a specialized arteriolovenular shunt in the skin that acts as a temperature-regulating mechanism. Small glomus tumors usually occur in peripheral areas of the body, especially the nail beds of the fingers. The tumors are red to violaceous tender dermal nodules that can erode the distal phalanx. Because of specialized innervation of the glomus cells, the tumors may cause severe paroxysmal pain following cold or minor trauma. Multiple glomangiomas represent an autosomal dominant condition that becomes apparent in early adult life.
