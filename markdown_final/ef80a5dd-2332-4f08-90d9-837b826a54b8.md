## Question

MRI of head for trigeminal neuralgia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use MRI of the head for trigeminal neuralgia, including indications, protocol, interpretation, limitations, and how MRI findings influence management decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and why MRI is indicated despite TN being a clinical diagnosis. Then, I should verify the guideline-backed indications for MRI in suspected TN. Next, I will specify the optimal MRI protocol and sequences. After that, I need to interpret MRI findings within the current classification framework and clarify what constitutes meaningful neurovascular compression. Then, I should review the diagnostic performance and limitations of MRI, including false positives and negatives. Finally, I will integrate MRI results into treatment planning, including medical therapy, surgical candidacy, and special populations like MS, and close with a concise, practical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the clinical foundation: trigeminal neuralgia remains a clinical diagnosis defined by paroxysmal, unilateral, electric shock-like facial pain in one or more trigeminal divisions, often triggered by innocuous stimuli, with a normal neurologic exam between attacks, so MRI is not required to make the diagnosis itself, but it is essential to exclude secondary causes and to subtype disease for management planning [^113aNB2p] [^116msAo9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite a classic history, I need to check guideline-backed indications for MRI because secondary etiologies are not rare and can change management. Multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend MRI for all patients with suspected TN to exclude tumors, demyelination, vascular malformations, and to characterize neurovascular relationships, with the AAN/EFNS noting that routine imaging identifies structural causes in up to about 15% of patients, and the EAN explicitly recommending MRI using a standardized high-resolution protocol for all TN patients [^1164Ei19] [^114okwxG] [^115Eq88b] [^111eccJC].

> Wait, let me verify the optimal protocol because detection of neurovascular conflict and subtle lesions hinges on sequence selection. The EAN-endorsed approach is a triad of 3D high-resolution T2-weighted cisternography (CISS/FIESTA/SPACE), 3D time-of-flight MR angiography, and 3D T1-weighted post-contrast imaging to define arteries, veins, and nerve morphology, with submillimetric voxels and multiplanar reconstructions centered on the root entry zone, and neuroradiologist interpretation blinded to the symptomatic side to minimize bias [^115Eq88b] [^112JZhcP] [^114QHFZa].

> I will now examine how to interpret MRI within the current classification, and I should double-check that mere contact is insufficient. The contemporary scheme classifies TN as classical when there is neurovascular contact with morphological changes of the trigeminal root (displacement, flattening, atrophy), idiopathic when there is no contact or no morphological change, and secondary when another lesion is present, so I need to grade severity and look for root deformation rather than contact alone to avoid overcalling conflict [^113aNB2p] [^116kwVP5] [^111PAhja].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about diagnostic performance and pitfalls? I should confirm that MRI is sensitive but imperfect for neurovascular conflict, with pooled sensitivity around 96% and specificity around 90% in surgical series, yet with notable variability across studies and a meaningful false-positive rate for low-grade contact, and importantly, a substantial minority of clinically typical TN patients have no demonstrable conflict, underscoring that MRI cannot confirm TN by itself and that clinical correlation is mandatory [^113x77e8] [^114zQ6UY] [^1128vHFV].

> Let me consider how MRI findings should alter management. If secondary TN is identified, I need to treat the underlying cause while applying standard analgesic principles, whereas in classical TN with clear conflict and root deformation, early discussion of microvascular decompression is reasonable given its superior durability, whereas in idiopathic TN or when no conflict is seen, neuroablative options may be preferred, and across all subtypes, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine remain first-line medical therapy with escalation or surgical referral if refractory or poorly tolerated [^114N7sXB] [^113JHHEi] [^113aNB2p] [^115q3b6S].

> But wait, what if the patient has multiple sclerosis? I should verify that neurovascular contact is not the primary driver in MS-related TN and that demyelinating plaques along intrapontine trigeminal afferents are the dominant mechanism, so MVD is generally not indicated in MS-TN and management should focus on medical therapy and lesion-directed approaches when appropriate, reinforcing the need for MRI to distinguish MS-related disease from classical TN [^117W12ZL] [^115L7vmC].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of advanced imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging and tractography can demonstrate microstructural abnormalities and may correlate with treatment response, and radiomics or volumetric approaches are promising but not yet standard of care, so I should reserve these for research or specialized centers rather than routine practice at this time [^114KBBB7] [^111pjHeu] [^1123dwxv].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing: in a patient with suspected TN, obtain MRI with the EAN triad protocol and blinded review. If a secondary cause is found, manage accordingly. If classical TN with conflict and morphological change is present, discuss MVD early. If idiopathic TN or no conflict is seen, consider medical therapy and, if refractory, percutaneous or radiosurgical options. Throughout, use trigeminal reflex testing when available to help distinguish secondary from classic disease, recognizing that normal reflexes reduce but do not eliminate the likelihood of secondary TN [^115Eq88b] [^1128F4JD] [^1164Ei19].

> In summary, I need to ensure MRI is obtained in all suspected TN cases to exclude secondary causes and to phenotype disease, interpret findings through the lens of contact versus compression with morphological change, communicate the limitations and probabilistic nature of imaging to patients, and align treatment with the resulting subtype, integrating medical therapy and timely surgical referral when appropriate to optimize outcomes [^114okwxG] [^113aNB2p] [^111xxBZQ].

MRI of the head is **essential in trigeminal neuralgia** to exclude secondary causes (tumor, multiple sclerosis, vascular malformation) [^111eccJC] and to identify neurovascular compression (NVC) [^113aNB2p] that guides management [^113JHHEi]. Use **high-resolution 3D T2 (CISS/FIESTA), 3D TOF MRA, and 3D T1 gadolinium** [^115Eq88b] to detect NVC and secondary lesions; interpret NVC by location, vessel type, and degree of nerve deformation or atrophy [^111RJ4ZF], as severe NVC predicts better surgical outcomes [^1128vHFV]. MRI is not mandatory for classic TN with a normal exam, but is recommended to exclude secondary causes and to plan surgery [#ref-716073d5,#ref-59e6612b]; false positives/negatives can occur, so clinical correlation is required [^111TdNGD].

---

## Indications for MRI in trigeminal neuralgia

MRI is indicated in TN to:

- **Exclude secondary causes**: Tumors, multiple sclerosis (MS), vascular malformations, or other structural lesions [^111eccJC] [^115Eq88b].
- **Identify neurovascular compression**: Vascular contact or compression of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone (REZ) [^113aNB2p] [^115Eq88b].
- **Guide management**: Inform surgical planning (e.g. microvascular decompression) [^113aNB2p] [^113JHHEi].

Although MRI is not mandatory for classic TN with a normal neurological exam, it is generally recommended to exclude secondary causes and to assist in surgical planning [^113u5ztc] [^114okwxG].

---

## MRI sequences and protocols

Effective MRI for TN relies on **high-resolution sequences** to delineate the trigeminal nerve and adjacent vessels:

| **Sequence** | **Purpose** | **Technical parameters** |
|-|-|-|
| 3D T2-weighted (CISS/FIESTA) | Visualize trigeminal nerve and cisternal segments; detect NVC | - Isotropic voxels < 0.5 mm <br/> - Heavy T2 weighting <br/> - CSF highlights nerve/vessels [^115Eq88b] [^114QHFZa] |
| 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA | Identify arteries (e.g. SCA, AICA) | - Isotropic voxels < 0.5 mm <br/> - Suppresses venous/background signal [^115Eq88b] [^111pQFAh] |
| 3D T1-weighted gadolinium | Detect tumors, demyelination, or enhancement | - Isotropic voxels < 0.5 mm <br/> - Gadolinium contrast [^115Eq88b] [^112JZhcP] |

---

Multiplanar reconstructions (**axial, coronal, sagittal**) are essential for **accurate assessment** of the nerve–vessel relationship [^115y1GNg].

---

## MRI findings in trigeminal neuralgia

MRI findings in TN include:

- **Neurovascular compression (NVC)**: Vessel contact at the REZ with nerve deformation, displacement, or atrophy [^111RJ4ZF] [^111PAhja].
- **Secondary lesions**: Tumors (e.g. meningioma, schwannoma), MS plaques, or vascular malformations [^112ib9fQ].
- **Nerve atrophy**: Reduced nerve volume, especially with continuous pain [^113VSVqH] [^116gXJUZ].

---

## Clinical significance of MRI findings

MRI findings **guide diagnosis and management**:

- **Classical TN**: NVC with morphological nerve changes supports the diagnosis and predicts good surgical outcomes [^111PAhja] [^111RJ4ZF].
- **Secondary TN**: Identification of tumors, MS plaques, or vascular malformations redirects management toward the underlying cause [^111eccJC] [^113aNB2p].
- **Surgical planning**: Detailed NVC mapping aids microvascular decompression (MVD) planning and patient counseling [^113JHHEi] [^1128vHFV].

---

## Limitations and challenges of MRI in trigeminal neuralgia

MRI has limitations: **false positives** can occur, as incidental NVC is common in asymptomatic individuals [^111PAhja] [^111RJ4ZF], and **false negatives** may occur when subtle or distal compression is missed. Artifacts from motion, dental implants, or vessel overlap can degrade image quality and obscure the nerve–vessel interface [^111TdNGD].

---

## Comparison with other imaging modalities

MRI is superior to CT for soft-tissue contrast, vascular structures, and nerve visualization, making it the **preferred modality** for TN. CT may be used when MRI is contraindicated or for bony detail, but it is less sensitive for NVC and secondary causes [^113u5ztc] [^112JZhcP].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend MRI for all patients with TN to exclude secondary causes and identify NVC; **high-resolution 3D sequences** are advised, and neuroradiologists should be blinded to the side of pain to avoid bias [^114okwxG] [^115Eq88b] [^111eccJC].

---

## Impact of MRI on treatment decisions

MRI findings **significantly influence treatment**: the presence of NVC with nerve deformation favors MVD as first-line surgery, whereas absence of NVC or medical contraindications may steer toward percutaneous or radiosurgical options [^113JHHEi] [^114av2CV]. Early, accurate MRI can expedite appropriate surgical referral and improve outcomes [^113JHHEi] [^1128vHFV].

---

MRI is **essential in TN** to exclude secondary causes, identify NVC, and guide management. High-resolution 3D sequences with multiplanar reconstructions are critical; interpretation must consider the degree of nerve deformation and clinical correlation to optimize diagnosis and treatment planning [^113JHHEi] [^115Eq88b].

Trigeminal neuralgia is a very painful neurological condition with severe, stimulus-evoked, short-lasting stabbing pain attacks in the face. The past decade has offered new insights into trigeminal neuralgia symptomatology, pathophysiology, and treatment, leading to a change in the classification of the condition. An accurate diagnosis is crucial because neuroimaging interpretation and clinical management differ among the various forms of facial pain. MRI using specific sequences should be a part of the diagnostic workup to detect a possible neurovascular contact and exclude secondary causes. Demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm a diagnosis but rather to facilitate surgical decision making. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are drugs of first choice for long-term treatment, whereas microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in medically refractory patients. Advances in neuroimaging techniques and animal models will provide further insight into the causes of trigeminal neuralgia and its pathophysiology. Development of more efficacious treatment options is highly warranted.

Introduction

A demyelinating plaque and neurovascular contact with morphological changes have both been suggested to contribute to the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia secondary to multiple sclerosis (TN-MS). The aim of this study was to confirm or refute whether neurovascular contact with morphological changes is involved in the etiology of TN-MS.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled consecutive TN-MS patients from the Danish Headache Center. Clinical characteristics were collected systematically. MRI scans were done using a 3.0 Tesla imager and were evaluated by the same experienced blinded neuroradiologist.

Results

Sixty-three patients were included. Fifty-four patients were included in the MRI analysis. There was a low prevalence of neurovascular contact with morphological changes on both the symptomatic side (6 (14%)) and the asymptomatic side (4 (9%)), p = 0.157. Demyelinating brainstem plaques along the trigeminal afferents were more prevalent on the symptomatic side compared to the asymptomatic side (31 (58%) vs. 12 (22%), p < 0.001). A demyelinating plaque was highly associated with the symptomatic side (odds ratio = 10.6, p = 0.002).

Conclusion

The primary cause of TN-MS is demyelination along the intrapontine trigeminal afferents. As opposed to classical trigeminal neuralgia, neurovascular contact does not play a role in the etiology of TN-MS. Microvascular decompression should generally not be offered to patients with TN-MS. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT04371575).

Trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, vestibulocochlear neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia represent the most common neurovascular compression syndromes. Repeated vascular pulsations at the vulnerable transitional zone of the individual cranial nerves lead to focal axonal injury and demyelination. High-resolution 3-D T2-weighted MR imaging is essential in detecting and mapping neurovascular compression for directed therapy. Knowledge of the specific nerve root exit, the transitional zones, and the adjacent vasculature is critical in proper management. Treatment options for these neurovascular compressions syndromes run the gamut from medical therapy to stereotactic radiosurgery to botulinum injections and to surgical decompression.

Background and Purpose

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an extremely painful condition which can be difficult to diagnose and treat. In Europe, TN patients are managed by many different specialities. Therefore, there is a great need for comprehensive European guidelines for the management of TN. The European Academy of Neurology asked an expert panel to develop recommendations for a series of questions that are essential for daily clinical management of patients with TN.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed and recommendations was developed based on GRADE, where feasible; if not, a good practice statement was given.

Results

The use of the most recent classification system is recommended, which diagnoses TN as primary TN, either classical or idiopathic depending on the degree of neurovascular contact, or as secondary TN caused by pathology other than neurovascular contact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using a combination of three high-resolution sequences, should be performed as part of the work-up in TN patients, because no clinical characteristics can exclude secondary TN. If MRI is not possible, trigeminal reflexes can be used. Neurovascular contact plays an important role in primary TN, but demonstration of a neurovascular contact should not be used to confirm the diagnosis of TN. Rather, it may help to decide if and when a patient should be referred for microvascular decompression. In acute exacerbations of pain, intravenous infusion of fosphenytoin or lidocaine can be used. For long-term treatment, carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are recommended as drugs of first choice. Lamotrigine, gabapentin, botulinum toxin type A, pregabalin, baclofen and phenytoin may be used either alone or as add-on therapy. It is recommended that patients should be offered surgery if pain is not sufficiently controlled medically or if medical treatment is poorly tolerated. Microvascular decompression is recommended as first-line surgery in patients with classical TN. No recommendation can be given for choice between any neuroablative treatments or between them and microvascular decompression in patients with idiopathic TN. Neuroablative treatments should be the preferred choice if MRI does not demonstrate any neurovascular contact. Treatment for patients with secondary TN should in general follow the same principles as for primary TN. In addition to medical and surgical management, it is recommended that patients are offered psychological and nursing support.

Conclusions

Compared with previous TN guidelines, there are important changes regarding diagnosis and imaging. These allow better characterization of patients and help in decision making regarding the planning of medical and surgical management. Recommendations on pharmacological and surgical management have been updated. There is a great need for future research on all aspects of TN, including pathophysiology and management.

Diagnosis and Imaging

TN is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis, and as such, neuroimaging and laboratory tests are not mandatory to make a diagnosis. Patients with a characteristic history and a normal neurologic examination other than pain may be treated without further workup. However, modern workup of patients with TN usually includes elective imaging for all patients to exclude secondary causes of TN, such as inflammatory or mass lesions. As computer tomography (CT) is limited in evaluating the brain parenchyma, skull base nerves, and CSF cisterns, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with high-resolution sequences at the skull base is usually the modality of choice. According to a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies, routine head imaging identifies nonvascular, structural causes of TN in up to 15% of TN patients.

Differential diagnosis

TN is a clinical diagnosis based on detailed history and examination. Though often considered a straightforward diagnosis to make, its differential diagnosis can be challenging, given the considerable overlap with other neuropathic and neuralgiform headache and oro-facial pain disorders. Table 1 outlines the important differential diagnoses of TN.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia

We have discussed below some selected differential diagnoses in greater detail as they often pose a challenge in neurological clinical practice.

TN and the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias

Since TN attacks are almost invariably precipitated by innocuous stimuli within the affected trigeminal distribution, all the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias except SUNCT/SUNA can be easily differentiated from TN as none of the others can be triggered by innocuous stimuli. Recent studies on the demographics and clinical phenotype of SUNCT and SUNA have highlighted a remarkable overlap with TN. Furthermore, a recent prospective cross-sectional MR study conducted in 159 patients with SUNCT and SUNA showed a significantly higher proportion of neurovascular contact with morphological changes on the symptomatic trigeminal nerves, compared with the asymptomatic nerves. The multivariate analysis of radiological predictors associated with the symptomatic side indicated that the presence of neurovascular contact with morphological changes was strongly associated with the side of the pain, suggesting that this finding may be a shared causative factor with TN. A recent large prospective open-label study conducted in 161 patients on the medical treatments of SUNCT/SUNA confirmed the efficacy of sodium channel blockers, indicating also a therapeutic overlap with TN. Taken together these pieces of evidence suggest that SUNCT, SUNA and TN may constitute a continuum of the same disorder. Given the challenges in differentiating between them, table 2 summarises the differences between TN and SUNCT/SUNA.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^114av2CV]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a highly disabling disorder characterised by very severe, brief and electric shock like recurrent episodes of facial pain. New diagnostic criteria, which subclassify TN on the basis of presence of trigeminal neurovascular conflict or an underlying neurological disorder, should be used as they allow better characterisation of patients and help in decision-making regarding medical and surgical treatments. MR imaging, including high-resolution trigeminal sequences, should be performed as part of the diagnostic work-up. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are drugs of first choice. Lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, botulinum toxin type A and baclofen can be used either alone or as add-on therapy. Surgery should be considered if the pain is poorly controlled or the medical treatments are poorly tolerated. Trigeminal microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in patients with trigeminal neurovascular conflict while neuroablative surgical treatments can be offered if MR imaging does not show any neurovascular contact or where patients are considered too frail for microvascular decompression or do not wish to take the risk.

### The trigeminal nerve: an illustrated review of its imaging anatomy and pathology [^1159q8dY]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The trigeminal nerve is the largest cranial nerve and has both sensory and motor components. Due to its extensive distribution in the head and neck, the nerve or its branches may be involved by a myriad of disease entities. Additionally, the nerve may act as a route of spread in various inflammatory and neoplastic diseases, underlining the need for a thorough understanding of its anatomy. A segmental division of the trigeminal system is preferred when interpreting imaging studies as both the type of lesion and symptoms may vary based on the site of involvement. These segments include the brainstem, cisternal, Meckel's cave, cavernous sinus, and peripheral divisions. In general, dedicated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred to evaluate nerve dysfunction. In select cases, contrast medium administration, heavily T2-weighted sequences, or MR angiography may prove to be diagnostic. This review aims to review the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve briefly, followed by illustrations of various lesions that may present with trigeminal nerve dysfunction.

### Trigeminal neuralgia… [^114tMmyJ]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, unilateral, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. The diagnosis is made using the history alone, based on characteristic features of the pain. Pain occurs in paroxysms, which can last from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks per day. Definition Trigeminal neuralgia is a characteristic pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. The diagnosis is made on the history alone, based on characteristic features of the pain. It occurs in paroxysms, with each lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. The frequency of paroxysms is highly variable, ranging from hundreds of attacks per day to long periods of remission that can last years. Between paroxysms, the person is asymptomatic.

The pain is severe and described as intense, sharp, superficial, stabbing, or shooting, often like an electric shock. It can be triggered by light touch in any area innervated by the trigeminal nerve, including from eating, talking, washing the face, or brushing the teeth. The condition can impair activities of daily living and lead to depression. In some persons, there remains a background pain of lower intensity for 50% of the time. This has been termed atypical trigeminal neuralgia or type 2 trigeminal neuralgia. The International Classification for Headache Disorders refers to this condition as trigeminal neuralgia with concomitant pain. Other causes of facial pain may need to be excluded. In trigeminal neuralgia, the neurologic examination is usually normal but sensory and autonomic symptoms may be reported, and persons with longer histories may demonstrate subtle sensory loss on careful examination.

A similar primary care study carried out in the Netherlands reported an incidence of 12. 6 per 100, 000 person-years when trained neurologists reviewed the data. A population-based study in Germany reported a lifetime prevalence of 0. 3%. Etiology and Risk Factors The cause of trigeminal neuralgia remains unclear, but the most common hypothesis is that of the ignition theory. More peripheral and central mechanisms may be involved, and trigeminal nerve microstructure may be altered. It is more common in persons with multiple sclerosis and stroke.

### Trigeminal neurovascular contact in SUNCT and SUNA: a cross-sectional magnetic resonance study [^113d6jyC]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

SUNCT and SUNA are listed separately in the International Classification of Headache Disorders under the umbrella term 'short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks'. A recent comparison of the clinical characteristics of SUNA and SUNCT phenotype in a large series of patients found no significant differences between the two phenotypes. This suggests that SUNCT and SUNA may represent a single clinical entity. The current study shows similar prevalence and neurovascular contacts characteristics between SUNCT and SUNA, providing structural neuroimaging evidence that these two conditions maybe the same entity, not only on a clinical, but also on a neuroradiological basis.

The study has some limitations, namely the lack of a healthy control group; to obviate this problem and given the prominent unilaterality of these headache disorders, the contralateral side was used as control. The MRI evaluators were not blinded to the diagnosis of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks, albeit that they were blinded to the subclassification of SUNCT or SUNA; this could potentially have induced them to report mostly one NVC per patient. However, a high proportion of bilateral NVC was reported in this series, confirming the accuracy of the MRI evaluations. The strengths of this study include its prospective nature, the large number of patients included for such a rare condition and the presence of two MRI evaluators blinded to the laterality of symptoms.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that NVC is highly prevalent on the symptomatic side in SUNCT and SUNA. In particular, our findings indicated a robust association between NVC with morphological changes and the symptomatic side, suggesting an important aetiological role of this neuroimaging characteristic in SUNCT/SUNA, similarly to trigeminal neuralgia. Ultimately, long-term evidence of headache freedom after trigeminal microvascular decompression would confirm the clinical value of our findings. The study also demonstrated the absence of any significant radiological differences between SUNCT and SUNA. These findings, along with the absence of clinical differences, support the notion that SUNCT and SUNA may be the same clinical entity and that their separation should be abandoned.

### Trigeminal neurovascular contact in SUNCT and SUNA: a cross-sectional magnetic resonance study [^116uKfgq]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first prospective, blinded MRI study, conducted in the largest cohort of consecutive radiologically evaluated SUNCT and SUNA patients, assessing the significance of trigeminal NVC. The findings demonstrate that trigeminal NVC is a highly prevalent neuroanatomical finding ipsilateral to the side of the pain in SUNCT and SUNA. Furthermore, other factors significantly more prevalent on the symptomatic side include severe degree of NVC, arterial conflict, NVC with the proximal segment of the trigeminal sensory root and NVC with the superior aspect of the nerve. There were no significant differences between SUNCT and SUNA in any of these MRI findings. Among these radiological outcomes, NVC with morphological changes was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of the symptomatic side in SUNCT and SUNA. This finding is likely to explain the high prevalence of arterial NVC with morphological changes, the proximal site and superior point of contact found on the symptomatic side. A high proportion of superior only, supero-medial and supero-lateral points of contact on both symptomatic and asymptomatic sides in SUNCT/SUNA, was also shown in a recent study, which aimed to assess the relation between the location of vascular compression and the pain distribution in trigeminal neuralgia patients operated with trigeminal microvascular decompression. Most patients in the trigeminal neuralgia study displayed a superior compression (61.7%). In view of the infrequent location of the painful attacks in V1 in trigeminal neuralgia, this and our findings may suggest that a superior trigeminal conflict is a frequent normal neuroanatomical finding. However, in the trigeminal neuralgia study, patients with supero-medial conflict had an OR of 2.7 (95% CI: 1.66–4.41) of manifesting pain in V1 and inferior compression was more likely to manifest with V3 pain (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.21–5.45), supporting the role of the point of conflict and pain in trigeminal neuralgia and indicating the need of evaluating this association in SUNCT/SUNA as well.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) research priorities emphasize that the efficacy of new drugs and, in particular, surgical interventions, needs to be determined in well- designed RCTs, and that randomized treatment allocation and independent outcome assessment would go a long way to establish the efficacy of the surgical techniques. Surgical comparison is proposed to be answered with a prospective study comparing long- term outcomes in patients with TN undergoing microvascular decompression with and without neurovascular contact identified on preoperative high-resolution MRI. The optimal timing of surgical referral remains a crucial question, including the clinical uncertainties "How many different drugs should be tried before referring a patient for surgery?" and "What is the likelihood that a patient with TN failing OXC or CBZ will respond to alternative drugs?", which could be answered by a large prospective cohort survey of patients with TN treated in a standardized, stepwise fashion.

Prognosis

TN is characterised by recurrences and remissions. Many people have periods of remission with no pain lasting months or years but in many, TN becomes more severe and less responsive to treatment over time, despite increasing pharmacological intervention. Most patients with TN are initially managed medically, and at our tertiary referral centre approximately 50% eventually have a surgical procedure.

2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition

Both patients and healthy controls underwent an MRI session using the same 3T GE MR scanner, equipped with an 8-channel phased-array head coil. High-resolution T1-weighted FSPGR anatomical images (voxel size = 0.94 × 0.94 × 1 mm 3, matrix = 256 × 256, repetition time = 12 ms, echo time = 5.1 ms, inversion time = 300 ms, flip angle = 20°, and field of view = 24 cm) and diffusion-weighted images (60 directions, spin echo EPI sequence, 1 B 0, b = 1000 s/mm 2, 1 excitation, ASSET, voxel size = 0.94 × 0.94 × 3 mm 3, matrix = 256 × 256, repetition time = 12,000 ms, echo time = 86.4 ms, flip angle = 90°, and field of view = 24 cm) were collected. For the patients, T1-weighted FLAIR images (voxel size = 0.43 × 0.43 × 3 mm 3, matrix = 512 × 512, repetition time = 2367 ms, echo time = 13 ms, inversion time = 860 ms, echo train length = 6, and flip angle = 90°) and T2-weighted FIESTA images (voxel size = 0.39 × 0.39 × 0.80 mm 3, matrix = 512 × 512, repetition time = 4.5 ms, echo time = 2.2 ms, and flip angle = 37°) were also collected. For the CTN and MS-TN group, the pretreatment (surgically naïve) imaging time point was used. For the SPL-TN group, the earliest available imaging time point was used, given their extremely refractory nature and history of having undergone multiple surgical procedures. Of the 11 SPL-TN patients, 2 had surgically naïve DWI scans. This limitation has been previously addressed in our study through additional data analysis and discussion.

2.4. Assessment of neurovascular contact

The presence of neurovascular contact was evaluated for each patient using T2-weighted FIESTA images. Both the affected and unaffected sides of the trigeminal nerves were examined. Two SPL-TN patients with a history of MVD were excluded from this assessment.

### Trigeminal neuralgia secondary to giant virchow-robin spaces: a case report with neuroimaging [^111DonMp]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Virchow-Robin spaces are pial-lined, interstitial, fluid-filled structures that accompany penetrating arteries and arterioles as they enter the cerebral substance. Occasionally they may enlarge and become giant Virchow-Robin spaces (GVRS) and produce mass effect. Various neurological symptoms have been described in association with GVRS, however, trigeminal neuralgia has not yet been reported in this context. We present a case of trigeminal neuralgia secondary to dorsal pontine giant Virchow-Robin spaces (GVRS) and highlight the diagnostic radiologic features. Routine 1.5 T MRI sequences were sufficient to diagnose the GVRS and a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study revealed distortion of the intrinsic trigeminal pathway. This study highlights the utility of routine MRI to study the intrinsic anatomy of the trigeminal pathway in pathological conditions.

MRI Protocol and Definitions

All patients underwent an MRI scan within one month after the first visit. All magnetic resonance (MR) data were acquired using a 3D MRI scanner (Magnetom Spectra, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and a 16-channel head coil. The standard MRI protocol for trigeminal neuralgia at our institution included the conventional images for screening of the whole brain, MR angiography (MRA), and MR cisternography. MRA was acquired using 3D time-of-flight (3D-TOF) MRA with the following parameters: TR/TE 24/3.9 ms, flip angle 18°, field of view (FOV) 160 × 160 mm, matrix 320 × 192, section thickness 0.5 mm, and number of slab 3, which was reconstructed to a voxel size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm. Also, MR cisternography was obtained using 3D constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS) with the following parameters: TR/TE 7.4/3.7 ms, flip angle 50°, FOV 160 × 160 mm, matrix 320 × 320, section thickness 0.5 mm, which was reconstructed to a voxel size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm. These MR sequences were acquired at the level of the root entry zone (REZ) of the trigeminal nerve with a slab thickness of 44 mm.

All 3D-TOF and 3D-CISS were displayed in triplanar views (transverse, coronal, and sagittal views) on the visualization system and evaluated by two experienced oral radiologists (JS, NY), who were blinded to symptom side. NVC was defined as contact between a blood vessel at the REZ and the trigeminal nerve without visible cerebrospinal fluid between the two structures in the triplanar views of 3D-CISS. REZ was defined as < 5 mm from the trigeminal root according to several previous studies. The type of the responsible blood vessel (artery or vein) was evaluated using the triplanar views and memory-in-pixel display of 3D-TOF MRA. If there was disagreement or uncertainty about whether there was a contact, it was considered no NVC in the data analysis. Insets in Figure 1 provide examples of the degree and location of trigeminal NVC.

### Predictability of fused 3D-T2-SPACE and 3D-TOF-MRA images in identifying conflict in trigeminal neuralgia [^111VSdRj]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding the comparison between 1.5-T and 3-T MRI using the same imaging protocol, Leal et al reported that there were no statistically significant differences in the type of offending vessel, in location and severity of compression, except that visualization of the type of venous compression and determination of the exact site of compression around the root were more difficult using 1.5-T MRI.

The degree of compression was classified into three grades depending on whether the trigeminal nerve is simply abused or indented or compressed by surrounding vessels. In the current study, there was an excellent agreement in the diagnosis of compression grade between MRI and MVD (k = 0.82). This is very important because it is possible to predict the outcome after surgery. If there is only a simple contact grade of NVC, the long-term pain relief rate is only about 58%. If there are compression or distortion grades, the pain relief rate is up to 88%. The apparent presence and the degree of NVC are of paramount importance in predicting the probability of long-term pain relief, and therefore in the decision to propose MVD as the first choice of surgical treatment. So the question is which patients will benefit from MVD, which is the role of preoperative MRI. Additionally, the positive predictive value of seeing a grade III conflict on the MRI reached 100% (Figure 2). The most significant errors were undergrading conflicts of grade I or II. Overgrading of NVC represented by MRI simple closeness or contact at surgery was rarer than undergrading of high-grade conflicts. Moreover, multidimensional reconstruction of the nerve might be helpful, especially in identifying indentations or deformations of the nerve and, in that sense differentiating between grade I and grade II.

### Significance of neurovascular contact in classical trigeminal neuralgia [^111RJ4ZF]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Neurovascular contact is considered a frequent cause of classical trigeminal neuralgia and microvascular decompression with transposition of a blood vessel is preferred over other surgical options in medically refractory patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia. However, the prevalence of neurovascular contact has not been investigated in a representative cohort of patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia based in a neurological setting and using high-quality neuroimaging and blinded evaluation. We aimed to investigate whether presence and degree of neurovascular contact are correlated to pain side in classical trigeminal neuralgia. Consecutive classical trigeminal neuralgia patients with unilateral symptoms were referred to 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging and included in a cross-sectional study. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were evaluated blindly and graded according to presence and degree of neurovascular contact. Severe neurovascular contact was defined as displacement or atrophy of the trigeminal nerve. A total of 135 patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia were included. Average age of disease onset was 53.0 years (95% confidence interval mean 40.5–55.5) and current age was 60.1 years (95% % confidence interval mean 57.5–62.7). Eighty-two (61%, 95% confidence interval 52–69%) patients were female. Neurovascular contact was prevalent both on the symptomatic and asymptomatic side [89% versus 78%, P = 0.014, odds ratio = 2.4 (1.2–4.8), P = 0.017], while severe neurovascular contact was highly prevalent on the symptomatic compared to the asymptomatic side [53% versus 13%, P < 0.001, odds ratio = 11.6 (4.7–28.9), P < 0.001]. Severe neurovascular contact was caused by arteries in 98%. We conclude that neurovascular contact causing displacement or atrophy of the trigeminal nerve is highly associated with the symptomatic side in classical trigeminal neuralgia as opposed to neurovascular contact in general. Our findings demonstrate that severe neurovascular contact is involved in the aetiology of classical trigeminal neuralgia and that it is caused by arteries located in the root entry zone.

2.3. Neuroimaging acquisition

As part of our routine clinical imaging protocol, each patient underwent MRI (3T GE) sessions with an 8-channel phased-array head coil to acquire T1-weighted FSPGR anatomical scans (voxel size = 0.94 × 0.94 × 1 mm 3, matrix = 256 × 256, repetition time = 12 ms, echo time = 5.1 ms, inversion time = 300 ms, flip angle = 20°, field of view = 24 cm), T1-weighted FLAIR scans (voxel size = 0.43 × 0.43 × 3 mm 3, matrix = 512 × 512, repetition time = 2367 ms, echo time = 13 ms, inversion time = 860 ms, echo train length = 6, flip angle = 90°), and T2-weighted FIESTA scans (voxel size = 0.39 × 0.39 × 0.80 mm 3, matrix = 512 × 512, repetition time = 4.5 ms, echo time = 2.2 ms, flip angle = 37°). For a subset of patients, diffusion-weighted imaging scans (60 directions, spin echo EPI sequence, 1 B 0, b = 1000 s/mm 2, 1 excitation, ASSET, voxel size = 0.94 × 0.94 × 3 mm 3, matrix = 256 × 256, repetition time = 12,000 ms, echo time = 86.4 ms, flip angle = 90°, field of view = 24 cm) were also acquired. Each healthy control participant underwent an MRI session using the same scanner, to acquire a T1-weighted FSPGR anatomical scan and a diffusion-weighted imaging scan with the same parameters as described above.

### Is preoperative high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging accurate in predicting neurovascular compression in patients with trigeminal neuralgia? A single-blind study [^117GSECa]. Neurosurgical Review (2005). Low credibility.

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) using three-dimensional fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (3D-FIESTA) and double-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional fast spoiled gradient echo (3D-FSPGR) sequences is considered to be a useful tool in detecting neurovascular compression in patients with trigeminal neuralgia. The purpose of this study was to analyze the accuracy and preoperative diagnostic value of these high-resolution imaging techniques in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, in a single-blind study. The preoperative MRI images of 21 consecutive patients were matched to one neuroradiologist, who was blind as to which side exhibited the symptoms. The images and post-processing multiplanar reconstructions were compared with the video-documented operative observations. HR-MRI using only 3D-FSPGR sequences demonstrated neurovascular compression in accordance with the intraoperative finding in 11 patients (52.4%). In the subgroup where, additionally, 3D-FIESTA sequences were available, neurovascular compression was in accordance with the intraoperative finding in 71.4% (n = 7). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging using double-dose contrast-enhanced 3D-FSPGR and 3D-FIESTA sequences is currently not sufficient enough to make an accurate prediction of neurovascular compression in a single-blind setting. These 3D imaging techniques currently provide only limited information, and one should consider their use carefully when identifying patients with trigeminal neuralgia from operation until image quality is improved by superior image resolution that can accurately discriminate vessels surrounding the trigeminal root entry zone.

### Trigeminal neuralgia occurs and recurs in the absence of neurovascular compression [^113x77e8]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve is the most common factor associated with the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Microvascular decompression (MVD) has proven to be the most successful and durable surgical approach for this disorder. However, not all patients with TN manifest unequivocal neurovascular compression (NVC). Furthermore, over time patients with an initially successful MVD manifest a relentless rate of TN recurrence.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective review of cases of TN Type 1 (TN1) or Type 2 (TN2) involving patients 18 years or older who underwent evaluation (and surgery when indicated) at Oregon Health & Science University between July 2006 and February 2013. Surgical and imaging findings were correlated.

Results

The review identified a total of 257 patients with TN (219 with TN1 and 38 with TN2) who underwent high-resolution MRI and MR angiography with 3D reconstruction of combined images using OsiriX. Imaging data revealed that the occurrence of TN1 and TN2 without NVC was 28.8% and 18.4%, respectively. A subgroup of 184 patients underwent surgical exploration. Imaging findings were highly correlated with surgical findings, with a sensitivity of 96% for TN1 and TN2 and a specificity of 90% for TN1 and 66% for TN2.

Conclusions

Magnetic resonance imaging detects NVC with a high degree of sensitivity. However, despite a diagnosis of TN1 or TN2, a significant number of patients have no NVC. Trigeminal neuralgia clearly occurs and recurs in the absence of NVC.

### Differences in the clinical characteristics of persistent idiopathic facial pain (atypical odontalgia) patients with or without neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve [^115oKSCU]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) is the unexplained pain along the territory of the trigeminal nerve, including nonorganic tooth pain called atypical odontalgia (AO). Though PIFP is debilitating to patients' livelihood and well-being, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Although neurovascular compression (NVC) of the trigeminal nerve is known to be associated with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), the relationship between NVC and other orofacial pains has not been fully elucidated.

Methods

In this study, we investigated the differences in the characteristics of PIFP (primarily AO) patients in the presence or absence of NVC. A retrospective analysis was performed on data from 121 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with unilateral PIFP according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-3 and underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans of the head.

Results

In the group without NVC, characteristic findings were significant for psychiatric morbidity, somatization, and pain disability, when compared with the group with NVC. Furthermore, the group without NVC exhibited significant headache, noncardiac chest pain, shortness of breath, and pain catastrophizing.

Conclusions

These results suggest that PIFP patients can be divided into two groups: one consistent with a neuropathic pain phenotype when NVC is present and a functional somatic symptom phenotype when presenting without NVC. Our findings may enable a more precise understanding of pathophysiology of PIFP and lead to better treatment strategies.

### Familial trigeminal neuralgia-a systematic clinical study with a genomic screen of the neuronal electrogenisome [^112bZVcw]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Focusing on the electrogenisome, we identified rare variants in 36 genes in the 11 cases of familial TN. However, future studies, assessing a wider array of genes and testing these variants in wider samples of participants, including healthy family members and unrelated controls are needed. Given the plausible multifactorial and polygenic origin of TN, our genetic analysis provides exploratory information, paving the way to future studies which can examine a larger number of genes in a larger number of patients and controls.

The MRI investigations in the affected relatives used heterogeneous protocols and did not allow definitive assessment of neurovascular conflict. In particular, we did not have the opportunity to revise MRI images for assessment of the presence of possible trigeminal root morphological changes at the site of conflict. Therefore, we could not verify whether our patients and the affected relatives suffered from the same type of TN (classical or idiopathic). Nevertheless, given the hypothesis of a multifactorial pathogenesis of TN, the presence of a conflict with morphological abnormalities might not play a crucial role in these families. The concurrent presence of familial risk factors may increase the susceptibility of the trigeminal root or cell body to ectopic excitation and high frequency discharge generation.

### Imaging the trigeminal nerve [^116bu3Lg]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Of all cranial nerves, the trigeminal nerve is the largest and the most widely distributed in the supra-hyoid neck. It provides sensory input from the face and motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. In order to adequately image the full course of the trigeminal nerve and its main branches a detailed knowledge of neuroanatomy and imaging technique is required. Although the main trunk of the trigeminal nerve is consistently seen on conventional brain studies, high-resolution tailored imaging is mandatory to depict smaller nerve branches and subtle pathologic processes. Increasing developments in imaging technique made possible isotropic sub-milimetric images and curved reconstructions of cranial nerves and their branches and led to an increasing recognition of symptomatic trigeminal neuropathies. Whereas MRI has a higher diagnostic yield in patients with trigeminal neuropathy, CT is still required to demonstrate the bony anatomy of the skull base and is the modality of choice in the context of traumatic injury to the nerve. Imaging of the trigeminal nerve is particularly cumbersome as its long course from the brainstem nuclei to the peripheral branches and its rich anastomotic network impede, in most cases, a topographic approach. Therefore, except in cases of classic trigeminal neuralgia, in which imaging studies can be tailored to the root entry zone, the full course of the trigeminal nerve has to be imaged. This article provides an update in the most recent advances on MR imaging technique and a segmental imaging approach to the most common pathologic processes affecting the trigeminal nerve.

### Preoperative evaluation of neurovascular relationship in primary trigeminal neuralgia (PTN) by magnetic resonance virtual endoscopy (MRVE) combined with 3D-FIESTA-C and 3D-TOF-MRA [^111TdNGD]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

MVD is regarded as the most effective treatment strategy for trigeminal neuralgia caused by NVC. Compared to other ablative surgical methods, MVD achieves immediate pain relief rates ranging from 87% to 98%, with 1-year pain-free rates reaching 80% and 8–10 year pain-free rates ranging from 58% to 68%. Even in elderly patients, MVD is equally safe and effective. However, MVD surgery involves further exploration of the cranial cavity, thereby carrying certain surgical risks and complications. Enhancing treatment efficacy and reducing complication rates have become significant challenges for clinical neurosurgeons. Various factors influence the outcomes of MVD surgery, with preoperative identification of responsible vessels and determination of the relationship between nerves and vessels crucial for surgical success.

In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been employed for preoperative detection of NVC in trigeminal neuralgia patients. Conventional MRI, due to its low resolution, has been disappointing in assessing the relationship between the trigeminal nerve and adjacent vessels. With rapid advancements in MR technology, high-resolution imaging sequences, particularly three-dimensional high-resolution T2-weighted imaging, play a crucial role in excluding secondary etiologies such as tumors, inflammation, and demyelination-induced spasms, and in identifying and evaluating NVC. In this study, we used 3D-FIESTA-c and 3D-TOF-MRA imaging for preoperative detection of NVC in trigeminal neuralgia patients. The 3D-FIESTA-c utilizes the effects of heavy T2-weighted imaging to highlight the signal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), achieving a similar effect to "ventriculography". In 3D-FIESTA-c imaging, arteries, veins, and nerves all appear as low signals, while surrounding CSF appears as high signal. With the use of refocused gradient echo pulses, the 3D-FIESTA-c demonstrates high contrast and good spatial resolution in depicting small structures around CSF, providing detailed visualization of the boundaries between CSF and nerves, vessels, and dura mater. However, a major limitation of this sequence is the low signal of both vessels and nerves, leading to unclear signal contrast between them. This restriction hampers the detection and differentiation of NVC, particularly when responsible vessels overlap closely with the trigeminal nerve, and when there is minimal or no CSF between them, resulting in some false-positive or false-negative results. Additionally, a significant drawback of 3D-FIESTA-c is its inability to differentiate between arteries and veins.3D-TOF-MRA is a flow-enhanced imaging technique that selectively images rapidly flowing vessels. It serves as an important complement to 3D-FIESTA-c, as it demonstrates fast-flowing small vessels as high signals, with CSF showing low signal, and is able to display high signal small vessels coursing within the low signal CSF background, thus facilitating clear identification of nerves and vessels. However, the 3D-TOF-MRA has limitations in imaging slow-flowing vessels such as veins and tortuous small arteries, especially the commonly implicated responsible vessel, the petrosal vein, in trigeminal neuralgia. In such cases, combining both sequences compensates for the limitations of each, enabling better tracking of the relationship between nerves and vessels. Muller et alreported that using 3D-FIESTA combined with TOF-MRA allows visualization of the trigeminal nerve, optimizing the identification of NVC and potentially providing more reliable differentiation between veins and arteries. Wei et alreported that the accuracy of diagnosing neurovascular compression using a combination of 3D-TOF-MRA and 3D-FIESTA significantly improves compared to using either sequence alone. Although the combination of these two sequences can compensate for some of their respective shortcomings, both display two-dimensional images, making it difficult to dynamically visualize the spatial anatomy of the cerebellopontine angle region and to display the spatial relationship between nerves and vessels from multiple angles and perspectives, especially with lower accuracy in displaying venous vessels or unknown small vessels, posing challenges for preoperative anatomical localization in neurosurgical MVD. In this study, the accuracy of diagnosing responsible vessels using a combination of 3D-TOF-MRA and 3D-FIESTA-c was 86.25%, with accuracies of 99.38% for evaluating single arterial branches and 80.0% for multiple arterial branches, but only 52.73% accuracy for evaluating responsible veins with or without other vessels. It is evident that while 3D-FIESTA-c combined with 3D-TOF-MRA effectively displays responsible arterial vessels, more advanced imaging techniques are required for cases where responsible vessels are veins.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: a practical guide [^116Ho1Zg]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Recent advances in TN have led to an improvement in its classification on the basis of the neuroimaging findings. Better understanding and description of other neuralgiform disorders such as SUNCT and SUNA have made the differential diagnosis clearer. Improved care pathways involving multidisciplinary teams and potentially new medications is resulting in improved outcomes for patients with TN.

Key points

Trigeminal neuralgia is currently classified into three subgroups: idiopathic, classical and secondary, based on imaging findings; MR brain imaging with trigeminal sequences is therefore essential in the diagnostic work-up.
An accurate diagnosis is crucial because the clinical management differs among the various forms of facial pain.
Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine remain the medications of choice; lamotrigine, gabapentin, pregabalin, botulinum toxin type A and baclofen can be used as second-line treatments in monotherapy or polytherapy.
In pharmaco-resistant cases, trigeminal microvascular decompression is the first-line surgery in patients with classical trigeminal neuralgia, whereas neuroablative surgical treatments and microvascular decompression can be considered in idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.
Pharmaco-resistant cases as well as cases where diagnosis is unclear should be referred to multidisciplinary facial pain teams led by neurologists specialising in headache disorders, where dedicated teams may confirm the diagnosis and offer advanced treatments.

Top a voxel-based analysis (see for methods) of the MRI scans in 50 patients with MS and trigeminal neuralgia showed that the area of maximal probability of lesion (red = p < 0.0001) is located along the intrapontine course of the trigeminal primary afferents. The colored area of high probability of lesion is displayed at its proper location on the relevant section of a stereotactic atlas to show the corresponding anatomical structures. Mid T2-weighted MRI image showing an area of demyelination on the intrapontine course of trigeminal primary afferents in a patient with trigeminal neuralgia associated with MS. In this representative patient, MS was disclosed by the onset of right trigeminal neuralgia at the age of 49 years. Bottom MRA image showing a cerebellar artery that distorts the right trigeminal root at its entrance into the pons, in the same subject as above. Mid and bottom MRI images have been flipped vertically and horizontally to correspond to the atlas image on top. Although in most patients with MS and trigeminal neuralgia, MRI shows a plaque in the area shown in the top panel, in several it does not, whereas it often discloses (when looked for) a neurovascular contact. MS patients (regardless of the presence of a plaque on MRI) usually have a typical trigeminal neuralgia indistinguishable from the classic neuralgia attributed to neurovascular contact, but several characteristics differentiate them from both MS patients without trigeminal neuralgia and patients with classic trigeminal neuralgia (see text). We propose that in many patients two mechanisms contribute to the development of trigeminal neuralgia in MS: intra-axial inflammatory demyelination plus extra-axial mechanical demyelination both affecting the same nerve fibers in the root entry zone (red dots)

### Five-year prospective outcomes of medical management and microvascular decompression in trigeminal neuralgia [^115y1GNg]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

MRI protocol and definitions

Preoperative 3.0 T MRI was performed using a standardized protocol including whole-brain T2-weighted turbo spin-echo, thin-section T2-weighted GRASE sequences of the brainstem/posterior fossa, 3D balanced fast field echo (BFFE), and time-of-flight MR angiography (s3DI MC HR). Multiplanar reconstructions visualized the cisternal trigeminal nerve and NVC in axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. All scans were reviewed by a neuroradiologist (E.S. or F.W.), blinded to the symptomatic side, using predefined criteria. NVC was defined as vessel contact with the trigeminal nerve without visible cerebrospinal fluid. It was graded as simple contact or contact with morphological changes (i.e. compression, displacement, distortion, indentation, and/or atrophy), and further classified by vessel type (artery, vein, or mixed) and location (root entry zone or peripheral).

Surgical technique

MVD was performed via a modified Jannetta retrosigmoid approach. Arterial compressions were treated by transposing the vessel and fixing it to the tentorium with glue and Teflon, or by interposing Teflon between the nerve and vessel when transposition was not possible. Venous compressions were often left untouched if there was an obvious arterial NVC. In some cases, veins were transposed or coagulated and divided. Perioperative findings were recorded in a standardized scheme by the treating neurosurgeon (P.R, J.S, or J.B) from the Department of Neurosurgery, Copenhagen University Hospital — Rigshospitalet. Further technical details have been described previously.

Outcome measures

Surgical and medical outcomes were assessed via self-report and independently evaluated by a physician from the research unit, which is based at the DHC but operates separately from the outpatient clinic to ensure impartiality. The primary outcome at 5-year follow-up was categorized into four predefined groups: pain-free without medication (excellent outcome), pain-free with medication, continued pain without medication, and continued pain with medication.

Secondary outcomes included predictors of the primary outcome, median pain reduction, ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% pain reduction, treatment satisfaction, depressive symptoms, surgical complications, medical treatment and side effects, and sex-stratified analyses of medication use and treatment response.

Introduction Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) is a poorly understood chronic orofacial pain disorder and a differential diagnosis to trigeminal neuralgia. To address the lack of systematic studies in PIFP we here report clinical characteristics and neuroimaging findings in PIFP. Methods Data collection was prospective and standardized in consecutive PIFP patients. All patients underwent 3.0 MRI. Results In a cohort of 53 PIFP patients, the average age of onset was 44.1 years. PIFP was found in more women 40 (75%) than men 13 (25%), p < 0.001. There was a high prevalence of bilateral pain 7 (13%), hypoesthesia 23 (48%), depression 16 (30%) and other chronic pain conditions 17 (32%) and a low prevalence of stabbing pain 21 (40%), touch-evoked pain 14 (26%) and remission periods 10 (19%). The odds ratio between neurovascular contact and the painful side was 1.4 (95% Cl 0.4–4.4, p = 0.565) and the odds ratio between neurovascular contact with displacement of the trigeminal nerve and the painful side was 0.2 (95% Cl 0.0–2.1, p = 0.195). Conclusion PIFP is separated from trigeminal neuralgia both with respect to the clinical characteristics and neuroimaging findings, as NVC was not associated to PIFP.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — diagnostic workflow context: Based upon cost, local expertise and availability, and patient preferences, obtaining trigeminal reflex testing or head imaging are both reasonable next steps. Because of a high diagnostic accuracy, MRI might reasonably be foregone in a patient with normal trigeminal reflexes.

Trigeminal neuralgia definition and incidence — population context: The International Association for the Study of Pain defines TN as sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent episodes of pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The annual incidence of TN is 4 to 5 in 100,000. The latest classification of the International Headache Society distinguishes between classic and symptomatic TN, and classic TN includes all cases without an established etiology (i.e., idiopathic), as well as those with potential vascular compression of the fifth cranial nerve.

### AAN-EFNS guidelines on trigeminal neuralgia management [^112b9EK7]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Several issues regarding diagnosis, pharmacological treatment, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) are still unsettled. The American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies launched a joint Task Force to prepare general guidelines for the management of this condition. After systematic review of the literature the Task Force came to a series of evidence-based recommendations. In patients with TN MRI may be considered to identify patients with structural causes. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes should be considered useful to disclose symptomatic TN, whereas younger age of onset, involvement of the first division, unresponsiveness to treatment and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials are not useful in distinguishing symptomatic from classic TN. Carbamazepine (stronger evidence) or oxcarbazepine (better tolerability) should be offered as first-line treatment for pain control. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy early surgical therapy may be considered. Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife and microvascular decompression may be considered. Microvascular decompression may be considered over other surgical techniques to provide the longest duration of pain freedom. The role of surgery versus pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with multiple sclerosis remains uncertain.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: rapid evidence review [^116msAo9]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a chronic neuropathic pain condition that causes sudden, brief episodes of electric shock-like, lancinating pain in one or more trigeminal nerve distributions. Facial spasms may occur during intense flare-ups. Trigger zones are small areas where minimal stimulation may precipitate a painful flare-up. Painful episodes of TN are often precipitated by seemingly benign stimuli, such as talking, chewing, light touch, or even a breeze across a trigger zone. Nerve root contact, compression, and subsequent demyelination are implicated as the central underlying pathophysiology. The average age of onset is 50 to 60 years, and incidence increases with age. Diagnosis is based on International Headache Society clinical criteria distinguishing classic, secondary, and idiopathic TN. Classic TN is caused by direct neurovascular compromise due to anatomic compression. Secondary TN is caused by another condition such as multiple sclerosis or a tumor. Idiopathic TN has no identifiable etiology. Examination findings typically are normal between painful episodes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast media is recommended for all patients with suspected TN to rule out key differential diagnoses, such as a tumor, and to determine surgical candidacy. The International Headache Society guidelines encourage tailored treatment based on TN type and etiology. Carbamazepine is the initial drug of choice, and 75% of patients with TN achieve initial symptom control with pharmacotherapy. Refractory TN or intolerable adverse drug effects should prompt a trial of adjunctive drugs and referral for surgical evaluation. Microvascular decompression is more effective in improving or alleviating symptoms of TN than other surgical options.

### Trigeminal neuralgia associated with a solitary pontine lesion: clinical and neuroimaging definition of a new syndrome [^112756K1]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is the most common type of chronic neuropathic facial pain, characterized by intermittent attacks of severe, electric shock-like unilateral pain along the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches. It has been described as one of the most excruciating pains a human can suffer, causing significant distress and deterioration in quality of life. Although not essential to TN pathophysiology, a well-established etiological factor is neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone, where focal demyelination is believed to occur at the point of contact. Trigeminal neuralgia can also manifest secondary to multiple sclerosis (MS-TN), where demyelinating brainstem plaques are believed to be responsible for the paroxysmal, lancinating pain.

Advances in neuroimaging techniques have identified key neuroanatomical signatures that distinguish TN. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown white-matter microstructural abnormalities at the trigeminal root entry zone characterized by lower fractional anisotropy (FA), and higher mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). These metrics derived from DTI have been associated with pathophysiological mechanisms: FA is highly sensitive to overall white-matter microstructural changes, while MD, RD, and AD can provide a specific assessment of neuroinflammation, myelination, and axonal integrity, respectively. In addition, multitensor DTI tractography has revealed differences in brainstem trigeminal fiber microstructure between patients with TN and MS-TN.

Towards our goal to further understand TN, we applied these advanced neuroimaging techniques to study a new, unique group of patients with TN who present with an unusual condition, namely a single brainstem lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of these patients does not identify any other brain lesions or atrophy, and patients do not fulfill criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The lesions seem to be distributed along the trigeminal nerve pathway; however, the exact location of the lesions with respect to the trigeminal nucleus is unknown. The lesions also appear to be consistent with demyelination, but conventional MRI demonstrates their significant differences from MS plaques, in that they appear much more distinct. On top of this, from a clinical perspective, these patients seem to respond poorly to surgical treatment. Although single cases or very small case series of TN patients with brainstem lesions exist in the literature, this unique entity has not been defined as a syndrome and studied extensively.

### A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial (vestparoxy) of the treatment of vestibular paroxysmia with oxcarbazepine [^111KGwRv]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vestibular paroxysmia (VP) is characterized by recurrent, brief, mono- or oligosymptomatic attacks of vertigo which occur spontaneously or are rarely triggered by a provoking factor, most commonly a head or body turn. The condition was first described in 1975 along the lines of trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm, and was termed "disabling positional vertigo". The initial nomenclature reflects the fact that affected patients are often severely disabled and cannot work or participate in daily activities. Since then some case reports and case series on the condition have been published, e.g. but no randomized controlled trials have been carried out.

The clinical diagnostic criteria of VP were first provided by Brandt and Dieterich and then refined by Hüfner. Although the disease is recognized as a diagnosis in most major dizziness centers (see for details) the absence of a gold standard diagnostic test has evidently hindered treatment studies on the topic. Most available clinical studies focus on the ancillary investigations, namely imaging data. It is now widely accepted that neuro-vascular cross compression (NVCC) of the eighth nerve leading to demyelination with ephaptic depolarization is the most probable underlying pathomechanism, although the finding of asymptomatic NVCC has been reported. NVCC of the eighth nerve could be detected in all VP patients, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 65% for the diagnosis of VP by MRI. The vessels are mainly arteries, most often the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). No structural lesions of the vestibular nerve were identified in 7 T MRI despite the presence of NVCC. Audiovestibular testing has shown heterogeneous results ranging from normal results to unilateral deficits and coinstantaneous signs of reduced and increased function within the same nerve.

### MRI of the trigeminal nerve in patients with trigeminal neuralgia secondary to vascular compression [^117WxoD8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Trigeminal neuralgia is a debilitating facial pain disorder, frequently caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve. Vascular compression that results in trigeminal neuralgia occurs along the cisternal segment of the nerve.

Conclusion

Imaging combined with clinical information is critical to correctly identify patients who are candidates for microvascular decompression. The purpose of this article is to review trigeminal nerve anatomy and to provide strategies for radiologists to recognize important MRI findings in patients with trigeminal neuralgia.

### Long-term effectiveness of early versus late microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia secondary to arterial compression [^112ECwWZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a facial pain syndrome characterized by severe, brief, shock‐like paroxysms even triggered by innocuous stimuli. The European Academy of Neurology, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), and the International Headache Society (IHS) classify TN as classical, idiopathic, and secondary. The diagnosis of classical trigeminal neuralgia (cTN) now requires MRI or intraoperative evidence of "neurovascular compression (NVC) (i.e. arterial or venous), with morphological changes (i.e. atrophy or displacement) in the trigeminal root". The diagnosis of idiopathic TN (iTN) requires the same symptoms of cTN, but iTN is distinguished from cTN by MRI, which confirms an absence of morphological changes in the trigeminal root or complete absence of NVC. The refinement of high resolution MRI protocols tailored to delineate vascular contact, compression, and distortion of the trigeminal nerve as well as atrophy of the trigeminal nerve has facilitated this further subclassification.

Studies concerning the duration of TN symptoms prior to initial microvascular decompression (MVD) and its relationship to long‐term pain freedom have provided contradictory data. These studies analyzed the relationship between symptom duration and long‐term pain freedom prior to the widespread use of high‐resolution MRI, which is now indicated to influence the outcome of MVD. Many patients suffering from cTN realize overall better outcomes when treated with an MVD rather than medical therapies. Patients are often able to taper all prior TN medications (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) avoiding or eliminating significant side effects. A recent prospective study analyzing outcomes after initial MVD for patients with cTN and iTN resulted in 80% and 53% of patients remaining pain free without medication at 24 months, respectively. This study reports the relationship between pre‐operative symptom duration and long‐term outcome after MVD in patients with cTN and iTN who underwent preoperative high‐resolution MRI to detect NVC.

Future Considerations

To date, trigeminal neuralgia is a clinical diagnosis that does not require imaging or laboratory correlation, though imaging may be helpful for excluding tumor and other diseases related to trigeminal pain. Although the majority of patients present with Type I TN involving neurovascular compression, a substantial number of patients nonetheless have Type II TN pain, or have Type I TN pain but without evidence of nerve compression. Why these patients experience pain, and the molecular mechanisms that distinguish Type I TN pain from Type II TN pain, still remains to be elucidated. Whether these distinct mechanisms arise from differential stimuli distal to the root entry zone, or whether the difference lies in central mechanisms of pain interpretation is also unknown. The fact that a subset of patients with multiple sclerosis uniformly derives less benefit from all medical and surgical interventions implies that neuroinflammation may play a role in disease pathogenesis and severity. Further studies will be needed to define the neuronal-glial interface in trigeminal neuralgia, and a more precise mechanistic understanding of TN will hopefully allow for the development of novel and more effective therapeutics.

### Identifying symptomatic trigeminal nerves from MRI in a cohort of trigeminal neuralgia patients using radiomics [^111pjHeu]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a devastating neuropathic condition. This work tests whether radiomics features derived from MRI of the trigeminal nerve can distinguish between TN-afflicted and pain-free nerves.

Methods

3D T1- and T2-weighted 1.5-Tesla MRI volumes were retrospectively acquired for patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery to treat TN. A convolutional U-net deep learning network was used to segment the trigeminal nerves from the pons to the ganglion. A total of 216 radiomics features consisting of image texture, shape, and intensity were extracted from each nerve. Within a cross-validation scheme, a random forest feature selection method was used, and a shallow neural network was trained using the selected variables to differentiate between TN-affected and non-affected nerves. Average performance over the validation sets was measured to estimate generalizability.

Results

A total of 134 patients (i.e., 268 nerves) were included. The top 16 performing features extracted from the masks were selected for the predictive model. The average validation accuracy was 78%. The validation AUC of the model was 0.83, and sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 and 0.76, respectively.

Conclusion

Overall, this work suggests that radiomics features from MR imaging of the trigeminal nerves correlate with the presence of pain from TN.

Investigations

MR of the brain is the gold-standard investigation to exclude secondary causes of TN. If MR is contraindicated, a CT scan of the head, CT cerebral angiogram and trigeminal-evoked potentials and/or neurophysiological recordings of trigeminal reflexes should be used.

Besides excluding secondary TN, neuroimaging is also important for further subclassifying a patient's symptoms into classical and idiopathic TN, so that the classical TN cases can be considered for trigeminal microvascular decompression when appropriate. Detailed trigeminal MR brain scan sequences are pivotal to detecting the presence of a trigeminal neurovascular conflict, the type of vascular structure (artery or vein or both) and the degree of compression. The protocol should use the combination of three high-resolution sequences that include a 3D cisternal fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition, constructive interference in steady state or sampling perfection with application optimised contrasts using different flip angle evolution sequences along with time-of-flight MR-angiography as well as 3D T1-weighted gadolinium sequences.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^111PAhja]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Classical TN.

Classical TN is defined as a specific category of TN in which MRI demonstrates vascular compression with morphologic changes of the trigeminal nerve root (figure 3). Because of its sensitivity to detect pathologic processes involving brainstem and cranial nerves running through the base of the skull, MRI is widely seen as the method of choice to examine the trigeminal nerve and root. MRI may reveal neurovascular contact of the trigeminal nerve root, but the frequency of blood vessel contact with asymptomatic trigeminal nerve roots cautions against the implementation of contact alone as a diagnostic criterion. In a recent meta-analysis of 9 high-quality blinded and controlled studies, neurovascular contact was found in 471 out of 531 symptomatic nerves (89%) and 244 of 681 asymptomatic nerves (36%), indicating high sensitivity but poor specificity. Several authors have instead emphasized the importance of physical impact of the blood vessel on the nerve. Nerve dislocation or atrophy raised the specificity to 97%. Two prospective studies have corroborated these results. Location of the neurovascular contact also appears to be relevant. Compression of the trigeminal nerve root at its entry into the brainstem increased specificity and positive predictive value to 100%, with high interobserver consistency. The degree of morphologic root changes is therapeutically relevant. Long-term outcome after surgical revision of mere neurovascular contact is uncertain compared to the decompression of dislocated, distorted, or flattened nerve roots. Flattening and atrophy appear to be particularly sensitive signs of clinically relevant compression. Advanced MRI techniques further allow for visualization of structural changes within the root that are highly suggestive of physical alteration and provide high predictive value for pain relief after decompression. However, it is important to acknowledge that all cited studies relied on a clinical diagnosis of TN before MRI. MRI is a valuable diagnostic tool only if preceded by an evaluation of symptoms and signs that indicate probable TN.

### Imaging the trigeminal nerve and pons before and after surgical intervention for trigeminal neuralgia [^116MfRsT]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the various imaging changes occurring in the trigeminal nerve and brainstem in patients before or after trigeminal neuralgia surgery.

Methods

During a 7-year period, 275 patients with trigeminal neuralgia underwent high-resolution, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pons during gamma knife radiosurgery. Ninety-seven patients had no previous surgical intervention for trigeminal neuralgia, and 178 patients had undergone one or more previous procedures. Two independent observers, one of whom was blinded to patients' clinical details, reviewed MRI scans retrospectively. The analysis of the independent observers was then correlated with all previous therapeutic interventions.

Results

One hundred one MRI scans demonstrated no radiological changes related to trigeminal neuralgia, and 174 MRI scans exhibited some radiological abnormality. The average axial plane diameter of the nerve for all patients was 4 mm (range, 2–6 mm). In the group that had not undergone previous surgery, 65 patients (67%) exhibited vascular compression. In the 88 patients who had undergone previous microvascular decompression, 21 (24%) had evidence of a pontine infarction. Twenty-six patients experienced facial sensory loss, 22 (88%) of whom had undergone previous surgery with evidence of a pontine infarction (n = 11) or perineural scarring (n = 6).

Conclusion

The majority of patients who had undergone previous trigeminal neuralgia surgery demonstrated readily identifiable abnormalities of the trigeminal nerve or brainstem. The frequency of such changes correlated with the type and number of procedures. Evidence of vascular compression was detected in the majority of patients. Most patients with postoperative facial sensory loss demonstrate changes in the nerve or pons on MR images.

### Microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia: update [^117CDbjC]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A recent Cochrane systematic review of surgical interventions for trigeminal neuralgia found not a single trial of what is becoming the most popular surgical intervention, namely microvascular decompression (MVD). With an increasing number of anticonvulsant drugs it is likely that patients may not be offered a surgical option for management of their trigeminal neuralgia for many years.

Recent Findings

Current studies repeat much of what is already in the literature but there is an increasing appreciation of the value of preoperative imaging and the need to be more precise with the diagnosis. The search for prognosticators for good outcomes continues to dominate the literature.

Summary

Microvascular decompression in correctly diagnosed patients is probably the most effective therapy. However, high-quality prospective studies of MVD in a population that has been well phenotyped and which is assessed pre and postoperatively using psychometrically tested questions, administered at regular intervals by independent observers, are needed to provide clear evidence of its superiority over medical therapies.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Predictors of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) risk among patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN): Younger age and abnormal trigeminal nerve evoked potentials are probably associated with an increased risk of STN, but there is too much overlap in patients with classic TN (CTN) and STN for these predictors to be considered clinically useful. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves probably increases the risk of STN, whereas the absence of these features does not rule out STN. Involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and unresponsiveness to treatment are probably not associated with an increased risk of STN.

### Concomitant continuous pain in patients with trigeminal neuralgia is associated with trigeminal nerve root atrophy [^113VSVqH]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia is an exemplary neuropathic pain condition characterized by paroxysmal electric-shock-like pain. However, up to 50% of patients also experiences concomitant continuous pain. In this neuroimaging study, we aimed to identify the specific anatomical features of trigeminal nerve root in patients with concomitant continuous pain.

Methods

We enrolled 73 patients with a definitive diagnosis of classical and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and 40 healthy participants. The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia was independently confirmed by two clinicians. Patients were grouped as patients with purely paroxysmal pain (45 patients) and patients also with concomitant continuous pain (28 patients). All participants underwent a structured clinical examination and a 3T MRI with sequences dedicated to the anatomical study of the trigeminal nerve root, including volumetric study. Images analysis was independently performed by two investigators, blinded to any clinical data.

Results

In most patients with concomitant continuous pain, this type of pain, described as burning, throbbing or aching, manifested at the disease onset. Demographic and clinical variables did not differ between the two groups of patients; the frequency of neurovascular compression and nerve dislocation were similar. Conversely, trigeminal nerve root atrophy was more severe in patients with concomitant continuous pain than in those with purely paroxysmal pain (p = 0.006).

Conclusions

Our clinical and neuroimaging study found that in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, concomitant continuous pain was associated with trigeminal nerve root atrophy, therefore suggesting that this type of pain is likely related to axonal loss and abnormal activity in denervated trigeminal second-order neurons.

### Reliability of MRI for predicting characteristics of neurovascular conflicts in trigeminal neuralgia: implications for surgical decision making [^1128vHFV]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The choice of microvascular decompression (MVD), among the several other surgical options, for treating refractory classical trigeminal neuralgia (TN) relies mostly on preoperative imaging, but the degree of reliability of MRI remains a matter of debate. The authors approached the question of predictability of neurovascular conflict (NVC) in a series of 100 protocolized MRI studies from patients with TN who underwent MVD, by reexamination of MR images, blinded to the clinical data and surgical findings, including the side of the neuralgia.

Methods

Patients included in the study were those who underwent MVD after surgical indication had been determined based on a protocolized imagery workup (3D high-resolution T2-weighted cisternography centered on the trigeminal nerve, 3D time-of-flight angiography, and 3D gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging) performed at our institution. All MR images were blindly reexamined, and neurovascular relationships were described on both sides, noting the existence of compression, vessels involved, situation along the root, and degree of compression. The results of MRI evaluation were then compared with actual surgical findings. The extent of agreement and quality of the prediction were expressed with Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) statistics.

Results

A conflict had actually been found during surgery in 94 of 100 patients. The sensitivity of MRI to detect a conflict was 97% and the specificity was 50%. Vessel type was identified with high reliability (κ = 0.80), while the grade of the conflict and its situation along the root showed poor to average reliability (κ = 0.38 and κ = 0.40, respectively). The area under the ROC curve for predicting the presence of a conflict according to the grades of conflict seen on MRI was 0.93, which is considered very good. The positive predictive value was differentiated according to the grade of conflict, with a very high value for high grades of vascular conflict.

Conclusions

This study shows an overall good reliability of MRI to predict the existence of an NVC. The prediction value is excellent for high grades of compression. Some apparent low-grade compressions on MRI may be revealed as false positives in surgical exploration. This raises the question of what other imaging methods might be used to determine not only the existence of a conflict but also its degree of compression. The degree of compression is of paramount importance to predict the probability of long-term pain relief, and therefore in the decision to propose MVD as the first choice of surgical treatment.

### Alterations of brain structural MRI are associated with outcome of surgical treatment in trigeminal neuralgia [^117FhZS3]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

To assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alterations occurring in patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and to explore the predictive ability of MRI for initial surgical outcome and long-term pain relief/recurrence after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS).

Methods

Thirty patients with idiopathic or classic TN, who underwent GKS and were followed for at least 24 months, were retrospectively included. Pre-treatment structural MRI and pre- and serial, postoperative clinical features were investigated. Fifteen age- and sex-matched healthy controls were also enrolled. Cortical thickness and gray matter (GM) volumes were assessed in TN patients relative to controls, as well as between patient subgroups according to treatment outcomes (initial responders/non-responders, patients with pain recurrence/long-lasting pain relief at the last follow-up). Clinical and MRI predictors of treatment outcomes were explored.

Results

Cortical thinning of temporal, prefrontal, cingulate, somatosensory and occipital areas bilaterally was found in TN patients relative to controls. No cortical thickness and GM volume differences were observed when TN initial responders and non-responders were compared. Patients who experienced TN recurrence after initial pain relief were characterized by thicker parahippocampal and temporal cortices bilaterally and greater volume of right amygdala and hippocampus compared to patients with long-lasting pain relief. In TN patients, disease duration and baseline cortical thinning of right parahippocampal, left fusiform and middle temporal cortices were associated with poor outcome after GKS at the last follow-up (R 2 = 0.57, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The study provides novel insights into structural brain alterations of TN patients, which might contribute to disease development and pain maintenance.

### Differences in the clinical characteristics of persistent idiopathic facial pain (atypical odontalgia) patients with or without neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve [^114fEa4s]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) is the unexplained pain along the territory of the trigeminal nerve, including nonorganic tooth pain called atypical odontalgia (AO). Though PIFP is debilitating to patients' livelihood and well-being, its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Although neurovascular compression (NVC) of the trigeminal nerve is known to be associated with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), the relationship between NVC and other orofacial pains has not been fully elucidated.

Methods

In this study, we investigated the differences in the characteristics of PIFP (primarily AO) patients in the presence or absence of NVC. A retrospective analysis was performed on data from 121 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with unilateral PIFP according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)–3 and underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans of the head.

Results

In the group without NVC, characteristic findings were significant for psychiatric morbidity, somatization, and pain disability, when compared with the group with NVC. Furthermore, the group without NVC exhibited significant headache, noncardiac chest pain, shortness of breath, and pain catastrophizing.

Conclusions

These results suggest that PIFP patients can be divided into two groups: one consistent with a neuropathic pain phenotype when NVC is present and a functional somatic symptom phenotype when presenting without NVC. Our findings may enable a more precise understanding of pathophysiology of PIFP and lead to better treatment strategies.

### Pre-treatment DTI markers: predicting clinical outcomes in microvascular decompression for classic trigeminal neuralgia-a systematic review [^114KBBB7]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe chronic pain condition, typically affecting patients over 50-year-old, caused by the compression of the nerve at the root entry zone (REZ) by blood vessels. While the diagnosis is clinical, advanced imaging like diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is crucial to identify underlying causes and assessing nerve damage. DTI may help develop neuroimaging markers to improve understanding of TN and predict surgical outcomes. The goal of the present systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of DTI and tractography in order to better assess treatment planning and outcome prediction through the analysis of trigeminal nerve alterations.

Methods

The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to compare radiological parameters identified in pre- and post-operative MRI with DTI sequences, including fractional anisotropy (FA), quantity of anisotropy (QA), radial diffusivity (RD), and to correlate these findings with post-operative clinical outcomes. A comprehensive search of the PubMed and Scopus databases was carried out for studies published between April 2010 and January 2024.

Results

This review included 11 studies and 603 patients. Of the 363 patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), 193 underwent microvascular decompression (MVD), with 72.5% showing clinical improvement and 27.5% not improving, possibly due to chronic nerve damage. Four studies assessed radiological parameters before and after MVD, while two focused only on post-MVD data. The mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in affected nerves increased from 0.328 before MVD to 0.382 afterward. Five studies did not report postoperative outcomes, just comparing radiological parameters in TN patients versus healthy controls.

Conclusions

Recent studies show that MRI-DTI parameters, including FA, RD, and QA, are useful for diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia and predicting treatment outcomes. Lower FA and higher RD values indicate better results after surgery. More research is mandatory to guide treatment decisions and enhance patients' care.

### Practice parameter: the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the European Federation of Neurological Societies [^115ZxHJz]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cause of facial pain.

Purpose

To answer the following questions: 1) In patients with TN, how often does routine neuroimaging (CT, MRI) identify a cause? 2) Which features identify patients at increased risk for symptomatic TN (STN; i.e., a structural cause such as a tumor)? 3) Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify patients with neurovascular compression? 4) Which drugs effectively treat classic and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia? 5) When should surgery be offered? 6) Which surgical technique gives the longest pain-free period with the fewest complications and good quality of life?

Methods

Systematic review of the literature by a panel of experts.

Conclusions

In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of TN in patients with MS remains uncertain.

### Trigeminal nerve compression without trigeminal neuralgia: intraoperative vs imaging evidence [^113Hdm76]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

While high-resolution imaging is increasingly used in guiding decisions about surgical interventions for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, direct assessment of the extent of vascular contact of the trigeminal nerve is still considered the gold standard for the determination of whether nerve decompression is warranted.

Objective

To compare intraoperative and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the prevalence and severity of vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve in patients without classical trigeminal neuralgia.

Methods

We prospectively recruited 27 patients without facial pain who were undergoing microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm and had undergone high-resolution preoperative MRI. Neurovascular contact/compression (NVC/C) by artery or vein was assessed both intraoperatively and by MRI, and was stratified into 3 types: simple contact, compression (indentation of the surface of the nerve), and deformity (deviation or distortion of the nerve).

Results

Intraoperative evidence of NVC/C was detected in 23 patients. MRI evidence of NVC/C was detected in 18 patients, all of whom had intraoperative evidence of NVC/C. Thus, there were 5, or 28% more patients in whom NVC/C was detected intraoperatively than with MRI (Kappa = 0.52); contact was observed in 4 of these patients and compression in 1 patient. In patients where NVC/C was observed by both methods, there was agreement regarding the severity of contact/compression in 83% (15/18) of patients (Kappa = 0.47). No patients exhibited deformity of the nerve by imaging or intraoperatively.

Conclusion

There was moderate agreement between imaging and operative findings with respect to both the presence and severity of NVC/C.

### Volumetric measurement of the pontomesencephalic cistern in patients with trigeminal neuralgia and healthy controls [^111s6yNj]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Most so-called idiopathic trigeminal neuralgias (TN) are caused by neurovascular compression. Does the size of the cerebellopontine cistern play a role in favoring a neurovascular conflict? The aim of this prospective study was to measure the volume of the parapontine cistern in patients with idiopathic TN and to perform a comparison with healthy controls.

Methods

In 25 patients with unilateral idiopathic TN and 17 healthy participants, high-resolution 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging scans of the parapontine region and the trigeminal nerve were performed. A coronal T2-weighted, true fast imaging steady-state precession sequence with a slice thickness of 0.9 mm was used to define the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid space from the trigeminal root entry zone to Meckel's cave. The volume of the pontomesencephalic cistern was calculated using a standardized method.

Results

The mean difference of the volume of the affected and opposite side was 13% in patients with TN. In all patients, a significantly smaller volume of the cistern was found on the affected side (P < 0.01). Healthy controls showed a mean volumetric side difference of 9%, which was not significant (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans are able to demonstrate significant volumetric differences of the pontomesencephalic cistern in patients with unilateral TN. A smaller cistern may be correlated with the occurrence of a neurovascular compression, and these findings support the neurovascular compression theory in idiopathic TN.

Surgery timing in TN — patient surveys and evidence strength. There are no studies specifically addressing when to offer surgery; two Class IV surveys of patients who had already undergone surgery found that the majority would have preferred to have had surgery earlier, and the conclusion is that there is insufficient evidence to allow strong inferences on when surgery should be offered to patients with TN.

Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) — diagnostic and treatment recommendations: For patients with TN, routine imaging may be considered to identify STN (Level C). The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves should be considered useful to identify patients with STN; however, because of poor specificity, the absence of these features is not useful for excluding STN (Level B). Measuring trigeminal reflexes in a qualified electrophysiologic laboratory should be considered useful for distinguishing STN from CTN (Level B). Younger age at onset, involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve, unresponsiveness to treatment, and abnormal trigeminal evoked potentials should be disregarded as useful for accurately identifying patients with STN (Level B). To control pain in patients with TN: carbamazepine should be offered (Level A), oxcarbazepine should be considered (Level B), baclofen, lamotrigine, and pimozide may be considered (Level C), and topical ophthalmic anesthesia should not be considered (Level B). For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy: early surgical therapy may be considered (Level C), and percutaneous procedures on the Gasserian ganglion, gamma knife, and microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C).

### Idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy with trigeminal mass lesion on MRI: neoplasm or not? [^1172ECY1]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the present study was to investigate clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of idiopathic trigeminal neuropathy with transient MR abnormalities mimicking a neoplasm (ITNmn). We retrospectively evaluated clinical and MRI features in two cases of ITNmn seen in our institution in comparison with those of previously reported five cases. The most common symptom was altered facial sensation and numbness limited to one or more trigeminal nerve divisions (100%). ITNmn commonly affected not only the second and third divisions (86% and 57%, respectively) but also the first division (71%). The most common findings on MRI were enlargement and gadolinium enhancement of the trigeminal nerve, which were similar to those seen in neoplasms (100%). The abnormalities spontaneously regressed in all five evaluable cases. ITNmn should be added in the differential diagnosis of non-specific mass-like lesions in trigeminal neuropathy and be observed carefully without surgical treatment.

3D constructive interference in steady state MRI shows axial sections at the level of trigeminal nerve root entry into the pons. (A) Bilateral neurovascular contact without morphologic changes of the root in a patient with left trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Nerve (long arrows) and blood vessel (short arrows) appear hypointense surrounded by hyperintense CSF. Contact is seen at the root entry zone as well as mid-cisternal segment. (B, C) Morphologic changes exceeding mere neurovascular contact of the trigeminal nerve root are compatible with the diagnosis of classical TN. (B) Root atrophy in a patient with right TN. (C) Indentation and dislocation of the root in a patient with right TN (short arrow).

Reliable detection of neurovascular compression requires the use of specific imaging techniques with 3D reconstruction. Several methods improve the depiction of the trigeminal nerve root and adjacent blood vessels in the posterior fossa. Typical imaging paradigms include sequences for 3D T2-weighted MRI, e.g. driven equilibrium or constructive interference in steady state, for a detailed examination of cisternal and cavernous nerve segments (figure 3), 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography for the visualization of arteries, and 3D T1-weighted MRI with gadolinium or phase-contrast MRI for the visualization of veins. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography detect abnormalities of the trigeminal nerve root that normalize following decompression or radiosurgery. DTI may become an essential diagnostic test for TN in the near future. However, so far too few studies have been conducted with sufficient stringency to derive diagnostic criteria with sensitivity/specificity. Most investigations involved group analyses only, and some yielded conflicting results. Pending additional evaluation, these imaging tools may in the future allow predicting the outcome of neurosurgical treatment.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^112fJZyp]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an exemplary condition of neuropathic facial pain. However, formally classifying TN as neuropathic pain based on the grading system of the International Association for the Study of Pain is complicated by the requirement of objective signs confirming an underlying lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. The latest version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders created similar difficulties by abandoning the term symptomatic TN for manifestations caused by major neurologic disease, such as tumors or multiple sclerosis. These diagnostic challenges hinder the triage of TN patients for therapy and clinical trials, and hamper the design of treatment guidelines. In response to these shortcomings, we have developed a classification of TN that aligns with the nosology of other neurologic disorders and neuropathic pain. We propose 3 diagnostic categories. Classical TN requires demonstration of morphologic changes in the trigeminal nerve root from vascular compression. Secondary TN is due to an identifiable underlying neurologic disease. TN of unknown etiology is labeled idiopathic. Diagnostic certainty is graded possible when pain paroxysms occur in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches. Triggered paroxysms permit the designation of clinically established TN and probable neuropathic pain. Imaging and neurophysiologic tests that establish the etiology of classical or secondary TN determine definite neuropathic pain.

### MRI volumetry for the preoperative diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia [^116gXJUZ]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

To assess whether quantitative measuring methods can help improve the reliability of MRI-based evaluations of the pathological role of a neurovascular conflict between an artery and the trigeminal nerve. In a prospective study, magnetic resonance images were obtained from 62 patients with unilateral facial pain and 50 healthy test subjects. In coronal T1- and T2-weighted sequences volume measurements were performed by regions of interest and compared intraindividually (healthy versus affected side in the patient populations and right versus left side in the group of test subjects) and on the basis of the different clinical pictures (t test for dependent and independent samples, p < 0.05). In patients with trigeminal neuralgia, the affected nerve showed a smaller volume than the trigeminal nerve on the healthy side (p < 0.001). Such a volume difference was noted neither in the other patients nor in the healthy test subjects. Quantitative MRI measurements allow a pathological neurovascular conflict to be distinguished from a nonpathological condition where an artery is in close proximity to the trigeminal nerve. The measured volume difference between the healthy and the affected nerve in patients with neuralgia is indicative of trigeminal nerve atrophy resulting from damage to the nerve.

DISCUSSION

We have developed a new definition and diagnostic classification for TN (table), one that integrates an evaluation of diagnostic certainty based on criteria equivalent to those applied for neuropathic pain in general. The added assessment of diagnostic certainty will be helpful for treatment decisions. Diagnostic requirements for idiopathic, classical, and secondary TN are based on a thorough review of clinical and etiologic features of TN.

Table
Definition and classification of trigeminal neuralgia (TN)

Even after MRI or other investigation, the etiology of TN remains unclear (idiopathic) in approximately 11% of patients. Classical TN, caused by neurovascular compression, is the most frequent form of TN with defined etiology. Morphologic changes indicative of compression rather than mere vascular contact of the trigeminal root markedly increase the specificity of the diagnosis. Therapeutic relevance of these stricter criteria is supported by improved outcome of microvascular surgery in patients with clear signs of morphologic root alterations.MRI is the investigation of choice to detect trigeminal nerve compression. 3D reconstructions delineate the anatomic setting with high levels of sensitivity and specificity that help avoid unnecessary posterior fossa exploration. In about 15% of patients with TN, MRI reveals a major neurologic disease such as a benign tumor or MS. Secondary TN is a well-established term for the designation of these manifestations of neuralgia and should be maintained.

### AAN and EFNS guideline on diagnosing and treating… [^117QvaSD]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

The International Headache Society has classified trigeminal neuralgia into two categories: classic and symptomatic. Classic trigeminal neuralgia has no established etiology, although it may include potential vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve. The diagnosis of classic trigeminal neuralgia requires the absence of any clinically evident neurologic deficit, whereas the diagnosis of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia requires the identification of a structural abnormality other than vascular compression. Possible abnormalities include multiple sclerosis plaques, tumors, and abnormalities of the skull base. Which clinical or laboratory features accurately identify patients with symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. The presence of trigeminal sensory deficits or bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerves likely indicates symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia.

However, because of poor specificity, the absence of these features does not rule out symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. The involvement of the first division of the trigeminal nerve and an unresponsiveness to treatment are not considered useful features for identifying patients with an increased risk of symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. Abnormal trigeminal reflexes should be considered useful in distinguishing symptomatic from classic trigeminal neuralgia because of the high specificity and sensitivity. Does high-resolution MRI accurately identify neurovascular compression in patients with classic trigeminal neuralgia. The literature is inconsistent about the accuracy of MRI in determining neurovascular compression in classic trigeminal neuralgia.

Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI in identifying vascular contact of the trigeminal nerve in classic trigeminal neuralgia, or to indicate the most reliable MRI technique. Putting the Evidence into Context The initial diagnostic evaluation of patients with trigeminal neuralgia focuses on clinical characteristics known to identify patients with the symptomatic variety. If the physician suspects symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia, more testing should be performed. Trigeminal reflex testing or MRI is a reasonable next step. However, given the relatively high diagnostic accuracy of abnormal trigeminal reflexes, MRI is probably unnecessary in the presence of normal trigeminal reflexes.

### 3D CRANI, a novel MR neurography sequence, can reliable visualise the extraforaminal cranial and occipital nerves [^115vJ7zJ]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

MR neurography (MRN) in the head and neck region is attracting increasing attention in the literature. This novel MRI technique already showed promise to diagnose peripheral and trigeminal neuropathies. MRN may localize the neuropathy and even grade the severity of these neuropathies. The obtained information can be useful in diagnosing and treatment planning of patients with neuropathies. Given the recent introduction of MRN in the head and neck area, only a limited number of validation studies are available. The studies by Chabbra and by Burian illustrated the feasibility of MR neurography of the mandibular nerve and its terminal branches. But no studies are available that validate MR neurography for all extraforaminal cranial or occipital nerves. The purpose of this study was to validate the use of the previously published 3D CRANI (CRAnial Nerve Imaging), a novel high-field STIR TSE, sequence in extraforaminal cranial and occipital nerve visualisation on a 3-T system. Secondary aims were to assess the role of gadolinium administration on imaging quality and to obtain benchmarking values of signal intensities, apparent signal-to-noise (aSNR) and apparent nerve-muscle contrast-to-noise ratios (aNMCNR), and nerve diameters for the evaluated nerve branches.

### Association between neurovascular contact and clinical characteristics in classical trigeminal neuralgia: a prospective clinical study using 3.0 tesla MRI [^1128n47S]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies demonstrated that a severe neurovascular contact (NVC) causing displacement or atrophy of the trigeminal nerve is highly associated with classical trigeminal neuralgia (TN). There are no studies describing the association between the clinical characteristics of TN and severe NVC.

Methods

Clinical characteristics were prospectively collected from consecutive TN patients using semi-structured interviews in a cross-sectional study design. We evaluated 3.0 Tesla MRI blinded to the symptomatic side.

Results

We included 135 TN patients. Severe NVC was more prevalent in men (75%) compared to women (38%) (p < 0.001), and the odds in favor of severe NVC on the symptomatic side were 5.1 times higher in men compared to women (95% CI 2.3–10.9, p < 0.001). There was no difference between patients with and without severe NVC in age (≥ 60 years vs. < 60) (OR 1.6 95% CI (0.8–3.4), p = 0.199) or duration of disease (p = 0.101).

Conclusions

Severe NVC was much more prevalent in men than in women, who may more often have other disease etiologies causing or contributing to TN. Severe NVC was not associated with age or with duration of disease.

Trigeminal reflex testing and trigeminal evoked potentials — diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) from classic trigeminal neuralgia (CTN): Across studies, trigeminal reflex testing showed sensitivity range 59 to 100% and specificity range 93 to 100%, with pooled sensitivity 94% (95% CI, 91–97) and pooled specificity 87% (95% CI, 77–93). Evoked potentials did not distinguish STN from CTN with high accuracy, with sensitivity 60 to 100% and specificity 49 to 76%, and pooled sensitivity 84% (95% CI, 73–92) and pooled specificity 64% (95% CI, 56–71), and many patients with STN had normal evoked potentials while many with CTN had abnormal evoked potentials. Abnormal trigeminal reflexes are probably useful in distinguishing STN from CTN.

Materials and Methods

Study Population

A total of 240 patients with PTN who underwent MVD surgery at our neurosurgery department between April 2016 and April 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Among these cases, 150 were located on the right side, and 90 on the left side. The cohort comprised 107 male and 133 female patients, with ages ranging from 22 to 88 years (mean age: 58.5 ± 10.0 years). The duration of symptoms ranged from 1 month to 20 years, with an average of (4.7 ± 4.6) years. Prior to surgery, all patients underwent preoperative scanning with 3D-TOF-MRA and 3D-FIESTA-c. Additionally. All patients underwent MVD surgery via a posterior approach through the sigmoid sinus. Inclusion criteria included:①Diagnosed as PTN according to the diagnostic criteria of the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders published by the International Headache Society Classification Committee in 2018;②Unilateral PTN; ③Complete imaging data; ④Normal cognitive function. Exclusion criteria:①Secondary trigeminal neuralgia due to intracranial tumors, inflammation, or vascular malformations; ②History of mental illness; ③Presence of contraindications for MRI examinations. The study was granted approval by the Institutional Ethical Committee for Clinical Research of Nanjing Brain Hospital, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Image Acquisition

Scans were conducted using the GE Discovery 750 3.0T MRI machine with a standard head coil. Patients were positioned in a supine posture, and the scanning range encompassed the entire brainstem. Parameters for the 3D-FIESTA-c scan were as follows: TR = 5.05ms, TE = 2.26ms, FOV 250 mm × 226 mm, matrix 256 × 256, excitation times 2, and slice thickness 1 mm. Parameters for the 3D-TOF-MRA scan were: TR = 12.0ms, TE = 2.9ms, FOV 230 mm × 208 mm, matrix 320 × 320, flip angle 18°, excitation times 2, and slice thickness 1mm.

Inadequate Management of Temporal and Terminological Heterogeneity

While the protocol includes literature from the past 30 years, based on "contemporary authoritative standards" it fails to address critical differences in the evolving versions of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) — for example, the ICHD-3 requirement that MRI be used to exclude secondary causes in classical trigeminal neuralgia. This oversight may lead to the inclusion of secondary cases, potentially distorting the assessment of acupuncture point efficacy. Additionally, acupuncture point nomenclature is standardized per the national standard, but alias mapping rules are not disclosed, which impedes reproducibility. It is recommended to adopt the ICHD-3 classification and publish a terminology governance protocol.

### Predictive value of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging structural and diffusion indices for the results of trigeminal neuralgia microvascular decompression surgery [^114z5jsk]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is the most common functional neurological disorder of the brain, characterized by recurrent episodes of severe pain in the hemifacial trigeminal sensory distribution area, with a prevalence of 22–182 per 100,000, mostly occurring in middle-aged and older adults and seriously affecting physical and mental health. The etiology of TN remains unclear, but the prevailing view is that vascular compression and nerve demyelination in the root zone leading to the crosstalk of the nerve conduction signals are the main pathogeneses of TN. Microvascular decompression (MVD) is widely used in clinical practice for treating TN. Compared to other destructive surgical approaches, MVD provides immediate pain relief in about 90% of patients with no neurological impairment and is the surgical treatment of choice for patients without contraindications to anesthesia or surgery. Nevertheless, about 10% of patients show ineffectiveness immediately after MVD surgery, and approximately 20–30% have poor long-term postoperative results. Moreover, MVD has inherent risks and potential complications, including cranial injuries, such as cranial nerve palsy (4%), hearing loss (1.8%), and facial hypoesthesia (3%), and severe complications, such as death (0.3%), stroke (0.6%), and meningitis (0.39%).

### Trigeminal neurovascular contact in SUNCT and SUNA: a cross-sectional magnetic resonance study [^114REJHN]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

All MRI studies were reviewed and analysed on Coronis high-resolution 3-megapixel monitors (Barco Inc) on IMPAX 6 Picture Archiving and Communication System (AGFA Healthcare NV, Belgium) by an experienced neuroradiologist (I.D.) and a neurosurgeon specialized in performing microvascular decompression procedures (L.Z.) who were blinded to the diagnosis and the laterality of the headache. The inter-operator agreement on MRI evaluations was measured with K -score. The trigeminal nerve on the side of the pain was defined as the symptomatic nerve; the trigeminal nerve contralateral to the side of the pain was defined as the asymptomatic nerve. In patients with side alternating unilateral head pain, both trigeminal nerves were considered symptomatic. NVC with the cisternal segments of the trigeminal nerves was assessed on both sides on multiplanar reformats of the source high-resolution data. NVC was defined on the analysis of imaging by no perceptible cerebrospinal signal intervening between the vascular structure (arterial or venous) and the cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve. In view of the ongoing debate upon the definition and boundaries of the zone where peripheral myelination transitions to central myelination ('root entry zone' or 'transition zone'), sites of NVC on the trigeminal nerve were divided into three segments, namely, proximal, middle and distal. If more than one site was contacted by the vessel, it was defined as mixed. The degree of NVC was graded as with or without morphological changes. NVC without morphological changes was defined a simple contact. NVC with morphological changes was defined as a contact with distortion and/or atrophy (Fig. 1). Distortion was defined as indentation or displacement of the trigeminal nerve at the site of the neurovascular contact. Atrophy was defined as a reduced volume of the trigeminal nerve at the site of the neurovascular contact. NVC with one or more arteries was defined as an arterial conflict; NVC with one or more veins was defined as a venous conflict; NVC with one artery and one vein was defined as a mixed conflict. Furthermore, the point of contact around the nerve diameter was evaluated and defined as superior, lateral, medial and inferior. If more than one point of contact was present, then the term 'mixed' was used.

The study was approved by Northwick Park Hospital Research Ethics Committee, London, UK (REC no: 11/LO/1709). Patients gave informed consent to participate in this study.

Practice parameter — diagnostic evaluation and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: In patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN), routine head imaging identifies structural causes in up to 15% of patients and may be considered useful (Level C). Trigeminal sensory deficits, bilateral involvement of the trigeminal nerve, and abnormal trigeminal reflexes are associated with an increased risk of symptomatic TN (STN) and should be considered useful in distinguishing STN from classic trigeminal neuralgia (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the usefulness of MRI to identify neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve (Level U). Carbamazepine (Level A) or oxcarbazepine (Level B) should be offered for pain control while baclofen and lamotrigine (Level C) may be considered useful. For patients with TN refractory to medical therapy, Gasserian ganglion percutaneous techniques, gamma knife, or microvascular decompression may be considered (Level C). The role of surgery vs pharmacotherapy in the management of patients with TN remains uncertain.

### Advanced neuroimaging of the trigeminal nerve and the whole brain in trigeminal neuralgia: a systematic review [^1123dwxv]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

For trigeminal neuralgia (TN), a major role of imaging is to identify the causes, but recent studies demonstrated structural and microstructural changes in the affected nerve. Moreover, an increasing number of studies have reported central nervous system involvement in TN. In this systematic review, recent quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the trigeminal nerve and the brain in patients with TN were compiled, organized, and discussed, particularly emphasizing the possible background mechanisms and the interpretation of the results. A systematic search of quantitative MRI studies of the trigeminal nerve and the brain in patients with TN was conducted using PubMed. We included the studies of the primary TN published during 2013 to 2023, conducted for the assessment of the structural and microstructural analysis of the trigeminal nerve, and the structural, diffusion, and functional MRI analysis of the brain. Quantitative MRI studies of the affected trigeminal nerves and the trigeminal pathway demonstrated structural/microstructural alterations and treatment-related changes, which differentiated responders from nonresponders. Quantitative analysis of the brain revealed changes in the brain areas associated with pain processing/modulation and emotional networks. Studies of the affected nerve demonstrated evidence of demyelination and axonal damage, compatible with pathological findings, and have shown its potential value as a tool to assess treatment outcomes. Quantitative MRI has also revealed the possibility of dynamic microstructural, structural, and functional neuronal plasticity of the brain. Further studies are needed to understand these complex mechanisms of neuronal plasticity and to achieve a consensus on the clinical use of quantitative MRI in TN.

rs-fMRI Examination and Data Analysis

The rs-fMRI experiments will be conducted using a 1.5 Tesla clinical scanner (GE Medical Systems, LLC) in the Department of Radiology. During the MRI scan, all subjects will be instructed to lie supine, keep their heads still using foam pads and straps, with their eyes closed, stay awake, avoiding structured thinking to ensure rest. Try to avoid painful episodes for about 6min during the resting-state scanning. Every subject will take routine whole brain MRI sequence scans first, including scout scan, conventional transverse section T2WI to exclude intracranial space-occupying lesion and cerebrovascular diseases. High resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging will be performed with a multi-echo magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (T1-weighted MPRAGE) sequences with the following parameters:sagittal slices = 176, time to repetition (TR) = 1900ms, time to echo (TE) = 2.45ms, time to inversion (TI) = 900ms, field of view (FOV) = 256 × 256mm 2, thickness/gap = 1.0/0 mm, acquisition matrix = 256 × 256, flip angle (FA) = 9°.

The resting-state scanning sequence is based on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) principle, using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences with the following parameters: axial slices = 33, TE = 40ms, TR = 3000ms, thickness = 5.0mm, gap = 1mm, FOV = 240 × 240mm 2, FA = 90°, acquisition matrix = 64×64, and 200 volumes, each fMRI scan will last 384 seconds. After the data is collected, the cooperation situation of each subject will be asked and recorded in time.

Objectives

This study was performed amongst trigeminal neuralgia (TN) patients with neurovascular contact (NVC) to 1) investigate the association of the demographic and radiologic factors/variables with TN occurrence, and 2) develop a screening tool for TN/TN-affected nerves based on the factors/variables associated with it.

Methods

Eighty-five TN patients were recruited, and 121 trigeminal nerves with NVC were derived from them. Based on MRI sequences, including balanced turbo field echo and enhanced T1 high-resolution isotropic volume excitation, radiologic factors/variables for each nerve, from the offending vessel to the presence of nerve displacement, were identified by a neuroradiologist and a neurosurgeon. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from clinical notes. Logistic regression was performed to assess the association of the factors/variables with TN occurrence (i.e., affected vs. unaffected nerves).

Results

Three factors/variables were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with TN occurrence amongst patients with NVC: nerve laterality, vertebral artery (VA) involvement, and the presence of nerve displacement. The nerves with VA involvement, those on the right side, and those with nerve displacement exhibited a significantly higher likelihood/odd of being affected by TN, compared to those without VA involvement, those on the left side, and those without nerve displacement, respectively. Based on these factors/variables, a screening tool/nomogram with acceptable accuracy was established (C-statistic/AUC = 0.80).

Conclusions

This study revealed an association of the three radiologic factors/variables with TN occurrence. A screening tool for TN/TN-affected nerves was established based on them. The findings may lay a foundation for an improvement of the diagnosis and clinical management of TN.

Key Points

- VA involvement and nerve displacement could be identified using MRI, and are significantly associated with TN occurrence.
- A potential objective screening tool/nomogram for TN/TN-affected nerves could be established based on the three radiologic factors/variables: VA involvement, the presence of nerve displacement, and nerve laterality.
- The screening accuracy of the tool/nomogram is acceptable as the C-statistic is 0.80.

### Diagnostic role of magnetic resonance imaging in assessing orofacial pain and paresthesia [^114cNCy2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of CT and MRI in evaluating orofacial pain and paresthesia. A total of 96 patients with orofacial pain and/or paresthesia were included in this study. The patients who underwent CT and/or MRI examinations were assessed, and the efficacy of CT and/or MRI examinations in detecting the causative disease of the orofacial pain and paresthesia was evaluated. Seventy (72.9%) of 96 patients underwent CT and/or MRI examinations. Whereas CT examinations detected 2 diseases (4.5%) in 44 tests, 13 diseases (37.1%) were detected in 35 MRI examinations. Seven (53.8%) of 13 diseases, which were detected by MRI, were found in elderly patients. A high percentage of patients, who claimed orofacial pain and paresthesia, have other diseases in their brain, especially in elderly patients, and MRI is more useful than CT for evaluating these patients.

### Central vein sign and trigeminal lesions of multiple sclerosis visualised by 7T MRI [^115L7vmC]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cranial nerve involvement is a prominent characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, with the optic nerve being the most frequently affected, followed by the trigeminal nerve. The prevalence of trigeminal involvement varies widely, ranging from 2.9% to 23%, depending on MRI resolution and sequence selection but also disease duration. Additionally, patients with MS have a 15-fold increased risk of developing trigeminal neuralgia (TN), compared with the general neurological outpatient population.

Trigeminal lesions predominantly concentrate along the cisternal portion of the trigeminal nerve, extending to the root entry zone (REZ) and even to the pontine-medullary nucleus. In a cohort of 1628 patients with MS, 26 of 28 patients with TN displayed a REZ plaque. Lesions of REZ exhibit a distinctive linear shape with their long axis parallel to the trigeminal nerve. This uniqueness of the shape and anatomical location questions the underlying reasons behind the development of such lesions along the trigeminal root to REZ.

Histologic evidence has demonstrated focal demyelination at REZ in MS-related TN. A general consensus exists on the close association of the trigeminal nerve root with vascular anatomy, which may trigger TN. The utilisation of ultra-high-field 7T MRI, with its increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and enhanced susceptibility effects, yields superior visualisation of the lesions and provides further insights into their possible pathology. Previous studies have mainly focused on MS-related TN with consecutive routine MRI scans, leading to potential underestimation of the prevalence of trigeminal nerve lesions in asymptomatic patients. To address this gap in knowledge, we aimed to determine the prevalence of trigeminal lesions using ultra-high-resolution MRI based on data from the China National Registry of Neuro-Inflammatory Diseases (CNRID) and explore characteristic imaging features.
