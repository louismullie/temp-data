## Question

Does versed drop blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether midazolam (Versed) lowers blood pressure and how to reconcile conflicting evidence across doses, populations, and clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic class and expected hemodynamic profile. Then, I should verify what high-credibility FDA labeling says about blood pressure effects. Next, I will examine dose-response data from clinical studies, including ICU sedation, conscious sedation, and induction of anesthesia. After that, I need to check special populations and drug interactions that amplify hypotension. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and monitoring plan with references to guidelines and labeling language [^1113rCzj] [^1156FBwQ].

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanism, because that frames expectations. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that potentiates GABA-A neurotransmission, producing anxiolysis, sedation, and amnesia; it is not a primary vasodilator like propofol, but benzodiazepines can reduce sympathetic tone and, at higher doses, exert direct vascular effects, so I should not assume neutrality on blood pressure without data [^113SYTvR].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory baseline. The FDA labeling repeatedly notes that IV induction doses of midazolam are associated with a slight to moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance, and pediatric data show a mean 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure with IV midazolam compared with a 25% decrease with propofol, which confirms a dose-related hemodynamic effect even if smaller than propofol's [^1156FBwQ] [^114HtXFb] [^115o6ho4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from labeling alone; I should review controlled studies. In a randomized, double-blind ICU trial of postoperative patients, IV midazolam produced a dose-dependent reduction in mean systolic arterial pressure, with only rare patients experiencing decreases greater than 20%, supporting a modest, dose-related effect at sedative doses rather than frank hypotension in most adults [^113cATpW]. In contrast, a prospective volunteer study at sedative doses reported no change in blood pressure or heart rate with midazolam, suggesting that at low, anxiolytic doses, hemodynamic effects can be minimal in healthy subjects, though this does not generalize to induction doses or vulnerable patients [^114Nd42B].

> I need to check real-world procedural and emergency settings where hemodynamics are less forgiving. In ED rapid sequence intubation, low-dose midazolam (2–4 mg) caused a mean 10% fall in systolic pressure and more hypotension than etomidate, with 19.5% experiencing hypotension, reinforcing that even "low" induction doses can precipitate clinically meaningful drops in unstable patients or those with limited reserve [^114QoBpj]. In prehospital post-arrest patients, a midazolam–fentanyl–rocuronium induction protocol reduced systolic pressure over time, with new hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) occurring in 6–16% depending on timing, again highlighting context sensitivity [^1142fdsT].

> Let me consider special populations where the margin for error is smaller. In neonates and preterm infants, rapid IV injection of midazolam is associated with severe hypotension, especially with concomitant fentanyl, and continuous infusions can also precipitate hypotension; this mandates slow administration and careful titration in this group [^113Mww5r] [^113q574z]. In older adults, higher premedication doses (for example, 0.06 mg/kg IV) produced significant reductions in mean blood pressure and oxygen saturation, indicating greater sensitivity and the need for dose reduction and vigilant monitoring [^115szHJX].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions that amplify hypotension. Concomitant opioids, other CNS depressants, and volatile anesthetics increase the risk of respiratory depression and hypotension; hypotension occurred more frequently in sedation studies when patients were premedicated with narcotics, and labeling repeatedly warns to titrate slowly and monitor continuously when combining with opioids or other sedatives [^1173N1g9] [^1113rCzj] [^117KcNXf]. Mechanistically, midazolam can produce vasodilation via activation of large-conductance calcium-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle, providing a plausible direct pathway for BP reduction at higher concentrations or in sensitive beds [^113SYTvR].

> But wait, what if the patient is on chronic benzodiazepines; could that change the BP response? Observational ambulatory data suggest chronic benzodiazepine use is associated with modestly lower blood pressure in older adults, though confounding is substantial and this does not negate acute dose-related hypotension risk with parenteral midazolam in procedural settings [^114mruo5].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Yes, midazolam can lower blood pressure, and the effect is dose dependent: minimal at low, anxiolytic doses in healthy volunteers, modest at sedative ICU doses, and more consistent and clinically relevant at induction doses, particularly in the elderly, neonates, hemodynamically unstable patients, or when combined with opioids or other depressants; rare hypotensive episodes requiring treatment have been reported, and labeling advises individualized dosing, slow titration, and continuous monitoring with resuscitation capability available [^114Nd42B] [^113cATpW] [^1156FBwQ] [^1113rCzj] [^1173N1g9].

> I should confirm practical implications. For procedural sedation, start low, titrate slowly (allowing 3–5 minutes between increments), and continuously monitor blood pressure, oxygenation, and ventilation; in older or debilitated patients, reduce IV doses and anticipate longer recovery; in neonates, avoid rapid IV pushes and be especially cautious with coadministered fentanyl; and whenever opioids or other CNS depressants are on board, expect synergistic effects and preempt hypotension with fluids and vasopressors as indicated [^116eEpXZ] [^1113rCzj] [^113Mww5r] [^1173N1g9].

---

Midazolam (Versed) can cause **modest, dose-dependent blood pressure reductions** [^1156FBwQ] via decreased systemic vascular resistance and sympathetic tone, with larger drops when combined with opioids or in elderly, frail, or hemodynamically unstable patients [^1173N1g9] [^1113rCzj]. Clinically significant hypotension is uncommon at sedative doses but more likely with induction doses or rapid IV push; monitor closely and titrate slowly to minimize risk [^116eEpXZ] [^1129x1AJ].

---

## Hemodynamic effects of midazolam

Midazolam causes **modest, dose-dependent reductions** in mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) [^1156FBwQ]. These effects reflect decreased sympathetic tone and direct vascular smooth muscle relaxation [^113SYTvR].

---

## Clinical evidence of blood pressure changes

Several studies document **midazolam-associated blood pressure reductions**:

- **Healthy volunteers**: Sedative doses produced modest BP reductions (~8–10 mmHg systolic/diastolic) [^112JRVk6].
- **ICU sedation**: Dose-dependent reductions in systolic BP; > 20% decreases in some patients [^113cATpW].
- **Pediatrics**: Mean 15% systolic BP reduction with IV midazolam (500 mcg/kg) [^114HtXFb].
- **Neonates**: Rapid IV injection (< 2 min) can cause severe hypotension, especially with fentanyl coadministration [^113Mww5r].

---

## Factors influencing blood pressure changes

Several factors **modulate the magnitude of BP reduction** with midazolam:

| **Factor** | **Influence on blood pressure** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses cause greater BP reduction [^113cATpW] |
| Administration rate | Rapid IV push increases hypotension risk [^113LDUAN] |
| Patient age | Elderly are more susceptible to hypotension [^1173N1g9] |
| Comorbidities | Cardiovascular disease, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability increase risk [^notfound] |
| Concomitant medications | Opioids, CNS depressants, and other sedatives amplify hypotension [^notfound] |

---

## Comparison with other sedatives

Compared with other sedatives, midazolam generally causes **less hypotension than propofol** [^114HtXFb] but more than etomidate [^114QoBpj]. Dexmedetomidine can cause more pronounced bradycardia and hypotension, particularly with bolus dosing [^114hUXCh].

---

## Clinical implications and precautions

Given these effects, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor**: Continuous BP and heart rate during administration [^116eEpXZ].
- **Titrate**: Use slow titration to effect, especially in elderly or unstable patients [^116eEpXZ].
- **Avoid rapid IV push**: Particularly in neonates and with fentanyl coadministration [^113Mww5r].
- **Be prepared**: Have fluids and vasopressors available if hypotension occurs [^1162N84e].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical scenario** | **Blood pressure effect** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Sedative doses in healthy adults | Modest reduction (~8–10 mmHg) | Usually mild and transient [^112JRVk6] |
| ICU sedation | Dose-dependent reduction | Occasionally requires intervention [^113cATpW] |
| Pediatric patients | ~15% reduction in systolic BP | Generally well tolerated [^114HtXFb] |
| Neonates (rapid IV push) | Severe hypotension | Significant risk, avoid rapid push [^113Mww5r] |
| Combination with opioids | Enhanced hypotension | Increased risk, monitor closely [^1173N1g9] |

---

Midazolam causes **modest, dose-dependent BP reductions** via decreased SVR and sympathetic tone; clinically significant hypotension is more likely with higher doses, rapid administration, or coadministration with other CNS depressants. Careful titration and monitoring mitigate risk, especially in vulnerable patients [^1156FBwQ] [^1173N1g9].

### Midazolam hydrochloride (midazolam) [^112ZPnta]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Intravenous doses of midazolam hydrochloride should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). These patients will also probably take longer to recover completely after midazolam administration for the induction of anesthesia.

Midazolam does not protect against the increase in intracranial pressure or against the heart rate rise and/or blood pressure rise associated with endotracheal intubation under light general anesthesia.

The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use are functions of the dose administered, the clinical status of the individual patient, and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS. Anticipated effects range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation virtually equivalent to a state of general anesthesia where the patient may require external support of vital functions. Care must be taken to individualize and carefully titrate the dose of midazolam hydrochloride to the patient's underlying medical/surgical conditions, administer to the desired effect being certain to wait an adequate time for peak CNS effects of both midazolam hydrochloride and concomitant medications, and have the personnel and size-appropriate equipment and facilities available for monitoring and intervention (see Boxed WARNING, WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Practitioners administering midazolam hydrochloride must have the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management.

### Hemodynamic characteristics of midazolam, propofol, and dexmedetomidine in healthy volunteers [^114Nd42B]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To study the effect of intravenous (IV) sedation on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rates (RR) to determine if IV sedatives differ with respect to their effect on BP, HR, and RR.

Design

Prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study.

Setting

Monitored patient care room at a clinical research center.

Subjects

60 healthy ASA physical status 1 volunteers.

Interventions

Subjects were randomized to receive, in increasing doses, one of three IV sedatives: propofol, midazolam, or dexmedetomidine; or saline control.

Measurements

Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic), HR, and RR were recorded.

Main Results

A significant dose-dependent BP reduction occurred with dexmedetomidine and, to a lesser degree, with propofol; and there was good agreement of predicted versus measured drug concentrations for all sedatives. Blood pressure and HR of participants who received midazolam did not change.

Conclusions

When administered in sedative doses, dexmedetomidine and, to a lesser extent, midazolam, reduces BP in a dose-dependent fashion. Dexmedetomidine also reduces HR. Midazolam does not affect BP or HR.

### Does premedication with dexmedetomidine provide perioperative hemodynamic stability in hypertensive patients? [^1129peWN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the most common concomitant disease that we encounter in the practice of anesthesia. In hypertensive patients, excessive reduction in blood pressure is observed after anesthetic induction, while excessive increases in blood pressure are seen under stresses such as intubation, laryngoscopy, surgical incision and extubation. A decrease of greater than 20% in blood pressure can precipitates myocardial ischemia; decreases in diastolic blood pressure in particular can cause declines in both cerebral and myocardial perfusion. Elevations in blood pressure may cause myocardial ischemia and infarction by increasing cardiac work. Perioperative and postoperative complications in hypertensive patients are similar to those in normotensive patients. However, in a study that evaluated 17,638 patients who had shown side effects such as hypotension and arrhythmias more frequently than not experienced major complications such as death and perioperative myocardial infarction in outpatient hypertensive procedures.

In the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for perioperative cardiovascular assessment, the usage of α-2 agonists, such as clonidine, is suggested in the treatment of perioperative hypertension, particularly in the presence of coronary disease. Furthermore, a limited number of studies have evaluated the usage of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine is 1600 times more selective to α-2 receptors than to α-1 receptors (clonidine, 200:1), and this high selectivity contributes to increases in hypnotic and analgesic efficacies and decreases in cardiovascular side effects. Potentially desirable effects include decreased requirements for other anesthetics and analgesics, a diminished sympathetic response to stress and the potential for cardioprotective effects against myocardial ischemia, along with minimal effects on respiration. Currently, dexmedetomidine is being used in both the operating room and diagnostic and procedure units in adult patients for sedation and analgesic effects.

Some studies have compared dexmedetomidine versus midazolam for sedation in critical patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. However, we did not find a study comparing the usage of dexmedetomidine and midazolam for premedication in hypertensive patients in the literature. In our previous study comparing dexmedetomidine and midazolam for sedation during endoscopy, we observed more hemodynamic stability with dexmedetomidine, particularly in hypertensive patients. Because of this observation, we designed this study with the hypothesis that the use of dexmedetomidine would provide better hemodynamic stability and would thus reduce the need for antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients for premedication during anesthetic management.

### Does premedication with dexmedetomidine provide perioperative hemodynamic stability in hypertensive patients? [^115LnwSj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Based on our study, dexmedetomidine as a premedication seems to be a better choice than midazolam for hypertensive patients. In addition, dexmedetomidine may have the benefit of decreasing anesthetic requirements. Nonetheless, it should be taken into consideration that dexmedetomidine increases the incidence of dry mouth and bradycardia in hypertensive patients.

### Midazolam is more likely to cause hypotension than etomidate in emergency department rapid sequence intubation [^114QoBpj]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the haemodynamic effect of low dose midazolam and etomidate as induction agent in emergency department rapid sequence intubation.

Methods

A prospective observational study in two phases. In phase one, midazolam 2–4 mg was used as induction agent and in phase two, etomidate 0.2–0.3 mg/kg was used. The haemodynamic data were recorded before and after intubation for comparison. Changes in mean systolic blood pressure were analysed with SPSS software.

Results

A 10% decrease in mean systolic blood pressure was observed in the midazolam group (p = 0.001) while there was no significant change in the etomidate group. Some 19.5% of patients had hypotension after being given midazolam while only 3.6% with etomidate (p = 0.002). Patients older than 70 tended to have more hypotension episodes but the difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Midazolam, even in low dose, was more likely than etomidate to cause significant hypotension when used as an induction agent for rapid sequence intubation. Etomidate is a better alternative.

### Midazoalm (Midazolam) [^114HtXFb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In cardiac hemodynamic studies in adults, IV induction of general anesthesia with midazolam hydrochloride was associated with a slight to moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance. Slow heart rates (less than 65/minute), particularly in patients taking propranolol for angina, tended to rise slightly; faster heart rates (e.g., 85/minute) tended to slow slightly. In pediatric patients, a comparison of IV midazolam hydrochloride (500 mcg/kg) with propofol (2.5 mg/kg) revealed a mean 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure in patients who had received IV midazolam vs a mean 25% decrease in systolic blood pressure following propofol.

Pharmacokinetics

Midazolam's activity is primarily due to the parent drug. Elimination of the parent drug takes place via hepatic metabolism of midazolam to hydroxylated metabolites that are conjugated and excreted in the urine. Six single-dose pharmacokinetic studies involving healthy adults yield pharmacokinetic parameters for midazolam in the following ranges: volume of distribution (Vd), 1.0 to 3.1 L/kg; elimination half-life, 1.8 to 6.4 hours (mean approximately 3 hours); total clearance (Cl), 0.25 to 0.54 L/hr/kg. In a parallel group study, there was no difference in the clearance, in subjects administered 0.15 mg/kg (n = 4) and 0.30 mg/kg (n = 4) IV doses indicating linear kinetics. The clearance was successively reduced by approximately 30% at doses of 0.45 mg/kg (n = 4) and 0.6 mg/kg (n = 5) indicating non-linear kinetics in this dose range.

### Midazolam hydrochloride (midazolam) [^111Joh3i]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients without intracranial lesions, induction of general anesthesia with IV midazolam hydrochloride is associated with a moderate decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (lumbar puncture measurements), similar to that observed following IV thiopental. Preliminary data in neurosurgical patients with normal intracranial pressure but decreased compliance (subarachnoid screw measurements) show comparable elevations of intracranial pressure with midazolam and with thiopental during intubation. No similar studies have been reported in pediatric patients.

The usual recommended intramuscular premedicating doses of midazolam hydrochloride do not depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation to a clinically significant extent in adults. Intravenous induction doses of midazolam hydrochloride depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation for 15 minutes or more beyond the duration of ventilatory depression following administration of thiopental in adults. Impairment of ventilatory response to carbon dioxide is more marked in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sedation with IV midazolam does not adversely affect the mechanics of respiration (resistance, static recoil, most lung volume measurements); total lung capacity and peak expiratory flow decrease significantly but static compliance and maximum expiratory flow at 50% of awake total lung capacity (Vmax) increase. In one study of pediatric patients under general anesthesia, intramuscular midazolam (100 g/kg or 200 g/kg) was shown to depress the response to carbon dioxide in a dose-related manner.

In cardiac hemodynamic studies in adults, IV induction of general anesthesia with midazolam hydrochloride was associated with a slight to moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance. Slow heart rates (less than 65/minute), particularly in patients taking propranolol for angina, tended to rise slightly; faster heart rates (e.g., 85/minute) tended to slow slightly. In pediatric patients, a comparison of IV midazolam (500 g/kg) with propofol (2.5 mg/kg) revealed a mean 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure in patients who had received IV midazolam vs. a mean 25% decrease in systolic blood pressure following propofol.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions in the Controlled Study of Intramuscular Midazolam in Patients with Status Epilepticus

In a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical study, 448 patients were assigned to receive intramuscular (IM) midazolam via an autoinjector, and 445 were assigned to receive intravenous (IV) lorazepam. Approximately 45% of patients were female, and the mean age was 43 years. Patients were administered treatment by a healthcare professional (e.g., paramedic) prior to arrival at a hospital.

Table 1 lists the adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of the IM midazolam-treated patients and at a rate greater than the IV lorazepam-treated patients.

Adverse Reactions in Other Midazolam Studies

Fluctuations in vital signs were the most frequently seen findings following parenteral administration of midazolam in adults for uses other than that for which SEIZALAM is indicated, and included decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate decrease [11% of patients following intramuscular administration], as well as variations in blood pressure and pulse rate. The majority of serious adverse effects, particularly those associated with oxygenation and ventilation, have been reported when midazolam was administered with other medications capable of depressing the CNS. The incidence of such events was higher in patients undergoing procedures involving the airway without the protective effect of an endotracheal tube (e.g., upper endoscopy and dental procedures).

The following additional adverse reactions were reported after intramuscular administration in adults: Headache (1.3%), and local effects at the IM injection site including pain (3.7%), induration (0.5%), redness (0.5%), and muscle stiffness (0.3%).

### Midazolam hydrochloride (midazolam) [^11586oos]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS:

See WARNINGS concerning serious cardiorespiratory events and possible paradoxical reactions. Fluctuations in vital signs were the most frequently seen findings following parenteral administration of midazolam in adults and included decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate decrease (23.3% of patients following IV and 10.8% of patients following IM administration) and apnea (15.4% of patients following IV administration), as well as variations in blood pressure and pulse rate. The majority of serious adverse effects, particularly those associated with oxygenation and ventilation, have been reported when midazolam hydrochloride is administered with other medications capable of depressing the central nervous system. The incidence of such events is higher in patients undergoing procedures involving the airway without the protective effect of an endotracheal tube (e.g., upper endoscopy and dental procedures).

Adults

The following additional adverse reactions were reported after intramuscular administration:

Administration of intramuscular midazolam hydrochloride to elderly and/or higher risk surgical patients has been associated with rare reports of death under circumstances compatible with cardiorespiratory depression. In most of these cases, the patients also received other central nervous system depressants capable of depressing respiration, especially narcotics (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

The following additional adverse reactions were reported subsequent to intravenous administration as a single sedative/anxiolytic/amnestic agent in adult patients:

Pediatric Patients

The following adverse events related to the use of IV midazolam hydrochloride in pediatric patients were reported in the medical literature: desaturation 4.6%, apnea 2.8%, hypotension 2.7%, paradoxical reactions 2.0%, hiccough 1.2%, seizure-like activity 1.1% and nystagmus 1.1%. The majority of airway-related events occurred in patients receiving other CNS depressing medications and in patients where midazolam was not used as a single sedating agent.

### The different effects of intravenous propofol and midazolam sedation on hemodynamic and heart rate variability [^1173j6vt]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Heart rate (HR) and arterial blood pressure (BP) changes have been reported during conscious sedation with propofol and midazolam. One potential mechanism to explain these changes is that propofol and midazolam affect HR and BP via changes in the cardiac autonomic nervous system. Two specific hypotheses were tested by HR variability analysis: 1) propofol induces predominance of parasympathetic activity, leading to decreased HR and BP, and 2) midazolam induces predominance of sympathetic activity, leading to increased HR and decreased BP. Thirty dental patients were included in a prospective, randomized study. HR, BP, low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and entropy were monitored during the awake, sedation, and recovery periods and depth of sedation was assessed using the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score. Propofol induced a significant decrease in total power (503 ± 209 ms(2)/Hz versus 162 ± 92 ms(2)/Hz) and LF/HF ratio (2.5 ± 1.2 versus 1.0 ± 0.4), despite the absence of any change in HR during the sedation period compared with baseline. Midazolam decreased normalized HF (34 ± 10% versus 10 ± 4%) but did not significantly change LF/HF ratio (2.3 ± 1.1 versus 2.2 ± 1.4) and increased HR in the sedation period. Compared with baseline, propofol was associated with a significant increase in normalized HF in the recovery period (34 ± 11% versus 44 ± 12%) and a significant decrease in HR, whereas midazolam was associated with an increase in LF/HF ratio (2.3 ± 1.1 versus 3.7 ± 1.8) with no change in HR. These results indicated a dominant parasympathetic effect of propofol and a dominant sympathetic effect of midazolam in both periods. These results should be considered during conscious sedation, especially in patients at risk of cardiovascular complications.

### Midazolam (midazolam in sodium chloride) [^112eurLi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients without intracranial lesions, induction of general anesthesia with intravenous midazolam is associated with a moderate decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (lumbar puncture measurements), similar to that observed following intravenous thiopental. Preliminary data in neurosurgical patients with normal intracranial pressure but decreased compliance (subarachnoid screw measurements) show comparable elevations of intracranial pressure with midazolam and with thiopental during intubation.

In pediatric patients, a comparison of intravenous midazolam (500 mcg/kg) with propofol (2.5 mg/kg) revealed a mean 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure in patients who had received intravenous midazolam vs a mean 25% decrease in systolic blood pressure following propofol.

Plasma Concentration-Efficacy Relationships

Concentration-efficacy relationships (after an intravenous dose) have been demonstrated for a variety of pharmacodynamic measures (eg, reaction time, eye movement, sedation) and are associated with extensive intersubject variability. Logistic regression analysis of sedation scores and steady-state plasma concentration indicated that at plasma concentrations greater than 100 ng/mL there was at least a 50% probability that patients would be sedated, but respond to verbal commands (sedation score = 3). At 200 ng/mL there was at least a 50% probability that patients would be asleep, but respond to glabellar tap (sedation score = 4).

### Midazolam [^115o6ho4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients without intracranial lesions, induction of general anesthesia with IV midazolam is associated with a moderate decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (lumbar puncture measurements), similar to that observed following IV thiopental. Preliminary data in neurosurgical patients with normal intracranial pressure but decreased compliance (subarachnoid screw measurements) show comparable elevations of intracranial pressure with midazolam and with thiopental during intubation. No similar studies have been reported in pediatric patients.

The usual recommended intramuscular premedicating doses of midazolam do not depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation to a clinically significant extent in adults. Intravenous induction doses of midazolam depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation for 15 minutes or more beyond the duration of ventilatory depression following administration of thiopental in adults. Impairment of ventilatory response to carbon dioxide is more marked in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sedation with IV midazolam does not adversely affect the mechanics of respiration (resistance, static recoil, most lung volume measurements); total lung capacity and peak expiratory flow decrease significantly but static compliance and maximum expiratory flow at 50% of awake total lung capacity (Vmax) increase. In one study of pediatric patients under general anesthesia, intramuscular midazolam (100 or 200 mcg/kg) was shown to depress the response to carbon dioxide in a dose related manner.

In cardiac hemodynamic studies in adults, IV induction of general anesthesia with midazolam was associated with a slight to moderate decrease in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance.

### Midazolam [^1141PuSw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Injectable midazolam can also be used during maintenance of anesthesia, for surgical procedures, as a component of balanced anesthesia. Effective narcotic premedication is especially recommended in such cases.

Incremental injections of approximately 25% of the induction dose should be given in response to signs of lightening of anesthesia and repeated as necessary.

CONTINUOUS INFUSION

For continuous infusion, midazolam 5 mg/mL formulation is recommended diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5%

dextrose in water.

Usual Adult Dose:

If a loading dose is necessary to rapidly initiate sedation, 0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg (approximately 0.5 to 4 mg for a typical adult) may be given slowly or infused over several minutes. This dose may be repeated at 10 to 15 minute intervals until adequate sedation is achieved. For maintenance of sedation, the usual initial infusion rate is 0.02 to 0.10 mg/kg/hr (1 to 7 mg/hr). Higher loading or maintenance infusion rates may occasionally be required in some patients.

The lowest recommended doses should be used in patients with residual effects from anesthetic drugs, or in those concurrently receiving other sedatives or opioids.

Individual response to midazolam is variable. The infusion rate should be titrated to the desired level of sedation, taking into account the patient's age, clinical status and current medications. In general, midazolam should be infused at the lowest rate that produces the desired level of sedation. Assessment of sedation should be performed at regular intervals and the midazolam infusion rate adjusted up or down by 25% to 50% of the initial infusion rate so as to assure adequate titration of sedation level. Larger adjustments or even a small incremental dose may be necessary if rapid changes in the level of sedation are indicated. In addition, the infusion rate should be decreased by 10% to 25% every few hours to find the minimum effective infusion rate. Finding the minimum effective infusion rate decreases the potential accumulation of midazolam and provides for the most rapid recovery once the infusion is terminated. Patients who exhibit agitation, hypertension or tachycardia in response to noxious stimulation, but who are otherwise adequately sedated, may benefit from concurrent administration of an opioid analgesic. Addition of an opioid will generally reduce the minimum effective midazolam infusion rate.

### Does premedication with dexmedetomidine provide perioperative hemodynamic stability in hypertensive patients? [^113A4UNx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

At the measured time points (after premedication, induction of anesthesia intubation, early surgical period and extubation) hypertensive patients showed significant changes compared to normotensive patients. There was no difference between dexmedetomidine and midazolam use. However, the requirement for perioperative antihypertensives was significantly higher in patients who received midazolam. Because antihypertensives were used in this group that interfered with blood pressure values, the values were reduced to the blood pressure values of patients that were treated with dexmedetomidine; therefore, it is possible that significant differences may have been eliminated. If perioperative antihypertensive treatment had not been administered in the hypertensive midazolam patients, the data may have indicated a statistically significant difference when compared to patients who were given dexmedetomidine.

It is well known that perioperative hemodynamic fluctuations are observed more often in hypertensive patients than in normotensive patients. These fluctuations can occur for the duration of anesthesia and are well tolerated in healthy individuals; however, these pressure changes and increased sympathetic activity can have harmful effects on hypertensive patients.

Ghignone et al. compared clonidine and diazepam as premedications for normotensive and hypertensive patients and found that clonidine was more effective in preventing reflex tachycardia caused by laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, and they reported that intraoperative fluctuations decreased. Singh et al. showed that oral clonidine as a premedication provided more stable hemodynamics compared to placebo (in this study, hypertension was not included in the study). Mariappan et al. showed similar hemodynamic profiles when they compared oral clonidine premedication and perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion. Most studies showed that, compared to saline, dexmedetomidine as a premedication significantly decreased hypertensive and tachycardia responses that occur due to intubation. Becker et al. reported that the dexmedetomidine infusion after intubation in craniotomy patients resulted in fewer antihypertensive requirements. These studies were conducted in normotensive patients. A study comparing dexmedetomidine and three different doses of midazolam showed that dexmedetomidine decreased mean blood pressure and HR compared to all of the different midazolam dosages. Nevertheless, in all studies, hypertensive patients were either excluded or mixed with normotensive patients. In our study, it was established that hemodynamic fluctuations were more common in hypertensive patients than in normotensive patients. Furthermore, we observed that the hemodynamic response was more distinctive in hypertensive patients who received midazolam as premedication, and the data indicated that in the same group, the use of antihypertensive drugs was more common.

### A dose-ranging study of midazolam for postoperative sedation of patients: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113cATpW]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the dose range, efficacy, and safety of midazolam for induction of sedation of mechanically ventilated postoperative patients in the intensive care unit.

Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Setting

Thirteen intensive care units in Japan.

Patients

We included 98 patients undergoing general surgery who were ASA physical status I-III. The following inclusion criteria were applied to the patients after surgery: under mechanical ventilation, sedation level 2 or 3 on the Ramsay Sedation Scale, and any pain level but 4 on the Pybus and Torda Pain Scale.

Measurements and Results

Of the 98 patients initially enrolled in the study, 95 patients received one of the study medications: placebo (n = 24), 0.015 mg/kg midazolam (n = 21), 0.03 mg/kg midazolam (n = 26), or 0.06 mg/kg midazolam (n = 24). Level of sedation was assessed by using the Ramsay Sedation Scale before and 10 mins after medication. The proportions of patients with sedation level 4 or deeper after medication were 4.3%, 14.3%, 52.0%, and 90.9% in the placebo and the midazolam 0.015 mg/kg, 0.03 mg/kg, and 0.06 mg/kg groups, respectively. Safety was assessed by routine monitoring of body functions and monitoring for adverse events. Although midazolam dose-dependently reduced mean systolic arterial pressure, the changes in this variable were small; only one or two patients in each treatment group had decreases in systolic arterial pressure of > 20%. No clear dose dependency was found for changes in other body functions measured in the intensive care unit.

Conclusion

The proportion of patients who achieved a satisfactory level of sedation increased with an increasing dose of midazolam. Intravenous bolus injection of midazolam also dose-dependently reduced mean systolic arterial pressure. This study indicated that, balancing sedative efficacy and safety, from 0.03 to 0.06 mg/kg of midazolam provides relatively safe sedation in postoperative patients.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Exploring differences in the noise structures between conditions

Figure 2 shows the group‐level changes over time of HR, blood pressure, RVT, and end‐tidal CO 2. When looking at each condition separately, comparing pre‐ and postdrug, only ketamine had significant changes in HR (mΔ = 13.52 bpm, SE = 2.41, p < .001), end‐tidal CO 2 (mΔ = −.15%, SE = .43, p = .003), and RVT (mΔ = 7.43e −4, SE = 3.31, p = .04). Ketamine also significantly increased systolic (mΔ = 9.86 mmHg, = = 3.27, p = .01) and diastolic (mΔ = 11 mmHg, SE = 2.74, p = .002) blood pressure, while midazolam significantly decreased these (systolic: mΔ = −8.429 mmHg, SE = 1.63, p < .001, diastolic: mΔ = −7.43 mmHg, SE = 2.23, p = .005). However, ketamine's impact on both systolic (F [2,26] = 10.74, p < .001) and diastolic (F [2,26] = 12.75, p < .001) blood pressure were significantly greater than midazolam's.

Figure 2
Changes in physiological measures. Depicted are the changes across time in heart rate (a), respiratory volume over time (b), and end‐tidal CO 2, and the change in blood pressure between pre‐ and post‐drug, for placebo (red), ketamine (blue), and midazolam (green). Infusion started at time 0, and error bars/shading are the standard error of the mean. Only ketamine significantly modulated the first three parameters, with increases in HR (p < .001) and RVT (p = .04), and decreases in end‐tidal CO 2 (p = .003). Ketamine also significantly increased both systolic (p = .01) and diastolic (p = .002) blood pressure, while midazolam decreased these (systolic: p < .001, diastolic: p = .005)

### The different effects of midazolam and propofol sedation on dynamic cerebral autoregulation [^1175KgyV]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although midazolam and propofol reduce cerebral blood flow (CBF) similarly, they generate different effects on the autonomic nervous system and endothelium-induced relaxation. Midazolam induces sympathetic dominance, whereas propofol induces parasympathetic dominance. Midazolam has no effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation, whereas propofol suppresses endothelium-dependent relaxation. Moreover, midazolam apparently constricts cerebral arterioles. We therefore hypothesized that midazolam and propofol have different effects on dynamic cerebral autoregulation.

Methods

Ten healthy male subjects received midazolam, propofol, and placebo administrations in a randomized, single-blind, crossover study. The modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale was used to assess sedation depth. After reaching a target depth of sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale score 3, responds only after name is called loudly and/or repeatedly) or after 15 minutes of normal saline administration as placebo, dynamic cerebral autoregulation was evaluated by spectral and transfer function analyses between mean arterial blood pressure variability in the radial artery measured by tonometry, and CBF velocity variability in the middle cerebral artery measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography.

Results

Steady-state CBF velocity decreased significantly with midazolam and propofol administration (significant interaction effects, P = 0.024). However, transfer function gain in the low-frequency range decreased significantly only with midazolam administration (significant interaction effects, P = 0.015), suggesting a reduced magnitude of transfer from mean arterial blood pressure oscillations to CBF fluctuations during midazolam sedation.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that midazolam and propofol sedation have different effects on dynamic cerebral autoregulation despite causing equivalent decreases in steady-state CBF velocity. Only midazolam sedation is likely to improve dynamic cerebral autoregulation.

OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms

The manifestations of midazolam overdosage reported are similar to those observed with other benzodiazepines, including sedation, somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, diminished reflexes, coma and untoward effects on vital signs. No evidence of specific organ toxicity from midazolam overdosage has been reported.

Treatment

Treatment of injectable midazolam overdosage is the same as that followed for overdosage with other benzodiazepines. Respiration, pulse rate and blood pressure should be monitored and general supportive measures should be employed. Attention should be given to the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation, including administration of oxygen. An intravenous infusion should be started. Should hypotension develop, treatment may include intravenous fluid therapy, repositioning, judicious use of vasopressors appropriate to the clinical situation, if indicated, and other appropriate countermeasures. There is no information as to whether peritoneal dialysis, forced diuresis or hemodialysis are of any value in the treatment of midazolam overdosage.

Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected. There are anecdotal reports of reversal of adverse hemodynamic responses associated with midazolam following administration of flumazenil to pediatric patients. Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure the airway, assure adequate ventilation, and establish adequate intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. Flumazenil will only reverse benzodiazepine-induced effects but will not reverse the effects of other concomitant medications. The reversal of benzodiazepine effects may be associated with the onset of seizures in certain high-risk patients. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior to use.

OVERDOSAGE:

Clinical Presentation

Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal (see WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.

Management of Overdose

In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway maintenance. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.

Consider contacting a poison center (1–800–222–1222), poisoncontrol.org, or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.

Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation

Prior to the intravenous administration of midazolam in any dose, the immediate availability of oxygen, resuscitative drugs, age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and skilled personnel for the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation should be ensured. Patients should be continuously monitored for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea with means readily available (e.g., pulse oximetry). Hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea can lead to hypoxia and/or cardiac arrest unless effective countermeasures are taken immediately. The immediate availability of specific reversal agents (flumazenil) is highly recommended. Vital signs should continue to be monitored during the recovery period. Because intravenous midazolam can depress respiration (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), especially when used concomitantly with opioid agonists and other sedatives (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), it should be used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia only in the presence of personnel skilled in early detection of hypoventilation, maintaining a patent airway, and supporting ventilation. When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for complete information).

Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including midazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. If a decision is made to use midazolam concomitantly with opioids, monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS/Drug Interactions).

Risk of Respiratory Adverse Events

Serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with a narcotic.

Individualization of Dosage

Midazolam must never be used without individualization of dosage particularly when used with other medications capable of producing central nervous system depression. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for complete information.

5.2 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids, Other Sedative Hypnotics, or Other Central Nervous

System Depressants

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Titrate the dose of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response.

Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension, airway obstruction, hypoventilation, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and ASA‑PS III or IV patients.

Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.

5.3 Risk of Cardiorespiratory Adverse Reactions

Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with an opioid. Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and/or arrest. When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population. Continuously monitor patients for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea using capnography, pulse oximetry, and clinical assessment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Prior to the administration of flumazenil, necessary measures should be instituted to secure the airway, assure adequate ventilation, and establish adequate intravenous access. Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine overdose. Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. Flumazenil will only reverse benzodiazepine-induced effects but will not reverse the effects of other concomitant medications. The reversal of benzodiazepine effects may be associated with the onset of seizures in certain high-risk patients. The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment, particularly in long-term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose. The complete flumazenil package insert, including CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted prior to use.

### Clonidine in the management of blood pressure during rhytidectomy [^111xncvi]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Blood pressure control is an important part of any surgical procedure and is especially important during rhytidectomy to reduce the risk of bleeding, improve visualization, and reduce the risk of postoperative fluid accumulations. For patients given general anesthetic, b blood pressure control is regulated by intravenous fluids, inhalational gas concentrations, and pharmacologic manipulation. For those given local anesthetic with intravenous sedation, blood pressure manipulation can be difficult. Clonidine (Catapres, Boehringer Ingelheim) has been shown to effectively reduce blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, as well as those with normal blood pressure. We compared both intraoperative and postoperative blood pressure, pulse, and drug use, as well as complications in 100 patients treated with preoperative oral clonidine (0.1 mg) and in 100 patients who did not receive clonidine. The group that received clonidine had reduced systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure, and pulse rate (114/64, 80, 79 vs 129/74, 92, 86, p < 0.001). Blood pressure measured 12 hours after surgery remained lower in the clonidine group (119/67 vs 126/72, p < 0.001). There was no difference in intraoperative diazepam (Valium) or midazolem (Versed) requirements. Intraoperative fentanyl requirements were lower in the non-Catapres-treated group. Postoperative narcotic requirements were reduced in the clonidine-treated group. The patients treated with clonidine had a lower rate of hematoma and postoperative antihypertensive drug requirement than the untreated group. We propose that clonidine is a safe and effective drug to use in the perioperative period in patients undergoing rhytidectomy to regulate blood pressure.

### Sevoflurane (ultane) [^11315BzS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

During the maintenance of anesthesia, increasing the concentration of sevoflurane produces dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Due to sevoflurane's insolubility in blood, these hemodynamic changes may occur more rapidly than with other volatile anesthetics. Excessive decreases in blood pressure or respiratory depression may be related to depth of anesthesia and may be corrected by decreasing the inspired concentration of sevoflurane.

Rare cases of seizures have been reported in association with sevoflurane use (see PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric Use, ADVERSE REACTIONS).

The recovery from general anesthesia should be assessed carefully before a patient is discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit.

Information for Patients

Risk of Driving and Operating Machinery

Advise patients that performance of activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, may be impaired after sevoflurane anesthesia (see WARNINGS).

Effect of anesthetic and sedation drugs on early brain development

Studies conducted in young animals and children suggest repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains. Discuss with parents and caregivers the benefits, risks, and timing and duration of surgery or procedures requiring anesthetic and sedation drugs (see WARNINGS - Pediatric Neurotoxicity).

Drug Interactions

In clinical studies, no significant adverse reactions occurred with other drugs commonly used in the perioperative period, including central nervous system depressants, autonomic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, anti-infective agents, hormones and synthetic substitutes, blood derivatives, and cardiovascular drugs.

Epinephrine

Epinephrine administered with sevoflurane may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Monitor the electrocardiogram and blood pressure and ensure emergency medications to treat ventricular arrhythmias are readily available.

Calcium antagonists

Sevoflurane may lead to marked hypotension in patients treated with calcium antagonists. Blood pressure should be closely monitored and emergency medications to treat hypotension should be readily available when calcium antagonists are used concomitantly with sevoflurane.

In animals, impairment of atrioventricular conduction has been observed when verapamil and sevoflurane are administered concomitantly.

Succinylcholine

See WARNINGS - Perioperative Hyperkalemia.

Non-selective MAO-inhibitors

Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors and inhalational anesthetics may increase the risk of hemodynamic instability during surgery or medical procedures.

Intravenous Anesthetics

Sevoflurane administration is compatible with barbiturates, propofol, and other commonly used intravenous anesthetics.

Benzodiazepines and Opioids

Benzodiazepines and opioids would be expected to decrease the MAC of sevoflurane in the same manner as with other inhalational anesthetics. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with benzodiazepines and opioids as commonly used in surgical practice.

### Mixed-effects modeling of the influence of midazolam on propofol pharmacokinetics [^111iS5UH]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The combined administration of anesthetics has been associated with pharmacokinetic interactions that induce concentration changes of up to 30%. Midazolam is often used as a preoperative sedative in advance of a propofol-based anesthetic. In this study, we identified the influence of midazolam on the pharmacokinetics of propofol.

Methods

Eight healthy male volunteers were studied on two occasions in a random crossover manner. During Session A, volunteers received propofol 1 mg/kg in 1 min followed by an infusion of 2.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 59 min. During Session B, in addition to this propofol infusion scheme, a target-controlled infusion of midazolam (constant C(t): 125 ng/mL) was given from 15 min before the start until 6 h after termination of the propofol infusion. Arterial blood samples for blood propofol and plasma midazolam concentration analysis were taken until 6 h after termination of the propofol infusion. Nonlinear mixed-effects models examining the influence of midazolam and hemodynamic variables on propofol pharmacokinetics were constructed using Akaike criterion for model selection.

Results

In the presence of midazolam (C(blood): 224.8 ± 41.6 ng/mL), the blood propofol concentration increased by 25.1% ± 13.3% compared with when propofol was given as single drug. Midazolam (C(blood): 225 ng/mL) reduced propofol Cl(1) from 1.94 to 1.61 L/min, Cl(2) from 2.86 to 1.52 L/min, and Cl(3) from 0.95 to 0.73 L/min. Inclusion of mean arterial blood pressure further improved the propofol pharmacokinetic model.

Conclusions

Midazolam reduces the metabolic and rapid and slow distribution clearances of propofol. In addition, a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure is associated with propofol pharmacokinetic alterations that increase the blood propofol concentration.

5.2 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids, Other Sedative Hypnotics, or Other Central Nervous System Depressants

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Titrate the dose of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response.

Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension, airway obstruction, hypoventilation, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and ASA‑PS III or IV patients.

Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.

5.3 Risk of Cardiorespiratory Adverse Reactions

Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with an opioid. Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and/or arrest. When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population. Continuously monitor patients for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea using capnography, pulse oximetry, and clinical assessment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Hemodynamic effects of propofol [^112Q1BBf]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Propofol is administered intravenously, can be given as a bolus for induction or as a continuous infusion for maintenance of sedation, and has multiple advantages, including rapid onset, short duration of effect, and quick elimination. Its pharmacokinetic profile is particularly attractive in the CICU setting, where sedation interruption is frequently necessary and rapid clearance of sedative metabolites is often desired. Another strength of propofol is its rapid metabolism via multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms, which renders propofol less dependent on renal or hepatic clearance than midazolam (a benzodiazepine). Propofol's metabolic profile can be particularly beneficial as it typically does not require significant dosage adjustment for renal or hepatic injury, unlike many other sedatives.

Propofol's most notable hemodynamic effects include hypotension and bradycardia. The incidence of hypotension was reported to be up to 42% and may be especially pronounced when bolused during anesthesia induction. Compared with other anesthetics, propofol is associated with increased risks for bradycardia — in certain CICU patients, such as those with myocardial ischemia, this effect may be beneficial, while in others, such as those with aortic insufficiency, it may be undesirable. The mechanisms underlying hypotension are multifactorial. One proposed pathway is the inhibition of the L-type calcium channels and activation of nitric oxide synthetase, resulting in relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle and therefore a reduction of systemic vascular resistance. However, clinical data regarding propofol's hemodynamic consequences remain inconsistent and are mostly from retrospective studies.

Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioids

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including midazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. If a decision is made to use midazolam concomitantly with opioids, monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions).

Risk of Respiratory Adverse Events

Serious cardiorespiratory adverse events have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with a narcotic.

Individualization of Dosage

Midazolam must never be used without individualization of dosage particularly when used with other medications capable of producing central nervous system depression. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for complete information.

Other Adverse Events

Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions. Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding. Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients.

### Intrathecal midazolam II: combination with intrathecal fentanyl for labor pain [^115Fv8ct]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Recent investigations have sought to improve intrathecal analgesia by combining opioids with other classes of analgesics. In this study we assessed the ability of intrathecal midazolam to increase the potency and duration of the analgesic effects of intrathecal fentanyl without causing adverse effects. Thirty parturients with cervical dilations 2–6 cm were randomized to receive either intrathecal midazolam 2 mg, fentanyl 10 micro g, or both combined to initiate analgesia. Pain scores were recorded before and at 5-min intervals for 30 min after the injection and then every 30 minutes until the patient requested further analgesia. The presence and severity of nausea, emesis, pruritus, headache, and sedation, in addition to arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, sensory changes to ice, motor impairment, cardiotocograph, and Apgar score were also recorded. The parturients were assessed after 2 days and 1 mo for neurologic impairment. Preinjection pain scores were unaltered by intrathecal midazolam alone and moderately decreased by fentanyl. Intrathecal midazolam increased the analgesic effect of fentanyl. No treatment altered cardiorespiratory variables or caused motor impairment. The addition of intrathecal midazolam to fentanyl did not increase the occurrence of any maternal adverse event or abnormalities on the cardiotocograph. We conclude that intrathecal midazolam enhanced the analgesic effect of fentanyl without increasing maternal or fetal adverse effects.

Implications

Treatment of labor pain with epidural injections of local anesthetic is complicated by decreases in arterial blood pressure and leg weakness. This study showed that a mixture of two drugs, fentanyl and midazolam, could provide powerful pain relief when the drugs were given together spinally without such side effects.

### Midazolam (midazolam in sodium chloride) [^113LDUAN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.9 Risk of Hypotension and Seizure in Preterm Infants and Neonates

Rapid injection should be avoided in the neonatal population. Midazolam administered rapidly as an intravenous injection (i.e., less than 2 minutes) has been associated with severe hypotension in neonates, particularly when the patient has also received fentanyl. Likewise, severe hypotension has been observed in neonates receiving a continuous infusion of midazolam who then receive a rapid intravenous injection of fentanyl. Seizures have been reported in several neonates following rapid intravenous administration.

The neonate also has reduced and/or immature organ function and is also vulnerable to profound and/or prolonged respiratory effects of midazolam.

5.10 Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome

Receiving Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate. Monitor neonates exposed to Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and manage these neonates accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.11 Pediatric Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans [see Nonclinical Pharmacology (13.2)].

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

### A placebo-and midazolam-controlled phase I single ascending-dose study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of remimazolam (CNS 7056): part I. safety, efficacy, and basic pharmacokinetics [^114MyK4S]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A new benzodiazepine, remimazolam, metabolized by tissue esterases to an inactive compound, CNS 7054, has been developed to permit a fast onset, a short and more predictable duration of sedative action, and a more rapid recovery profile than with currently available benzodiazepines. We report on the safety and efficacy of the first human study.

Methods

A phase I, single-center, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, randomized, single-dose escalation study was conducted. Up to 10 cohorts of healthy subjects were scheduled to receive a single 1-minute IV infusion of remimazolam, midazolam, or placebo. In the 10 possible cohorts, remimazolam doses were from 0.01 to 0.35 mg/kg. In cohorts 1 to 3, 6 subjects received remimazolam and 1 placebo. From cohort 4 onward, an additional 3 subjects in each cohort received midazolam (0.075 mg/kg). Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics were measured. A stop criterion of loss of consciousness for > 5 minutes in > 50% of subjects was predefined.

Results

The stop criterion was reached in cohort 9 (0.30 mg/kg remimazolam) so that 81 subjects were enrolled. Remimazolam was well tolerated in all dose cohorts, and no serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Three AEs of mild (Spo(2) 85%-88%) hemoglobin desaturation (2 in the remimazolam groups and 1 in the midazolam group) resolved spontaneously, and 1 AE of moderate hemoglobin desaturation (Spo(2) 75%) resolved with a chin lift in the highest remimazolam dose group. No supplemental oxygen or manual ventilation was required. Vital signs remained stable throughout, although there was an increase in heart rate 2 minutes postdose for both remimazolam and midazolam. There were no reports of hypo- or hypertension. The pharmacokinetic behavior of remimazolam was linear and its systemic clearance approximately 3 times that of midazolam. Clearance was essentially independent of body weight. A rapid onset and dose-dependent sedation was observed after administration of remimazolam at 0.05 mg/kg and higher. Remimazolam (0.075 to 0.20 mg/kg) induced peak sedation levels similar to or higher than those achieved with midazolam (0.075 mg/kg). Median recovery times after approximately equieffective doses of remimazolam (0.10 and 0.15 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.075 mg/kg) were 10 and 40 minutes, respectively.

Conclusions

Remimazolam provided sedation with rapid onset and offset, and was well tolerated. There was no supplemental oxygen or ventilation required. On the basis of these data, further studies on the potential utility of remimazolam for sedation/anesthesia are warranted.

### Preoperative intravenous midazolam: benefits beyond anxiolysis [^117R6HyV]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the effect of midazolam on the global perioperative experience, including patient satisfaction, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative pain, and perioperative anxiety and amnesia.

Design

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.

Setting

Ambulatory surgical center affiliated with a tertiary-care hospital.

Patients

88 ASA physical status I, II, and III patients scheduled for outpatient surgery.

Interventions

Patients were randomized into two groups to receive either 0.04 mg/kg of midazolam or placebo intravenously (IV) 20 minutes preoperatively.

Measurements

Perioperative measurements included blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation and the patient's level of anxiety; type of anesthetic administered; the anesthesiologist's guess at the treatment arm; perioperative dosages of fentanyl, morphine, and ondansetron; recovery room length of stay; frequency of nausea and vomiting, and level of postoperative pain in the 24 hours after surgery; the patient's overall satisfaction with the anesthetic, and whether the patient would recommend the premedication to a friend.

Main Results

Patient demographics, type of surgery/anesthesia, vital signs, case duration, recovery duration, and postoperative pain were all similar between the midazolam and placebo groups. As expected, IV midazolam was an effective anxiolytic. There was no evidence of retrograde amnesia. Fewer patients in the midazolam group suffered from postoperative nausea than did those in the placebo group (25%vs. 50%; p = 0.03), despite receiving similar perioperative antiemetic and opioid administration. Similarly, fewer patients in the midazolam group experienced postoperative vomiting than placebo group patients (8%vs. 21%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Only 42% of patients in the placebo group would recommend their premedication to a friend, compared with 85% of patients in the midazolam group (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In addition to the known anxiolytic effects of midazolam, midazolam premedication is an effective way to reduce the frequency of postoperative nausea, and perhaps vomiting, and increase patient satisfaction.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.

In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway maintenance. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.

### Midazolam hydrochloride (midazolam in sodium chloride) [^113q574z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Risk of Hypotension and Seizure in Preterm Infants and Neonates

Rapid injection should be avoided in the neonatal population. Midazolam administered rapidly as an intravenous injection (i.e., less than 2 minutes) has been associated with severe hypotension in neonates, particularly when the patient has also received fentanyl. Likewise, severe hypotension has been observed in neonates receiving a continuous infusion of midazolam who then receive a rapid intravenous injection of fentanyl. Seizures have been reported in several neonates following rapid intravenous administration.

The neonate also has reduced and/or immature organ function and is also vulnerable to profound and/or prolonged respiratory effects of midazolam.

5.10 Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome

Receiving Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate. Monitor neonates exposed to Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and manage these neonates accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.11 Pediatric Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans [see Nonclinical Pharmacology (13.2)].

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

### Effects of age and gender on intravenous midazolam premedication: a randomized double-blind study [^115szHJX]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Given the potentially important effects that age and gender may have on midazolam premedication, this study aimed at determining if these factors alter anxiety, sedation, and cardiorespiratory outcomes when administering two different doses of i.v. midazolam.

Methods

After randomization, patients were premedicated 1 h before surgery with either i.v. midazolam 0.02 or 0.06 mg kg(-1) depending on their age and gender group. Levels of anxiety and sedation, heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), mean blood pressure (MBP), and oxygen saturation (Sp(O2)) were measured before and 15 min after midazolam administration.

Results

A higher level of preoperative anxiety was more often observed in women than in men, and in young than in older patients. The female or younger patients showed significant anxiolytic benefits from midazolam. A deeper sedation level was found in men compared with women. Forty-two of 45 patients (93.3%) with excessive sedation received midazolam 0.06 mg kg(-1). The elderly patients receiving midazolam 0.06 mg kg(-1) showed significant reductions in MBP, RR, and Sp(O2). Of the patients with an Sp(O2) < 90%, 72.7% had received midazolam 0.06 mg kg(-1).

Conclusions

Age and gender differences in neuropsychological and physiological responses after midazolam premedication were evident. Midazolam is effective for producing sedation and anxiolysis at a dose of 0.02 mg kg(-1), with minimal effects on cardiorespiration and oxygen saturation to patients. Dosage adjustments based on these covariates are, therefore, necessary.

### The effects of propofol-midazolam-ketamine co-induction on hemodynamic changes and catecholamine response [^113T4Aax]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To compare the clinical efficacy of co-induction with propofol-midazolam-ketamine with etomidate as the sole induction agent.

Design

Prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Operating room of a university hospital.

Patients

60 ASA physical status 1 and 2 patients scheduled for limited elective surgery requiring general anesthesia.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to two groups to receive etomidate 0.3 mg/kg (single-drug group) or propofol 0.6 mg/kg + ketamine 0.8 mg/kg + midazolam 0.06 mg/kg (three-drug group).

Measurements

Hemodynamic responses (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure) were examined at baseline and at one, three, and 5 minutes after tracheal intubation. Plasma catecholamine levels were measured at baseline, one, and 5 minutes after tracheal intubation.

Main Results

Heart rate (HR) changes differed significantly between the two groups at three minutes (P = 0.01) and 5 minutes (P = 0.00) after tracheal intubation. However, the HR increase in the three-drug group was in the acceptable range. Percentage changes of epinephrine level differed between the two groups at 5 minutes after tracheal intubation (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

The higher norepinephrine/epinephrine ratio noted in the single-drug group may be implicated in lower adrenal sympathetic activity. Propofol-midazolam-ketamine co-induction may be used instead of etomidate for anesthesia induction in patients with hemodynamic instability.

### The efficacy of simulated intravascular test dose in sedated patients [^111r4zvv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Sedation usually decreases the reliability of subjectively detecting an intravascular test dose, but the efficacies of objective hemodynamic and T-wave criteria remain undetermined. Sixty healthy patients were randomly assigned to receive IV midazolam in 1-mg increments until they were lightly sedated, fentanyl 2 microg/kg followed by incremental midazolam until they were similarly sedated, or no sedative (n = 20 each). Then, normal saline 3 mL was administered IV, followed 4 min later by 1.5% lidocaine 3 mL plus epinephrine 15 microg (1:200,000) in all subjects. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured by a radial arterial catheter, and lead II of the electrocardiogram were continuously recorded for 4 min after the saline and test dose injections. An IV test dose produced significant increases in HR and SBP and decreases in T-wave amplitude in all subjects. However, the mean maximum increase in HR in patients sedated with midazolam plus fentanyl (31 ± 14 bpm [mean ± SD]) was significantly less than in those administered midazolam alone or no sedative (42 ± 12 and 44 ± 10 bpm, respectively; P < 0.05). A sensitivity of 100% was obtained on the basis of the traditional HR criterion (positive if ≥ 20 bpm increase) in patients sedated with midazolam or no sedative, but it was 70% in those with midazolam plus fentanyl (P < 0.05 versus the other two groups). Irrespective of the treatment, sensitivities and specificities of 100% were obtained according to the SBP (positive if ≥ 15 mm Hg increase) and T-wave (positive if ≥ 25% decrease in amplitude) criteria. An increase in SBP and a decrease in T-wave amplitude are more reliable than an HR response for detecting accidental intravascular injection of the epinephrine-containing test dose in subjects sedated with midazolam and fentanyl.

Implications

To determine whether an epidural catheter is in a blood vessel, an epidural test dose containing 15 microg epinephrine is used. We found that an increase in systolic blood pressure and a decrease in T-wave amplitude seem to be more reliable than a heart rate change for detecting inadvertent intravascular injection of an epinephrine-containing test dose in patients sedated with midazolam and fentanyl.

### Anticonvulsant effectiveness and hemodynamic safety of midazolam in full-term infants treated with hypothermia [^111DwN7o]. Neonatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Midazolam is used as an anticonvulsant in neonatology, including newborns with perinatal asphyxia treated with hypothermia. Hypothermia may affect the safety and effectiveness of midazolam in these patients.

Objectives

The objective was to evaluate the anticonvulsant effectiveness and hemodynamic safety of midazolam in hypothermic newborns and to provide dosing guidance.

Methods

Hypothermic newborns with perinatal asphyxia and treated with midazolam were included. Effectiveness was studied using continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalography. Hemodynamic safety was assessed using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling with plasma samples and blood pressure recordings (mean arterial blood pressure) under hypothermia.

Results

No effect of therapeutic hypothermia on pharmacokinetics could be identified. Add-on seizure control with midazolam was limited (23% seizure control). An inverse relationship between the midazolam plasma concentration and mean arterial blood pressure could be identified. At least one hypotensive episode was experienced in 64%. The concomitant use of inotropes decreased midazolam clearance by 33%.

Conclusions

Under therapeutic hypothermia, midazolam has limited add-on clinical anticonvulsant effectiveness after phenobarbital administration. Due to occurrence of hypotension requiring inotropic support, midazolam is less suitable as a second-line anticonvulsant drug under hypothermia.

### Midazolam in sodium chloride [^112FdMVW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids, Other Sedative Hypnotics, or Other Central Nervous System Depressants

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Titrate the dose of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative- hypnotics to the desired clinical response.

Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension, airway obstruction, hypoventilation, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and ASA‑PS III or IV patients.

Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.

5.3 Risk of Cardiorespiratory Adverse Reactions

Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with an opioid. Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and/or arrest. When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population. Continuously monitor patients for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea using capnography, pulse oximetry, and clinical assessment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Spinal cord blood flow change by intravenous midazolam during isoflurane anesthesia [^111sg1cf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

We investigated the effects of IV midazolam on spinal cord blood flow in 32 cats anesthetized with isoflurane. Cats underwent laminectomy, and the lumbar spinal cord was exposed. A platinum electrode was inserted stereotaxically into the spinal cord to a depth of 1 mm-2 mm lateral to midline at L2. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and spinal cord blood flow (using the hydrogen clearance method) were measured before and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after an IV bolus of midazolam (0, 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg in saline 5 mL; n = 8 cats per dose). Arterial blood pressure was not affected by 0 or 1 mg/kg of midazolam but was decreased for 30 min by 2 or 4 mg/kg of midazolam. Heart rate did not change. Spinal cord blood flow was increased for 90 min by midazolam 1 mg/kg and for 15 min by midazolam 2 mg/kg but was not changed by midazolam 4 mg/kg. In conclusion, 1 mg/kg of midazolam increased feline spinal cord blood flow without changing arterial blood pressure. In contrast, a larger dose of midazolam (4 mg/kg) did not change spinal cord blood flow but substantially decreased arterial blood pressure during isoflurane anesthesia.

### Benzodiazepine consumption is associated with lower blood pressure in ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM): retrospective analysis of 4938 ABPMs [^114mruo5]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of chronic benzodiazepine use on blood pressure has not been documented. We aimed to evaluate whether regular benzodiazepine use can be associated to the results of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).

Methods

A retrospective analysis of the ABPM database between 2009 and 2015 was performed. The study groups were divided according to benzodiazepine treatment at least 3 months before ABPM. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model analysis was conducted to estimate the association between benzodiazepine treatment and ABPM test measurements. Multivariable COX regression survival analysis model for mortality and cardiovascular (CV) events was performed.

Results

A total of 4,938 ABPM studies were included in final analysis, 670 ABPMs of benzodiazepine-treated patients, and 4,268 of untreated patients. The benzodiazepine-treated group was significantly older, with a predominance of female patients, comprised more diabetic patients and consumed more antihypertensive medications. Adjustment for age, gender, diabetes mellitus, and number of antihypertensive medications, showed an association between benzodiazepine treatment and significantly lower ABPM measurements. When the analysis was split into those ≥ 60 years old and the other < 60 years old, regular benzodiazepine consumption was associated with lower ABPM measurements only among ≥ 60 years old. Multivariable Cox regression survival analysis showed that regular benzodiazepine consumption was not associated with increased mortality or CV events (mean follow-up period of 42.4 ± 19.8 and 42.1 ± 20.0 months, respectively).

Conclusions

Long-term use of benzodiazepines by ≥ 60 years old was independently associated with lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure in all parameters of ABPM, but not among younger patients.

### Comparison of hypotension incidence between remimazolam and propofol in patients with hypertension undergoing neurosurgery: prospective, randomized, single-blind trial [^116e9wrn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the most common concomitant disease encountered by anesthesiologists. In patients with hypertension, a rapid decline in blood pressure may occur during the induction phase. These patients are at increased risk of organ damage caused by inadequate blood flow during episodes of low blood pressure. Therefore, maintaining stable hemodynamics is crucial for hypertensive patients compared with those with normal blood pressure. Additionally, blood pressure may increase excessively in stressful situations, such as intubation, pinning, or surgical incision. Elevated blood pressure may cause myocardial ischemia and infarction due to increased cardiac workload. In particular, a decrease in diastolic BP causes a reduction in cerebral and myocardial perfusion. Moreover, intraoperative hypotension has been reported to be associated with postoperative complications, including acute kidney and myocardial injury.

The conventional method for intraoperative total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) involves the use of propofol and opioids. TIVA provides a feasible setting for intraoperative evoked potential monitoring of brain tumors. Propofol, the first-choice anesthetic drug for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia, has drawbacks, including vasodilation, decreased cardiac output, and a higher likelihood of hypotension in high-risk patients.

Remimazolam, a newer benzodiazepine used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia or procedural sedation, acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the γ-aminobutyric acid subtype A (GABA A) receptor via the benzodiazepine-binding site. Benzodiazepines have been typically administered to patients with hemodynamic instability or comorbidities to reduce the risk of hypotension during the induction phase. Therefore, it is expected that blood pressure will be maintained more stably when remimazolam is used. However, various studies have reported different results regarding hypotension. We aimed to determine whether propofol or remimazolam leads to stable vital signs during the induction period.

### Sevoflurane — sevoflurane, — volatile for inhalation [^1125d4Qr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

During the maintenance of anesthesia, increasing the concentration of sevoflurane produces dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure. Due to sevoflurane insolubility in blood, these hemodynamic changes may occur more rapidly than with other volatile anesthetics. Excessive decreases in blood pressure or respiratory depression may be related to depth of anesthesia and may be corrected by decreasing the inspired concentration of sevoflurane. Rare cases of seizures have been reported in association with sevoflurane use (see PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric Use, ADVERSE REACTIONS).

The recovery from general anesthesia should be assessed carefully before a patient is discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit.

Information for Patients

Risk of Driving and Operating Machinery

Advise patients that performance of activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, may be impaired after sevoflurane anesthesia (see WARNINGS).

Effect of Anesthetic and Sedation Drugs on Early Brain Development

Studies conducted in young animals and children suggest repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains. Discuss with parents and caregivers the benefits, risks, and timing and duration of surgery or procedures requiring anesthetic and sedation drugs (see WARNINGS - Pediatric Neurotoxicity).

Drug Interactions

In clinical studies, no significant adverse reactions occurred with other drugs commonly used in the perioperative period, including central nervous system depressants, autonomic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, anti-infective agents, hormones and synthetic substitutes, blood derivatives, and cardiovascular drugs.

Epinephrine

Epinephrine administered with sevoflurane may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Monitor the electrocardiogram and blood pressure and ensure emergency medications to treat ventricular arrhythmias are readily available.

Calcium Antagonists

Sevoflurane may lead to marked hypotension in patients treated with calcium antagonists. Blood pressure should be closely monitored and emergency medications to treat hypotension should be readily available when calcium antagonists are used concomitantly with sevoflurane.

In animals, impairment of atrioventricular conduction has been observed when verapamil and sevoflurane are administered concomitantly.

Succinylcholine

See WARNINGS - Perioperative Hyperkalemia.

Non-selective MAO-inhibitors

Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors and inhalational anesthetics may increase the risk of hemodynamic instability during surgery or medical procedures.

Intravenous Anesthetics

Sevoflurane administration is compatible with barbiturates, propofol, and other commonly used intravenous anesthetics.

Benzodiazepines and Opioids

Benzodiazepines and opioids would be expected to decrease the MAC of sevoflurane in the same manner as with other inhalational anesthetics. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with benzodiazepines and opioids as commonly used in surgical practice.

### Pharmacokinetics during therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy: a literature review [^1115JUpG]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Midazolam

A model compound of a drug metabolised by a CYP450 enzyme is midazolam, converted by CYP3A to 1-hydroxymidazolam and successively to 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide (HMG), both of which are sedative and further excreted by renal route. Midazolam is used as an add-on antiepileptic drug when seizure control with phenobarbital monotherapy is inadequate and provides an additional 23% of patients with seizure control. Intriguingly, none of the studies on midazolam showed an effect of TH on midazolam clearance. However, Favié et al reported on a significant reduction of the clearance of HMG (8.6%/°C), likely reflecting the impact of renal impairment(table 2c). Midazolam is usually concomitantly used with phenobarbital, which is an inducer of CYP3A. This effect has been quantified, so that midazolam metabolic clearance is increased by 2.33-fold during comedication with phenobarbital. Thus, if another antiepileptic drug is used as a first-line agent instead of phenobarbital, the dose of midazolam should be reduced by about 50%. A point of attention is the occurrence of hypotension during treatment with midazolam as blood pressure and plasma concentrations of midazolam have a direct relationship, with blood pressure dropping by 3.6 mm Hg for every increase in plasma concentration of 0.1 mg/L.

Lidocaine

If there is still no seizure control after adding midazolam, lidocaine can be added as a third-line treatment, which is effective in 91% of the patients where seizure control could not be achieved with phenobarbital and midazolam alone. Lidocaine is a drug frequently used as a local anaesthetic or antiarrhythmic agent and is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A into the active monoethylglycinexylidide and subsequently glycinexylidide, which is an inactive metabolite. The clearance of lidocaine was shown to be decreased by 24% (or 8.0%/°C) during TH. The extent of the impact of TH on lidocaine PK has recently been confirmed (decrease 21%, 7.26%/°C) in a further extended cohort of patients, including 49 neonates undergoing TH (prospective validation).

### Midazolam in 0.8% sodium chloride [^115k3Dkq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation

Prior to the intravenous administration of midazolam in any dose, ensure the immediate availability of oxygen, resuscitative drugs, age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/ valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and skilled personnel for the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation.
Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation, and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, should administer Midazolam in Sodium Chloride Injection.
Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and apnea, including the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation.
Continuously monitor patients for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea, with means readily available (e.g., pulse oximetry). Hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea can lead to hypoxia and/or cardiac arrest unless effective countermeasures are taken immediately.
A benzodiazepine reversal agent (i.e., flumazenil) should be immediately available during administration of Midazolam in Sodium Chloride Injection.
Continuously monitor vital signs during the recovery period. Because intravenous midazolam can depress respiration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)], especially when used concomitantly with opioid agonists and other sedatives [see Dosage and Administration (2)], it should be used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia only in the presence of personnel skilled in early detection of hypoventilation, maintaining a patent airway, and supporting ventilation.

5.2 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids, Other Sedative Hypnotics, or Other Central Nervous System Depressants

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Titrate the dose of Midazolam in Sodium Chloride Injection when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response.

Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension, airway obstruction, hypoventilation, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and ASA-PS III or IV patients.

Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation.

These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with an opioid.

Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and/or arrest. When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population. Continuously monitor patients for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea using capnography, pulse oximetry, and clinical assessment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.4 Risk of Paradoxical Behavior

Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions. Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding. Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients.

### Effect of nitrous oxide on cisatracurium infusion demands: a randomized controlled trial [^115ZHmcm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

The patients received oral premedication consisting of 3.75–7.5 mg midazolam approximately 1 hour prior to induction of anesthesia. All patients received total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using target controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. One group of patients received a mixture of air with 30% oxygen (Air/TIVA group) and the other group received nitrous oxide with 30% oxygen (Nitrous oxide/TIVA group). The patients were randomly assigned to one of these groups, each group consisting of 35 patients. The initial target of propofol was set at 4 μg/ml and if necessary adjusted to 6 μg/ml for adequate induction. After induction the target was maintained at 4 μg/ml until the end of surgery. The target of remifentanil was initially set at 2 ng/ml and later adjusted between 1.5–6 ng/ml, according to clinical needs. A decrease in systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg or a decrease in mean blood pressure below 55 mmHg, respectively, was treated by decreasing the target of remifentanil to a minimum level of 1.5 ng/ml. In addition, the patients received rapid infusion of Ringer's acetate solution and/or 5–10 mg of intravenous ephedrine, when considered necessary. In hypertensive patients treatment of hypotension was initiated if a 30% decrease in blood pressure was detected. Fresh gas flow was kept at 10 l/min until tracheal intubation, using the above mentioned gas mixtures. During maintenance of anesthesia gas flow was set at 5 l/min, with the end-tidal nitrous oxide concentration kept above 65% in the patients receiving nitrous oxide.

Prior to the intravenous administration of midazolam hydrochloride in any dose, the immediate availability of oxygen, resuscitative drugs, age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and skilled personnel for the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation should be ensured. Patients should be continuously monitored for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea with means readily available (e.g., pulse oximetry). Hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea can lead to hypoxia and/or cardiac arrest unless effective countermeasures are taken immediately. The immediate availability of specific reversal agents (flumazenil) is highly recommended. Vital signs should continue to be monitored during the recovery period. Because intravenous midazolam can depress respiration (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), especially when used concomitantly with opioid agonists and other sedatives (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), it should be used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia only in the presence of personnel skilled in early detection of hypoventilation, maintaining a patent airway, and supporting ventilation. When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for complete information).

### Microcirculatory alterations induced by sedation in intensive care patients. effects of midazolam alone and in association with sufentanil [^1143i7ME]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Sedation with midazolam alone or in association with sufentanil induces a deterioration of vasomotion and microvascular response to ischaemia. This raises the question of whether sedation may further alter tissue perfusion when already compromised, as in septic patients.

### Haemodynamic changes and heart rate variability during midazolam-propofol co-induction [^112cbWjB]. Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

In a prospective, blind, randomised study, we examined the effects of midazolam-propofol co-induction on haemodynamic (blood pressure, heart rate and stroke volume) and heart rate variability. The latter was measured by spectral analysis using the maximum-entropy method to calculate the following: the low frequency component (LF), which reflects both the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, the high frequency component (HF) and entropy, which reflects the cardiac parasympathetic activity, the total power (TP), calculated by the addition of LF and HF, and the LF/HF ratio, which reflects the balance between the cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity. Forty patients were randomly allocated to the propofol group and the midazolam-propofol group, and the parameters described above were calculated at baseline (T1), post induction (T2), after tracheal intubation (T3), and 3 min (T4) and 5 min after intubation (T5). Propofol was administered at 2.5 mg.kg(-1) in the propofol group and midazolam at 0.1 mg.kg(-1) followed by propofol at 1.5 mg.kg(-1) in the midazolam-propofol group for anaesthesia induction. Then, propofol was administered at 4–6 mg.kg(-1)propofol for maintenance in both groups. The midazolam-propofol group showed compensated haemodynamic changes, which were related to significant increases in the LF/HF ratio at T2, T4 and T5 (p = 0.011, 0.038 and 0.034). These results suggest that the midazolam-propofol combination yielded compensated modulatory effects on the cardiovascular system, including preserved baroreflex activity.

### Haemodynamic changes to a midazolam-fentanyl-rocuronium protocol for pre-hospital anaesthesia following return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest [^1142fdsT]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Following the return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, neurological dysfunction, airway or ventilatory compromise can impede transport to early percutaneous coronary intervention, necessitating pre-hospital or emergency department anaesthesia to facilitate this procedure. There are no published reports of the ideal induction agents in these patients. We sought to describe haemodynamic changes associated with induction of anaesthesia using a midazolam (0.1 mg.kg -1), fentanyl (2 μg.kg -1) and rocuronium (1 mg.kg -1) regimen developed using expert opinion, and adherence to the protocol by our pre-hospital teams. We performed a retrospective review of haemodynamic data recorded during induction of anaesthesia in patients following return of spontaneous circulation, over a 30-month period. We analysed the changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate using a repeated-measures design, as well as the rate of new hypotension or hypertension. Sixty-four patients had four consecutive measurements for analysis (one pre-induction and three post-induction). Systolic blood pressure at all three post-induction measurements was significantly lower than the pre-induction value. Heart rate did not differ between any time-points. New episodes of hypotension (systolic pressure < 90 mmHg) occurred in four (6%) patients at the first measurement post-induction (95%CI 2–15%) and 10 (16%) at the third measurement (95%CI 8–27%). Three patients (5%; 95%CI 1–13%) had a hypertensive response. The median (IQR[range]) dose of midazolam given at induction was 0.04 (0.03–0.05 [0.01 to 0.10]) mg.kg -1. Adherence to recommended fentanyl and rocuronium doses was high. Overall, systolic blood pressure was reduced following induction of anaesthesia, and systolic pressures < 90 mmHg occurred more often at measurements made later (up to 9 min) after induction. Changes in heart rate, and new hypertension were uncommon.

2.2 General Dosing Information

Individualize dosing and titrate to desired clinical response, taking into account patient age, clinical status, and concomitant use of other CNS depressants. Titrate to effect with multiple small doses while continuously monitoring respiratory and cardiac function (i.e., pulse oximetry). To minimize the potential for oversedation, allow adequate time between doses to achieve peak central nervous system effect (3 to 5 minutes).

Adults and Pediatrics:

Sedation guidelines recommend a careful presedation history to determine how a patient's underlying medical conditions or concomitant medications might affect their response to sedation/analgesia as well as a physical examination including a focused examination of the airway for abnormalities. Further recommendations include appropriate presedation fasting.

Pediatrics:

Pediatric patients generally require higher dosages of midazolam (mg/kg) than adults. For deeply sedated pediatric patients a dedicated individual, other than the practitioner performing the procedure, should monitor the patient throughout the procedure.

Elderly and Debilitated Patients

Intravenous doses of midazolam should be decreased for elderly and for debilitated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. These patients will also probably take longer to recover completely after midazolam administration for the induction of anesthesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Monitoring

Patient response to sedative agents, and resultant respiratory status, is variable. Regardless of the intended level of sedation or route of administration, sedation is a continuum; a patient may move easily from light to deep sedation, with potential loss of protective reflexes. This is especially true in pediatric patients. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and through the recovery period [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.].

2.3 Dosing Recommendations

2.4 Safe Discontinuation of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection After Long-Term Use

If Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is administered long-term (for several days to weeks), do not abruptly discontinue. Gradually taper the dosage in physically-dependent patients using a tapering schedule that is individualized to the patient. (see Warnings and Precautions (5.5).

### Perioperative dexmedetomidine for outpatient cataract surgery: a systematic review [^114hUXCh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters

Cardiovascular depression was noted with dexmedetomidine as evidenced by statistically significant decreases in arterial pressure, heart rate, or both. Administration of dexmedetomidine by continuous infusion without initial bolus was not associated with statistically significant decreases in arterial pressure when compared to remifentanil, midazolam, and saline. However, when compared to propofol-alfentanil (combination of propofol and alfentanil), dexmedetomidine infusion titrated to RSS 3 without initial bolus dose led to statistically significant decreases in systolic blood pressure intraoperatively and postoperatively. Additionally, hypotension was reported as an adverse event in 5 patients spanning 2 studies that used continuous infusions of dexmedetomidine at 0.4 mcg•kg − 1
- hr. − 1 and 0.6 mcg•kg − 1
- hr. − 1 without initial boluses; arterial pressures that defined hypotension in these studies, however, were not specifically provided. Omitting a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine was not associated with preserved arterial pressure or heart rate in any of the studies included in this review. Table 3 displays the effects of dexmedetomidine on arterial pressure and heart rate compared to other study medications and placebo.

### The timing of administration of intravenous dexmedetomidine during lower limb surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^114VPaF4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Spinal anesthesia (SA) is commonly used for lower limb surgery because it has a high success rate and can maintain spontaneous ventilation. The hemodynamic instability such as hypotension and bradycardia are the most common side effects with SA. It may be increased when sedatives is used with SA for decreasing patients' anxiety.

Patients want to be sedated during painful procedures such as spinal tapping. Pre-sedation of patients can be an important factor in the quality of SA. Propofol, midazolam, and dexmedetomidine (DEX) have been commonly used for sedation during SA. Propofol is a profound respiratory depressant and midazolam has a slight synergistic ventilatory depressive effect with SA. DEX, a selective α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, causes minimal or no respiratory depression, unlike other sedatives.

Intravenous DEX as a rapid infusion caused biphasic changes in heart rate (HR) and mean blood pressure (MBP). Dyck et al. found a 22% rise in the MBP and a 27% decline in the HR within 4–5 min after starting intravenous infusion of DEX. Although they infused DEX at a high dose (2 μg/kg for 5 min), the administration of a bolus of 1 μg/kg DEX initially causes an increase in BP for a brief period.

Also, DEX has anxiolytic effects and there is growing interest in comparing efficacy, time to onset, and outcomes between DEX and other anxiolytics such as midazolam. DEX was as effective as higher dose (0.06 mg/kg) of midazolam in preoperative sedation. Anxiety-like behavior is reduced by decreases in the circulating catecholamine secretion after the administration of DEX.

Therefore, we evaluated the hemodynamic effects and patients' anxiety and comfort level according to the timing of administration of DEX with SA.

Table 3
Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Arterial Pressure, Heart Rate, and Respiratory Parameters

a SBP systolic blood pressure, b SD standard deviation; c mm Hg millimeters mercury, d HR heart rate, e MAP mean arterial pressure, f SE standard error, g SpO 2 blood oxygen saturation, h ETCO 2 end-tidal carbon dioxide, i DBP diastolic blood pressure, j ketofol ketamine and propofol

Heart rate was preserved in 2 studies that did not administer a bolus dose of dexmedetomidine. However, one study comparing the effects of dexmedetomidine to midazolam or saline in 90 patients did not bolus dexmedetomidine, and reported statistically significant decreases in intraoperative and postoperative heart rates. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse event in 5 studies and frequently required atropine treatment.

No statistically significant differences in oxygen saturation (SpO 2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) values, or respiratory rates were reported in studies investigating the respiratory effects of dexmedetomidine compared to saline; no sedation; midazolam and fentanyl; propofol and alfentanil; and ketamine and propofol (ketofol). However, there were inconsistent results among studies investigating changes in ETCO 2 and SpO 2 when comparing dexmedetomidine to midazolam, placebo, and remifentanil. One study demonstrated statistically significant decreases in oxygen saturation with IM dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg compared to midazolam 20 mcg/kg and placebo. Better ventilation as evidenced by lower ETCO 2 values and increased respiratory rates was noted in dexmedetomidine-treated patients compared to those receiving remifentanil titrated to a target effect site concentration of 1 ng/ml. However, another study comparing dexmedetomidine to remifentanil infusion at 0.05 mcg•kg − 1
- min − 1 reported statistically significant decreases in oxygen saturation in dexmedetomidine-treated patients 35–45 min after induction.

### LY3522348, A new ketohexokinase inhibitor: a first-in-human study in healthy adults [^113z4tnG]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Safety Analyses

No deaths, other serious adverse events, or AEs leading to treatment or study discontinuation were reported during this study.

Safety in SAD Study

Overall, nine treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported in the SAD study. Eight TEAEs were reported for eight participants who received LY3522348, and one TEAE was reported for one participant who received a placebo (Table 2). All TEAEs reported in the SAD study were mild, except for one event of presyncope in the 15 mg LY3522348 group. The investigator considered one TEAE of nausea and one of myalgia to be related to LY3522348. TEAEs in the SAD study were not associated with increasing the LY3522348 dose. No clinically significant differences in vital signs or trends in ECG parameters were noted in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, but there was an apparent decrease in supine pulse rate in the 380 mg treatment group compared to placebo and lower doses of LY3522348.

a 200 μg midazolam was administered on day − 1 and day 15; Adverse events with a change of severity are only counted one time at the highest severity

Safety in MAD Study

Overall, eight TEAEs were reported for three participants in the 120 mg treatment group (Table 2). All TEAEs reported in the MAD study were mild. Among the TEAE events, three events of headache and one event each of constipation and decreased appetite were considered to be possibly related to LY3522348 by the investigator. TEAEs in the MAD study were not associated with increasing the LY3522348 dose. On days 1, 7, and 14, among all the cohorts in the MAD study, mean supine systolic blood pressure was comparable to the readings at baseline. However, on day 14, a dose-related decrease in supine diastolic blood pressure was noted in participants in the three cohorts who were administered LY3522348 with or without midazolam. On days 1 and 7, no drug-related trends in ECG parameters were observed in participants administered LY3522348 up to 290 mg compared to placebo.

### Midazolam in sodium chloride [^113Mww5r]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Risk of Hypotension and Seizure in Preterm Infants and Neonates

Rapid injection should be avoided in the neonatal population. Midazolam administered rapidly as an intravenous injection (i.e., less than 2 minutes) has been associated with severe hypotension in neonates, particularly when the patient has also received fentanyl. Likewise, severe hypotension has been observed in neonates receiving a continuous infusion of midazolam who then receive a rapid intravenous injection of fentanyl. Seizures have been reported in several neonates following rapid intravenous administration.

The neonate also has reduced and/or immature organ function and is also vulnerable to profound and/or prolonged respiratory effects of midazolam.

5.10 Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome

Receiving Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate. Monitor neonates exposed to Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and manage these neonates accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.11 Pediatric Neurotoxicity

Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans [see Nonclinical Pharmacology (13.2)].

Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.

Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.

### Mechanisms involved in the relaxing effect of midazolam on coronary arteries [^113SYTvR]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Hypotension, especially in elderly and hypovolaemic patients, is frequently associated with intravenous midazolam administration. The mechanisms are not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the relaxing effect of midazolam on coronary arteries.

Methods

The substance was studied in isolated porcine coronary artery rings precontracted by either potassium chloride or prostaglandin F2alpha.

Results

Midazolam caused vasodilatation in a concentration-dependent manner. Relaxation was more pronounced in prostaglandin F2alpha precontracted segments than in those treated with potassium chloride (P < 0.001). Vasodilatation was unaffected by Nomega-nitro-L-arginine, indomethacin and glibenclamide. Tetraethylammonium chloride, an inhibitor of the BK(Ca) K+ channel (a high conductance Ca(2+)-sensitive K+ channel), dose dependently attenuated the vasodilating effect of midazolam (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cell in the vessel wall, elicited by the activation the BK(Ca) K+ channel, may contribute to the vasorelaxing effect of midazolam.

### What you should know about xylazine | Overdose prevention… [^114btiWV]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Xylazine A tranquilizer called xylazine, a non-opioid sedative, is increasingly being found in the US illegal drug supply and linked to overdose deaths. Xylazine — which is not approved for use in people and can slow down the brain and breathing, make the heart beat slower, and lower blood pressure in people, is especially dangerous when combined with opioids like fentanyl. When used in people, xylazine can cause:

- Sedation
- Difficulty breathing
- Dangerously low blood pressure
- Slowed heart rate
- Wounds that can become infected
- Severe withdrawal symptoms
- Death How are people exposed to xylazine. Give rescue breaths. First responders have reported that rescue breaths are especially helpful for people who have used xylazine because use causes breathing to slow down. To give rescue breaths to adults, make sure the person's airway is clear; place one hand on the person's chin, tilt the head back, and pinch the nose closed.

Place your mouth over the person's mouth to make a seal and give two slow breaths. Watch for the person's chest to rise and follow up with one breath every 5 seconds. Because xylazine is often mixed with opioids like fentanyl, naloxone should be given in response to a suspected overdose to reverse any possible opioid effects. Importantly, naloxone will not reverse effects of xylazine. In the event of an overdose, call 911 for additional medical treatment. Provide rescue breaths. Rescue breaths are especially helpful for people who have used xylazine since xylazine causes breathing to slow down. Harm reduction experts also suggest rolling individuals on their side, into the recovery position. Know the risks of using illegal drugs with unknown ingredients. Illegal drugs are unregulated — they don't come with an ingredients list.

More than one dose of naloxone may be required to restore normal breathing, and in cases involving xylazine, rescue breaths should be given. Provide test strips for people who use drugs as part of community drug checking programs. These are key opportunities to educate people who use drugs about the increasing presence of xylazine. First responders to overdoses: Consider xylazine as a contributor tooverdose when naloxone administration is ineffective. Provide rescue breaths. Rescue breaths are an especially helpful intervention for people who have used xylazine since use causes breathing to slow down.

### Arterial stiffness and general anesthesia induced hypotension… [^113ZvqmC]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

Arterial Stiffness and General Anesthesia Induced Hypotension in Patients on Angiotensin-converting Enzyme InhibitorsClinicalTrials. gov ID. Previous studies have shown that patients chronically taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have a higher incidence of developing hypotension under general anesthesia as well as being refractory to adrenergic vasoconstrictor medications given to help restore systemic blood pressure. Interestingly, not all patients taking ACE inhibitors have shown the described hemodynamic response after induction of general anesthesia. Previous studies demonstrate that patients chronically treated with angiotensin converting enzyme -inhibitors have higher incidence of developing hypotension after induction of general anesthesia, which typically, can be restored with small doses of adrenergic drugs such as phenylephrine to acceptable blood pressure levels.

However, some patients that develop hypotension may be refractory to those medications, which in turn poses a significant challenge in controlling the hemodynamics of patients. The consequence of the severe hypotension could be canceled surgery, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or even death. If the systolic pressure drops below 90 mmHg or more than 25% from baseline, the patient will be classified in the study as "Hypotensive. " Conversely, if the patient's systolic blood pressure does not drop below 90 mmHg more than 25% from baseline within 10 minutes of intubation, the patient will be classified as "Not Hypotensive". If the patient's systolic blood pressure rises above 25% the baseline value, the anesthesiologist will administer a bolus of 0. 5mg/kg of propofol. This bolus will be repeated after the minute blood pressure evaluations until the systolic blood pressure back to the baseline value.

These patients will be classified as "Not Hypotensive, " but the administration of propofol will be noted. If over 200µg phenylephrine has been used without a return of the systolic brachial blood pressure > 90 mmHg or more than 25% from baseline, the patient will be classified in the study as "Refractory Hypotensive. " The study environment will be ended and the provider can use whatever vasoactive drugs they deem appropriate, including more phenylephrine, ephedrine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, or vasopressin, and/or fluid bolus.
