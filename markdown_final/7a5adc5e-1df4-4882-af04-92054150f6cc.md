High co2

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing "high CO2", i.e., hypercapnia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis with appropriate blood gas sampling and acid-base interpretation. Then, I should verify chronicity and classify acute versus chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Next, I will consider common etiologies such as COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and ARDS. After that, I need to stratify severity and acuity to guide escalation. Then, I will outline initial and advanced ventilatory strategies, oxygen titration, and special situations like ECMO/ECCO2R. Finally, I should define monitoring, goals of care, and pediatric considerations, and I will keep checking each step against guideline-based evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions based on a single elevated end-tidal CO2 or transcutaneous value; I need to obtain an arterial blood gas to define PaCO2 and pH because acid-base status dictates management and urgency, and venous pCO2 cannot reliably substitute for arterial measurement in ventilatory assessment [^112BnKSQ]. I should double-check that pH and pCO2 move in opposite directions to identify a primary respiratory acidosis and then assess the expected bicarbonate compensation to determine if there is a mixed disorder, as this influences therapy and prognosis [^115PgMxh] [^114q1bzp].

> Wait, let me verify chronicity before I treat; chronic hypercapnia often reflects renal compensation with elevated serum bicarbonate and near-normal pH, whereas acute hypercapnia typically shows low bicarbonate and low pH, and I can use a serum bicarbonate threshold of 27 mmol/L to help screen for chronic hypercapnic states like obesity hypoventilation syndrome in the right clinical context, while remembering bicarbonate alone is insufficient to diagnose OHS when suspicion is high and an ABG is still needed [^111GMg9t] [^111zE1HP] [^115tXu9x]. Hold on, I should verify that this bicarbonate strategy is best used for low-to-moderate pretest probability rather than in patients with a high likelihood of OHS, in whom direct PaCO2 measurement is warranted despite bicarbonate levels [^114QdVcj].

> I will now examine the common etiologies and risk factors, and I need to ensure I tailor management accordingly; COPD with acute exacerbation, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chest wall or neuromuscular disease, severe asthma, ARDS with lung-protective ventilation, and drug-induced hypoventilation are typical culprits, and pre-test probability plus ABG help distinguish these entities and guide ventilatory strategy. Let me consider OHS screening carefully: if serum bicarbonate is 27 mmol/L or higher in an obese patient with sleep-disordered breathing, I should obtain an ABG during wakefulness and proceed to polysomnography to confirm the diagnosis and start positive airway pressure therapy if indicated [^111zE1HP] [^111VY5fo].

> Next, I should review severity and acuity to determine escalation; severe acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is often defined by pH less than 7.35 with PaCO2 above about 6.5 kPa or 49 mmHg, and I need to correlate this with mental status, hemodynamics, and the underlying cause because acidosis and hypercapnia contribute to CNS depression and cardiovascular compromise [^111LmNWc] [^116fmvXg]. Hold on, let's not jump to invasive ventilation too quickly; if the patient is stable with preserved airway and no contraindications, noninvasive ventilation remains first-line for many causes of hypercapnic failure, including COPD exacerbations and selected chest wall or neuromuscular disease, while closely monitoring response [^1146ntT5].

> I will now outline initial ventilatory management and oxygen strategy, and I need to ensure I titrate oxygen to avoid oxygen-induced hypercapnia; for patients at risk of hypercapnia such as COPD, OHS, or neuromuscular disease, I should target SpO2 88–92% and use Venturi devices or low-flow nasal cannula, reassessing ABGs within 30–60 minutes after oxygen changes to detect rising PaCO2 or worsening acidosis [^114tKPGd] [^111jL5VM]. If pH remains below 7.35 with PaCO2 above 6.5 kPa despite optimal medical therapy, I should initiate noninvasive ventilation, starting with IPAP around 10–12 cm H2O and EPAP 4–5 cm H2O, titrating to achieve improved ventilation and gas exchange while watching for mask leaks, aerophagia, and hemodynamic tolerance [^111LmNWc].

> Let me consider special populations and contraindications carefully; for COPD exacerbations, I should avoid starting NIV in purely non-acidotic hypercapnia, whereas in obesity hypoventilation syndrome I should favor CPAP as first-line if severe OSA coexists and escalate to NIV if hypercapnia persists or if there is acute-on-chronic failure, ideally alongside weight-loss strategies and structured follow-up [^11639QQM] [^111xbD2V] [^111zeNmL]. I should double-check for absolute contraindications to NIV such as hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled vomiting, facial trauma, or inability to protect the airway, in which case invasive ventilation is indicated without delay [^111LmNWc].

> If conventional strategies fail or lung-protective ventilation is required, I need to escalate thoughtfully; permissive hypercapnia with a pH target of about 7.20–7.25 can be acceptable to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury in severe airflow obstruction or ARDS, but I must avoid hypercapnia in settings where it is dangerous, such as acute brain injury or severe pulmonary hypertension, and in those cases consider extracorporeal CO2 removal or ECMO if available and appropriate [^117S9eRz] [^111hePup] [^112MrtCZ]. Wait, I should verify that ECCO2R is not routine; evidence is limited and complications exist, so it should be reserved for carefully selected patients in experienced centers when hypercapnia is contraindicated or refractory despite optimized lung-protective ventilation [^114UjwhX] [^1113zEc4].

> I need to ensure monitoring is explicit and actionable; in patients at risk of hypercapnia, I should repeat ABGs within 30–60 minutes after starting or increasing oxygen, and continue frequent reassessment until stable, documenting SpO2, respiratory rate, mental status, and ventilator parameters with each change in therapy to promptly detect CO2 narcosis or NIV failure [^111jL5VM]. Hold on, I should verify that rising PaCO2, falling pH, or declining mental status despite NIV should trigger intubation, as delayed escalation worsens outcomes in acute hypercapnic failure [^1158pNpX].

> For long-term management and goals, I should confirm that stable chronic hypercapnic COPD patients may benefit from home NIV when symptoms, hypercapnia, and recurrent failure persist, and in OHS, sustained weight loss of roughly 25–30% is the only therapy that can lead to resolution, with bariatric surgery offering the highest likelihood of durable remission, alongside adherence to PAP therapy and cardiometabolic risk reduction [^111Dvt6w] [^111xbD2V]. Let me reconsider whether high-flow nasal cannula helps chronic hypercapnia; post hoc analyses suggest modest reductions in PaCO2 over time, likely via dead-space washout, but I should not substitute HFNC for NIV in acute hypercapnic failure and should individualize chronic use in stable patients with close follow-up and gas exchange monitoring [^112FWrEz].

> I should confirm pediatric and neonatal nuances; neonatal "safe" PaCO2 ranges during ventilation are often cited as approximately 5–7 kPa, but evidence quality is limited and permissive hypercapnia should be applied cautiously with continuous or frequent monitoring until definitive ranges are established, with transcutaneous CO2 as a useful noninvasive adjunct when appropriately calibrated and interpreted alongside the clinical picture [^114FfRgG] [^116tTmrn] [^11629eHT]. But wait, what if the child shows signs of rising CO2 or persistent acidosis; I should promptly obtain a confirmatory ABG and adjust ventilatory support per local pediatric protocols rather than relying solely on noninvasive estimates [^111SS8a9].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: confirm hypercapnia and acid-base pattern with ABG, classify acute versus chronic and identify the cause, stratify severity, apply guideline-based oxygen titration with SpO2 targets of 88–92% for hypercapnia-prone patients, initiate NIV for acidotic hypercapnic failure when appropriate, escalate to invasive ventilation or ECCO2R/ECMO selectively when indicated, and monitor closely with serial ABGs and clinical reassessment, integrating long-term therapies such as home NIV, weight loss, and adherence for durable improvement [^114q1bzp] [^115JV683] [^111LmNWc] [^111hePup] [^111Dvt6w].

High CO2 (hypercapnia) is defined as **PaCO2 > 45 mmHg** and reflects alveolar hypoventilation or increased CO2 production [^116fmvXg]. It is diagnosed by **arterial blood gas** and classified as acute (normal HCO3−, low pH) or chronic (elevated HCO3−, near-normal pH) [^1163B8Tc] [^116fmvXg]. Acute hypercapnia causes CNS depression, confusion, and respiratory acidosis, while chronic hypercapnia can lead to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale [^116fmvXg]. Management targets the underlying cause, with **noninvasive ventilation for COPD exacerbations and obesity hypoventilation**, oxygen titrated to 88–92% to avoid CO2 narcosis, and permissive hypercapnia in ARDS when needed [^111LmNWc] [^114tKPGd] [^117S9eRz]. Severe or refractory cases may require invasive ventilation or extracorporeal CO2 removal [^112MrtCZ] [^111hePup].

---

## Physiological regulation of CO2

CO2 is produced during aerobic metabolism and eliminated primarily by the lungs; **PaCO2 reflects the balance between production and elimination** [^116tTmrn]. Alveolar ventilation is the main determinant of PaCO2; decreased ventilation increases PaCO2, while increased ventilation decreases it. Chemoreceptors in the medulla and carotid bodies detect CO2/H+ and modulate ventilation to maintain normocapnia (35–45 mmHg) [^116tTmrn].

---

## Causes of high CO2 levels (hypercapnia)

Hypercapnia results from **alveolar hypoventilation or increased CO2 production** [^116fmvXg]. Common causes include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory disorders | - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [^115JV683] <br/> - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [^115Pgd9N] <br/> - Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) [^115KWzs9] <br/> - Asthma <br/> - Pneumonia <br/> - Pulmonary edema <br/> - Respiratory muscle weakness (e.g. neuromuscular diseases) [^1146ntT5] |
| Central nervous system disorders | - Stroke <br/> - Head injury <br/> - Sedative or opioid overdose <br/> - Central hypoventilation syndromes [^116fmvXg] |
| Increased CO2 production | - Sepsis <br/> - Fever <br/> - Hypermetabolic states (e.g. malignant hyperthermia) [^117R5nvW] |
| Mechanical ventilation issues | - Inadequate minute ventilation <br/> - Rebreathing circuits <br/> - Malfunctioning valves [^notfound] |

## Clinical manifestations of hypercapnia

Hypercapnia has **diverse clinical effects** that vary with severity and chronicity:

- **Central nervous system**: Headache, confusion, somnolence, asterixis, coma [^116NcHxH].
- **Cardiovascular system**: Pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, arrhythmias [^1163MPSA].
- **Respiratory system**: Dyspnea, tachypnea, respiratory acidosis [^116fmvXg].
- **Acute hypercapnia**: Rapid onset of confusion, respiratory distress, and acidosis [^116fmvXg].
- **Chronic hypercapnia**: Fatigue, daytime somnolence, polycythemia, and right heart failure [^1168mn9f].

---

## Diagnosis and assessment

Hypercapnia is diagnosed and assessed with **arterial blood gas (ABG)** analysis, which provides PaCO2, pH, and HCO3− levels to distinguish acute from chronic hypercapnia [^115PgMxh]. Pulse oximetry monitors oxygenation but cannot detect hypercapnia, whereas capnography provides real-time end-tidal CO2 trends. Evaluate the underlying cause with clinical assessment, imaging (CXR, CT), and pulmonary function tests [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **correcting the underlying cause** and improving ventilation:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Titrate to 88–92% in patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure to avoid oxygen-induced hypercapnia [^114tKPGd].
- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)**: First-line for COPD exacerbations, OHS, and other causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure [^111LmNWc] [^111xbD2V].
- **Invasive mechanical ventilation**: Indicated for severe respiratory failure, altered mental status, or failure of NIV [^notfound].
- **Permissive hypercapnia**: Allow mild hypercapnia (pH 7.2–7.25) in ARDS to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury [^notfound].
- **Extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R)**: Consider in refractory hypercapnia when lung-protective ventilation is needed [^111hePup] [^112MrtCZ].

---

## Potential complications of untreated hypercapnia

Untreated hypercapnia can cause **respiratory acidosis**, which depresses CNS function and impairs organ systems. Chronic hypercapnia leads to pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and right heart failure [^1163MPSA]. Severe hypercapnia depresses consciousness and may cause coma [^116NcHxH]. Hypercapnia can worsen immune function and increase infection risk [^1133nt6p].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause, severity, and response to therapy**. Acute hypercapnia is reversible with prompt treatment, whereas chronic hypercapnia carries higher morbidity and mortality, especially in COPD and OHS. Long-term outcomes improve with adherence to therapy, smoking cessation, weight loss, and ongoing monitoring [^115wfRvo] [^114pj5iG].

---

High CO2 (hypercapnia) reflects alveolar hypoventilation or increased CO2 production, with causes including respiratory, CNS, and metabolic factors. It is diagnosed by **ABG** and managed by correcting the cause, oxygen titration, and ventilatory support; **untreated hypercapnia** can cause significant complications, and prognosis varies with cause and treatment response.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111xbD2V]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: The purpose of this guideline is to optimize evaluation and management of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Methods: A multidisciplinary panel identified and prioritized five clinical questions. The panel performed systematic reviews of available studies (up to July 2018) and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence-to-decision framework to develop recommendations. All panel members discussed and approved the recommendations. Recommendations: After considering the overall very low quality of the evidence, the panel made five conditional recommendations. We suggest that: 1) clinicians use a serum bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing when suspicion for OHS is not very high (< 20%) but to measure arterial blood gases in patients strongly suspected of having OHS, 2) stable ambulatory patients with OHS receive positive airway pressure (PAP), 3) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than noninvasive ventilation be offered as the first-line treatment to stable ambulatory patients with OHS and coexistent severe obstructive sleep apnea, 4) patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and suspected of having OHS be discharged with noninvasive ventilation until they undergo outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration in the sleep laboratory (ideally within 2–3 mo), and 5) patients with OHS use weight-loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25% to 30% of body weight to achieve resolution of OHS (which is more likely to be obtained with bariatric surgery). Conclusions: Clinicians may use these recommendations, on the basis of the best available evidence, to guide management and improve outcomes among patients with OHS.

### Carbon dioxide for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in adults: a novel therapy [^117Q1Ptr]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a hallmark feature of autonomic nervous system failure. On standing, people with nOH experience large reductions in blood pressure (≥ 20/10 mmHg) and debilitating symptoms (e.g. light-headedness, blurred vision, and syncope). Current blood pressure therapies have limited efficacy and potentially serious side effects, including supine hypertension, creating a strong clinical need for new therapeutic approaches.

Previous studies examining the effects of hypocapnia [i.e. low arterial carbon dioxide (CO 2)] on blood pressure have shown that hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia decreases supine blood pressure in nOH patients and can be readily prevented with exogenous CO 2. Whether exogenous CO 2 can prevent OH in these patients is unknown. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the hypothesis that increased inspired CO 2 increases standing blood pressure in patients with nOH.

### Bench-to-bedside review: carbon dioxide [^113i6QgL]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Carbon dioxide is a waste product of aerobic cellular respiration in all aerobic life forms. PaCO2 represents the balance between the carbon dioxide produced and that eliminated. Hypocapnia remains a common - and generally underappreciated - component of many disease states, including early asthma, high-altitude pulmonary edema, and acute lung injury. Induction of hypocapnia remains a common, if controversial, practice in both adults and children with acute brain injury. In contrast, hypercapnia has traditionally been avoided in order to keep parameters normal. More recently, advances in our understanding of the role of excessive tidal volume has prompted clinicians to use ventilation strategies that result in hypercapnia. Consequently, hypercapnia has become increasingly prevalent in the critically ill patient. Hypercapnia may play a beneficial role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and tissue injury, but may hinder the host response to sepsis and reduce repair. In contrast, hypocapnia may be a pathogenic entity in the setting of critical illness. The present paper reviews the current clinical status of low and high PaCO2 in the critically ill patient, discusses the insights gained to date from studies of carbon dioxide, identifies key concerns regarding hypocapnia and hypercapnia, and considers the potential clinical implications for the management of patients with acute lung injury.

Methods

Literature search

The methodology of this systematic review was designed and conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statementsand guidelines from the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE). A literature search was done on Pubmed, Embase and Scopus and the terms undertaken were: "neonates" AND ("hypocapnia" OR "hypercapnia"). Additional studies identified during a manual search were also included.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies that satisfied the following criteria were included into our literature review: (1) full text available in English, (2) human subjects and (3) peer-reviewed journals. Exclusion criteria were established to eliminate studies beyond the scope of the review: editorials; letters and case reports; duplicate publications; and use of animal models. The publication years were not restricted due to a limitation in the number of studies available.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115JV683]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Respiratory support — oxygen therapy during COPD exacerbations: Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to improve hypoxemia with a target saturation of 88–92%, and once oxygen is started, blood gases should be checked frequently, or as clinically indicated, to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without carbon dioxide retention and/or worsening acidosis. Pulse oximetry is not as accurate as arterial blood gas and may overestimate blood oxygen content among individuals with darker skin tones. Venous blood gas to assess bicarbonate levels and pH is accurate when compared with arterial blood gas assessment, but additional data are needed because most patients included had a pH > 7.30 on presentation and PCO2 levels were dissimilar when measured by venous compared to arterial samples. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of oxygen than nasal prongs.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1152N3eJ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acidosis is associated with poor outcome in critical illness. However, acidosis - both hypercapnic and metabolic - has direct effects that can limit tissue injury induced by many causes. There is also a clear potential for off-target harm with acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), and with exposure for prolonged periods (for example, increased risk of infection) or at high doses. Ongoing comprehensive determination of molecular, cellular and physiologic impact across a range of representative pathologies will allow us to understand better the risks and benefits of hypercapnia and acidosis during critical illness.

### Respiratory acidosis [^116fmvXg]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory acidosis, or primary hypercapnia, is the acid-base disorder that results from an increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Acute respiratory acidosis occurs with acute (Type II) respiratory failure, which can result from any sudden respiratory parenchymal (eg, pulmonary edema), airways (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma), pleural, chest wall, neuromuscular (eg, spinal cord injury), or central nervous system event (eg, drug overdose). Chronic respiratory acidosis can result from numerous processes and is typified by a sustained increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, resulting in renal adaptation, and a more marked increase in plasma bicarbonate. Mechanisms of respiratory acidosis include increased carbon dioxide production, alveolar hypoventilation, abnormal respiratory drive, abnormalities of the chest wall and respiratory muscles, and increased dead space. Although the symptoms, signs, and physiologic consequences of respiratory acidosis are numerous, the principal effects are on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Treatment for respiratory acidosis may include invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support and specific medical therapies directed at the underlying pathophysiology.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^115PgMxh]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for blood gas analysis, more specifically with respect to general principles, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain pH and pCO2 on blood gas to determine the primary process of an acid-base disorder. Recognize that abnormal values increasing or decreasing in the same direction indicate a metabolic process, while those shifting in opposite directions indicate a respiratory process.

### Associations of arterial carbon dioxide and arterial oxygen concentrations with hospital mortality after resuscitation from cardiac arrest [^111E1Qmv]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Even after successful resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), cardiac arrest carries a poor prognosis with limited options for treatment. In addition to controlling temperature after cardiac arrest, optimizing ventilation and oxygenation may improve outcome. International consensus currently recommends careful monitoring of post-resuscitation ventilation for neurological and cardiovascular outcome. Indeed, targeting safe levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in arterial blood may limit global ischemic damage and enhance oxygenation and blood flow. Aberrant arterial levels have repeatedly been shown to be associated with worse outcome after cardiac arrest, but the effects may depend on degree and duration of the (concurrent) exposure. Recently, a large cohort study was performed in 125 intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia and New Zealand, which showed that abnormal concentrations of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) were common after cardiac arrest. Compared with normocapnia, hypocapnia was independently associated with worse clinical outcomes, whereas hypercapnia was associated with a greater likelihood of good outcome. The results were reproduced in a smaller cohort and are supported by pediatric and experimental research. However, ventilation and oxygenation are closely related and effects of PaCO 2 may not be independent from arterial oxygen levels (PaO 2). In this study, we aimed to investigate the separate and combined effects of both parameters in a multicenter cohort of patients admitted to Dutch ICUs after cardiac arrest.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111zE1HP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, more specifically with respect to blood gas analysis, ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum bicarbonate level to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having OHS. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of OHS. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L as the diagnosis of OHS is very unlikely in these patients.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111GMg9t]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome — American Thoracic Society diagnostic recommendation: The panel suggests that clinicians should measure PaCO2 in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing who are strongly suspected of having OHS, and it suggests using a serum bicarbonate level of 27 mmol/L to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with low to moderate probability of OHS (e.g. BMI 30–40 kg/m2). In this group, a bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L precludes the need for an arterial blood gas, whereas a bicarbonate level ≥ 27 mmol/L should trigger clinicians to measure PaCO2 as a confirmatory diagnostic test, especially when the pretest probability of OHS is 10 to 20% (generally a BMI > 35 kg/m2). A formal statement specifies, "we suggest measuring Paco2, rather than using serum bicarbonate or Spo2, to diagnose" in those strongly suspected.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^1158pNpX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiologic rationale in critical care — roles and limits are described: Reasoning from biology, biochemistry, and physiology has been a standard methodology with mixed results, yet it provides a check on questionable research findings and biological plausibility supports arguments of causality; pathophysiologic rationale remains valuable for individual patients in critical care, where physiologic differences at presentation may justify changing the rapidity and intensity of initial diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, may guide initial therapy (for instance, antibiotic choice may be determined in part by whether the patient warrants intensive care unit admission), and monitoring physiologic changes can assess likelihood of success (for example, a rising PCO2 after initiating noninvasive ventilation suggests likely failure to avoid invasive mechanical ventilation), although such reasoning has significant limitations because strategies based on physiologic goals do not always lead to better outcomes and scientific understanding remains incomplete, even as mechanisms underlie illness and recovery and further exploration is essential.

### Carbon monoxide toxicity [^1131gquf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide accounts for thousands of deaths worldwide each year. Clinical effects can be diverse and include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, syncope, seizures, coma, dysrhythmias, and cardiac ischemia, and severe toxicity generally affects the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Because of its complex pathophysiology, effects of toxicity can be acute or delayed. The diagnosis can be elusive, as carboxyhemoglobin levels do not always correlate with the degree of poisoning. Even when the diagnosis is certain, appropriate therapy is widely debated. Normobaric oxygen is the standard therapy, and the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear.

### The features of AECOPD with carbon dioxide retention [^114UoK6v]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Another indicator that holds promise for assessing the severity of COPD is carbon dioxide retention. Carbon dioxide retention indicates the exhaustion of lung reserve, loss of ventilatory function, worsening of clinical symptoms, respiratory failure, and secondary damage. But actually we don't know the complete long term consequences of hypercapnia. Tsuboi reported that persistent carbon dioxide retention in chronic ventilatory deficient subjects may reflect an adaptive mechanism that allows for lower levels of alveolar ventilation so as not to overload the respiratory muscles. In summary, carbon dioxide retention is involved in the respiratory center drive capacity, respiratory muscle strength, airway obstruction, pulmonary parenchymal damage, and many other complex processes. The gold standard for carbon dioxide retention is arterial blood gas analysis, but arterial blood gas analysis only reflects the instantaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. Therefore, checking blood gas at different times will produce different results, and the overall extent of COPD disease leading to carbon dioxide retention (or even respiratory failure) cannot be determined accurately. Accurate prediction of COPD carbon dioxide retention from pathological changes level would be of great help in disease monitoring.

What is the relationship between carbon dioxide retention and pulmonary function and imaging parameters? To date, this relationship has not been clear. For this study, we were interested in the ability to predict and estimate carbon dioxide retention using pulmonary function parameters and imaging parameters. Therefore, the aims of the present study were: 1) to compare the differences in clinical symptom scores, inflammatory markers, pulmonary function indicators, and CT parameters between patients with carbon dioxide retention in COPD vs those without carbon dioxide retention; and 2) to identify the factors associated with carbon dioxide retention in AECOPD.

### Hyperbaric oxygen treatment in carbon monoxide poisoning-does it really matter? [^1135JB2H]. Burns (2023). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless and colorless gas that can lead to fulminant and life-threatening intoxications. Besides an early diagnosis, an appropriate treatment of the intoxication is important. In this context the reduction of CO concentration in blood and tissues is crucial revealing hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBO) as a highly promising tool. However, the benefit of HBO in CO intoxications is still considered controversial. In this review, we discuss the evidence of the role of HBO treatment in isolated CO intoxication.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115wfRvo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline on obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) — after considering the overall very low quality of the evidence, the panel made five conditional recommendations. We suggest that clinicians use a serum bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing when suspicion for OHS is not very high (< 20%) but to measure arterial blood gases in patients strongly suspected of having OHS. We suggest that stable ambulatory patients with OHS receive positive airway pressure (PAP). We suggest that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than noninvasive ventilation be offered as the first-line treatment to stable ambulatory patients with OHS and coexistent severe obstructive sleep apnea. We suggest that patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and suspected of having OHS be discharged with noninvasive ventilation until they undergo outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration in the sleep laboratory (ideally within 2–3 mo). We suggest that patients with OHS use weight-loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25% to 30% of body weight to achieve resolution of OHS (which is more likely to be obtained with bariatric surgery).

G. Patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (see table 4 and full Guideline section 8.12)
G1. (also A3) For most patients with known COPD or other known risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure (eg, morbid obesity, cystic fibrosis, chest wall deformities or neuromuscular disorders or fixed airflow obstruction associated with bronchiectasis), a target saturation range of 88–92% is suggested pending the availability of blood gas results (grade A for COPD, grade D for other conditions).
G2. Some patients with COPD and other conditions are vulnerable to repeated episodes of hypercapnic respiratory failure. In these cases, it is recommended that treatment should be based on the results of previous blood gas estimations during acute exacerbations. For patients with prior hypercapnic failure (requiring NIV or intermittent positive pressure ventilation) who do not have an alert card, it is recommended that low-concentration oxygen treatment should be started using a 24% Venturi mask at 2–3 L/min (or a 28% Venturi mask at 4 L/min or nasal cannulae at 1–2 L/min if a 24% mask is not available) with an initial target saturation of 88–92% pending urgent blood gas results. These patients should be treated as a high priority by emergency services, and the oxygen concentration should be reduced if the saturation exceeds 92% but increased if it falls below 88% (grade D).

### Carbon dioxide levels in neonates: what are safe parameters? [^116tTmrn]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a physiological gas produced as a consequence of aerobic metabolism. Plasma CO 2 levels are tightly regulated under physiological conditions to maintain blood pH. CO 2 is mainly removed from the body via the lungs and can accumulate in lung pathologies. In humans, normocapnia is defined as a pCO 2 of between 4.7 and 6.0 kPa (35.3–45.0 mmHg), with pCO 2 reflecting the balance between CO 2 production and removal. Consequently, slightly higher pCO 2 values are associated with the venous circulation as CO 2 -enriched blood is returned towards the lungs. Importantly, the local microenvironment of cells and tissues can experience pCO 2 levels that differ markedly from systemic PaCO 2, e.g. in solid tumours. This is likely a consequence of local metabolic activity and alterations in local blood supply. Adaptive responses to changes in CO 2 can be classified as being acute or chronic. Acute responses to CO 2 are generally sensed through brain stem central chemoreceptors that modulate the rate and depth of breathing to try and maintain normocapnic partial pressures of CO 2. Chronic responses to CO 2 can be elicited on a cellular level through CO 2 -dependent changes in gene expression, e.g. genes associated with immune signalling. The cerebral vasculature is very sensitive to physiological gases. Given the brain's significant demand for oxygen to maintain normal function, several adaptive cerebral vasodilatory mechanisms are elicited to promote and maintain cerebral blood flow under conditions of hypoxia. Elevated CO 2 levels, which are frequently associated with hypoxia, also promote an increase in cerebral blood flow through dilation of cerebral arteries and arterioles. In contrast, hypocapnia leads to vascular constriction and reduced blood flow. Thus, the cerebral vasculature is highly sensitive to the level of circulating physiological gases with hypocapnia and hypercapnia capable of affecting brain oxygen levels indirectly through modulation of cerebral blood flow.

### Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to the acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review [^114UjwhX]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Tidal recruitment, alveolar derecruitment and high inspiratory volumes during mechanical ventilation add further insult to already injured and failing lungs. Few interventions have been proven to reduce mortality, with the notable exception of low tidal volume ventilation. In practice, lung-protective strategies involving low tidal volume ventilation can prove difficult to implement, often due to concerns of hypercapnia or its potential adverse physiological consequences.

Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R) offers a potentially attractive solution to this problem because carbon dioxide can be 'dialysed' out of the blood, while the lungs are ventilated in a maximally protective manner. Techniques to achieve this have existed since the late 1970s, but widespread uptake has been limited due to the paucity of trial data, the demanding technical requirements of the technique and concerns regarding complications. More recently, modern developments in ECCO 2 R technology have stimulated renewed interest, particularly because of the potential for safe use in nonspecialist centres. To define current understanding of ECCO 2 R in patients with acute respiratory failure and inform future randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we performed a systematic review to assess efficacy and complication rates of ECCO 2 R.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111dJYTF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with hypoventilation syndrome (evaluation), ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring serum bicarbonate level to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate < 27 mmol/L as the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is very unlikely in these patients.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: weighing in on therapy options [^114pj5iG]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is becoming an increasingly encountered condition both in respiratory outpatient clinics and in hospitalized patients. The health consequences and social disadvantages of obesity hypoventilation syndrome are significant. Unfortunately, the diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapy is commonly delayed when the syndrome is not recognized or misdiagnosed. Positive airway pressure therapy remains the mainstay of treatment and is effective in controlling sleep-disordered breathing and improving awake blood gases in the majority of individuals. Evidence supporting one mode of therapy over another is limited. Both continuous and bilevel therapy modes can successfully improve daytime gas exchange, with adherence to therapy an important modifiable factor in the response to treatment. Despite adherence to therapy, these individuals continue to experience excess mortality primarily due to cardiovascular events compared with those with eucapnic sleep apnea using CPAP. This difference likely arises from ongoing systemic inflammation secondary to the morbidly obese state. The need for a comprehensive approach to managing nutrition, weight, and physical activity in addition to reversal of sleep-disordered breathing is now widely recognized. Future studies need to evaluate the impact of a more aggressive and comprehensive treatment plan beyond managing sleep-disordered breathing. The impact of early identification and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing on the development and reversal of cardiometabolic dysfunction also requires further attention.

### Recent advances in obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^115KWzs9]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) consists of a combination of obesity and chronic hypercapnia accompanied by sleep-disordered breathing. During the last 3 decades, the prevalence of extreme obesity has markedly increased in the United States and other countries. With a global epidemic of obesity, the prevalence of OHS is bound to increase. Patients with OHS have a lower quality of life with increased health-care expenses and are at a higher risk for the development of pulmonary hypertension and early mortality compared to eucapnic patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome, it is often unrecognized and treatment is frequently delayed. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion since early recognition and treatment reduces the high burden of morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome. In this review, we will discuss the definition and clinical presentation of OHS, provide a summary of its prevalence, review the current understanding of the pathophysiology, and discuss the recent advances in the therapeutic options.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^115Pgd9N]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

A. General information on obstructive sleep apnea explains that obstructive sleep apnea is a very common and serious sleep disorder which affects many military personnel and Veterans, and snoring is one common symptom but not all patients with sleep apnea snore. Other symptoms include pauses in breathing while asleep, trouble staying asleep, using the bathroom frequently at night, morning headaches, morning dry mouth, morning sore throat, and daytime sleepiness. What defines sleep apnea is decreased breathing – either a partial (hypopnea) or complete absence of breathing (apnea) – that occurs while sleeping, during which oxygen levels can decrease (hypoxia) and carbon dioxide levels can increase (hypercapnia), with serious medical consequences such as high blood pressure, heart failure, irregular heart rhythms, stroke, memory impairment, and death. Multiple awakenings during the night also lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and increased risk for motor vehicle accidents. We will need to obtain a sleep study to confirm this diagnosis. There are effective treatments for sleep apnea.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111VY5fo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (ATS guideline) — conditional recommendations and monitoring: The guideline includes conditional recommendations for using serum bicarbonate below 27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) in the appropriate clinical context; treating patients with positive airway pressure (PAP); favoring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) over noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for the approximately two-thirds of patients who have concomitant severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); discharging hospitalized patients suspected of having OHS on PAP while they await subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic workup; and risk-stratifying patients for bariatric surgery interventions. For PAP titration or subsequent PAP adjustment, noninvasive monitoring of ventilation (transcutaneous CO2) can be added to pulse oximetry (SpO2), but we found no studies that examined outcomes using monitoring of SpO2 versus combined SpO2 plus noninvasive monitoring of CO2, and we propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for patients with OHS or suspected of having OHS.

The discovery that carbon monoxide (CO)-a highly publicized toxic gas molecule-can have powerful benefits and curative effects not only changed how we view CO, but has, with tremendous contradiction, resulted in clinical trials of CO for the treatment of various pathologies. There is sound preclinical evidence that, at a low concentration, CO has benefits in numerous and diverse diseases in rodents, large animals, and humans. CO especially has potential benefits in inflammatory disorders. As CO moves ahead in the clinic, we continue to advance our understanding of how it functions, especially as the number of potential clinical applications expands. CO's mechanisms of action at the cellular level depend on the disease and the experimental focus, but the one constant is that CO reestablishes homeostasis.

### British thoracic society guideline for oxygen use in adults in healthcare and emergency settings [^112Uz73V]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Good practice point

Management of hypercapnia or respiratory acidosis due to excessive oxygen therapy (avoidance of life-threatening rebound hypoxaemia):
✓ If a patient is suspected to have hypercapnic or respiratory failure due to excessive oxygen therapy, the oxygen therapy must be stepped down to the lowest level required to maintain a saturation range of 88–92%. This may be achieved using 28% or 24% oxygen from a Venturi mask or 1–2 L/min via nasal cannulae depending on oxygen saturation and subsequent blood gas measurements.
✓ Sudden cessation of supplementary oxygen therapy can cause life-threatening rebound hypoxaemia with a rapid fall in oxygen saturations below the starting oxygen saturation prior to the start of supplementary oxygen therapy.

G3. Initial oxygen treatment of cystic fibrosis exacerbations should be similar to the initial oxygen treatment of COPD exacerbations with target saturation 88–92% (see sections 8.12.1–8.12.2) (grade D).
G4. In the initial management of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders with acute respiratory failure, or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, aim at an oxygen saturation of 88–92% and measure blood gases to determine if NIV will be required (grade D).

Good practice point regarding patients with neurological disorders

✓ Patients with respiratory failure due to neurological disorders or muscle disease are at high risk of dying and require urgent assessment to determine if they are likely to require non-invasive or invasive ventilator support rather than oxygen therapy. Monitor these patients with blood gases and regular spirometry (forced vital capacity). Patients' wishes regarding this form of treatment should established as early as possible in the course of the illness, ideally before an acute episode has developed.
G5. Morbidly obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m 2), even without evidence of coexistent obstructive sleep apnoea are at risk of hypoventilation and should be given titrated oxygen to maintain a target saturation of 88–92% (grade D).
G6. NIV should be considered for hypercapnic patients with COPD, CF, neuromuscular disorders or morbid obesity who are at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure if the pH is < 7.35 or [H+] > 45 nmol/L (grade D) (see BTS/ICS Guidelines for the Ventilatory Management of Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure in Adults).

### Respiratory failure [^111wqwX4]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

On the basis of research evidence, (1)(2) numerous diseases and conditions can impair gas exchange, resulting in failure to meet the body's metabolic demands and leading to respiratory failure. On the basis of consensus, (1)(2)(7)(8)(9)(10) the clinical presentations of respiratory failure depend on the underlying cause and the level of hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Early diagnosis, close monitoring, and timely intervention are of utmost importance. On the basis of research evidence, (5)(14)(25) interventions range from noninvasive methods, such as close monitoring and supplemental oxygen, to full respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and in extreme cases even the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

### Carbon dioxide levels in neonates: what are safe parameters? [^114FfRgG]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on the literature review performed, it appears that pCO 2 levels of approximately 5–7 kPa (37.5–52.5 mmHg) may be safe for neonates requiring ventilatory support. Intervention to therapeutically alter carbon dioxide has been suggested in the recent HENRIC study which demonstrated the use of CO 2 insufflation to prevent hypocarbia in NE. While the research for safe O 2 ranges in preterm and term infants is well underway, the same advancement is required for CO 2. Contradictory findings highlight the need for rigorous evidence to establish the role of permissive hypercapnia in clinical practice and if beneficial, the safe upper limit of permissive hypercapnia. Until safe ranges have been clearly defined, this ventilation strategy should be used with caution.

Management

Children with established diabetes, who are not vomiting or severely ill, and whose caregiver has been trained in sick day management, can be managed at home or at an outpatient facility, with appropriate supervision and follow-up.–Children who are vomiting and not severely ill may be managed with intravenous (IV) fluids in an emergency department and discharged to home if able to take fluids orally following rehydration, if venous pH is above 7.25, and telephone follow-up can be assured. Children requiring IV rehydration over an extended period need to be admitted to a unit in which neurological status and vital signs can be monitored frequently and blood glucose levels measured hourly. Nursing staff trained in monitoring and management of DKA should be available and written guidelines should be provided. With severe DKA (long duration of symptoms, compromised circulation, depressed level of consciousness) or if there are other factors increasing the risk for cerebral edema (CE; age under 5 years, low partial pressure of carbon dioxide [pCO 2], high serum urea nitrogen), an intensive care unit, preferably pediatric, or an equivalent facility is appropriate.

Fluid and Insulin Replacement

Goals of Treatment with Fluid and Insulin

Restore perfusion, which will increase glucose uptake in the periphery, increase glomerular filtration, and reverse the progressive acidosis.
Arrest ketogenesis with insulin administration, which reverses proteolysis and lipolysis while stimulating glucose uptake and processing, thereby normalizing blood glucose concentration.
Replace electrolyte losses.
Intervene rapidly when complications, especially CE, occur.

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^113dN2gZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids, The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight- hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight - depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning: pathogenesis, management, and future directions of therapy [^111k4jH8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning affects 50,000 people a year in the United States. The clinical presentation runs a spectrum, ranging from headache and dizziness to coma and death, with a mortality rate ranging from 1 to 3%. A significant number of patients who survive CO poisoning suffer from long-term neurological and affective sequelae. The neurologic deficits do not necessarily correlate with blood CO levels but likely result from the pleiotropic effects of CO on cellular mitochondrial respiration, cellular energy utilization, inflammation, and free radical generation, especially in the brain and heart. Long-term neurocognitive deficits occur in 15–40% of patients, whereas approximately one-third of moderate to severely poisoned patients exhibit cardiac dysfunction, including arrhythmia, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and myocardial infarction. Imaging studies reveal cerebral white matter hyperintensities, with delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy or diffuse brain atrophy. Management of these patients requires the identification of accompanying drug ingestions, especially in the setting of intentional poisoning, fire-related toxic gas exposures, and inhalational injuries. Conventional therapy is limited to normobaric and hyperbaric oxygen, with no available antidotal therapy. Although hyperbaric oxygen significantly reduces the permanent neurological and affective effects of CO poisoning, a portion of survivors still have substantial morbidity. There has been some early success in therapies targeting the downstream inflammatory and oxidative effects of CO poisoning. New methods to directly target the toxic effect of CO, such as CO scavenging agents, are currently under development.

### Development in paCOover 12 months in patients with COPD with persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure treated with high-flow nasal cannula-post-hoc analysis from a randomised controlled trial [^112FWrEz]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure is associated with poor disease prognosis. In COPD, persistent hypercapnic failure is a predictor of more exacerbations, poor quality of life, impaired cognitive function, especially in combination with persistent hypoxic respiratory failure, and mortality. In acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, treatment with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been shown to improve prognosis, and NIV is an established treatment modality in respiratory acute care worldwide. The body of evidence for treatment with long-term home NIV (LTH-NIV) in persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure is growingand respiratory societies such as the European Respiratory Society have made guidelines for treatment with LTH-NIV in patients with COPD.

Evidence for the benefit of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in patients with COPD with persistent hypoxic failure is growing, with evidence most positive for its long-term use in hypoxemic, frequently exacerbating patients with COPD. In addition, studies have shown that PaCO 2 levels are reduced with short-term and longer-term use of HFNC in COPD, both in chronic and stable conditions, but it has been argued that this is primarily due to a reduction of CO 2 levels in the anatomical dead space. In the randomised controlled trial (RCT) by Storgaard et al, hereafter called the Aalborg Study, an inclusion criterion was persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure, although patients with concomitant hypercapnic respiratory failure were not excluded. The patients were comparable in terms of all blood gases at inclusion, but for PaCO 2 there was a significant average treatment difference at 12 months in favour of HFNC treatment.

The aim of this post-hoc analysis is therefore to examine further the changes primarily in PaCO 2, but also in PaO 2 in patients with persistent hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure over 12 months treatment with HFNC. Furthermore, changes in numbers of exacerbations and of hospital admission are compared 1 year prior to inclusion and during the study period within the two treatment groups.

W. Practical aspects of oxygen dispensing, documentation and monitoring
W1. Registered nurses and others who dispense drugs in hospitals should sign the drug chart or electronic prescribing record at every drug round and check that the patient is receiving oxygen therapy. This is to check that the patient is within the target saturation and also to check whether weaning and discontinuation should be instituted (grade D).
W2. Most patients are prescribed an oxygen target range. If patients are on air at the time of the drug round, registered nurses should sign the drug chart using a code such as 'A' for air and the observation chart should also be filled in using the code A for air (see table 5 and figure 19 in the full guideline) (grade D).
W3. All patients should have their oxygen saturation observed for at least 5 min after starting oxygen therapy or for patients who require an increased concentration of oxygen and after oxygen therapy has been decreased or stopped (grade D).
W4. If the oxygen saturation is above the target saturation range and the patient is stable, the delivery system or oxygen flow rate should be modified to return the saturation to within the target range (grade D).
W5. Patients who have a target saturation of 88–92% should have their blood gases measured within 30–60 min. This is to ensure that the carbon dioxide level is not rising. This recommendation also applies to those who are at risk of developing hypercapnic respiratory failure but who have a normal PCO 2 on the initial blood gas measurement (grade D).
W6. Stable patients whose oxygen saturation is within their target saturation range of 94–98% do not need repeat blood gas measurements within 30–60 min if there is no risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure and acidosis and may not need any further blood gas measurements unless there should be further deterioration including symptoms or signs of possible hypercapnia (grade D).
W7. Stable patients on oxygen treatment should have SpO 2 and physiological variables (eg, NEWS) measured four times a day (grade D).
W8. In those who have signs of critical illness (eg, NEWS score 7 or above), oxygen saturation should be monitored continuously and the patient may require level 2 or level 3 care on a high-dependency unit or critical care unit (grade D).
W9. If the patient is clinically stable and the oxygen saturation is within the target range, treatment should be continued (or eventually lowered) depending on the clinical situation (grade D).
W10. Oxygen therapy should be increased if the saturation is below the desired range and decreased if the saturation is above the desired range (and eventually discontinued as the patient recovers) (grade D).
W11. The new saturation (and the new delivery system) and flow rate should be recorded on the patient's observation chart after 5 min of treatment at the new oxygen concentration. Each change should be recorded by the clinician trained to administer oxygen by signing the observation chart (only changes should be signed for) (grade D).
W12. Repeat blood gas measurements are not required for stable patients who require a reduced concentration of oxygen (or cessation of oxygen therapy) to maintain the desired target saturation (grade D).
W13. Patients with no risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure do not always need repeat blood gas measurements after an increase in oxygen concentration. However, the patient requires clinical review to determine why the oxygen saturation has fallen (grade D).
W14. Patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (usually those with a target range of 88–92%; see table 4) require repeat blood gas assessment 30–60 min after an increase in oxygen therapy (to ensure that the carbon dioxide level is not rising) (grade D).
W15. For patients with no risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, monitoring by pulse oximeter is sufficient (repeated blood gases not required) provided the patient is clinically stable and the oxygen saturation remains in the desired range, usually 94–98% (grade D).
W16. If a patient's oxygen saturation is lower than the prescribed target range, first check all aspects of the oxygen delivery system and the oximeter device for faults or errors (grade D).
W17. If a patient's oxygen saturation is consistently lower than the prescribed target range, there should be a medical review and the oxygen therapy should be increased according to an agreed written protocol (grade D).
W18. If the oxygen saturation fails to rise following 5–10 min of increased oxygen therapy or if there is clinical concern following medical review, then blood gas measurements should be repeated (grade D).

Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning — hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy versus normobaric oxygen: Level B recommendations state that emergency physicians should use HBO2 therapy or high-flow normobaric therapy for acute CO-poisoned patients, while noting it remains unclear whether HBO2 therapy is superior to normobaric oxygen therapy for improving long-term neurocognitive outcomes. The potential benefit described is supporting clinicians who choose not to refer for HBO2 therapy when constrained, and the subcommittee identified no potential harms of implementing this recommendation.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with hypoventilation syndrome (evaluation), ATS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring PaCO2 rather than serum bicarbonate or SpO2 for the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome in patients with obesity and sleep-disordered breathing with a high pretest probability of having obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113HEnr9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) screening in obese adults with sleep-disordered breathing using serum bicarbonate and pulse oximetry is described with diagnostic evidence and thresholds. The two tests required to diagnose OHS are a sleep study and arterial blood gases during wakefulness, yet arterial blood gases are often not obtained; thus simple screening tests are needed. Commonly used tests assess elevated serum bicarbonate (total serum CO2) and hypoxemia; bicarbonate represents 96% of total serum CO2, and in the absence of alternative causes an increased serum bicarbonate level suggests increased PaCO2. Pulse oximetry is noninvasive and accessible, but hypoxemia can occur in morbidly obese patients without hypercapnia. Evidence identification found 31 studies, excluding 18; of the remaining 13, 9 were full manuscripts and 4 abstracts. Six were prospective, six were retrospective, and one had both designs. Six studies evaluated bicarbonate; one with 2% OHS prevalence was excluded, and the remaining studies had OHS prevalence ranging between 17% and 42%. Only two studies specified how bicarbonate was measured; in two studies it was calculated from blood gas measurements, and one study did not specify. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed for serum bicarbonate cutoffs of 26, 27, 28, and 29 mmol/L, with the corresponding number of studies two, four, three, and one, respectively; 27 mmol/L was the only cutoff with sufficient data for pooled analysis, including one study that contributed both retrospective and prospective samples at 27 mmol/L, so the pooled analysis includes five samples.

### Intraoperative circulatory arrest secondary to high-risk pulmonary embolism. case series and updated literature review [^111Crjx6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of intraoperative PE in CA and anesthetized patients presents a considerable challenge due to the atypical presentation of signs and symptoms. Unexplained hypoxia, tachycardia, hypotension, and/or decreased levels of expired end-tidal carbon dioxide should alert healthcare providers to the possibility of PE. Consequently, prompt, and thorough diagnostic evaluation becomes essential.

The collaborative consensus statement by the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists recommends TEE in scenarios characterized by persistent, life-threatening circulatory instability, which remains unexplained despite appropriate therapeutic interventions (Class I, Level C evidence). Moreover, studies have provided evidence of comparable levels of sensitivity and specificity between TEE and computed tomography in the evaluation of centrally located PE.

TTE can reveal hypokinesis and RV dysfunction, suggesting high-risk PE. A study from the International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism Registry demonstrated that RV hypokinesis on TTE was associated with a twofold increased risk of mortality in patients with PE. Therefore, in unstable patients, evidence of RV dysfunction on TTE is sufficient to prompt immediate primary pulmonary reperfusion without the need for additional tests. Pulmonary CTA should be performed in stabilized patients (low vasopressor support) to confirm the diagnosis and guide specific PE treatment (Class I, Level C evidence).

Anticoagulation

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of treatment for PE. It should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis of PE or in the presence of high clinical suspicion (Class I, Level C evidence). However, in patients with CA and high-risk PE, treatment escalation is warranted. According to the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) recommendations, thrombolysis, SE, and CDT should be considered as the primary reperfusion treatment options in these cases. Anticoagulation should be considered a viable primary perfusion treatment in patients with low vasopressor support after a complete ROSC, with no indications of other primary perfusion therapies.

During surgical procedures, using unfractionated heparin (UFH) may be preferable due to its shorter half-life, dose adjustability, and potential reversal with protamine. The 2019 ESC guidelines for the management of PE recommend the use of UFH in patients with evident hemodynamic instability or decompensation who require primary reperfusion treatment. UFH is also recommended for patients with severe renal insufficiency (< 30 mL/min) or severe obesity.

### Best clinical practices for the sleep center adjustment of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in stable chronic alveolar hypoventilation syndromes [^113p4pq7]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2010). Medium credibility.

Chronic noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) follow-up assessment — the respiratory function of patients on chronic NPPV treatment should be assessed with measures of oxygenation and ventilation (arterial blood gas, end-tidal CO2, transcutaneous PCO2) on a regular follow-up basis or if signs of clinical deterioration are present (LEVEL A - CONSENSUS). This recommendation explains that the clinical condition of patients may change (weight gain, reduction in muscle strength, progression of the underlying cause of CAH), with the result that current NPPV treatment may no longer be adequate, and that assessment is typically carried out during quiet breathing while awake and at rest. Additional considerations are that pressure settings determined during a NPPV titration may not remain adequate if patient characteristics such as muscle strength change during chronic treatment, and that concurrent medical problems or medications might impact the effectiveness of treatment.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115tXu9x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome — serum bicarbonate diagnostic accuracy and predictive values in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing are as follows: Serum bicarbonate demonstrated pooled sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI, 0.70–0.94) and specificity 0.77 (95% CI, 0.60–0.89). A bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L effectively rules out hypercapnia with a very high negative predictive value of 99.0% (95% CI, 97.9–99.6%) and remained effective when pretest probability was as high as 20%. Prevalence strata used for modeling were 5% for BMI 30–34.9 kg/m2, 10% for BMI 35–40 kg/m2, and 20% for BMI > 40 kg/m2. When bicarbonate is ≥ 27 mmol/L, positive predictive value is 48.3% (95% CI, 34.9–66.1%) at 20% prevalence, decreasing to 29.3% (95% CI, 19.2–46.4%) at 10% and 16.4% (95% CI, 10.1–29.0%) at 5%.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1133nt6p]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of acidosis in critical illness are complex and depend on multiple factors, including the etiology of the acidosis (hypercapnic versus metabolic), the degree of acidosis and whether the acidosis accumulates acutely or more gradually, where compensatory or adaptive mechanisms may blunt its effects. While acidosis is traditionally associated with poor outcome in critical illness, it is not clear to what extent - if any - this is a causal relationship. In any case, simple avoidance of acidosis is generally not feasible in the critically ill. In fact, conventional protective ventilation strategies that minimize lung stretch increase the prevalence of hypercapnic acidosis (HCA) in the critically ill, and have been clearly demonstrated to save lives in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there is also a clear potential for harm with HCA or metabolic acidosis (MAC), whether due to acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), exposure for prolonged periods of time (for example, increased risk of infection) or high concentrations. These complexities are further underlined by the findings in multiple preclinical studies that acidosis may have direct effects which can protect cells and organs in the setting of acute organ injury. Thus, managing acidosis is an integral component of critical care, and efforts to deepen our understanding of its consequences are therefore welcome.

### Oxygen-induced hypercapnia in COPD: myths and facts [^114rv7Jr]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

During our medical training, we learned that oxygen administration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) induces hypercapnia through the 'hypoxic drive' mechanism and can be dangerous. This mindset frequently results in the reluctance of clinicians to administer oxygen to hypoxemic patients with COPD. However, this fear is not based on evidence in the literature. Here, we will review the impact and pathophysiology of oxygen-induced hypercapnia in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and recommend a titrated oxygen management.

### Bench-to-bedside review: permissive hypercapnia [^115FsWKw]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Current protective lung ventilation strategies commonly involve hypercapnia. This approach has resulted in an increase in the clinical acceptability of elevated carbon dioxide tension, with hypoventilation and hypercapnia 'permitted' in order to avoid the deleterious effects of high lung stretch. Advances in our understanding of the biology of hypercapnia have prompted consideration of the potential for hypercapnia to play an active role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and tissue injury. In fact, hypercapnia may protect against lung and systemic organ injury independently of ventilator strategy. However, there are no clinical data evaluating the direct effects of hypercapnia per se in acute lung injury. This article reviews the current clinical status of permissive hypercapnia, discusses insights gained to date from basic scientific studies of hypercapnia and acidosis, identifies key unresolved concerns regarding hypercapnia, and considers the potential clinical implications for the management of patients with acute lung injury.

F10. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with entrained oxygen or high-flow humidified nasal oxygen to maintain saturation 94–98% (or 88–92% if at risk of hypercapnia) should be considered as an adjunctive treatment to improve gas exchange in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema who are not responding to standard treatment (or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) if there is co-existant hypercapnia and acidosis) (grade B).
F11. In anaemia, aim at an oxygen saturation of 94–98% or 88–92% if the patient is at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (grade D).

### The obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^1163MPSA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The obesity hypoventilation syndrome, which is defined as a combination of obesity and chronic hypoventilation, utimately results in pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and probable early mortality. Since the classical description of this syndrome nearly fifty years ago, research has led to a better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in this disease process, and to the development of effective treatment options. However, recent data indicate the obesity hypoventilation syndrome is under-recognized, and under-treated. Because obesity has become a national epidemic, it is critical that physicians are able to recognize and treat obesity-associated diseases. This article reviews current definitions of the obesity hypoventilation syndrome, clinical presentation and diagnosis, present understanding of the pathophysiology, and treatment options.

### Rapid changes in arterial carbon dioxide levels caused by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. the temptation of a fascinating technology [^115cwuG3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Since 2009, the publication year of the CESAR (Conventional Ventilatory Support Versus Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure) trial, the fascinating technique of extracorporeal support for the failing lung or for life-threatening cardiac instability has celebrated a triumph that continues to this day. Without doubt, the application of new technologies, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may save life in many cases. Yet, ECMO is a complex and risky measure, and it may be accompanied by severe adverse events, such as bleeding or neurologic injuries. The precise knowledge of ECMO management in critically ill patients is crucial for survival and for ensuring the health-related quality of life after transfer from the ICU. Interprofessional teamworking and a high level of expertise are required in terms of mechanical ventilation during ECMO, anticoagulation, positioning of the patients, and strategies of weaning. Incidentally, a position paper, among the quality aspects, on the use of such an attractive device was published in 2018.

In accordance with the mostly accepted indications for ECMO, such a technique should be considered in severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia (venovenous ECMO), or in acute cardiac failure (venoarterial ECMO). Although most intensivists report a rapid (and perhaps lifesaving) increase in oxygenation after the initiation of ECMO, less attention was paid to changes in the carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels in the early phase of ECMO treatment. Most ECMO users are happy with a relatively high sweep gas flow resulting in a prompt oxygen increase in the blood, accompanied by a rapid decrease in Pa CO 2 and an increase in the pH value. In a recent international multicenter prospective cohort study on current practices in ECMO management, a sweep gas flow of around 5 L/min was preferred by most intensivists, resulting in a significant, and often rapidly occurring, reduction in arterial CO 2 levels because CO 2 removal is predominantly and very effectively regulated by the amount of the sweep gas flow. Remarkably, in an experimental animal study in 1995, Liem and colleagues observed adverse effects of hypercapnia and hypocapnia in pigs on ECMO, and they recommended that "it is important to keep arterial CO 2 tension stable and in normal range during clinical ECMO". Over and above this, some small retrospective observational studies found deleterious effects of a rapid reduction in CO 2 levels in patients using ECMO after cannulation.

### An abrupt decrease in arterial blood pressure may predict a high level carbon dioxide embolism in retroperitoneoscopic surgery: case report and a literature review [^112acXMr]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic surgeries by transperitoneal, retroperitoneal approach and robotic assisted laparoscopy have gained increasing popularity and rapidly expanded as minimal invasive techniques. One of the fatal complications is carbon dioxide (CO 2) embolism due to the direct puncture of the major vessels, and other courses of CO 2 embolism, such as gas absorption through the vein plexus, need further exploration.

A multicenter research of incidents in time of laparoscopic surgery indicated that CO 2 embolism is the primary suspect in most cases of intraoperative "cardiovascular" collapse. So, by monitoring the hemodynamic and respiratory variables, early detection of CO 2 embolism followed by immediate treatment may avoid serious complications and decrease the mortality caused by clinically significant CO 2 embolism.

### Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for lowering the risk of mechanical ventilation: research questions and clinical potential for the future [^1113zEc4]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

As a result of technical improvements, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R) now has the potential to play an important role in the management of adults with acute respiratory failure. There is growing interest in the use of ECCO 2 R for the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. However, evidence to support its use is scarce and several questions remain about the best way to implement this therapy, which can be associated with serious side-effects. This Review reflects the consensus opinion of an international group of clinician scientists with expertise in managing acute respiratory failure and in using ECCO 2 R therapies in this setting. We concisely review clinically relevant aspects of ECCO 2 R, and provide a series of recommendations for clinical practice and future research, covering topics that include the practicalities of ECCO 2 R delivery, indications for use, and service delivery.

### Use of carbon dioxide production to detect bacterial superinfections in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an exploratory prospective cohort study [^113HpU6W]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we did not find a sudden clinically relevant increase in daily median V'CO2 of > 20% to be associated with the onset of a bacterial superinfection on the same day, despite strong evidence for higher daily median V'CO2 levels in patients who developed a superinfection. The high specificity of a sudden V'CO2 increase in detecting superinfection suggests that a significant daily rise in V'CO2 should prompt consideration of a bacterial superinfection. However, given the poor sensitivity observed, we do not propose daily V'CO2 increases as a stand-alone diagnostic method for pulmonary superinfections. Rather, we suggest it may serve as a supportive tool to raise clinical suspicion when integrated with other clinical, microbiological and radiological findings. Our results may help inform future management of ARDS and highlight the need for further research, ideally using a larger sample size and more diverse patient populations.

C. Arterial and capillary blood gases (see full Guideline sections 7.1.3 and 8.4 and 8.5)
C1. For critically ill patients or those with shock or hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), the initial blood gas measurement should be obtained from an arterial sample. For most patients who require blood gas sampling, either arterial blood gases or arterialised earlobe blood gases may be used to obtain an accurate measure of pH and PCO 2. However, the PO 2 is less accurate in earlobe blood gas samples (it underestimates the oxygen tension by 0.5–1 kPa) so oximetry should be monitored carefully if earlobe blood gas specimens are used and a repeat arterial specimen should be taken if there is any concern about the accuracy of a capillary sample (grade D).
C2. Local anaesthesia should be used for all arterial blood gas specimens except in emergencies (grade A).
C3. Blood gases should be checked in the following situations: ▶ All critically ill patients (Grade D). ▶ Unexpected or inappropriate fall in SpO 2 below 94% in patients breathing air or oxygen or any patient requiring oxygen to achieve the above target range. (Allowance should be made for transient dips in saturation to 90% or less in normal individuals during sleep) (grade D). ▶ Deteriorating oxygen saturation (fall of ≥ 3%) or increasing breathlessness in a patient with previously stable chronic hypoxaemia (eg, severe COPD) (grade D). ▶ Most previously stable patients who deteriorate clinically and require increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) to maintain a constant oxygen saturation (grade D). ▶ Any patient with risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure who develops acute breathlessness, deteriorating oxygen saturation, drowsiness or other symptoms of carbon dioxide retention (grade D). ▶ Patients with breathlessness who are thought to be at risk of metabolic conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis or metabolic acidosis due to renal failure (grade D). ▶ Any other evidence from the patient's medical condition that would indicate that blood gas results would be useful in the patient's management (eg, an unexpected change in 'track and trigger' systems such as a sudden rise of several units in the NEWS score or an unexpected fall in oxygen saturation of 3% or more, even if within the target range) (grade D).

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^111jRp6m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

Do not use unless solution is clear and the container or seal is intact. Discard unused portion.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^114ZFUvR]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In infants (up to two years of age), the 4.2% solution is recommended for intravenous administration at a dose not to exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. Slow administration rates and the 4.2% solution are recommended in neonates, to guard against the possibility of producing hypernatremia, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid pressure and inducing intracranial hemorrhage.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Clinical time course of COVID-19, its neurological manifestation and some thoughts on its management [^114rqQZ7]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

During this progression, D-dimer might have been a marker indicative of the seriousness of the infection. High level D-dimer was closely related to the severe stage of infection.D-Dimer elevation may be a turning point. Microangiopathy (autopsy proven) and thrombosis causing pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction will occur and are responsible for sudden death.

In severe patients, retaining CO 2 is a challenging problem. Due to extensive damage to the lungs, gas exchange becomes difficult. Frequent checking of arterial blood gas is needed to monitor PCO 2 levels. Only using pulse oximeter to monitor PO 2 may be misleading.

Currently, the treatment and vaccine for COVID-19 is under development. Those principles have been so effective to manage patients in our clinical practice:

Be vigilant of neurological symptoms with low lymphocyte count and if they occur, consider CT of chest and test for COVID-19.
If symptoms detected and nucleic acid is positive, start prescribing Arbidol or hydrochloroquine as treatment daily and quarantine in a hospital ward. Management of neurological symptoms continued.
Mild patients cannot go home but be quarantined somewhere else. About 20% of them will turn into severe cases.
More than a week later if fever and lung infections happen, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started when either sputum or blood cultures are positive, with or without elevated C reactive protein level.
When D-dimer is elevated, systemic anticoagulation is indicated. Antiplatelet therapy will fail.
Monitor arterial blood gas often and be aware of hypercapnia from the retention of PCO 2. Ventilator support when PO 2 is low and PCO 2 is high.
Consider intravenous immunoglobulin at the later phase.

### Evaluation and treatment of respiratory alkalosis [^111gRCV3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is the most frequent acid-base disturbance encountered in clinical practice. This is particularly true in critically ill patients, for whom the degree of hypocapnia directly correlates with adverse outcomes. Although this acid-base disturbance often is considered benign, evidence suggests that the alkalemia of primary hypocapnia can cause clinically significant decreases in tissue oxygen delivery. Mild respiratory alkalosis often serves as a marker of an underlying disease and may not require therapeutic intervention. In contrast, severe respiratory alkalosis should be approached with a sense of urgency and be aggressively corrected.

### Oxygen therapy in the pre-hospital setting for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112dKf6b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a global leading cause of morbidity and mortality, characterised by acute deterioration in symptoms. During these exacerbations, people are prone to developing alveolar hypoventilation, which may be partly caused by the administration of high inspired oxygen concentrations.

Objectives

To determine the effect of different inspired oxygen concentrations ("high flow" compared to "controlled") in the pre-hospital setting (prior to casualty/emergency department) on outcomes for people with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, reference lists of articles and online clinical trial databases were searched. Authors of identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were also contacted for details of other relevant published and unpublished studies. The most recent search was conducted on 16 September 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing oxygen therapy at different concentrations or oxygen therapy versus placebo in the pre-hospital setting for treatment of AECOPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcome was all-cause and respiratory-related mortality.

Main Results

The search identified a total of 824 citations; one study was identified for inclusion and two studies are awaiting classification. The 214 participants involved in the included study were adults with AECOPD, receiving treatment by paramedics en route to hospital. The mean age of participants was 68 years. A reduction in pre/in-hospital mortality was observed in favour of the titrated oxygen group (two deaths in the titrated oxygen group compared to 11 deaths in the high-flow control arm; risk ratio (RR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.97; 214 participants). This translates to an absolute effect of 94 per 1000 (high-flow oxygen) compared to 21 per 1000 (titrated oxygen), and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 14 (95% CI 12 to 355) with titrated oxygen therapy. Other than mortality, no other adverse events were reported in the included study. Wide confidence intervals were observed between groups for arterial blood gas (though this may be confounded by protocol infidelity in the included study for this outcome measure), treatment failure requiring invasive or non-invasive ventilation or hospital utilisation. No data were reported for quality of life, lung function or dyspnoea. Risk of bias within the included study was largely unclear, though there was high risk of bias in domains relating to performance and attrition bias. We judged the evidence to be of low certainty, according to GRADE criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

The one included study found a reduction in pre/in-hospital mortality for the titrated oxygen arm compared to the high-flow control arm. However, the paucity of evidence somewhat limits the reliability of these findings and generalisability to other settings. There is a need for robust, well-designed RCTs to further investigate the effect of oxygen therapies in the pre-hospital setting for people with AECOPD.

### Furosemide [^111zRPyH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The principal signs and symptoms of overdose with furosemide are dehydration, blood volume reduction, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, hypokalemia and hypochloremic alkalosis, and are extensions of its diuretic action.

The acute toxicity of furosemide has been determined in mice, rats and dogs. In all three, the oral LD50exceeded 1,000 mg/kg body weight, while the intravenous LD50ranged from 300 to 680 mg/kg. The acute intragastric toxicity in neonatal rats is 7 to 10 times that of adult rats.

The concentration of furosemide in biological fluids associated with toxicity or death is not known.

Treatment of overdosage is supportive and consists of replacement of excessive fluid and electrolyte losses. Serum electrolytes, carbon dioxide level and blood pressure should be determined frequently. Adequate drainage must be assured in patients with urinary bladder outlet obstruction (such as prostatic hypertrophy).

Hemodialysis does not accelerate furosemide elimination.

### Pulmonary hypertension in the intensive care unit. expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric pulmonary hypertension. the European paediatric pulmonary vascular disease network, endorsed by ISHLT and DGPK [^116vvv7m]. Heart (2016). Medium credibility.

Paediatric pulmonary hypertension — anaesthesia and ventilation management: "Mechanical ventilation is indicated in severe PH with profound cyanosis, respiratory or metabolic acidosis not responding to initial therapy, respiratory failure", whereas "In patients responding to medical therapy mechanical ventilation should be avoided". "Positive pressure ventilation impairs cardiac filling and output especially in the failing RV". For ventilator targets, "Normoventilation (pCO2-levels 35–40 mm Hg) and long expiratory times are recommended", and "Hyperventilation reduces cardiac output, increases SVR and injures lung parenchyma".

Prioritization of Outcomes

Following the standard GRADE guidance, the panel rated each outcome for their perceived importance to a patient with COPD on a scale of 1–9, with mean scores of 7–9 indicating a "critical" outcome, mean scores of 4–6 indicating an "important but not critical" outcome, and scores of 1–3 indicating an outcome that was "not important". In general, outcomes deemed critical should be most informative to the panel in generating recommendations. The panel identified 11 key outcomes that would take priority in guideline decision-making for all PICO questions: dyspnea, hospitalizations, mortality, 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD), serum CO 2 and O 2, QOL, FEV 1, FVC, sleep efficiency, and minor side effects.

Literature Search and Study Selection

With the assistance of a medical librarian, the two methodologists conducted literature searches for each PICO question. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL (Central Register of Controlled Trials), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science from inception to April 2019 for English-language observational studies and RCTs addressing the PICO questions of interest. If existing systematic reviews addressing the PICO questions were available, these searches and reviews were updated to include the latest evidence. The two methodologists screened all potential citations identified by the search independently in duplicate to identify all relevant studies to include in the quantitative evidence summaries.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113pD4xK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 3–4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — patient-level controller choice indicates that treatment choices for individual patients also take into account any patient characteristics or phenotype, or any environmental exposures, that may predict their risk of exacerbations or other adverse outcomes, together with assessment of multimorbidity, the patient's goals and preferences, and practical issues such as cost, ability to use the medication and adherence. Choosing between controller options for individual patients uses shared decision-making with the patient or parent/caregiver to discuss preferred treatment (as above) based on evidence for symptom control and risk reduction; patient characteristics or phenotype, including features that predict differences in future risk or treatment response (e.g., smoker; history of exacerbations, blood eosinophilia or high FeNO; environmental exposures); whether there are modifiable risk factors or multimorbidity that may affect treatment outcomes; patient views about goals, beliefs and concerns; and practical issues including which inhaler(s) are available to the patient, inhaler technique – can the patient use the inhaler correctly after training, adherence – how often is the patient likely to take the medication, cost to patient – can the patient afford the medication, and which of the available inhalers has the lowest environmental impact.

### Tolerance and survival in severe chronic hypercapnia… [^1156uL2Y]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study of ten patients, mean age, 56 years, with a mean forced expiratory volume in one second, 0. 41 liters, and mean level of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood of 90 mm Hg reveals that this chronic steady state can exist for many months and that it is well tolerated. Elevated CO2, per se, does not seem to cause central nervous system dysfunction with the possible exception of a fine tremor in some patients. Well oxygenated "steady state" chronically severely hypercapnic patients have the ability to maintain a high plasma bicarbonate level; mean, 45 mEq/liter; and, therefore, nearly normal arterial pH; mean, 7.

### Effect of elevated carbon dioxide on innate immune… [^116mu8YY]. stacks.cdc.gov (2014). Low credibility.

Details Personal Author: Bailey KL; Cloonan D; Devasure JM; Romberger D; Schneberger D; Wyatt T. Description: Purpose/Objective: Workers in high intensity livestock facilities exhibit reduced lung function over time in the industry. Many symptoms have been attributed to barn dust exposure and bacterial components in these dusts that can activate innate immune responses. Under circumstances of decreased ventilation of barn facilities and increased pulmonary obstruction, the lungs of these workers may also be exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide. Methods/Efforts: In recent years there have been conflicting reports on the effects of CO2 on inflammation in the lung from studies of permissive hypercapnia. We proposed these changes would be reflected in lung epithelial cells.

To address this we looked at several cell lines representing bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium, and alveolar macrophages and how they responded to stimulation with a variety of innate immune stimuli as well as barn dust under normal and elevated CO2. Results/Findings: We show that all cell types tested showed an increase in production of inflammatory signaling molecules in response to higher CO2, suggesting that CO2 may enhance inflammation in the lung, or make these cells more responsive to potential inflammatory molecules in the environment. Interestingly, expression of anti-microbial molecules produced by these same cells showed reductions in several at elevated CO2, suggesting that killing of microbes may at the same time be inhibited by CO2. In fact barn dust exposure itself may be inhibiting this one microbial defense mechanism.

Application to Field Research: The study of hypercapnia and its effect on innate immunity is a basic study that has immediate implications for work on smoking, workplace safety, ventilator lung strategy, and infection in cases of chronic obstruction.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (EOLIA) [^113CKbhg]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview Background: The acute respiratory distress syndrome is generally a severe pulmonary disease, whose associated mortality remains high. The most severe forms of ARDS, during which the hypoxemia induced by the lung involvement is the most profound, have an even more dismal prognosis, with a mortality rate exceeding 60%, despite resorting to exceptional adjunctive therapies, like NO inhalation, prone positioning of the patients, almitrine infusion or high frequency oscillation -type ventilation. To minimize the trauma induced by mechanical ventilation, the following ventilator settings will be used: volume-assist control mode, FiO2 30–60%, PEEP ≥ 10 cm H2O, VT lowered to obtain a plateau pressure < 25 cm H2O, respiration rate 10–30/minute or APRV mode with high pressure level < 25 cm H2O and low pressure level ≥ 10 cm H2O. One of the 3 following criteria of disease severity: i.

PaO2/FiO2 < 50 mm Hg with FiO2 ≥ 80% for > 3 hours, despite optimization of mechanical ventilation and despite possible recourse to usual adjunctive therapies OR. ii. PaO2/FiO2 < 80 mm Hg with FiO2 ≥ 80% for > 6 hours, despite optimization of mechanical ventilation and despite possible recourse to usual adjunctive therapies OR. iii. pH < 7. 25 for > 6 hours resulting from MV settings adjusted to keep plat ≤ 32 cm H2O (first, tidal volume reduction by steps of 1 mL/kg to 4 mL/kg then PEEP reduction to a minimum of 8 cm H2O.
