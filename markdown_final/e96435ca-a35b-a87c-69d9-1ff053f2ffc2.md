## Question

Summary of methamphetamine vs cocaine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a summary comparing methamphetamine versus cocaine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms and pharmacokinetics that drive clinical differences. Then, I should verify epidemiology and overdose trends. Next, I will examine neurobiological and neurocognitive effects, followed by clinical presentations and organ-specific harms. After that, I need to review treatment response and guideline-based management, including acute care. Finally, I will consider special populations, risk modifiers, and synthesize practical clinical implications with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology, because mechanism often predicts clinical phenotype. Methamphetamine both increases dopamine release and blocks reuptake, with a half-life around 10–12 hours, yielding prolonged stimulant effects, whereas cocaine primarily blocks dopamine reuptake with a much shorter half-life near 1 hour, producing briefer but intense effects; these distinctions matter for duration of intoxication, withdrawal, and treatment windows [^3666e383] [^6d5f2364]. Wait, let me verify the mechanistic nuance: methamphetamine also redistributes dopamine from vesicles and can internalize DAT, which amplifies and sustains synaptic dopamine beyond simple reuptake blockade, reinforcing its longer clinical footprint [^6d5f2364].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and overdose trends to anchor public health implications. Methamphetamine use and overdose deaths have surged in the U.S., with psychostimulant-involved deaths rising more than 12-fold from 2012 to 2021, while cocaine deaths roughly tripled over the same interval; stimulants now feature in about half of U.S. overdose deaths, with methamphetamine predominating among psychostimulants and cocaine remaining a major contributor as well [^16b7edf5] [^998b1777]. Hold on, I should verify regional and demographic patterns: methamphetamine is especially prominent in the West, whereas cocaine use and harms are more concentrated in the East and among Black populations, reflecting both supply and historical use patterns [^8630c824] [^34477229].

> I will now examine neurobiological effects, because they shape addiction severity and treatment response. Both drugs downregulate striatal dopamine markers, but methamphetamine shows greater DAT reductions and more persistent dopaminergic deficits, which correlate with higher relapse risk and treatment resistance; imaging meta-analyses show large effect sizes for reduced dopamine release and D2/D3 receptor availability across stimulants, with particularly pronounced DAT loss in methamphetamine users [^64d4b881] [^134c463e]. Let me consider structural and functional brain changes: chronic use of either stimulant is linked to frontal cortical volume loss and impaired executive function, but methamphetamine is more consistently associated with neurotoxic injury and white matter alterations, which may underlie its stronger cognitive and psychiatric sequelae [^8ed6e6d5] [^43642d57].

> Now, I should review clinical presentations and organ-specific harms, starting with the cardiovascular system. Both agents increase risk of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality, but methamphetamine confers a higher hazard ratio for incident ventricular arrhythmia than cocaine, and both show disproportionate risk in younger individuals and females, likely reflecting direct electrophysiologic toxicity and catecholaminergic surges; importantly, methamphetamine is also linked to a distinctive cardiomyopathy phenotype with pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, which is less characteristic of cocaine-related cardiotoxicity [^8b3b8844] [^9608a825]. Hold on, I should verify acute coronary care guidance: in suspected intoxication, avoid beta-blockers due to risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and coronary spasm; prefer benzodiazepines, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers for hypertension and ischemia, and manage ACS similarly otherwise with close monitoring [^0f02c71f] [^aa1d5986].

> Let me consider neuropsychiatric and cerebrovascular risks next. Methamphetamine carries a higher propensity for psychosis than cocaine, and population data suggest a several-fold increased risk of schizophrenia-spectrum admissions after methamphetamine exposure, although confounding and reverse causation remain concerns; clinically, methamphetamine-induced psychosis is common and may require antipsychotic management with attention to differential diagnoses [^5d0b8437] [^3017ef54]. I should double-check stroke data: methamphetamine is associated with markedly elevated hemorrhagic stroke risk, with hazard ratios around 2.1 in longitudinal data and even higher in registry analyses, whereas cocaine increases both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk; this has implications for primary prevention counseling and screening in people who use stimulants [^9abb1b74] [^1391e6bb].

> Next, I should review treatment response and guideline positions, because this directly affects care planning. For stimulant use disorder, there are no FDA-approved medications, and major guidelines conclude insufficient evidence for pharmacotherapy for either cocaine or methamphetamine; psychosocial treatments, particularly contingency management, remain first-line and show consistent benefits for retention and reduced use, though effect sizes are modest and durability varies [^fb75e678] [^01bc4817]. Wait, let me verify substitution strategies: trials of psychostimulants for cocaine dependence show mixed and low-quality results, and WHO advises against dexamphetamine for stimulant use disorders due to safety concerns, so substitution therapy should not be routine outside research settings [^7bb9ac81] [^b8695b86]. For methamphetamine-associated psychosis, atypical antipsychotics are used off-label with low-quality evidence, and clinicians should prioritize safety, monitoring, and addressing comorbidities while confirming etiology [^5d0b8437].

> I need to ensure acute care guidance is precise. In patients with chest pain and suspected stimulant intoxication, guidelines recommend considering cocaine or methamphetamine as causal, avoiding beta-blockers in acute intoxication, and using benzodiazepines with nitrates or calcium channel blockers for hypertension and ischemia; toxicology can assist diagnosis and management decisions when results will change care, but clinical assessment remains paramount [^00a05061] [^aa1d5986] [^7c74c160]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale: beta-blockade can worsen vasoconstriction in the setting of stimulant intoxication, so vasodilators and anxiolytics are preferred until the acute phase resolves [^0f02c71f].

> Let me consider special populations and risk modifiers, because they shift thresholds for screening and intervention. In people with HIV, both stimulants accelerate disease progression, impair ART adherence, and increase sexual risk behaviors; methamphetamine is particularly detrimental in this population and warrants integrated HIV and SUD care with contingency management and linkage strategies [^032dc533] [^f3d618c1]. In pregnancy, both substances are associated with adverse outcomes, and combined screening with self-report and toxicology improves detection; cessation during pregnancy improves outcomes, so nonpunitive, treatment-oriented approaches are essential [^869ecdbf]. For adolescents and young adults, therapeutic stimulant use for ADHD does not increase later illicit stimulant use, but prescription stimulant misuse is a strong predictor of subsequent cocaine or methamphetamine use, supporting targeted screening and early intervention [^368e596d] [^2897a93f].

> But wait, what about sex and gender differences that might influence clinical risk and treatment engagement. Women appear more sensitive to stimulant effects, transition faster to dependence, and have higher craving and psychiatric comorbidity; they also experience disproportionate cardiovascular harms from stimulants, including higher relative risks of ventricular arrhythmias, which should prompt lower thresholds for screening and integrated care [^569424c5] [^8b3b8844]. I should confirm that these findings align with clinical guidance emphasizing trauma-informed, sex-specific approaches in stimulant use disorder treatment, even though high-quality medication trials remain limited [^notfound].

> I should double-check the practical clinical implications so the synthesis is actionable. Methamphetamine tends to produce longer-lasting intoxication, more persistent neurotoxicity, higher psychosis risk, and a distinctive cardiomyopathy, whereas cocaine more often causes acute coronary syndromes and arrhythmias with shorter-lived effects; both increase stroke and arrhythmia risk, and both are frequently co-used with opioids, which complicates overdose presentations and necessitates naloxone access and stimulant-specific harm reduction [^9608a825] [^9abb1b74] [^677ffd94]. Given the absence of approved medications, prioritize contingency management, CBT-based approaches, and technology-enabled delivery to improve access, and integrate medical management of cardiovascular, psychiatric, and infectious comorbidities into longitudinal care plans [^01bc4817] [^00a492ad].

> Finally, I need to ensure the caveats and uncertainties are transparent. Much of the comparative literature is observational, with potential confounding by route of administration, polysubstance use, and ascertainment biases; nonetheless, converging mechanistic, epidemiologic, and clinical data support the broad differentials summarized here, and ongoing research on D3-selective agents, sigma-1 modulation, and other targets may eventually yield pharmacotherapies, but evidence remains preliminary [^134c463e] [^c2de650f]. Clinicians should individualize care, reassess frequently, and align interventions with patient goals, comorbidities, and social determinants to mitigate the substantial and rising harms from these stimulants [^1e1e19aa].

Methamphetamine and cocaine are both **highly addictive stimulants** with overlapping but distinct pharmacology, clinical effects, and risks. Methamphetamine has a **longer duration of action** (10–12 hours) [^3666e383] and greater neurotoxicity, leading to higher risks of psychosis, neurocognitive impairment, and cardiomyopathy [^5d0b8437] [^9608a825]. Cocaine acts faster and shorter (minutes to 1 hour), with higher risks of acute coronary events and arrhythmias [^9cad37fb]. Both cause dopamine dysregulation and severe cardiovascular harm, but methamphetamine's longer half-life and broader organ toxicity drive more chronic complications. No medications are FDA-approved for either disorder; **contingency management is first-line** [^01bc4817], and cocaine shows stronger evidence for psychosocial treatment response.

| **Feature** | **Methamphetamine** | **Cocaine** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Releases dopamine and blocks reuptake; longer half-life (10–12 h) [^3666e383] | Blocks dopamine reuptake; short half-life (~1 h) [^3666e383] |
| Clinical effects | Prolonged euphoria, alertness, insomnia, appetite suppression | Rapid onset, brief euphoria, increased energy, anxiety |
| Neurotoxicity | High; dopamine deficits, psychosis, cognitive impairment [^749c2ed8] | Moderate; less persistent neurocognitive deficits [^notfound] |
| Cardiovascular risk | Cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, stroke [^9608a825] [^9abb1b74] | Acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, sudden death [^9cad37fb] |
| Overdose risk | Rising sharply; frequent co-use with fentanyl [^16b7edf5] [^34477229] | Stable/high; frequent co-use with opioids [^16b7edf5] [^984f4d90] |
| Treatment response | Contingency management effective; no FDA-approved meds [^01bc4817] [^fb75e678] | Contingency management effective; stronger evidence base [^01bc4817] |

---

In sum, methamphetamine poses **greater chronic toxicity and psychiatric risk**, whereas cocaine carries **higher acute cardiovascular risk**; both require urgent, evidence-based psychosocial treatment and integrated medical care [^1e1e19aa].

Methamphetamine is a substantial public health problem in many communities in the United States and in other parts of the world. In order to bring new knowledge about methamphetamine to policy makers, clinicians and researchers, this volume has compiled a set of articles containing new information about the drug and its effects. The articles contain information presented by researchers at two special methamphetamine meetings sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse in 2005.

Compared with other illicit substances, stimulants are not commonly used by adolescents; however, they represent a serious concern regarding substance use among youths. This article uses methamphetamine as a model for stimulant use in adolescents; cocaine and prescription stimulants are also mentioned. Methamphetamine use among adolescents and young adults is a serious health concern with potentially long-term physical, cognitive, and psychiatric consequences. Brain development and the effects of misusing stimulants align such that usage in adolescents can more dangerous than during adulthood. It seems helpful to keep in mind the differences between adolescents and young adults when implementing interventions.

### Illicit stimulants and ventricular arrhythmias: a longitudinal cohort study [^ee18256e]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Methamphetamine and cocaine use are each associated with a heightened risk of incident VA and all-cause mortality. The magnitude of the risk associated with these substances was similar to most well-established cardiovascular risk factors. Unlike many of those risk factors and with the caveat that physical addiction may limit ready cessation of these drugs, these drugs represent a modifiable risk factor under the immediate control of the user. These findings stress the importance of avoiding methamphetamine and cocaine to prevent VA and premature death. Recognizing and, in the future, better understanding the differences in the impact of these substances across demographic groups may enhance prevention strategies.

### Association of stimulant use with dopaminergic alterations in users of cocaine, amphetamine, or methamphetamine: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^64d4b881]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Stimulant use disorder is common, affecting between 0.3% and 1.1% of the population, and costs more than $85 billion per year globally. There are no licensed treatments to date. Several lines of evidence implicate the dopamine system in the pathogenesis of substance use disorder. Therefore, understanding the nature of dopamine dysfunction seen in stimulant users has the potential to aid the development of new therapeutics.

Objective

To comprehensively review the in vivo imaging evidence for dopaminergic alterations in stimulant (cocaine, amphetamine, or methamphetamine) abuse or dependence.

Data Sources

The entire PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies from inception date to May 14, 2016.

Study Selection

Case-control studies were identified that compared dopaminergic measures between stimulant users and healthy controls using positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography to measure striatal dopamine synthesis or release or to assess dopamine transporter availability or dopamine receptor availability.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Demographic, clinical, and imaging measures were extracted from each study, and meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted for stimulants combined, as well as for cocaine and for amphetamine and methamphetamine separately if there were sufficient studies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Differences were measured in dopamine release (assessed using change in the D2/D3 receptor availability after administration of amphetamine or methylphenidate), dopamine transporter availability, and dopamine receptor availability in cocaine users, amphetamine and methamphetamine users, and healthy controls.

Results

A total of 31 studies that compared dopaminergic measures between 519 stimulant users and 512 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. In most of the studies, the duration of abstinence varied from 5 days to 3 weeks. There was a significant decrease in striatal dopamine release in stimulant users compared with healthy controls: the effect size was -0.84 (95% CI, -1.08 to -0.60; P < .001) for stimulants combined and -0.87 (95% CI, -1.15 to -0.60; P < .001) for cocaine. In addition, there was a significant decrease in dopamine transporter availability: the effect size was -0.91 (95% CI, -1.50 to -0.32; P < .01) for stimulants combined and -1.47 (95% CI, -1.83 to -1.10; P < .001) for amphetamine and methamphetamine. There was also a significant decrease in D2/D3 receptor availability: the effect size was -0.76 (95% CI, -0.92 to -0.60; P < .001) for stimulants combined, -0.73 (95% CI, -0.94 to -0.53; P < .001) for cocaine, and -0.81 (95% CI, -1.12 to -0.49; P < .001) for amphetamine and methamphetamine. Consistent alterations were not found in vesicular monoamine transporter, dopamine synthesis, or D1 receptor studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Data suggest that both presynaptic and postsynaptic aspects of the dopamine system in the striatum are down-regulated in stimulant users. The commonality and differences between these findings and the discrepancies with the preclinical literature and models of drug addiction are discussed, as well as their implications for future drug development.

### Location, location: using functional magnetic resonance imaging to pinpoint brain differences relevant to stimulant use [^446d2184]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

The purpose of this review is to summarize the neural substrate dysfunctions and disrupted cognitive, affective and experiential processes observed in methamphetamine and cocaine-dependent individuals.

Methods

We reviewed all publications in PubMed that conducted comparison studies between healthy volunteers and cocaine-, amphetamine- or methamphetamine-dependent individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Results

Stimulant dependence is characterized by a distributed alteration of functional activation to a number of experimental paradigms. Attenuated anterior and posterior cingulate activation, reduced inferior frontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation and altered posterior parietal activation point towards an inadequate demand-specific processing of information. Processes reported most consistently to be deficient in these functional neuroimaging studies include inhibitory control, executive functioning and decision-making.

Conclusion

One emerging theme is that stimulant-dependent individuals show specific, rather than generic, brain activation differences, i.e. instead of showing more or less brain activation regardless of task, they exhibit process-related brain activation differences that are consistent with a shift from context-specific, effortful processing to more stereotyped, habitual response generation.

### Is the self-report of recent cocaine or methamphetamine use reliable in illicit stimulant drug users who present to the emergency department with chest pain? [^a3d43af4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Use of illicit drugs results in an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, which is often seen in the Emergency Department (ED). Chest pain is frequently associated with cocaine and methamphetamine use.

Objectives

To determine if the self-report of recent cocaine or methamphetamine use is reliable in illicit stimulant drug users who present to the ED with chest pain.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients presenting to the ED from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006 was undertaken. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18 years, chief complaint of chest pain, documented social history of drug abuse, positive urine toxicology screen and myoglobin and troponin levels measured, sent from the ED.

Results

For the 318 patients who met the inclusion criteria, the self-report rate of cocaine or methamphetamine use was 51.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–0.57). No difference was found in the self-report rate between users of methamphetamine vs. cocaine (odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% CI 0.7–1.7). There also was no difference in the self-report rate by patient age < 50 years compared to patient age ≥ 50 years (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42–1.08). The self-report rate for males compared to females was not significantly different (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54–1.4). Patients who had a positive troponin were not significantly more likely to self-report drug use than patients who did not have a positive troponin (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.55–2.2).

Conclusion

The self-report rate among cocaine- or methamphetamine-using patients presenting to the ED with chest pain was 51.8%. There seems to be no significant difference in the self-report rate among those who use methamphetamine vs. those who use cocaine, nor by gender, nor stratified by age over 50 years.

### Longitudinal changes in methamphetamine and cocaine use in untreated rural stimulant users: racial differences and the impact of methamphetamine legislation [^cf3fd328]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine how race and methamphetamine legislation are associated with changes in cocaine and methamphetamine use among untreated rural stimulant users.

Design

A longitudinal study of stimulant users identified through respondent-driven sampling.

Setting

Rural areas of three US states.

Participants

Participants at baseline were current users of methamphetamine and/or cocaine.

Measures

Self-reports of methamphetamine, crack cocaine and powder cocaine use were assessed at 6-month intervals over a 2-year period. Generalized estimating equations were performed to account for correlations between the repeated measurements.

Findings

Compared to whites, African Americans were much more likely to use crack cocaine, equally likely to use powder cocaine and much less likely to use methamphetamine. Both whites and African Americans reduced their consumption of methamphetamine and both forms of cocaine over 2 years. Exposure to laws restricting the purchase of over-the-counter cold medications containing methamphetamine precursors was not associated with methamphetamine use, but associated with a slight rise in powder and crack cocaine use.

Conclusions

The study yielded disconcerting as well as promising findings regarding the natural history of stimulant use in rural areas. Of some concern is that methamphetamine precursor laws were correlated with increased cocaine consumption, diminishing their net public health benefits. However, despite its insurgence in rural areas of the United States, very few African Americans have initiated methamphetamine use. Regardless of race, many stimulant users stopped using cocaine and methamphetamine without formal substance abuse treatment over 24 months.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^3666e383]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant use disorder — categorization by substance and pharmacology: The recommendations for non-psychostimulant and psychostimulant medications have been categorized by substance type (cocaine use disorder and ATS use disorder) due to different pharmacological mechanisms that may impact effectiveness, with cocaine and ATS both increasing dopamine signaling; cocaine blocks dopamine reuptake, whereas methamphetamine both increases dopamine release and blocks its reuptake, resulting in higher concentrations. Methamphetamine's half-life of 10 to 12 hours is significantly longer than cocaine's 1-hour half-life, leading to more prolonged effects.

### Sex differences in methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases in ventral striatum [^569424c5]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dopamine signaling in the brain is responsible for modulating functions critical for survival, including attention, memory, motor control, motivation, and reward-guided behaviors. Several lines of research point to sex-based differences in dopamine signaling, with consequences for health outcome disparities. Differential expression of genes in the sex chromosomes directly contributes to differences in midbrain dopaminergic signaling between men and women. These are thought to manifest in differences in brain structure and function that emerge in childhood, impacting behavior and vulnerability to neuropsychiatric illnesses including those associated with aberrant dopaminergic function. For instance, men are about 2.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than women, whereas women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with a mood disorder than men [e.g.].

Similarly, the prevalence of most substance use disorders (SUD) including that for stimulants is higher for males than females. However, differences in prevalence are driven in part by environmental factors that make women less likely to be exposed to drugs than men, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Moreover, the sensitivity to stimulant drugs appears to be higher for women than for men. Women experience more severe symptoms of cocaine use disorder than men: they transition from occasional cocaine taking to addiction more rapidly, exhibit greater cue-induced craving and withdrawal symptoms, and have poorer treatment outcomes. Similarly, in the case of methamphetamine, women take more drugs and transition from occasional use to dependence faster than men. Studies in human laboratory settings further suggest that women are more sensitive to the psychomotor and subjective behavioral effects of methamphetamine than men. Preclinical studies have corroborated significant sex differences in the response to stimulant drugs including locomotor and rewarding effects. These findings underscore the need to better understand sex differences in the brain's responses to dopamine-enhancing drugs in humans that might help clarify sex differences in vulnerability to SUD and other neuropsychiatric disorders that involve the dopaminergic system (e.g. ADHD, schizophrenia, mood disorders, and Parkinson's disease).

### Illicit stimulants and ventricular arrhythmias: a longitudinal cohort study [^98b4d7ee]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

It is also remarkable that the impact of methamphetamine and cocaine on the incidence of VA was higher in younger people and females. This may suggest that the proarrhythmic properties of these stimulants are independent of aging. The observed higher predictive value for methamphetamine and cocaine in females compared with males deserves further investigation. The sex differences in particular might be due to ventricular structural and electrophysiological differences resulting from the impact of sex hormones during cell development, differences in autonomic function, differences in body size (such that the same amount of a drug leads to greater serum concentrations), or the effects of circulating sex hormones before and after puberty. Another potential explanation is the fact that a risk factor for a disease tends to have a higher attributable risk in the absence of competing risk factors. Hence, the lower prevalence of classical risk factors for VA such as coronary artery disease in younger individuals and females might explain why they have relatively higher risk of VA attributable to methamphetamine and cocaine use compared with older individuals and males.

### The prevalence and negative impacts of substance use disorders among people with HIV in the United States: a real-time Delphi survey of key stakeholders [^ddc82695]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Although not specifically for PWH, nor within the U.S. nor for SUD, the negative impacts of different substances have been examined in the United Kingdom, European Union, and Australia, with each study identifying alcohol as the substance of greatest harm. For Australia, alcohol was followed by methamphetamine and opioids, with a substantial drop in the harm score for the other substances examined. The other two studies each found the second and third most harmful substances, after alcohol, to be heroin and crack cocaine, with methamphetamine, cocaine, and tobacco grouped together much lower. As part of our study, we found methamphetamine use disorder to have the highest individual-level negative impact and opioid use disorder to have the second highest, with a significant difference between these two use disorders and each of the others. The individual-level negative impacts of use disorders for cocaine and alcohol were about the same, and both were significantly higher than cannabis use disorder. Several important differences make it challenging to directly compare our results to these other three studies, including geographic differences, the difference between substance use and a SUD, the difference between the general population and PWH, and the difference in the rating criteria (i.e. our criteria included indicators of the HIV care continuum). However, even with these key differences, there appears to be relatively good convergence that the perceived harms associated with use/use disorders for alcohol, opioids, and methamphetamines are among the highest of all substances. As research improves our understanding of the ways in which outcomes for PWH are impacted by substance use and SUDs, there is a need for greater specificity regarding the substance and/or SUD (i.e. the impairment caused by some substances are significantly greater than others). Future research could further expand the knowledge base by exploring the extent to which the negative impacts on the HIV continuum of care vary by severity of substance use, including severity of substance use disorder (i.e. if there is a dose response relationship).

### Neurobiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of methamphetamine use disorder: a review [^5a632d44]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on stimulant use disorder:

- **Definition**: Stimulant use disorder is a chronic relapsing brain disorder characterized by the compulsive seeking and use of stimulants, such as amphetamines or cocaine, despite harmful consequences.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of stimulant use disorder extends beyond the acute effect of the drug as a monoaminergic modulator. It involves intracellular pathways focused on oxidative stress, neurotoxic and excitotoxic effects, and neuroinflammation. These changes in the brain's reward system lead to addiction.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of cocaine and amphetamine use disorders worldwide is estimated at 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for developing stimulant use disorder include genetic predisposition, environmental influences, and co-occurring mental health disorders. For example, blunted anterior insula activation during interoceptive perturbations has been associated with stimulant use disorder. Additionally, early initiation of drug use, such as in adolescence, is associated with a higher risk of developing substance use disorder.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of stimulant use disorder often begins with initial use, which can progress to dependence. This progression is typically characterized by increased tolerance, withdrawal symptoms upon cessation, and continued use despite negative consequences. Acute psychostimulatory symptoms may be accompanied by complex cardiovascular and cerebrovascular signs and symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of stimulant use disorder is variable and depends on several factors, including the severity of the disorder, the individual's overall health, and their access to treatment. While recovery is possible, it often requires long-term management and support.

### Risk factors for methamphetamine use in youth: a systematic review [^383c5139]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent stimulant that is readily available. Its effects are similar to cocaine, but the drug has a profile associated with increased acute and chronic toxicities. The objective of this systematic review was to identify and synthesize literature on risk factors that are associated with MA use among youth. More than 40 electronic databases, websites, and key journals/meeting abstracts were searched. We included studies that compared children and adolescents (≤ 18 years) who used MA to those who did not. One reviewer extracted the data and a second checked for completeness and accuracy. For discrete risk factors, odds ratios (OR) were calculated and when appropriate, a pooled OR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated. For continuous risk factors, mean difference and 95% CI were calculated and when appropriate, a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI was calculated. Results were presented separately by comparison group: low-risk (no previous drug abuse) and high-risk children (reported previous drug abuse or were recruited from a juvenile detention center).

Results

Twelve studies were included. Among low-risk youth, factors associated with MA use were: history of heroin/opiate use (OR = 29.3; 95% CI: 9.8–87.8), family history of drug use (OR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8–7.9), risky sexual behavior (OR = 2.79; 95% CI: 2.25, 3.46) and some psychiatric disorders. History of alcohol use and smoking were also significantly associated with MA use. Among high-risk youth, factors associated with MA use were: family history of crime (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2–3.3), family history of drug use (OR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8–7.9), family history of alcohol abuse (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.8–5.6), and psychiatric treatment (OR = 6.8; 95% CI: 3.6–12.9). Female sex was also significantly associated with MA use.

Conclusion

Among low-risk youth, a history of engaging in a variety of risky behaviors was significantly associated with MA use. A history of a psychiatric disorder was a risk factor for MA for both low- and high-risk youth. Family environment was also associated with MA use. Many of the included studies were cross-sectional making it difficult to assess causation. Future research should utilize prospective study designs so that temporal relationships between risk factors and MA use can be established.

### The sigma-1 receptor modulates methamphetamine dysregulation of dopamine neurotransmission [^c2de650f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

σRs have been widely implicated in METH addiction. METH interacts with the σ 1 R at physiologically relevant concentrations. Additionally, METH exposure increases σ 1 R levels in DAT-expressing brain regions of rodents, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra. Given evidence that σR ligands attenuate METH-induced behavioral responses, hyperthermia, and neurotoxicity –, the increase in σ 1 R levels following METH exposure potentially serves as an compensatory mechanism to decrease the effects of METH. However, the mechanisms by which the σ 1 R regulates the METH-stimulated responses are largely unknown. In contrast to METH, the potential molecular mechanisms by which the σ 1 R modulates responses to cocaine have been more thoroughly examined. It should be noted that while behavioral responses to both METH and cocaine are attributed to increased extracellular dopamine, METH rapidly enters the cell, releases dopamine from vesicular stores, and induces dopamine efflux via DAT. In contrast, cocaine blocks uptake of dopamine via DAT. These mechanistic differences may result in distinct pharmacological manipulation of the cellular responses to METH compared to cocaine and distinct modulation of these responses via the σ 1 R. As such, the present study is focused specifically on σ 1 R modulation of METH dysregulation of dopaminergic neurons.

Fig. 2
Contribution of each indicator to the individual-level negative impact scores

For each SUD, the average individual-level negative impact score is provided as part of Table 3 Panel A, with this information again reported by region, stakeholder perspective, and overall. Overall, methamphetamine use disorder was perceived as having the greatest individual-level negative impact score (19.4), followed by opioid use disorder (17.6), cocaine and alcohol use disorders (16.2 and 15.9, respectively), and cannabis use disorder (8.1). Based on the adjusted analyses, which again controlled for region and perspective, the individual-level negative impact scores between alcohol (15.9) and cocaine use disorders (16.2) did not differ significantly. In contrast, all other pairwise comparisons between individual-level negative impact scores were significantly different. The absolute effect size difference was very large between cannabis use disorder and use disorders for methamphetamine (d = 2.17), opioids (d = 1.77), alcohol (d = 1.63), and cocaine (d = 1.51). On average, the remaining significant differences were close to medium sized (average d = 0.45).

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cocaine and methamphetamine users, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to do not administer β-blockers in patients with ACS with a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use demonstrating signs of acute intoxication because of the risk of potentiating coronary spasm.

### The neurobiology of addiction: the perspective from magnetic resonance imaging present and future [^8ed6e6d5]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Brain anatomy and structure

The most prevalent method for measuring brain structure, voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) 10, draws upon the contrast between grey and white matter in high‐resolution MRI to estimate tissue volumes, as well as ventricular volumes that are filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Following digital alignment of these tissue maps, statistical comparisons that search, for example, for significant case–control differences at every intra‐cerebral location are possible in what is often termed a 'whole‐brain' analysis.

Qualitatively, almost all drugs of abuse are associated with reductions in cortical volume, especially in the frontal lobes, reiterating the general observations made in the earliest studies. This is accompanied by increases in the volumes of subcortical structures associated with dependency on stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine 11. A formal meta‐analysis of the whole‐brain VBM literature partly supports this view 12 with decreases in volumes in prefrontal cortex, but also in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, pregenual anterior cingulate and anterior thalamus with, notably, the decline in grey matter in frontal regions related to duration of dependency. However, changes in the subcortices are not seen across the literature, which may be due to inconsistent results in the primary literature or a bias in the sensitivity of the VBM methodology in these regions of the brain 12.

Several studies to date show that different addiction groups have reduced grey matter volume compared to healthy controls in regions of the brain targeted by the specific drug of abuse, including alcohol 13, cocaine 14, 15, amphetamine 16 and nicotine 17, 18, 19. However, the approaches taken in these studies appear to neglect the contribution to structural deficits that arise from relapse, treatment outcome and abstinence; it is unclear how former addicts remain abstinent even with severe structural deficits in brain regions implicated in addiction 20. Furthermore, there is evidence for shared structural deficits between addict and non‐addict populations. Abnormalities in frontostriatal brain systems in both stimulant‐dependent individuals and their biological siblings who have no history of chronic drug abuse 21 potentially devalue the clinical significance of these outcome measures for addiction.

White matter differences have been difficult to observe with whole‐brain VBM in heavy cannabis users 22 and cocaine addiction addicts 23. Detections of white matter changes have been associated with amphetamine use, with results equivocal concerning the direction and location of case–control differences 1. This suggests that if addiction does lead to changes in white matter, they occur most probably at the microscopic scale without consistent observable changes in volume.

### Cocaine or methamphetamine use during young adulthood following stimulant use for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder during adolescence [^368e596d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is adolescents' use of stimulant therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) associated with cocaine and methamphetamine use as young adults?

Findings

In this cohort study of 5034 respondents, adolescents who used stimulant therapy for ADHD did not differ from their peers in cocaine and methamphetamine use at 19 to 24 years of age. In contrast, adolescents' prescription stimulant misuse was associated with greater adjusted odds of later cocaine and methamphetamine use compared with population controls.

Meaning

These findings suggest that adolescents' use of stimulant therapy was not associated with increased risk for illicit stimulant use; however, prescription stimulant misuse was a signal for cocaine or methamphetamine use and warrants monitoring and screening.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^032dc533]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Stimulants — cocaine and methamphetamine in people with HIV: Cocaine and methamphetamine are powerful stimulants associated with accelerated disease progression, poor ART adherence, and lack of viral suppression among people with HIV. Cocaine powder is snorted or injected, with the free-base form (crack) smoked, whereas methamphetamines can be taken orally or rectally, injected, or smoked. These substances are commonly used with other substances including alcohol and can be combined with fentanyl, which increases the risk of overdose. Individuals who use stimulants may experience heightened sexual desire and arousal, which can lead to disinhibited sexual behaviors and increase the risk of HIV transmission.

### Use of stimulants to treat cocaine and methamphetamine abuse [^2fed1c7a]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

The concept of using stimulants to treat cocaine and methamphetamine dependence is largely based on the "replacement" therapy model that has shown efficacy for treating nicotine and opiate dependence. Although results have been mixed, some evidence supports using stimulant medication to reduce cocaine use. There are not enough data to date to determine the efficacy of stimulants for methamphetamine dependence. Drawbacks of stimulants as treatments include the potential for abuse of the treatment, which necessitates careful screening and monitoring of patients. Possible reasons for efficacy of stimulants include enhancement of monoamine function dysregulated by chronic cocaine or methamphetamine use. Newer medications that enhance dopamine function but lack the abuse potential of older stimulants are being studied. It is hoped that these medications will provide safe, effective treatment for cocaine and methamphetamine dependence, but more research on this topic is needed.

### Fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine analyte concentrations in urine drug testing specimens [^34477229]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cross-sectional study, to our knowledge, is the largest and most granular assessment of drug use patterns in the US to date. Its findings reveal changes in drug exposure and illicit drug supply over the past decade and highlight the need to reinforce surveillance initiatives and accelerate efforts to effectively treat IMF and/or stimulant exposure. The UDT results from 2013 to 2023 provide objective, biological evidence that persons presenting to treatment for SUD have increasingly higher absolute exposure to fentanyl and methamphetamine, as well as cocaine to a smaller degree, and decreasing exposure to heroin. These concentrations conformed to regional reports on drug use patterns, with IMF replacing heroin throughout most of the country and methamphetamine being most prominent in the Western regions. A concerted research strategy is necessary to lessen the consequences of increased exposure levels in individuals with SUD and to support focused public health and biomedical research efforts to understand and curtail overdoses from the twin opioid-stimulant epidemic.

### Characterization of nonfatal opioid, cocaine, methamphetamine, and polydrug exposure and clinical presentations reported to the toxicology investigators consortium core registry, January 2010-December 2021 [^677ffd94]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To characterize and compare opioid-only, cocaine-only, methamphetamine-only, opioid-and-cocaine exposure, and opioid-and-methamphetamine exposure and to examine clinical presentations, leading to a better understanding of overdose effects involving these drug exposures.

Methods

We examined drug exposures in the Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) Core Registry from January 2010 to December 2021, a case registry of patients presenting to participating healthcare sites that receive a medical toxicology consultation. Demographic and clinical presentations of opioid-only, cocaine-only, methamphetamine-only, and opioid-and-cocaine exposure, and opioid-and-methamphetamine exposure consultations were described; differences between single and polydrug exposure subgroups were calculated to determine statistical significance. Clinical presentations associated with exposures were evaluated through calculated adjusted relative risk.

Results

A total of 3,883 consultations involved opioids, cocaine, methamphetamine, opioid-and-cocaine exposure, or opioid-and-methamphetamine exposure. Opioid-only (n = 2,268, 58.4%) and methamphetamine-only (n = 712, 18.3%) comprised most consultations. There were significant differences in clinical presentations between exposure subgroups. Opioid-and-cocaine exposure consultations were 8.15 times as likely to present with a sympathomimetic toxidrome than opioid-only. Conversely, opioid-and-cocaine exposure and opioid-and-methamphetamine exposure were 0.32 and 0.42 times as likely to present with a sympathomimetic toxidrome compared to cocaine-only and methamphetamine-only consultations, respectively. Opioid-and-cocaine exposure was 0.67 and opioid-and-methamphetamine exposure was 0.74 times as likely to present with respiratory depression compared to opioid-only consultations. Similarly, opioid-and-cocaine exposure was 0.71 and opioid-and-methamphetamine exposure was 0.78 times as likely to present with CNS depression compared to opioid-only consultations.

Conclusions

Used in combination, opioids and stimulants may mask typical clinical presentations of one another, misattributing incorrect drugs to overdose in both clinical treatment and public health surveillance.

### Does the association between stimulant use and high risk sexual behavior vary by injection drug use, sexual minority status, or HIV infection status? A meta-analysis [^2c1af709]. AIDS and Behavior (2023). Medium credibility.

There is strong evidence linking stimulant use, namely methamphetamine use, to sexual risk behavior among sexual minority men (SMM); we do not, however, have a good understanding of this relationship among other at-risk populations. In this study, we systematically reviewed associations between stimulant use (i.e., methamphetamine, crack cocaine, cocaine) and sexual risk behaviors among populations facing elevated risk of HIV transmission and acquisition (i.e. SMM, people who inject drugs (PWID), and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH)). Random-effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses that included crude and adjusted estimates separately were conducted to evaluate the impact of potential confounding variables. The results showed strong relationships between stimulant use and condomless sex, transactional sex, and multiple sexual partners. Results were broadly consistent when analyses were stratified by type of stimulant (methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and other stimulants) and risk group. Sensitivity analyses with confounding variables did not greatly impact results. The results indicate that stimulant use is associated with numerous sexual risk behaviors regardless of risk group, suggesting prevention efforts focused on reducing methamphetamine-related HIV risk should target a range of at-risk populations.

### DSM-5 stimulant use disorder severity, stimulant craving, and other clinical characteristics based on stimulant type (cocaine, methamphetamine, nonmedical prescription stimulants, or polystimulants) [^464acb8c]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study examined DSM-5 stimulant use disorder (StimUD) symptom severity, stimulant craving, and clinical characteristics associated with different stimulant types.

Methods

Nationally representative cross-sectional data from the 2021–2022 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 117,103) was analyzed to determine the past-year prevalence and adjusted odds of DSM-5 StimUD symptom severity, stimulant craving, psychological distress, suicidality, and major depressive episodes among individuals who used crack cocaine, methamphetamine, non-crack cocaine, nonmedical prescription stimulants (NPSU), or polystimulants (≥ 2 stimulants).

Results

Past-year DSM-5 StimUD was most prevalent and severe among individuals who used crack cocaine, methamphetamine-only, or polystimulants, versus non-crack cocaine-only and NPSU-only. Stimulant craving was the most prevalent DSM-5 StimUD symptom, highest among those reporting polystimulant use (56.6%), followed by methamphetamine-only (51.2%), crack cocaine (48.0%), non-crack cocaine-only (18.6%), and NPSU-only (16.6%). Stimulant craving showed a dose-response association with more frequent use. Polystimulant use was associated with the highest rates of psychological distress, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and major depressive episodes. In controlled analyses, adjusted odds of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, pharmacologic indicators, and craving were greater among those using crack cocaine, methamphetamine-only, and polystimulants, relative to NPSU-only. Individuals reporting non-crack cocaine use-only had lower odds of psychological distress [AOR = 0.63 (95% CI = 0.44–0.92)] and major depressive episodes [AOR = 0.61 (95% CI = 0.40–0.91)] compared with NPSU-only.

Conclusions

Individuals using different stimulant types differ in DSM-5 StimUD symptoms, craving, and other clinical characteristics, especially those engaged in crack cocaine, methamphetamine, and polystimulant use. Health care professionals should consider these differences when treating individuals who use stimulants.

Pharmacological management of psychosis — risk, medication options, and evaluation focus: ATS use is associated with greater risk for psychosis compared to cocaine use. Olanzapine or quetiapine may be preferred for methamphetamine-induced psychosis, though the evidence is considered low quality due to high risk of bias. When managing psychosis before confirming etiology, clinicians should evaluate for causes other than stimulant intoxication and focus treatment on underlying causes while monitoring for medication side effects with usual care.

### Methamphetamine use, methamphetamine use disorder, and associated overdose deaths among US adults [^f618f4d2]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Mortality associated with methamphetamine use has increased markedly in the US. Understanding patterns of methamphetamine use may help inform related prevention and treatment.

Objective

To assess the national trends in and correlates of past-year methamphetamine use, methamphetamine use disorder (MUD), injection, frequent use, and associated overdose mortality from 2015 to 2019.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study analyzed methamphetamine use, MUD, injection, and frequent use data from participants in the 2015 to 2019 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Mortality data were obtained from the 2015 to 2019 National Vital Statistics System Multiple Cause of Death files.

Exposures

Methamphetamine use.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Methamphetamine use, MUD, injection, frequent use, and overdose deaths.

Results

Of 195 711 NSDUH respondents aged 18 to 64 years, 104 408 were women (weighted percentage, 50.9%), 35 686 were Hispanic individuals (weighted percentage, 18.0%), 25 389 were non-Hispanic Black (hereafter, Black) individuals (weighted percentage, 12.6%), and 114 248 were non-Hispanic White (hereafter, White) individuals (weighted percentage, 60.6%). From 2015 to 2019, overdose deaths involving psychostimulants other than cocaine (largely methamphetamine) increased 180% (from 5526 to 15 489; P for trend < .001); methamphetamine use increased 43% (from 1.4 million [95% CI, 1.2–1.6 million] to 2.0 million [95% CI, 1.7–2.3 million]; P for trend = .002); frequent methamphetamine use increased 66% (from 615 000 [95% CI, 512 000–717 000] to 1 021 000 [95% CI, 860 000–1 183 000]; P for trend = .002); methamphetamine and cocaine use increased 60% (from 402 000 [95% CI, 306 000–499 000] to 645 000 [95% CI, 477 000–813 000]; P for trend = .001); and MUD without injection increased 105% (from 397 000 [95% CI, 299 000–496 000] to 815 000 [95% CI, 598 000–1 033 000]; P for trend = .006). The prevalence of MUD or injection surpassed the prevalence of methamphetamine use without MUD or injection in each year from 2017 to 2019 (60% to 67% vs 37% to 40%; P for trend ≤ .001). Adults with MUD or using injection were more likely to use methamphetamine frequently (52.68%-53.84% vs 32.59%; adjusted risk ratio, 1.62–1.65; 95% CI, 1.35–1.94). From 2015 to 2019, the adjusted prevalence of MUD without injection more than tripled among heterosexual women (from 0.24% to 0.74%; P < .001) and lesbian or bisexual women (from 0.21% to 0.71%; P < .001) and more than doubled among heterosexual men (from 0.29% to 0.79%; P < .001) and homosexual or bisexual men (from 0.29% to 0.80%; P = 0.007). It increased over 10-fold among Black individuals (from 0.06% to 0.64%; P < .001), nearly tripled among White individuals (from 0.28% to 0.78%; P < .001), and more than doubled among Hispanic individuals (from 0.39% to 0.82%; P < .001). Risk factors for methamphetamine use, MUD, injection, and frequent use included lower educational attainment, lower annual household income, lack of insurance, housing instability, criminal justice involvement, comorbidities (eg, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or C virus, depression), suicidal ideation, and polysubstance use.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study found consistent upward trends in overdose mortality, greater risk patterns of methamphetamine use, and populations at higher risk for MUD diversifying rapidly, particularly those with socioeconomic risk factors and comorbidities. Evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions are needed to address surges in methamphetamine use and MUD.

### Stimulant overdose… [^b4e71378]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Stimulants include drugs such as methamphetamine, other amphetamines, and cocaine.
- Stimulant-involved overdose deaths have risen in recent years.
- View our Stimulant Guide below to learn more about risks, how to identify a stimulant overdose, and how to access resources for further support or education. Psychostimulants Quick Facts: Psychostimulants -Include illegal drugs such as methamphetamine, cocaine, or ecstasy -Also include prescription stimulantsfor conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or depression -Most of these drugs can be misused and are considered addictive. Psychostimulants with abuse potential are a subset of stimulants that have a higher likelihood of being misused due to their effects on the central nervous system. Psychostimulants with abuse potential include both illegal drugs, such as cocaine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy, as well as prescription stimulants.

Cocaine Quick Facts: Cocaine -Powerful psycho stimulant for the nervous system Illegal drug Highly addictive drug that can be snorted, smoked, or dissolved and injected into a vein In 2023, 5 million Americans aged 12 or older reported using cocaine in the past year. Cocaine-involved overdose death rates in the United States decreased from 2006 to 2010 but have since increased. Non-Hispanic Black people experienced the highest death rate for overdoses involving cocaine in 2019. Methamphetamine Quick Facts: Methamphetamine -Highly addictive, largely illegal central nervous system psychostimulant -Man-made drug that can be smoked, snorted, injected, or orally ingested. Methamphetamine is a highly addictive central nervous system stimulant. It is also categorized as a psychostimulant. Methamphetamine is commonly referred to as meth, ice, speed, and crystal, among many other terms.

In addition to risking becoming addicted to methamphetamine, people who use methamphetamine long-term may experience a range of negative health outcomes, including damage to the heart and brain, anxiety, confusion, insomnia, mood disturbances, and violent behavior.

### Trends in nonfatal fentanyl exposures involving stimulants in the United States, 2015–2023 [^b7af522f]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fentanyl-related deaths involving stimulants have increased in the US, but little is known about nonfatal overdoses involving use. We examined national trends in nonfatal fentanyl-related exposures involving co-use of cocaine or methamphetamine.

Methods

In this cross-sectional analysis, data from US poison centers were used to estimate annual trends in reported exposures involving fentanyl and stimulant use from 2015 to 2023. Cases included patients aged ≥ 13 with exposures involving intentional misuse or "abuse" of fentanyl where nonfatal adverse effects occurred (n = 13,173). Co-exposure trends were examined, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate how region and medical outcome severity were associated with (1) fentanyl-cocaine use (vs. fentanyl, no cocaine use) and (2) fentanyl-methamphetamine use (vs. fentanyl, no methamphetamine use).

Results

Between 2015 and 2023, among fentanyl-related exposures, cocaine use increased from 1.3% to 10.0% (669.2% increase, p < .001) and methamphetamine use increased from 1.5% to 10.8% (620.0% increase, p < .001). Exposures in the Northeast were associated with higher odds of cocaine co-use, while exposures in the Midwest, South, and West were associated with higher odds of methamphetamine co-use. Compared to those with less severe effects, those with a major (life-threatening) effect had higher odds of cocaine co-use, but lower odds of methamphetamine co-use.

Conclusions

Similar to drug-related mortality trends, nonfatal fentanyl poisonings involving co-use of cocaine or methamphetamine increased in recent years and became increasingly widespread. Differences in experience of life-threatening adverse effects linked to different stimulants suggests varying risk according to which stimulant is involved.

### Illicit stimulants and ventricular arrhythmias: a longitudinal cohort study [^b599ce27]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. The use of administrative databases and diagnostic codes is prone to coding errors and incomplete documentation. However, our additional validation analyses of codes for cocaine and methamphetamine exhibited reasonable sensitivities and specificities. Furthermore, previous research has shown good accuracy of codes for methamphetamine and cocaine use as well as for VT, VF, and CA. This also points to a potential advantage of the current study as, due to common stigma, studies relying on self-reported use of these substances may be inaccurate. In addition, similar study design and statistical methods utilizing earlier years of similar datasets have resulted in conclusions reproduced in various other research settings. Because we only included individuals who presented to a healthcare setting, we mostly captured people with substance use that was severe enough to catch the attention of a healthcare provider. Hence, our findings might not be fully applicable to those with lower or rare consumption of cocaine and methamphetamine. However, this would not detract from the differential risks among these millions of patients with and without evidence of illicit stimulant use nor the differential magnitudes of risks relative to established cardiovascular co-morbidities within this same population. We recognize systemic bias may be operative in the current data base such that differential misclassification might favour statistically significant results among those coded as using stimulants (such as if those patients generally engaged in overall more healthcare utilization or if coding for stimulants was a marker of coding for all other diagnoses in general), but the negative control analyses suggested such differences were unlikely to explain our observations. In addition, sensitivity analyses revealed similar results when outcomes were constrained only to those with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest presenting to the emergency department or when examining mortality outside a healthcare facility, providing evidence the differences observed were not simply among those already admitted for some other disease. Finally, as with all observational studies, we cannot exclude residual or unmeasured confounding, limiting confident conclusions regarding causal inference. Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this study is the first large longitudinal cohort study examining methamphetamine and cocaine use as predictors of incident VA and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, the study covered most of the California's adult population, which is one of the most diverse in the United States, allowing a robust analysis of sociodemographic interactions. Substance use and all other covariates were time-updated at each healthcare encounter, and death included as a competing risk for VA, providing for temporal assessments accounting for a competing risk of death (where use of the Comprehensive Death File assured that we included all deaths in California over the study period).

### Addressing methamphetamine use in primary care: provider perspectives [^78dd7424]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Providers also highlighted patients with methamphetamine use are at heightened risk for stigmatization because their behavioral and psychiatric manifestations seem more challenging to treat. Such symptoms are often a consequence of acute or chronic methamphetamine use. Practical methods are needed to reduce stigma, including supporting patients and their families across the continuum of care for the problems they wish to address.

These findings should be evaluated in light of some limitations. Providers with prior experience and investment in treating opioid use disorder were more likely to volunteer for these group interviews, limiting the results' generalizability to primary care providers with significant addiction treatment experience. Those who agreed to participate seemed to encounter larger populations with methamphetamine use, have a specific interest in caring for patients with methamphetamine use and substance use, and have taken additional steps to become x-waivered to begin prescribing buprenorphine. These providers may be more informed by their experience in substance use treatment, which may differ from more general primary care providers who have not directly taken on the care of addiction in their practice. The providers in the sample still offered valuable insights into the identification and treatment of methamphetamine use in primary care settings. Primary care providers are likely facing similar barriers in providing quality care for patients with methamphetamine use. Still, future research should explore the specific issues providers face with more limited addiction treatment experience. In addition to methamphetamine use, there were mentions of cocaine, but this was not a predominant theme. The findings may not be generalizable beyond primary care settings in California because most providers encountered methamphetamine. Future research should explore regional differences in addressing cocaine and methamphetamine use in primary care settings. The sessions were also conducted over videoconference in a group format. This methodology may have reduced comfort levels and the depth of the discourse.

### Cocaine treatment demands in 10 Western European countries: observed trends between 2011 and 2018 [^2f1c042c]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

It would be of value to focus upon the combination of substances use and polydrug use, as cocaine as an adjunctive substance is frequently recorded in combination with primary use of opioids [1]. In the United Kingdom there has been a recent increase in clients starting treatment for opiate and crack problem use [27]. In Belgium, between 2015 and 2018, clients entering treatment for opiates, cannabis and alcohol as primary substance report an increased consumption of cocaine as adjunctive substance [28].

The current study is subject to a range of limitations. First, TDI data provided information on clients entering drug treatment (for the first time in their life or after previous treatment) during the reporting year, meaning that data on clients who are in continuous treatment (i.e. who remain in treatment from one year to the next) were not provided. Secondly, treatment data collected by the national TDI systems did not cover all treatment demand and hence need to be interpreted with caution. Indeed, coverage of treatment services was not 100% and the proportion differed by country. Inclusion of treatment services not currently represented may provide different results. However, data coverage of specialized outpatient and inpatient treatment facilities is good in most countries, with lower representation concentrated among other services (e.g. general practitioners, low‐threshold agencies, prisons) [15]. Thirdly, not all years were available for all countries which might also have influenced some figures. Fourthly, cocaine was only considered as the primary substance of abuse or the primary/adjunctive substance used. As there are some differences in the way national TDI protocols tackle adjunctive substances (in the total number of adjunctive substances reported), this might have impacted the comparability of these data by including more or less cocaine cases. Fifthly, the results are not representative for the whole EU, as only 10 countries volunteered and agreed to participate (including England), therefore missing the other 18 European countries. Nevertheless, those 10 countries covered a very large proportion of the European cocaine data (95%). Future studies should monitor what is happening in other countries, as there are signs that cocaine is expanding into new markets in eastern Europe [5]. Future studies might also assess other substances and specifically other stimulants (amphetamines, methamphetamines) in the analysis in order to broaden the scope of this research field by including a class of substances with similar effects.

### Illicit stimulants and ventricular arrhythmias: a longitudinal cohort study [^c5c2dca1]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

It is worth emphasizing that these stimulants, especially methamphetamine use, were associated with comparable or even greater effect sizes in predicting VA in the current study than other common cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and other atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Hence, avoidance of methamphetamines and cocaine should be an important target in strategies aimed at preventing VA and premature mortality. Our findings also support the recommendation to systematically investigate illicit drug use following CA as emphasized by the recent Lancet Commission on SCD. Furthermore, association of methamphetamine use with increased risk of VA and all-cause mortality raises questions about the safety of amphetamine used for disorders such as ADHD, narcolepsy, or obesity. Studies are needed to investigate the potential long-term risks associated with amphetamine in treated patients.

The risk of VA associated with cocaine use was significantly higher in Blacks and lower in Whites. This could be explained by the difference in the type of cocaine predominantly consumed in these groups. It has been shown that being Black may be associated with crack cocaine use, whereas being White has been associated with powder cocaine use. Powder cocaine is usually abused by snorting or by injecting into a vein, whereas crack cocaine is smoked. Smoking crack cocaine is more likely to be psychologically addictive and lead to chronic, heavy cocaine use than the predominant method for administering powder cocaine (snorting). Hence, more chronic and heavier cocaine use in Blacks could at least partly explain the apparent greater effect of cocaine on incident VA compared with other racial or ethnic groups. Unlike cocaine, methamphetamine use had a consistently higher risk of VA across all demographic groups. However, Blacks exhibited a substantially lower risk associated with methamphetamine, whereas Asians experienced a high risk. The reasons for these discrepancies remain unclear — a better understanding of the interactions between various sociocultural and behavioural factors and illicit drug use might shed some light on these racial and ethnic differences and reveal information pertinent to reducing risks among all people that use or are at risk of using these substances.

### Common and gender-specific associations with cocaine use on gray matter volume: data from the ENIgMA addiction working group [^22554d45]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

Contrary to previous research (Rando et al; Regner et al.), we did not observe a GMV interaction in frontal cortical structures (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex) or limbic‐related structures other than the insula and hippocampus, such as the amygdala. Notably, previous studies that reported GMV gender differences in these other brain regions examined mostly participants with stimulant‐dependence rather than samples restricted to cocaine users (Regner et al.). Future research is needed to directly compare women with stimulant use disorders (to amphetamines, and/or methamphetamines, and/or 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine, with or without cocaine) to CD women exclusively. In addition, our analyses showed that the interaction effects were not driven by men, which contrasts with previous reports that showed lower GMV in the precentral and midcingulate gyrus in men with cocaine dependence compared to control men (Rando et al.). In general, our more circumscribed results may reflect our focus on cocaine dependence and the inclusion of a large sample size.

### Trends in self-reported and biochemically verified cocaine and methamphetamine use among pregnant individuals in Northern California, 2011–2019 [^869ecdbf]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This study found that, consistent with population-level increases in the prevalence of cocaine and methamphetamine use in the general US population, rates of cocaine use increased modestly among pregnant individuals in KPNC. Although the adjusted prevalence was higher across years by self-report vs toxicology tests, likely reflecting screening for any use since pregnancy vs current use, rates increased faster via toxicology tests. In contrast, rates of prenatal methamphetamine use decreased slightly over time via self-report and did not change via toxicology tests. Although prenatal methamphetamine use was nearly twice as prevalent as prenatal cocaine use in 2011, prevalence rates were similar by 2019. Across years, the adjusted prevalence of cocaine and methamphetamine use was roughly twice as high when including data from self-report and toxicology tests vs either measure on its own, indicating that the combination of both methods may lead to the best identification.

This study was limited to insured patients in Northern California screened for stimulant use during pregnancy. Results do not capture the amount or frequency of use, continued prenatal use, or stimulant use disorders. We are not able to differentiate prenatal use that occurred before vs after pregnancy recognition. Stimulants are detectable via urine 2 to 4 days after a single use but can be detectable longer with long-term use, and some individuals may be misclassified as nonusers. Results may not be generalizable to other states or individuals without health care.

Rates of cocaine use during early pregnancy increased modestly from 2011 to 2019 and likely reflect changes in continuation of prepregnancy use into pregnancy. Differing trends in prenatal cocaine and methamphetamine use highlight the importance of early screening for different types of prenatal illicit stimulant use, assessment of substance use disorder, and linkage to nonpunitive treatment, as needed. Research indicates that stopping stimulant use during pregnancy improves birth outcomes, and continued research is needed to understand factors associated with different types of prenatal stimulant use over time.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^16b7edf5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

United States overdose epidemiology involving stimulants — between 2012 and 2021, the rate of overdose deaths involving cocaine more than tripled from 1.4 per 100 000 in 2012 to 7.3 in 2021, increasing on average by 21% per year. Over the same period, deaths involving methamphetamine, amphetamine, and prescription stimulants increased more than 12-fold from 0.8 per 100 000 in 2012 to 10.0 in 2021. The precipitous increase in novel and designer drugs in the market complicates the clinical picture, and while the rate of cocaine use has been relatively flat, rates of cocaine use disorder, methamphetamine use, and methamphetamine use disorder are rising. In 2021, 50% of all overdose deaths in the US involved stimulants, 23% involved cocaine, and 30% involved psychostimulants (primarily methamphetamine). There has been a large increase in the risk from use due to the increasing potency of illicit stimulants and the increasing use of stimulants in combination with opioids, which can increase toxicity, a growing number of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) are using stimulants intentionally, and others may be unaware that the stimulants they use are contaminated with fentanyl or other opioids.

### The prevalence and negative impacts of substance use disorders among people with HIV in the United States: a real-time Delphi survey of key stakeholders [^49069cfc]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevalence

Table 2 Panel A includes the mean and standard error regarding perceived SUD prevalence among PWH, reported by (i) the four U.S. regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West), (ii) the three stakeholder perspectives (clients with HIV, ASO staff, and HPC members), and (iii) overall. Cannabis and alcohol use disorders were perceived as the most prevalent SUDs overall (42.3% and 41.9%, respectively), followed by opioid use disorder (34.6%), methamphetamine use disorder (32.2%), and cocaine use disorder (28.1%), most of which were significantly different from one another in terms of magnitude. Table 2 Panel B summarizes the regional and stakeholder perspective differences identified in perceived SUD prevalence and includes the p value and the effect size (Cohen's d; 0.2 = small effect, 0.5 = medium effect, 0.8 = large effect). The largest difference (d = 0.73) was between the perceived prevalence of methamphetamine use disorders among PWH in the West (40.8%) and the Northeast (24.2%). Regarding the perceived prevalence of alcohol use disorders, the only significant difference found was the small difference (d = 0.32) between the South (44.1%) and the West (37.1%). In terms of the prevalence of cannabis use disorders, there were medium-sized differences between the West (35.7%) and both the Northeast (47.0%; d = 0.42) and the South (44.4%; d = 0.33). For cocaine use disorders, the average perceived prevalence for the West (19.5%), was significantly lower (medium-sized effects) compared to each of the other three regions. Additionally, ASO staff reported significantly lower cocaine use disorder prevalence (25.1%) than both HPC members (31.6%; d = 0.30) and clients with HIV (36%; d = 0.49). For methamphetamine use disorders, the West's 40.8% average rate was also significantly higher than the average in the South (28.6%; d = 0.55), and ASO staff again reported a significantly lower prevalence of 29.5% compared to clients with HIV (38.9%; d = 0.40). Last, the Northeast's prevalence for opioid use disorders (41.3%) had small-to-medium effect size differences with both the South (32.0%; d = 0.40) and the West (35.0%; d = 0.35).

### Corticolimbic dysregulation and chronic methamphetamine abuse [^43642d57]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

This review aims to present and interpret evidence that methamphetamine dependence is associated with disorder of brain function that is required for top-down control of behavior.

Approach

Presented here are findings from brain imaging studies of human research participants with histories of chronic methamphetamine abuse in the context of functional consequences and implications for treatment of their dependence on methamphetamine.

Findings

Brain imaging studies have revealed differences in the brains of research participants who have used methamphetamine chronically and then abstained from taking the drug, compared with healthy control subjects. These abnormalities are prominent in cortical and limbic systems, and include deficits in markers of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, differences in glucose metabolism and deficits in gray matter. These abnormalities accompany cognitive deficits, including evidence of impaired inhibitory control.

Conclusion

Cortical deficits in abstinent methamphetamine abusers can affect a wide range of functions that can be important for success in maintaining drug abstinence. These include but are not limited to modulation of responses to environmental stimuli as well as internal triggers that can lead to craving and relapse. Potential therapies may combine behavioral approaches with medications that can improve cognitive control.

### Novel medications to treat addictive disorders [^fb14b23e]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Recent discoveries about the effects of drugs of abuse on the brain and the mechanisms of their addictions; new chemical compounds, including immunotherapies; and new actions of available medications are offering many opportunities for the discovery and development of novel medications to treat addictive disorders. Furthermore, advancements in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of drug addiction and the pharmacogenetics of the safety and/or efficacy of the medications are providing opportunities for more individualized pharmacotherapy approaches. Although multiple medications have been investigated for treating addictions, only a handful have shown acceptable safety and efficacy and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This article reviews the current medications that are medically safe and have shown promising results for treating opioid, cocaine, methamphetamine, and cannabis addictions.

### Patient characteristics and treatment utilization in fatal stimulant-involved overdoses in the United States veterans health administration [^75a6cf9a]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

This study aimed to (1) describe trends in stimulant-alone and stimulant and other substance use overdose deaths from 2012 to 2018 and (2) measure patient and service use characteristics across stimulant-related overdose death profiles.

Design

Retrospective cohort study of patients who died from stimulant-involved overdose between annual years 2012 and 2018.

Setting

United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA). A total of 3631 patients died from stimulant-involved overdose, as identified through the National Death Index.

Measurements

Stimulant-involved overdose deaths were categorized by stimulant type (cocaine or methamphetamine/other) and other substance co-involvement. Cause of death data were linked to patient characteristics, including demographic and treatment use preceding overdose from VHA administrative data. We examined trends over time and compared treatment use factors between the following mutually exclusive overdose profiles: cocaine alone, methamphetamine alone, cocaine+opioid, methamphetamine+opioid, any stimulant+other substance and cocaine+methamphetamine.

Findings

The rate of overdose death was 3.06 times higher in 2018 than 2012, with increases across all toxicology profiles. Compared with cocaine-involved overdoses, methamphetamine-involved overdoses were less likely in people who were older [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.06–0.87 aged 65+ versus 18–29] and more likely among those who lived in rural areas (aOR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.43–5.23). People who died from stimulant+opioid overdoses had lower odds of a stimulant use disorder diagnosis compared with stimulant alone deaths (cocaine: aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.41–0.75, methamphetamine: aOR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.29–0.68).

Conclusions

The rate of deaths among US Veterans from stimulant-related overdose was three times higher in 2018 than 2012. Key differences in characteristics of patients across overdose toxicology profiles, such as geographic location and health-care use, point to distinct treatment needs based on stimulant use type.

DERS scores by SUD type

Specific SUDs that were studied included alcohol use disorder, methamphetamine use disorder, opioid use disorder and cocaine use disorder. In some studies, the type of SUD was not specified or there was a mix of different SUD diagnoses (designated as the unspecified SUD group). In our analysis, opioid use disorder and cocaine use disorder were combined, as there was only one study for each. Among substance types, SUD groups had a higher total DERS score than control groups. The unspecified SUD group and AUD group had similar sample sizes that were more than twice the size of the methamphetamine and opioid/cocaine use disorder groups. The unspecified SUD group had a significant effect size of 18.93 (95% CI = 13.35–24.52, P < 0.001). The AUD group had the highest significant effect size of 28.24 (95% CI = 11.46–45.02, P = 0.001). The methamphetamine use disorder group had a significant effect size of 20.17 (95% CI = 15.99–24.35, P < 0.001) and the cocaine/opioid use disorder group had a significant effect size of 21.44 (95% CI = 15.24–27.63, P < 0.001). Heterogeneity for each drug type is as follows: unspecified SUD = 90.3%, AUD = 97.1%, methamphetamine use disorder = 0.0%, cocaine/opioid use disorder = 44.9%. A forest plot of the total DERS scores by drug type is shown in Figure 5.

### PET studies of D-methamphetamine pharmacokinetics in primates: comparison with L-methamphetamine and-cocaine [^853f9d9c]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The methamphetamine molecule has a chiral center and exists as 2 enantiomers, d-methamphetamine (the more active enantiomer) and l-methamphetamine (the less active enantiomer). d-Methamphetamine is associated with more intense stimulant effects and higher abuse liability. The objective of this study was to measure the pharmacokinetics of d-methamphetamine for comparison with both l-methamphetamine and (-)-cocaine in the baboon brain and peripheral organs and to assess the saturability and pharmacologic specificity of binding.

Methods

d- and l-methamphetamine and (-)-cocaine were labeled with (11)C via alkylation of the norprecursors with (11)C-methyl iodide using literature methods. Six different baboons were studied in 11 PET sessions at which 2 radiotracer injections were administered 2–3 h apart to determine the distribution and kinetics of (11)C-d-methamphetamine in brain and peripheral organs. Saturability and pharmacologic specificity were assessed using pretreatment with d-methamphetamine, methylphenidate, and tetrabenazine. (11)C-d-Methamphetamine pharmacokinetics were compared with (11)C-l-methamphetamine and (11)C-(-)-cocaine in both brain and peripheral organs in the same animal.

Results

(11)C-d- and l-methamphetamine both showed high uptake and widespread distribution in the brain. Pharmacokinetics did not differ between enantiomers, and the cerebellum peaked earlier and cleared more quickly than the striatum for both. (11)C-d-Methamphetamine distribution volume ratio was not substantially affected by pretreatment with methamphetamine, methylphenidate, or tetrabenazine. Both enantiomers showed rapid, high uptake and clearance in the heart and lungs and slower uptake and clearance in the liver and kidneys. A comparison of (11)C-d-methamphetamine and (11)C-(-)-cocaine showed that (11)C-d-methamphetamine peaked later in the brain than did (11)C-(-)-cocaine and cleared more slowly. The 2 drugs showed similar behavior in all peripheral organs examined except the kidneys and pancreas, which showed higher uptake for (11)C-d-methamphetamine.

Conclusion

Brain pharmacokinetics did not differ between d-and l-methamphetamine and thus cannot account for the more intense stimulant effects of d-methamphetamine. Lack of pharmacologic blockade by methamphetamine indicates that the PET image represents nonspecific binding, though the fact that methamphetamine is both a transporter substrate and an inhibitor may also play a role. A comparison of (11)C-d-methamphetamine and (11)C-(-)-cocaine in the same animal showed that the slower clearance of methamphetamine is likely to contribute to its previously reported longer-lasting stimulant effects relative to those of (-)-cocaine. High kidney uptake of d-methamphetamine or its labeled metabolites may account for the reported renal toxicity of d-methamphetamine in humans.

### Illicit stimulants and ventricular arrhythmias: a longitudinal cohort study [^9cad37fb]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among this large population-based cohort of patients seeking care in California, methamphetamine and cocaine uses were each associated with increased incidence of VA and all-cause mortality, with magnitudes of risk that were comparable to those of several classic cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, the risk of VA varied across sociodemographic groups, with relative risks consistently higher in younger individuals and females for both methamphetamine and cocaine use, higher in Blacks and lower in Whites and Hispanics for cocaine use, and higher in Asians and lower in Blacks for methamphetamine use (Structured Graphical Abstract).

In vivo and in vitro studies in animal models and human case studies have shown that methamphetamine and cocaine induce electrical and structural changes that can initiate cardiac arrhythmias. Cocaine can produce electrical remodelling by altering gating properties of ion channels. Cocaine inhibits several potassium channels, including voltage-dependent potassium channels that prolong the QT interval. In addition, cocaine blocks fast inward sodium channels similar to class IC antiarrhythmic drugsand also alters the function of calcium-related channels and calcium handling proteins, resulting in a dose-dependent increase in action potential duration, early afterdepolarizations, and field potential duration. These changes in the electrical substrate may lead to VA. Similarly, methamphetamine has been shown to alter the transcription and functions of cardiac ions channels, including the inhibition of transient outward potassium current, inward rectifying potassium current, and L-type calcium current. Electrocardiograms of methamphetamine users have shown higher rates of QTc prolongation, suggesting underlying changes in the electrical substrate that may lead to VA. Both cocaine and methamphetamine can cause enhanced catecholaminergic effects, myocardial oxidative stress, inflammation, necrosis, hypertrophy, collagen deposition, and fibrotic remodelling, all resulting in reduced systolic function and scar tissue that represent a structural substrate propitious to arrhythmias. These changes have been observed mostly in the setting of myocardial ischaemiabut also in the absence of ischaemia. Besides the electrical and structural remodelling that could be induced by chronic cocaine or methamphetamine, rendering ventricular substrate prone to arrhythmogenesis, acute proarrhythmic consequences related to ion channel or catecholaminergic effects may have been operative in some cases. It is also possible that overdoses of these stimulants could acutely cause CA and sudden death as a final common pathway to multiple lethal mechanisms.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to management of acute coronary syndrome, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to manage patients with NSTEMI and a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use in the same manner as patients without cocaine- or methamphetamine-related NSTEMI, except for patients with signs of acute intoxication (such as euphoria, tachycardia, and/or hypertension) and β-blocker use unless receiving coronary vasodilator therapy.

### Methamphetamine use and schizophrenia: a population-based cohort study in California [^3017ef54]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinical investigators in Japan have long suggested that exposure to methamphetamine might cause a persistent schizophrenia-like psychosis. This possibility is discounted in the Western literature. To investigate the relationship between drug use and later schizophrenia, the authors conducted a large-scale cohort study of drug users initially free of persistent psychosis.

Method

A population-based cohort study was conducted using data from California inpatient hospital discharge records from 1990 through 2000. Patients with methamphetamine-related conditions (N = 42,412) and those with other drug use disorders (cannabis, cocaine, alcohol, and opioids) were propensity score-matched to individuals with primary appendicitis who served as a population proxy comparison group; the methamphetamine cohort was also matched to the other drug cohorts. Cox modeling was used to estimate differences between matched groups in the rates of subsequent admission with schizophrenia diagnoses.

Results

The methamphetamine cohort had a significantly higher risk of schizophrenia than the appendicitis group (hazard ratio = 9.37) and the cocaine, opioid, and alcohol groups (hazard ratios ranging from 1.46 to 2.81), but not significantly different from that of the cannabis group. The risk of schizophrenia was higher in all drug cohorts than in the appendicitis group.

Conclusions

Study limitations include difficulty in confirming schizophrenia diagnoses independent of drug intoxication and the possibility of undetected schizophrenia predating drug exposure. The study's findings suggest that individuals with methamphetamine-related disorders have a higher risk of schizophrenia than those with other drug use disorders, with the exception of cannabis use disorders. The elevated risk in methamphetamine users may be explained by shared etiological mechanisms involved in the development of schizophrenia.

### Cocaine or methamphetamine use during young adulthood following stimulant use for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder during adolescence [^2897a93f]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this multicohort study of adolescents exposed to prescription stimulants, adolescents who used stimulant therapy for ADHD did not differ from population controls in initiation of illicit stimulant (cocaine or methamphetamine) use, which suggested a potential protective effect, given evidence of elevated illicit stimulant use among those with ADHD. In contrast, monitoring adolescents for PSM is warranted because this behavior offered a strong signal for transitioning to later cocaine or methamphetamine initiation and use during young adulthood.

### Drug overdose deaths involving stimulants-United States, January 2018-June 2024 [^8630c824]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 50,000 (15%) overdose deaths during 3.5 years involved stimulants and no opioids. Nearly 40% had a CVD history, possibly representing long-term stimulant use. Persons who use stimulants but not opioids have limited tailored interventions and treatments available to prevent death and support recovery and might be missed by existing opioid-focused prevention efforts. Including stimulant-specific guidance in risk reduction strategies and improving access to and retention in treatment for stimulant use disorder might reduce overdose deaths. In addition, persons who died of overdoses involving stimulants and no opioids were older and less often had an opioid use history than those who died of overdoses co-involving stimulants and opioids; overdose prevention and response efforts might therefore require different outreach strategies to reach this population.

From 2018 to 2023, AI/AN persons experienced the largest increases in psychostimulant-involved overdose death rates, and Black persons experienced the largest increases in cocaine-involved death rates. During this time, the prevalence of methamphetamine use among AI/AN persons, cocaine use among Black persons, and opioid use and misuse in both groups remained relatively stable. §§§§ This suggests increased drug potency or differential access to health care and treatments for SUDs among these groups. Compared with eastern U.S. drug markets, IMFs proliferated later in southern markets where Black persons disproportionately live, and in western markets where AI/AN persons disproportionately live; recent increases in deaths co-involving stimulants and opioids among these groups might reflect these market changes. Prevention messaging addressing specific stimulants commonly involved in different populations and improved engagement and retention in care might decrease deaths.

Limitations

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, given cardiovascular outcomes, some stimulant-involved overdose deaths might be certified such that they do not receive overdose-specific ICD-10 codes (e.g. cause of death listed as acute cerebrovascular event in setting of methamphetamine toxicity) and thus be missed. Second, postmortem toxicology testing varies within and across jurisdictions, and testing for emerging stimulants is not routine. Together, these factors likely contribute to an underestimation of stimulant-involved overdose deaths. Third, circumstance information depends on availability in investigative reports; percentages are likely underestimated. Fourth, race and ethnicity might be misclassified, potentially affecting race- and ethnicity-specific death rates. Finally, although analyses included nearly all states, some large states were excluded from SUDORS circumstance analyses, reducing generalizability.

### Antipsychotics for cocaine or psychostimulant dependence: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^d3a33c83]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Since cocaine and psychostimulant dependence are related to increased dopamine release, antipsychotics have been tried to reduce their reinforcing properties. A meta-analysis was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotics in cocaine- or stimulant-dependent patients.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, and PsycINFO from database inception until June 24, 2013, using the following keywords: (randomized OR random OR randomly) AND (placebo) AND (methylphenidate OR cocaine OR methamphetamine OR amphetamine OR 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) AND (dependence OR abuse) AND (antipsychotic OR neuroleptic OR 34 specific antipsychotic names).

Study Selection

Included were randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotics lasting at least 2 weeks in patients with primary cocaine or psychostimulant dependence. Of 363 hits, we removed 316 duplicates, 20 references based on abstract/title, and 13 ineligible full-text articles, retaining 14 trials for this meta-analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted the data. Coprimary outcomes included degree of substance use and lack of abstinence. Risk ratio (RR), 95% CI, and standardized mean difference were calculated.

Results

Ten studies in patients with primary cocaine dependence (risperidone = 5, olanzapine = 3, reserpine = 2; n = 562) and 4 in those with amphetamine/methamphetamine dependence (aripiprazole = 4; n = 179) were meta-analyzed (14 studies, total n = 741). When study results were pooled together, antipsychotics did not differ from placebo in regard to cocaine use days and lack of cocaine or amphetamine/methamphetamine abstinence, severity of addiction, cocaine or amphetamine/methamphetamine craving, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scores, depression, anxiety, compliance, all-cause discontinuation, and several side effects. However, antipsychotics caused more intolerability-related discontinuation than placebo (P = 0.0009). Individually, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in regard to CGI-S (P = 0.001), while olanzapine was inferior to placebo in regard to cocaine craving (P = 0.03) and risperidone was inferior to placebo in regard to depression (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Antipsychotics had no advantages over placebo in regard to cocaine use and cocaine or psychostimulant abstinence or craving, while causing more intolerability-related discontinuations.

Chronic stimulant use or exposure

Human studies

Neurochemistry (Fig. 1; also see for table of molecular imaging findings in human subjects with SUDs)

Dopamine

People with StUD exhibit multiple dopaminergic deficits including deficits in dopamine transporter (DAT) availability, vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) levels, and stimulant-induced striatal dopamine release. These deficits are coupled with robust MCL dopamine responses to drug-related cues.

Although relatively few studies have assessed VMAT2 and DAT, a larger body of research indicates that striatal D2/3R availability is reduced in most individuals with stimulant use disorders (StUD) involving cocaine or methamphetamine. This reduction could be due to fewer receptors, decreased receptor affinity, receptor internalization, or higher levels of endogenous dopamine competing with the radiotracer. To investigate whether elevated endogenous dopamine levels were responsible, researchers conducted a study using alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine at a dose expected to significantly lower dopamine levels (and thereby increase D2/3R availability). The resulting increase in D2/3R availability was smaller in cocaine-dependent individuals compared to controls, suggesting that the reduced D2/3R availability in cocaine dependence is not due to higher extracellular dopamine.

Given the distinct functional roles of dopamine D2-type receptor subtypes, it is important to acknowledge that PET imaging lacks the resolution to differentiate receptors based on their cellular localization. Moreover, commonly used radiotracers do not reliably distinguish between D2 and D3 receptor subtypes (D2Rs, D3Rs). Studies using more selective radioligands have shown that chronic stimulant exposure upregulates D3 receptors (D3Rs). Postmortem analyses revealed elevated D3R levels in the ventral striatum and substantia nigra of individuals who died from cocaine overdose compared to controls. Subsequent PET studies found increased D3R availability in the substantia nigra of stimulant-dependent individuals, which was associated with greater impulsivity and risky decision-making. These findings suggest that D3-selective drugs may be beneficial for addressing inhibitory control deficits in StUD.

Cocaine- and methamphetamine-dependent participants, however, exhibit no abnormalities in striatal D1Rs. It has been theorized that striatal D1Rs in the "direct pathway" are involved in preparing a set of possible appropriate responses whereas striatal D2Rs in the "indirect pathway" shape and select the response. Thus, D2R-expressing pathways would function to inhibit or modulate behavioral responses to phasic dopamine surges.

### Illicit stimulants and ventricular arrhythmias: a longitudinal cohort study [^b33cb6bc]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

There were disparities in the effect of methamphetamine and cocaine uses on VA across sociodemographic groups. The relative risk of VA was higher in individuals aged < 65 years and females for both methamphetamine and cocaine. This risk was higher in Blacks and lower in Whites and Hispanics for cocaine use and higher in Asians and lower in Blacks for methamphetamine use (Figure 3). Whereas people with higher income tended to have a higher risk of VA associated with methamphetamine use, there was no interaction between cocaine use and the level of income.

### Cocaine or methamphetamine use during young adulthood following stimulant use for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder during adolescence [^3296bbcb]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The prescribing of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased in the US. Prescription stimulants are one of the most commonly misused controlled substances during adolescence. Despite a 10-fold increase in stimulant-related overdose deaths in the past decade, the transitions from prescription stimulants to illicit stimulants (eg, cocaine, methamphetamine) remain relatively unknown in longitudinal population-based studies.

Objective

To determine the longitudinal transitions from adolescents' prescription stimulant exposure (ie, stimulant therapy for ADHD and prescription stimulant misuse [PSM]) to later cocaine and methamphetamine use during young adulthood.

Design, Setting, and Participants

National longitudinal multicohort panels of US 12th grade public and private school students in the coterminous US were assessed annually (baseline cohort years 2005–2017 [between March and June]) and followed up across 3 waves over a 6-year period to 23 to 24 years of age (follow-up years 2011–2021 [between April and October]).

Exposure

History of self-reported stimulant therapy for ADHD at baseline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence and prevalence of past-year use of cocaine and methamphetamine during young adulthood (19–24 years of age).

Results

Among 5034 students enrolled at baseline (2589 [52.0%] female), 470 (10.2% [95% CI,9.4%-11.2%]) reported use of stimulant therapy for ADHD, 671 (14.6% [95% CI,13.5%-15.6%]) reported PSM only, and 3459 (75.2% [95% CI,73.9%-76.4%]) reported neither (and served as population controls). In controlled analyses, there were no statistically significant differences between adolescents who reported stimulant therapy for ADHD at baseline compared with population controls in the adjusted odds of transitioning to later cocaine or methamphetamine initiation or use during young adulthood (19–24 years of age). In contrast, PSM during adolescence in those not treated with stimulants for ADHD had significantly higher odds of transitioning to later cocaine or methamphetamine initiation and use during young adulthood compared with population controls (adjusted odds ratio,2.64 [95% CI,1.54–4.55]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this multicohort study, adolescents' stimulant therapy for ADHD was not associated with increased risk of later cocaine and methamphetamine use during young adulthood. Adolescents' prescription stimulant misuse offered a signal for subsequent cocaine or methamphetamine use and warrants monitoring and screening.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^01e87a37]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Adolescents and young adults — prevalence and initiation patterns — are described with 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data: among adolescents (ages 12 to 17), 1.2% reported nonmedical use of prescription stimulants, 0.2% used cocaine, and 0.1% used methamphetamine in the past year; among young adults (ages 18 to 25), 3.7% reported nonmedical use of prescription stimulants, 3.5% used cocaine, and 0.5% used methamphetamine in the past year. In the US, the peak age for initiating nonmedical prescription stimulant use is 16 to 19 years, and the median age of initiation for cocaine and methamphetamine is approximately 20 years, and adolescents and young adults often cite cognitive enhancement as a reason for prescription stimulant misuse. Stimulant use disorder (StUD) prevalence is low in adolescents, with 0.1% meeting criteria for methamphetamine use disorder, 0.0% for cocaine use disorder, and 0.9% for prescription stimulant use disorder in 2021, while among young adults, 3.5% met criteria for a prescription stimulant use disorder, 0.6% for methamphetamine use disorder, and 0.6% for cocaine use disorder. Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for substance use disorder (SUD) compared to the general population, but pharmacological treatment of ADHD, including psychostimulants, reduces the risk for development of SUD.

### The sigma-1 receptor modulates methamphetamine dysregulation of dopamine neurotransmission [^6d5f2364]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a transmembrane protein implicated in multiple physiological and pathological conditions, including movement, reward, and drug addiction. DAT facilitates the uptake of dopamine from the extracellular fluid back into the neuron and modulates the excitability of dopaminergic neurons, making it a crucial regulator of dopamine homeostasis in the brain. DAT is also the primary target for the psychostimulants cocaine and methamphetamine (METH). The reinforcing effects and abuse potential of these psychostimulants directly correlate with their ability to increase extracellular dopamine levels in brain, albeit via different mechanisms. Whereas cocaine increases extracellular dopamine by blocking DAT, METH increases extracellular dopamine levels by at least three well-described mechanisms: (1) competitive inhibition of dopamine uptake, (2) stimulation of dopamine efflux, and (3) internalization of DAT from the plasma membrane –. Furthermore, METH also increases the excitability of dopaminergic neurons in a DAT-dependent fashion. The net result of these actions is a robust increase in extracellular dopamine levels in brain. Currently, there are no effective pharmacotherapies for the treatment of METH addiction.

### Subcortical Grey matter alterations in cocaine dependent individuals with substance-induced psychosis compared to non-psychotic cocaine users [^46a4ac4e]. Schizophrenia Research (2016). Low credibility.

After prolonged psychostimulant abuse, transient psychotic symptoms referred to as "substance-induced psychosis" (SIP) can develop - closely resembling symptoms observed in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The comparability in psychotic presentation between SIP and schizophrenias suggests that similar underlying neural deficits may contribute to the expression of psychosis across these disorders. To date, neuroanatomical characterization of grey matter structural alterations in SIP has been limited to methamphetamine associated psychosis, with no studies controlling for potential neurotoxic effects of the psychostimulant that precipitates psychosis. To investigate grey matter subcortical alterations in SIP, a voxel-based analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRI) was performed between a group of 74 cocaine dependent nonpsychotic individuals and a group of 29 individuals with cocaine-associated psychosis. The cocaine-associated psychosis group had significantly smaller volumes of the thalamus and left hippocampus, controlling for age, total brain volume, current methamphetamine dependence, and current marijuana dependence. No differences were present in bilateral caudate structures. The findings of reduced thalamic and hippocampal volumes agree with previous reports in the schizophrenia literature, suggesting alterations of these structures are not specific to schizophrenia, but may be common to multiple forms of psychosis.

### Psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder [^01bc4817]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Stimulant use disorder is a continuously growing medical and social burden without approved medications available for its treatment. Psychosocial interventions could be a valid approach to help people reduce or cease stimulant consumption. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of psychosocial interventions for stimulant use disorder in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in September 2023. All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched the references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any psychosocial intervention with no intervention, treatment as usual (TAU), or a different intervention in adults with stimulant use disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included a total of 64 RCTs (8241 participants). Seventy-three percent of studies included participants with cocaine or crack cocaine use disorder; 3.1% included participants with amphetamine use disorder; 10.9% included participants with methamphetamine use disorder; and 12.5% included participants with any stimulant use disorder. In 18 studies, all participants were in methadone maintenance treatment. In our primary comparison of any psychosocial treatment to no intervention, we included studies which compared a psychosocial intervention plus TAU to TAU alone. In this comparison, 12 studies evaluated cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), 27 contingency management, three motivational interviewing, one study looked at psychodynamic therapy, and one study evaluated CBT plus contingency management. We also compared any psychosocial intervention to TAU. In this comparison, seven studies evaluated CBT, two contingency management, two motivational interviewing, and one evaluated a combination of CBT plus motivational interviewing. Seven studies compared contingency management reinforcement related to abstinence versus contingency management not related to abstinence. Finally, seven studies compared two different psychosocial approaches. We judged 65.6% of the studies to be at low risk of bias for random sequence generation and 19% at low risk for allocation concealment. Blinding of personnel and participants was not possible for the type of intervention, so we judged all the studies to be at high risk of performance bias for subjective outcomes but at low risk for objective outcomes. We judged 22% of the studies to be at low risk of detection bias for subjective outcomes. We judged most of the studies (69%) to be at low risk of attrition bias. When compared to no intervention, we found that psychosocial treatments: reduce the dropout rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.91; 30 studies, 4078 participants; high-certainty evidence); make little to no difference to point abstinence at the end of treatment (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.41; 12 studies, 1293 participants; high-certainty evidence); make little to no difference to point abstinence at the longest follow-up (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.62; 9 studies, 1187 participants; high-certainty evidence); probably increase continuous abstinence at the end of treatment (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.97; 12 studies, 1770 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may make little to no difference in continuous abstinence at the longest follow-up (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.46; 4 studies, 295 participants; low-certainty evidence); reduce the frequency of drug intake at the end of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.19; 10 studies, 1215 participants; high-certainty evidence); and increase the longest period of abstinence (SMD 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.68; 17 studies, 2118 participants; high-certainty evidence). When compared to TAU, we found that psychosocial treatments reduce the dropout rate (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; 9 studies, 735 participants; high-certainty evidence) and may make little to no difference in point abstinence at the end of treatment (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.64 to 4.31; 1 study, 128 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether they make any difference in point abstinence at the longest follow-up (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.99; 2 studies, 124 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Compared to TAU, psychosocial treatments may make little to no difference in continuous abstinence at the end of treatment (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.53; 1 study, 128 participants; low-certainty evidence); probably make little to no difference in the frequency of drug intake at the end of treatment (SMD -1.17, 95% CI -2.81 to 0.47, 4 studies, 479 participants, moderate-certainty evidence); and may make little to no difference in the longest period of abstinence (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.21; 1 study, 110 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies for this comparison assessed continuous abstinence at the longest follow-up. Only five studies reported harms related to psychosocial interventions; four of them stated that no adverse events occurred.

Authors' Conclusions

This review's findings indicate that psychosocial treatments can help people with stimulant use disorder by reducing dropout rates. This conclusion is based on high-certainty evidence from comparisons of psychosocial interventions with both no treatment and TAU. This is an important finding because many people with stimulant use disorders leave treatment prematurely. Stimulant use disorders are chronic, lifelong, relapsing mental disorders, which require substantial therapeutic efforts to achieve abstinence. For those who are not yet able to achieve complete abstinence, retention in treatment may help to reduce the risks associated with stimulant use. In addition, psychosocial interventions reduce stimulant use compared to no treatment, but they may make little to no difference to stimulant use when compared to TAU. The most studied and promising psychosocial approach is contingency management. Relatively few studies explored the other approaches, so we cannot rule out the possibility that the results were imprecise due to small sample sizes.

### Neurobiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of methamphetamine use disorder: a review [^749c2ed8]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The prevalence of and mortality associated with methamphetamine use has doubled during the past 10 years. There is evidence suggesting that methamphetamine use disorder could be the next substance use crisis in the United States and possibly worldwide.

Observation

The neurobiology of methamphetamine use disorder extends beyond the acute effect of the drug as a monoaminergic modulator and includes intracellular pathways focused on oxidative stress, neurotoxic and excitotoxic effects, and neuroinflammation. Similarly, the clinical picture extends beyond the acute psychostimulatory symptoms to include complex cardiovascular and cerebrovascular signs and symptoms that need to be identified by the clinician. Although there are no pharmacologic treatments for methamphetamine use disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral activation, and contingency management show modest effectiveness.

Conclusions and Relevance

There is a need to better understand the complex neurobiology of methamphetamine use disorder and to develop interventions aimed at novel biological targets. Parsing the disorder into different processes (eg, craving or mood-associated alterations) and targeting the neural systems and biological pathways underlying these processes may lead to greater success in identifying disease-modifying interventions. Finally, mental health professionals need to be trained in recognizing early cardiovascular and cerebrovascular warning signs to mitigate the mortality associated with methamphetamine use disorder.

### Reduced drug use as an alternative valid outcome in individuals with stimulant use disorders: findings from 13 multisite randomized clinical trials [^07f40e98]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Total abstinence has historically been the goal of treatment for substance use disorders; however, there is a growing recognition of the health benefits associated with reduced use as a harm reduction measure in stimulant use disorders treatment. We aimed to assess the validity of reduced stimulant use as an outcome measure in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for stimulant use disorder.

Design

We conducted a secondary analysis of a pooled dataset of 13 RCTs.

Setting and Participants

Participants were individuals seeking treatment for cocaine or methamphetamine use disorders (N = 2062) in a wide range of treatment facilities in the United States.

Measurements

We validated reduced stimulant use against a set of clinical indicators drawn from harmonized measurements, including severity of problems caused by drug use, comorbid depression, global severity of substance use and improvement, severity of drug-seeking behavior, craving and high-risk behaviors, all assessed at the end of the trial, as well as follow-up urine toxicology. A series of mixed effect regression models was conducted to validate reduction in frequency of use against no reduction in use and abstinence.

Findings

More participants reduced frequency of primary drug use than achieved abstinence (18.0% vs. 14.2%, respectively). Reduced use was significantly associated with decreases in craving for the primary drug [60.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 54.3%-64.7%], drug seeking behaviors (41.0%, 95% CI = 36.6%-45.7%), depression severity (39.9%, 95% CI = 30.9%-48.3%), as well as multiple measures of global improvement in psychosocial functioning and severity of drug-related problems, albeit less strongly so than abstinence. Moreover, reduced use was associated with sustained clinical benefit at follow-up, as confirmed by negative urine tests (adjusted odds ratio compared with those with no reduction in use: 0.50, 95% CI = 0.35–0.71).

Conclusion

Reduced frequency of stimulant use appears to be associated with meaningful improvement in various clinical indicators of recovery. Assessment of reduced use, in addition to abstinence, could broaden the scope of outcomes measured in randomized controlled trials of stimulant use disorders and facilitate the development of more diverse treatment approaches.

### Psychostimulant drugs for cocaine dependence [^7bb9ac81]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cocaine dependence is a severe disorder for which no medication has been approved. Like opioids for heroin dependence, replacement therapy with psychostimulants could be an effective therapy for treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of psychostimulants for cocaine abuse and dependence. Specific outcomes include sustained cocaine abstinence and retention in treatment. We also studied the influence of type of drug and comorbid disorders on psychostimulant efficacy.

Search Methods

This is an update of the review previously published in 2010. For this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO up to 15 February 2016. We handsearched references of obtained articles and consulted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised parallel group controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy of a psychostimulant drug versus placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 26 studies involving 2366 participants. The included studies assessed nine drugs: bupropion, dexamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, mazindol, methamphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts and selegiline. We did not consider any study to be at low risk of bias for all domains included in the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Attrition bias was the most frequently suspected potential source of bias of the included studies. We found very low quality evidence that psychostimulants improved sustained cocaine abstinence (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.77, P = 0.02), but they did not reduce cocaine use (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.16, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.33) among participants who continued to use it. Furthermore, we found moderate quality evidence that psychostimulants did not improve retention in treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06). The proportion of adverse event-induced dropouts and cardiovascular adverse event-induced dropouts was similar for psychostimulants and placebo (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01, respectively). When we included the type of drug as a moderating variable, the proportion of patients achieving sustained cocaine abstinence was higher with bupropion and dexamphetamine than with placebo. Psychostimulants also appeared to increase the proportion of patients achieving sustained cocaine and heroin abstinence amongst methadone-maintained, dual heroin-cocaine addicts. Retention to treatment was low, though, so our results may be compromised by attrition bias. We found no evidence of publication bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found mixed results. Psychostimulants improved cocaine abstinence compared to placebo in some analyses but did not improve treatment retention. Since treatment dropout was high, we cannot rule out the possibility that these results were influenced by attrition bias. Existing evidence does not clearly demonstrate the efficacy of any pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependence, but substitution treatment with psychostimulants appears promising and deserves further investigation.

### Methamphetamine-associated cardiomyopathy [^3ba1a918]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Methamphetamine and related compounds are now the second most commonly used illicit substance worldwide, after cannabis. Reports of methamphetamine-associated cardiomyopathy (MAC) are increasing, but MAC has not been well reviewed. This analysis of MAC will provide an overview of the pharmacology of methamphetamine, historical perspective and epidemiology, a review of case and clinical studies, and a summary of the proposed mechanisms for MAC. Clinically, many questions remain, including the appropriate therapeutic interventions for MAC, the incidence and prevalence of cardiac pathology in methamphetamine users, risk factors for developing MAC, and prognosis of these patients. In conclusion, recognition of the significance of MAC among physicians and other medical caregivers is important given the growing use of methamphetamine and related stimulants worldwide.

### A comparison of impulsivity, depressive symptoms, lifetime stress and sensation seeking in healthy controls versus participants with cocaine or methamphetamine use disorders [^ec01725c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Previous research has focused on developing theories of addiction that may explain behavior in cocaine- and methamphetamine-dependent individuals. The primary goal of this report was to compare and contrast the prevalence of self-reported measures of impulsivity, depression, lifetime stress and sensation-seeking in healthy controls versus individuals with cocaine or methamphetamine use disorders. Twenty-nine individuals with cocaine use disorders and 31 individuals with methamphetamine use disorders were matched with 31 healthy control participants on several demographic variables. All participants were administered behavioral questionnaires including the Barrett Impulsiveness Scale (assessing impulsivity), Beck Depression Inventory II (assessing depression), Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (assessing lifetime stress) and the Impulsive Sensation Seeking Scale (assessing sensation-seeking). When compared to healthy controls, individuals with cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders had significantly higher levels of impulsivity and sensation-seeking. In addition, when compared to healthy controls, individuals with cocaine use disorders had significantly higher Beck Depression Inventory II scores, while individuals with methamphetamine use disorders had significantly higher Life Stressor Checklist-Revised scores. The results revealed that there were significantly higher levels of impulsivity, depression and sensation-seeking in cocaine users and significantly higher impulsivity, lifetime stress and sensation-seeking in methamphetamine users when compared to healthy controls.

### Approaches to the development of medications for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence [^875d0581]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Methamphetamine abuse has become an increasing problem in both the United States and globally with concomitant increases in adverse medical, social and environmental sequelae. Behavioral therapies have been used with some success to treat methamphetamine abusers and dependent individuals, but are not universally efficacious. Methamphetamine has a rich pharmacology that theoretically provides many opportunities for potential pharmacotherapeutic intervention. Nevertheless, there are no approved medications with an indication for treating methamphetamine abusers or addicts at this time.

Aim

To describe briefly how methamphetamine functions and affects function in brain and report how basic researchers and clinicians are attempting to exploit and exploiting this knowledge to discover and develop effective pharmacotherapies.

Results

Scientifically based approaches to medications development by evaluating medications that limit brain exposure to methamphetamine; modulate methamphetamine effects at vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2); or affect dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and/or glutamatergic brain pathways that participate in methamphetamine's reinforcing effects are presented.

Conclusion

The evidence supports the rationale that pharmacotherapies to decrease methamphetamine use, or reduce craving during abstinence may be developed from altering the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methamphetamine or its effects on appetitive systems in the brain.

### Changes in opioid-involved overdose deaths by opioid type and presence of benzodiazepines, cocaine, and methamphetamine-25 States, July-December 2017 to January-June 2018 [^984f4d90]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of opioid deaths (62.6%) co-occurred with one or more of the following drugs: benzodiazepines, cocaine, and methamphetamine, which were each present in 32.5%, 34.0%, and 12.1% of deaths, respectively. From July–December 2017 to January–June 2018, opioid deaths without benzodiazepines, cocaine, or methamphetamine decreased 8.0%, and opioid deaths co-occurring with benzodiazepines significantly decreased 5.7% (Table 3). Conversely, opioid deaths co-occurring with methamphetamine significantly increased by 14.6%. IMF deaths that co-occurred with benzodiazepines, cocaine, and methamphetamine significantly increased from July–December 2017 to January–June 2018 by 11.3%, 14.0%, and 31.0%, respectively, as IMF deaths without benzodiazepines, cocaine, or methamphetamine increased 6.7%.

### Clinical characteristics and management of methamphetamine-associated cardiomyopathy: state-of-the-art review [^ff7eab59]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The effects of methamphetamine on the cardiovascular system may be enhanced by the concomitant use of other drugs, mainly alcohol, cocaine, and opioids. 18, 19, 20 The combination of methamphetamine and alcohol increases rate‐pressure product compared with methamphetamine alone, possibly because of increased methamphetamine absorption and distribution, coupled with decreased metabolism. 21, 22, 23, 24 Concomitant methamphetamine and cocaine is also associated with additive effects on vasoconstriction and myocardial oxygen consumption, causing greater cardiomyocyte damage in a rat model. 25 Opioids, which reduce oxygenation via their respiratory depressant effects, may dysregulate the myocardial oxygen supply and demand balance when used in conjunction with methamphetamines. 18

Usefulness and indications — comprehensive, accurate, and correctly interpreted toxicology testing may be useful for educating patients and providers and, occasionally, as a diagnostic tool; the informational value depends on clinical importance, so testing is unnecessary if it would not alter the treatment plan and becomes more necessary as outcomes become more clinically important, with examples including pediatric exposure assessment and differentiating psychiatric decompensation from methamphetamine-associated psychosis.

### An acute care contingency management program for the treatment of stimulant use disorder: a case report [^b3ae7e38]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Illicit stimulants such as crystal methamphetamine and cocaine are a rising cause of morbidity and mortality in North America. Unfortunately, there are few evidence-based approaches for the management of stimulant use disorder. Contingency management programs are currently the best evidenced treatment strategy, designed to reward behavior change and offer competing reinforcers toward the goal of reducing substance use, but these programs are often difficult to access. Given that it is well understood that hospitalization presents a valuable opportunity for the initiation of treatment for a variety of substance use disorders, the adaptation of contingency management programs to an acute medicine inpatient setting is a potentially viable option to improve care, and to increase access to effective treatment for stimulant use disorders.

Case Summary

We present a case outlining the clinical care of a complex medical patient admitted with osteomyelitis, whose course in hospital changed significantly upon enrollment in a pilot contingency management program in an urban hospital in Canada.

Discussion

This case illustrates how effective treatment programs can be adapted as needed for use in novel settings, especially where current options are inaccessible, inadequate, or ineffective.

### Association of neural responses to drug cues with subsequent relapse to stimulant use [^0ef08d88]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Harmful drug use accounts for 12.4% of global mortality and 8.9% of global disability-adjusted life years, much of which can be attributed to chronic relapse. Individuals with stimulant use disorders (including cocaine use disorder and amphetamine use disorder) have a particularly severe rate of relapse: more than half of patients relapse 1 year after leaving treatment and an additional one-fourth of patients relapse 2 to 5 years after leaving treatment. Although both social (eg, unemployment) and clinical (eg, co-occurring psychiatric disorders) factors appear to increase the risk of relapse across different types of drug addiction, they do so only weakly and variably in individuals with stimulant use disorder. By discovering more robust factors associated with relapse, clinicians might better identify intervention targets and direct interventions toward the most vulnerable patients.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^00a492ad]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Technology-based interventions for stimulant use disorder — using computer, web, or mobile applications — can be used to implement evidence-based interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and contingency management (CM), offering standardized implementation, reduced staff burden, and increased access to care. CBT-focused web applications include Computer Based Training for CBT (CBT4CBT) and the Therapeutic Education System (TES), an interactive web-based program based on Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) that contains a CBT component. CBT4CBT can be combined with weekly monitoring check-ins, with studies finding significant reductions in substance use and improved retention compared with in-person CBT, and evidence suggests residential programs can also benefit from web-based CBT. Across technology-based interventions, individual studies reported reduced substance use, particularly among people who use cocaine, though the literature revealed less evidence of efficacy for ATS and methamphetamine use. When added to other behavioral interventions, CBT4CBT and TES appear to improve stimulant use outcomes, although these effects are not always durable; some evidence suggested these interventions may be similarly effective to clinician-delivered treatment, including CBT, and one study suggested the positive effect of TES was greater in those with a drug-positive urine test at baseline. While evidence is strongest for cocaine use, the CGC notes no reason to believe the effectiveness would be significantly different for ATS use. CM interventions have used webcams and mobile applications to promote cessation of nicotine/tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use.

### Ageing and older people who use illicit opioids, cocaine or methamphetamine: a scoping review and literature map [^5e4c88df]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane register searches returned a total of 774 references, from which 79 duplicates were removed. Of the 695 publications screened against title and abstract, 433 were excluded, leaving 262 studies to be assessed for full‐text eligibility. This second round of screening led to the exclusion of 123 studies (Figure 1), leaving 139 included publications from the database search. Twenty‐five more studies were added from a hand search of reference lists for a total of 164 included publications. Details of included publications are presented in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Details of included publications

Characteristics of included publications

Of the 164 included publications, 126 (77%) reported primary research, 19 (12%) were reviews, 15 (9%) were editorials or commentaries and four were case studies (Table 1). Primary publications included 107 quantitative studies, 16 qualitative studies and three mixed‐methods studies. Of the quantitative primary studies, two‐thirds presented cross‐sectional data (n = 71; 66%). A large majority (n = 157; 96%) of reviewed publications were from high‐income countries: 113 (69%) from the United States, 19 (12%) from the United Kingdom, 11 (7%) from European countries, 10 (6%) from Australia and four (3%) from Canada. Google Translate was used to read four publications (three in German, one in Spanish).

Participants in primary studies were most often recruited from drug treatment services (n = 45, 36%) or from the community, either through diversified recruitment of PWUD samples (n = 34, 27%) or via surveys conducted in the general population (n = 8, 6%). Studies that specifically focused upon 'older' PWUD most often used a cut‐off of 50 years or above (n = 54, 33%), but 'older' definitions ranged from 40 years and above (n = 6) to 70 years and above (n = 1) (Table 1).

### Clinical correlates and outcomes of methamphetamine-associated cardiovascular diseases in hospitalized patients in California [^9608a825]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Methamphetamine use is associated with the increased incidence of several serious CVD pathologies and thus with epidemics comparable to those known for many decades resulting from cocaine and alcohol abuse. Our study found that methamphetamine users have a significantly increased (32%) risk of CVD and in particular of developing PHTN and HF. Among methamphetamine users, those with chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes were most at risk. Unlike previous studies, we did not demonstrate a significant association between female sex and incidence of methamphetamine‐associated PHTN, although we found that men were more likely to develop MI or MINOCA. We found a trend for increased risk of CVD among methamphetamine users who also abuse other substances (alcohol and cocaine) though this did not reach significance, possibly due to small sample sizes, and warrants further exploration. Methamphetamine users who also use cocaine are at particular risk of developing MI and MINOCA and should be considered a subgroup where prevention strategies are particularly focused. The dual burdens of cardiovascular and mental health disease among methamphetamine users must be recognized and addressed by physicians in order to slow the rapid pace of growth of this global epidemic.

### Illicit stimulants and ventricular arrhythmias: a longitudinal cohort study [^8b3b8844]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Aims

Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation underlie many sudden cardiac deaths, but common lifestyle factors that predict their occurrence are poorly understood. This study aimed to assess the association between methamphetamine and cocaine, the most used illicit stimulants, and ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and mortality.

Methods

Healthcare databases were used to identify adults aged ≥ 18 years receiving hospital-based care in California in 2005–2019. ICD codes were used to identify diagnoses and illicit stimulant use. Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for demographics and time-updated cardiovascular risk factors were employed. The outcomes were VA combining ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest and all-cause mortality.

Results

Among 29 593 819 individuals (53.8% female, mean age 44.9 years), 690 737 (2.3%) used methamphetamine, and 290 652 (1.0%) used cocaine at some point. After adjustment for age, sex, race and ethnicity, cannabis and opioid use, and other cardiovascular risk factors, methamphetamine use and cocaine use were each associated with increased risk of incident VA [hazard ratio (HR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85–1.95, and HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.10–1.19, respectively], and mortality (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.47–1.54 and HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.64–1.72, respectively). The risk of VA was higher in younger individuals (< 65 years) and females for both methamphetamine and cocaine, whereas it was higher in Blacks and lower in Whites and Hispanics for cocaine use, and higher in Asians and lower in Blacks for methamphetamine use (P for interaction < .05 in all).

Conclusions

Methamphetamine use and cocaine use were each associated with increased risk of incident VA and mortality, with differential relationships by demographic groups. Avoiding these substances may reduce risk of VA and death.

United States overdose mortality — opioids and stimulants is characterized by 49,860 opioid overdose deaths in 2019, exceeding 46,802 in 2018 and over twice the 21,088 in 2010; the 2018 number was only slightly less than 48,344 deaths by suicide in 2018, making opioid overdose alone the 11th most common cause of death in the U.S.; non-methadone synthetic opioids such as fentanyl were the primary cause of death by opioid overdose, and roughly twice as many men than women die of opioid overdose. Death by psychostimulant overdose is the next most common cause of overdose death, and in 2019 deaths from methamphetamine overdose exceeded cocaine, with approximately 16,100 methamphetamine deaths and 15,900 cocaine deaths.

### Neurocognitive functioning of individuals with schizophrenia: using and not using drugs [^7d793d68]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Research on neurocognition in schizophrenia, using modest samples and self-rated assessments, reports drug use contributes to improved rather than impaired cognitive function. We have sought to replicate these findings in a large sample of patients that had their drug-use status confirmed by laboratory assays and evaluated the potential differences in cognitive function between patients with positive and negative results.

Methods

Nine hundred and seventy four schizophrenia patients completed neuropsychological and laboratory tests at screening/baseline of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) of hair tested for cannabis, cocaine and methamphetamine.

Results

Many patients screened positive for drug use (n = 262; 27%), and there were no differences between patients with positive and negative results in terms of cognitive function after adjusting for multiple inference testing, except patients with positive RIA for methamphetamine demonstrated increased processing speed (corrected, P = 0.024). Moderator models were employed to explore potential subgroup differences in this pattern of results. At low medication dosages, patients with positive RIA for cocaine demonstrated decreased processing speed compared with patients with negative RIA for cocaine (uncorrected, P = 0.008). And for any other drugs with low psychopathology, patients with positive RIA demonstrated decreased working memory compared with patients with negative RIA (uncorrected, P = 0.006).

Conclusions

No positive effects of cannabis on cognitive function were observed, and drug use was not associated with improved neurocognition across most of the subgroup characteristics explored in this sample of schizophrenia patients.

Table 4
Population-level negative impact score by region and stakeholder perspective

ASO = HIV/AIDS Service Organization; HPC = HIV Planning Council. In Panel A, overall means not sharing any superscript letter are significantly different by the t -test at the 5% level of significance. In Panel B, mean differences between regions and respondent type were tested by the t-test using Bonferroni-corrected alpha levels of.008 and.017 for region and respondent type, respectively

Significant differences by region or perspective are summarized in Table 4 Panel B. Again, the largest difference was between the population-level negative impact score for methamphetamine use disorders reported by respondents from the West (8.3) and Northeast (4.6; d = 0.74). For alcohol use disorders, the only significant difference was a small difference (d = 0.28) between respondents in the South (7.4) and West (6.1). For cannabis use disorders, scores for respondents in the Northeast and South (both 4.2) were significantly higher than the West (2.8). The population-level negative impact score for cocaine use disorder was significantly lower for respondents from the West (3.2) than from the Northeast (5.6), South (5.7) and Midwest (5.3). Additionally, the score for cocaine use disorder was significantly higher for ASO staff (6.6) than clients with HIV (4.4). For methamphetamine use disorders, the score from the West (8.3) was significantly higher than both the Northeast (4.6) and the South (5.9). Furthermore, ASO staff again reported a significantly higher score (8.1) than clients with HIV (6.0). Finally, for opioid use disorders, the score from respondents in the Northeast (7.8) was higher than the South (5.9) and West (5.8).

### Cocaine engages a non-canonical, dopamine-independent, mechanism that controls neuronal excitability in the nucleus accumbens [^267667ac]. Molecular Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Thus, the role of σ 1 vs. DARs in cocaine's behavioral effects remains elusive. Their contributions are likely synergetic, and teasing apart their relative contributions in cocaine-related behaviors and in specific stages of the addiction cycle (acquisition, extinction, relapse) has been an intense subject of research in Dr. Katz's laboratory (reviewed in). In the present study, we identify a DA-independent cellular mechanism by which cocaine alters neuronal intrinsic excitability (i.e. neuronal firing) of NAcSh MSNs.

Non-canonical, intracellular, actions of psychiatric drugs or abused substances are emerging as intriguing complementary mechanisms that contribute to their pernicious addictive properties. For example, besides conventional action of nicotine on membrane nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), nicotine exhibits pharmacological chaperoning activity upon binding to specific intracellular nAChRs located at the ER level, which underlies some initial events of nicotine addiction (reviewed in). Directly pertinent to the present study, intravenous self-administration of methamphetamine (METH) in rats, a psychostimulant drug that is chemically different from cocaine, decreases NAcSh MSNs firing rate. METH also binds to σ 1, consistent with the capability of the σ 1 ligand-binding cavity to bind structurally different compounds. Future studies are warranted to determine whether NAcSh neuronal hypoactivity is a unifying σ 1-dependent, DA-independent, mechanism among abused psychostimulant drugs that bind σ 1.000000000000000e+00

### Transcranial direct current stimulation to modulate fMRI drug cue reactivity in methamphetamine users: a randomized clinical trial [^79c53a1c]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1 Stimulation effects on subjective response: craving score

Irrespective of active or sham stimulation, subjective response to drug cue exposure showed significant increases in craving after the first scan (cue exposure) (pre‐stimulation, T2 compared to T1). The craving score decreased significantly after the tDCS intervention in both groups (T3 compared to T2). However, there was no significant change in craving after the second scan (cue exposure) (post‐stimulation, T4 compared to T3) in either the active or sham groups (lack of subjective response to drug cue in the second exposure). There was a significant reduction in the craving self‐report from baseline (before the stimulation day) to the day after stimulation without any significant difference between groups. Our findings suggest that our interventions, which included both cue exposure and active/sham tDCS, successfully reduced craving in both groups. However, no significant between‐group differences or time × group interaction was found across the population. There have been other tDCS studies that reported no significant differences between active and sham groups in terms of self‐reported drug craving (see this systematic review, Lupi et al.). For instance, Xu et al. reported that the reduction in cigarette craving after bilateral DLPFC stimulation did not differ significantly between active and sham stimulation. In another randomized sham‐controlled trial, craving scores did not change significantly by applying a multi‐session bilateral DLPFC stimulation in a group of people with severe alcoholism (Klauss et al.). Furthermore, five sessions of unilateral tDCS over DLPFC (F3‐Fp2) in a group of participants with schizophrenia showed no statistically significant effects on cigarette craving or cigarettes smoked (Smith et al.). Another study among cigarette smokers on the immediate effects of unilateral DLPFC tDCS during an in vivo smoking cue exposure, revealed no significant time (pre vs. post) by group (sham vs. active) interaction on self‐reported craving (Kroczek et al.). Meanwhile, there have been several studies among people with SUDs that reported significant differences between active and sham groups in terms of drug craving (cocaine, Batista et al; marijuana, Boggio et al; heroin, Sharifi‐Fardshad et al; alcohol, Klauss et al; and methamphetamine, Shahbabaie et al.). Heterogeneity in methodological details and large interindividual variabilities in response to tDCS can contribute significantly to the mixed results (Bashir & Yoo). The inconsistency between different studies might be attributed to the differences in the number of subjects, type of substances, duration of abstinence, and state of dependency in the target population, and methodological details like electrode montage and sham stimulation protocols and details in cue exposure protocols. For example, compared to the previous tDCS‐fMRI research in the field of addiction medicine, we used a larger sample size in this study. Significant between‐group differences in behavioral outcomes reported in previous studies might be related to the smaller sample size and low statistical power that reduces the likelihood that statistical results reflect a true effect (Button et al.) as studies with smaller size are more likely to report false positives with relatively large effect size (Minarik et al.).

### Urine drug screen positive for cocaine and amphetamine is not an adverse risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in trauma [^23984736]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study showed that a UDS positive for cocaine or methamphetamine is not an adverse risk factor for death, stroke, or MI in trauma. This was true for the overall trauma population as well as for the patients who underwent surgery.

This lack of harmful association calls into question the perceived perioperative risk of these drugs and the policy of canceling surgery based on a positive UDS. The results of UDS for illicit drugs show a variety of harmful and protective associations with mortality and complications in trauma patients. It is likely to represent a complex interaction of patient selection and pharmacologic effects. In the setting of a positive UDS, evaluation for signs of acute intoxication, cardiovascular compromise and hemodynamic instability should help guide evaluation of cardiovascular risk and the timing of surgery.

### Stimulants | Overdose prevention… [^998b1777]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Stimulants include drugs such as methamphetamine, other amphetamines, and cocaine.
- Stimulant-involved overdose deaths have risen in recent years.
- View our Stimulant Guide below to learn more about risks, how to identify a stimulant overdose, and how to access resources for further support or education. All psychostimulants are stimulants, but not all stimulants are psychostimulants. In the type of data coding that is often used for tracking overdose deaths, stimulants are captured largely under two main groupings: cocaine and psychostimulants with abuse potential. Methamphetamine is classified under "psychostimulants with abuse potential". Although this category also includes other stimulants such as amphetamine and MDMA, methamphetamine accounts for the majority of deaths in the category.

In 2023, nearly 60, 000 overdose deaths involved cocaine and/or psychostimulants with abuse potential, which translates to about 57% of the 105, 007 total overdose deaths in the US that year. Importantly, these drug categories cover most but not all stimulant drugs, so the percentage of deaths involving any stimulant in 2023 is likely slightly higher. Cocaine Cocaine is an illegal, highly addictive central nervous system stimulant that can be snorted, smoked, or dissolved and injected into a vein. In 2023, 5 million Americans aged 12 or older reported using cocaine in the past year. Cocaine-involved overdose death rates in the United States decreased from 2006 to 2010 but have since increased. From 2022 to 2023, the number of overdose deaths involving cocaine increased by nearly 7%, with about 30, 000 Americans dying in 2023 from an overdose involving cocaine.

Methamphetamine Methamphetamine is a highly addictive central nervous system stimulant. In addition to risking becoming addicted to methamphetamine, people who use it long-term may experience a range of negative health outcomes, including damage to the heart and brain, anxiety, confusion, insomnia, mood disturbances, and violent behavior.
