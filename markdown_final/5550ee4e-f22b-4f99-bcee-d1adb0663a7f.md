## Question

Is there a utility of breast MRI prior to surgery for stage 1 breast cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether preoperative breast MRI is useful for patients with stage I breast cancer and, if so, how to determine which patients should receive it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what stage I means clinically and the typical goals of preoperative imaging. Then, I should review diagnostic performance and potential benefits, including margin status and re-excision rates. Next, I will examine the evidence on harms, particularly increased mastectomy and treatment delays. After that, I need to check randomized and high-quality data for oncologic outcomes. Then, I should align conclusions with major guidelines and society statements. Finally, I will identify the subgroups where MRI is most likely to add value and outline a practical, evidence-based approach to shared decision-making and implementation requirements.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: stage I disease is defined by tumor size ≤ 2 cm and node-negative (or micrometastasis), where breast-conserving surgery is standard and imaging's primary role is to confirm tumor size, location, and the absence of additional ipsilateral or contralateral disease, not to overcall extent that would push patients unnecessarily toward mastectomy [^112oXDeC].

> Now, I need to verify what MRI can and cannot do diagnostically. MRI has high sensitivity and can detect additional ipsilateral disease in roughly 16–20% and contralateral disease in about 3–5%, but specificity is limited and the positive predictive value for ipsilateral additional disease hovers around two-thirds, meaning false positives are common and require tissue confirmation before altering surgery [^111hLUHS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benefit. I initially thought MRI would consistently reduce positive margins or re-excision because it better defines extent, but I should double-check the data. A large multicenter SHAVE/SHAVE2 cohort found no significant association between preoperative MRI and margin negativity on multivariable analysis, whereas a meta-analysis of surgical outcomes showed higher initial mastectomy rates and no consistent reduction in re-excision, suggesting that better detection does not reliably translate into fewer positive margins or less reoperation when used broadly [^115h6izs] [^115MjXsn].

> Next, I should review randomized evidence for oncologic endpoints. Wait, let me verify which RCTs speak to this. The Finnish RCT in unifocal stage I invasive ductal carcinoma showed management changes in 20% but no differences in mastectomy or reoperation, and importantly, MRI delayed surgery by about 13 days; the Brazilian BREAST-MRI trial found higher mastectomy rates and no improvement in local relapse-free or overall survival; and a contemporary RCT meta-analysis concluded that MRI did not improve surgical outcomes and may increase mastectomy risk, reinforcing the absence of a survival or recurrence benefit signal [^111kKx8u] [^114pscLv].

> I should also consider harms and system effects. Observational population-level data show MRI is associated with more imaging, more biopsies, higher odds of mastectomy and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, and prolonged time to surgery by roughly 8–13 days; the detection of synchronous contralateral disease can look favorable at first glance, but propensity-matched analyses in older women suggest overdiagnosis without a net reduction in subsequent invasive contralateral events, and even where synchronous detection increases, downstream mastectomy use rises disproportionately, underscoring potential harm without proven survival benefit [^116jZF2Y] [^113qgShq] [^116hQ2HT].

> Let me now examine long-term outcomes more broadly. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses repeatedly fail to demonstrate improved local control, disease-free survival, or overall survival with preoperative MRI. One meta-analysis showed a nonsignificant trend toward lower in-breast recurrence that did not reach statistical significance, and multiple large cohorts show no recurrence advantage even in younger patients, including those ≤ 40–50 years, which tempers enthusiasm for routine MRI in early-stage disease [^117Gw64j] [^114f4cNZ] [^11297L46].

> I need to ensure my conclusions align with guidelines. The NCCN states that MRI may be used selectively for staging or contralateral screening but is not universally recommended, and cautions that MRI overestimates extent and can drive unnecessary mastectomies. The ASBrS notes MRI is not mandatory for BCS planning and emphasizes that decisions should be individualized. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria similarly advise against routine MRI for stage I workup, reserving it for specific scenarios, reflecting the absence of outcome benefit and the risk of overtreatment [^112oXDeC] [^112yN8X5].

> But wait, what if there are subgroups where MRI meaningfully changes management. I should confirm the selective indications. Evidence-supported scenarios include invasive lobular carcinoma with ill-defined extent, discrepancy between clinical and conventional imaging, planned neoadjuvant therapy where accurate baseline and response assessment are needed, dense breasts with poor mammographic sensitivity, and young patients with higher likelihood of multifocality; even in these groups, MRI findings should be verified with tissue sampling and integrated into multidisciplinary planning to avoid overcalling disease [^111iH5CX] [^115tPtby] [^112oXDeC].

> I will now examine special contexts where MRI may help. For DCIS, randomized data do not show clear improvements in re-excision or conversion to mastectomy with MRI, so routine use is not supported. For extensive intraductal component or extensive DCIS on conventional imaging, MRI can better map disease, but decisions still hinge on pathologic confirmation of MRI-suspected areas before escalating surgery. In patients with axillary nodal disease and an occult primary, MRI can help localize the primary, but this is outside the typical stage I scenario [^1124bAP3] [^11129nUh] [^111bYDCA].

> Next, I should review alternatives when MRI is unavailable or equivocal. Contrast-enhanced mammography combined with targeted ultrasound can approach MRI for size accuracy and detection of multifocal disease in some settings, and in experienced hands, ultrasound can substitute for MRI in selected axillary scenarios, which is particularly relevant given MRI's cost, access constraints, and false-positive potential. Shared decision-making should explicitly weigh these trade-offs and patient preferences [^113NJSz3] [^117Hyjzt] [^111KLw24].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For stage I breast cancer, routine preoperative MRI does not improve survival or local control and is associated with increased mastectomy, more biopsies, longer time to surgery, and added costs; therefore, MRI should be used selectively for specific indications, with any management-altering findings confirmed histologically before surgery, and patients counseled about potential benefits and harms using a shared decision framework grounded in current guideline recommendations [^114pscLv] [^112oXDeC] [^112yN8X5].

Preoperative breast MRI is **not routinely recommended** for stage I breast cancer because it does not improve survival or reduce local recurrence [^112oXDeC] and may increase mastectomy rates without reducing re-excisions [^115MjXsn]. MRI is best reserved for **select scenarios** such as invasive lobular carcinoma, dense breasts [^111iH5CX], or when conventional imaging is inconclusive [^111bYDCA]. Routine MRI can cause false positives, delay surgery [^116jZF2Y], and increase costs, so decisions should be individualized and guided by multidisciplinary teams [^117WxNV7].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility

MRI has high sensitivity for detecting additional ipsilateral and contralateral lesions, with **incremental detection rates** of 16% for ipsilateral and 3–5% for contralateral disease [^111hLUHS]. However, its **specificity is lower**, leading to false positives that can prompt unnecessary biopsies and surgery [^114pscLv].

---

## Impact on surgical management

Preoperative MRI frequently alters surgical plans, often converting breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy, yet **does not consistently reduce re-excision rates** or improve long-term outcomes [^115MjXsn]. A meta-analysis showed MRI increased mastectomy rates without reducing re-excisions, indicating potential overtreatment [^115MjXsn].

---

## Oncologic outcomes

There is **no evidence** that preoperative MRI improves survival or reduces local recurrence in stage I breast cancer [^notfound]. Randomized and observational studies show no significant differences in recurrence or survival between patients who had MRI and those who did not [^116tBK5n].

---

## Potential drawbacks and limitations

- **False positives**: MRI can detect benign or indeterminate lesions, leading to unnecessary biopsies and surgery [^114pscLv].
- **Delay in treatment**: MRI can postpone surgery, increasing anxiety and potentially worsening outcomes [^116jZF2Y].
- **Increased costs**: MRI adds significant expense without proven clinical benefit in stage I disease [^117WxNV7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines **do not recommend routine MRI** for stage I breast cancer [^112oXDeC]. NCCN advises selective use — such as for invasive lobular carcinoma, dense breasts, or when conventional imaging is inconclusive — and emphasizes that MRI findings should be confirmed histologically before changing surgical plans [^111bYDCA]. ASBrS similarly states MRI is not mandatory and should be used selectively [^112yN8X5].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing MRI utility

Certain factors may justify **MRI** in stage I disease:

| **Patient-specific factor** | **Rationale for mri** |
|-|-|
| Invasive lobular carcinoma | Diffuse growth pattern makes extent assessment challenging [^115tPtby] |
| Dense breast tissue | Mammography sensitivity is reduced, making MRI useful [^112yN8X5] |
| Discrepancy between clinical and imaging findings | MRI can clarify extent when conventional imaging is inconclusive [^111bYDCA] |
| High-risk genetic mutations (e.g. BRCA) | MRI may detect additional lesions in high-risk patients [^1161mx2D] |

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

MRI should be **weighed against alternatives**. Mammography and ultrasound remain standard for staging; contrast-enhanced mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis can improve detection and sizing in early-stage disease, offering accessible substitutes where MRI is limited [^113NJSz3] [^117Hyjzt].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

MRI increases costs through additional imaging, biopsies, and surgeries, often without improving outcomes; thus, **routine MRI is not cost-effective** in stage I disease, especially given false positives and treatment delays [^116jZF2Y].

---

## Current research gaps and ongoing studies

Ongoing studies aim to clarify MRI's role in subgroups (e.g. invasive lobular carcinoma, dense breasts) and to evaluate whether selective use can reduce re-excisions without increasing mastectomies. No completed RCT has demonstrated **clear oncologic benefit** in stage I disease [^111kKx8u].

---

Preoperative breast MRI is **not routinely recommended** for stage I breast cancer due to a lack of survival or recurrence benefit and potential harms. It should be reserved for select cases, with decisions made by multidisciplinary teams and findings confirmed histologically before altering surgery [^112oXDeC].

Breast MRI accuracy, outcomes, and shared decision-making: In the neoadjuvant setting, the level of agreement between MRI and pathologic tumor size is better than clinical examination and mammography but similar to ultrasound by meta-analysis; there is no convincing evidence that MRI reduces re- excision lumpectomy rates, local recurrence, or overall survival in patients with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, and the decision to use breast MRI as an adjunct should be made by the physician and patient after joint consideration of benefits and consequences, including frequent false-positive findings of the breast, increased ipsilateral and contralateral mastectomy rates and increased time to treatment. The performance of MRI is associated with increased costs of care and may be associated with increased patient anxiety, and well-informed patients may have less distress when false-positive findings necessitate additional biopsies.

Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The POMB Trialwas a prospective, randomized, multicenter study that included 440 patients aged < 56 years with BC from three Swedish breast units. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either the preoperative staging with breast MRI (n = 220) or no breast MRI (n = 220) group. In patients randomized to the MRI group, a change from suggested breast conservation to mastectomy occurred in 23 of 153 (15%) patients. Breast MRI provided additional information in 83 of 220 (38%) patients, resulting in a change in treatment plan in 40 (18%). The breast reoperation rate was significantly lower in the MRI group: 11 of 220 (5%) versus 33 of 220 (15%) in the control group (p < 0.001). The number of mastectomies, axillary reoperations, and the number of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy after definitive treatment did not differ significantly between the groups.

Brück et al.published an RCT in 2018 from Finland investigating the diagnostic value of preoperative MRI and its impact on short-term surgical outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed unifocal stage I invasive ductal carcinoma. A total of 100 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either preoperative MRI or to be scheduled directly for surgery. There were 50 patients in both study arms. MRI detected an additional finding in 28%, and in 7%, it was identified as malignant, causing a change in planned surgical management in 10 patients (20%). Mastectomy and reoperation rates were similar in both groups. The mean interval between referral and first surgical procedure was 34 days in the MRI group and 21 days in the control group (p < 0.001).

The BREAST-MRI Trialwas a phase III, randomized, open-label, single-center Brazilian trial that included female participants with stage 0–III BC who were eligible for BCS. This study compared the role of MRI in preoperative evaluation with that of routine radiologic examinations (mammography and ultrasound) in BCS candidates. The primary outcome was local relapse-free survival, and secondary outcomes were overall survival, mastectomy, and reoperation rates. The study randomized 524 patients to the preoperative MRI group (n = 257) or control group (n = 267); however, the preoperative MRI increased the mastectomy rates by 8%, and the use of preoperative MRI did not influence local relapse-free survival, overall survival, or reoperation rates.

### Is imaging the future of axillary staging in breast cancer? [^11255y9d]. European Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Axillary management in patients with breast cancer has become much less invasive with the introduction of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, over 70% of SLNBs are negative, questioning the generic use of this invasive procedure. Emerging evidence indicates that breast cancer patients with a low axillary burden of disease do not benefit from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Non-invasive techniques such as paramagnetic iron oxide contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide genuine alternatives to axillary staging and should be evaluated within clinical trials. Selective axillary surgery could then be offered based on imaging findings and for therapeutic intent. This non-operative approach would reduce morbidity further and facilitate interpretation of follow-up imaging. Key Points
- Modern imaging and biopsy greatly help the axillary staging of breast cancer.
- Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MRI offers a further advance.
- Sentinel lymph node biopsy may become redundant with SPIO-enhanced MRI.
- Selective therapeutic axillary surgery should be based upon preoperative imaging findings.

### Preoperative MRI radiomics to predict outcomes in patients with early-stage breast cancer… [^111JZrCt]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Meaning In this study, clinical-radiomic nomograms were useful in clinical decision-making associated with personalized selection of surgical interventions and therapeutic regimens for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Importance Axillary lymph node metastasis status, typically estimated using an invasive procedure with a high false-negative rate, strongly affects the prognosis of recurrence in breast cancer. However, preoperative noninvasive tools to accurately predict ALNM status and disease-free survival are lacking. This retrospective prognostic study included patients with histologically confirmed early-stage breast cancer diagnosed at 4 hospitals in China from July 3, 2007, to September 21, 2019, randomly divided into development and vaidation cohorts. All patients underwent preoperative MRI scans, were treated with surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy or ALN dissection, and were pathologically examined to determine the ALNM status.

Data analysis was conducted from February 15, 2019, to March 20, 2020. This technique displayed a greater net benefit and was able to reduce the number of unnecessary ALNDs compared with use of radiologists' diagnosis to select patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy at all threshold probabilities. The patients stratified by the combined radiomic and clinical signature were classified into low-risk and high-risk groups for DFS in advance, which greatly improved the ability to predict the risk of DFS. This strategy may have clinical implications for individualized follow-up and for guiding therapeutic strategies. They included small sample sizes of only 62 and 163 patients from a single center, which likely lowered the generalizability and clinical applicability. In addition, the MRI radiomics were based on only single a T1-weighted sequence, which might be inadequate to reflect tumor heterogeneity.

Compared with these studies, the data sets in this study were, to our knowledge, the largest to date, involving more than 1000 patients from 4 medical institutions. The development of artificial intelligence–based radiomics in the medical field has allowed for the identification of low-risk and high-risk patients with early-stage breast cancer and has provided useful clinical decision-making guidance. A previous study that recruited 294 patients with invasive breast cancer found an encouraging association between MRI radiomics and DFS. 28 Consistent with this finding, this multicenter study had an increased recruitment by 321. 1% and confirmed the predictive abilities of MRI radiomics for DFS.

Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to review and summarize the association between preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and surgical outcomes in women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer from published randomized controlled trials (RCT).

Materials and Methods

Two independent researchers conducted a systematic review through a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. If there was disagreement between the two reviewers, a third reviewer assessed the manuscript to determine whether it should be included for data extraction. The quality of the papers was assessed using the risk of bias tool, and the evidence was analyzed using GRADE. Meta-analyses using a fixed-effects model were used to estimate the pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

Initially, 21 studies were identified, 15 of which were observational comparative studies. A total of five RCTs were included, and they suggested that preoperative MRI significantly reduced the rate of immediate breast-conserving surgery and increased the risk for mastectomy.

Conclusions

From the RCT perspective, preoperative MRI for newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer did not improve surgical outcomes and may increase the risk of mastectomy.

### Accuracy of breast MRI for surgical planning after neoadjuvant therapy for patients with invasive lobular carcinoma [^115tPtby]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate preoperative imaging is an important component of surgical planning for breast cancer to allow for appropriate treatment selection. Precise measurement of tumor size is crucial, as underestimation can lead to positive margins and need for re-excision, while overestimation can lead to unnecessarily excessive resection of breast tissue or mastectomy. However, conventional imaging techniques have limitations, and accuracy may vary across different types of breast cancer. This is particularly relevant for patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), where tumor characteristics make accurate imaging assessment more challenging.

ILC is the second most common subtype of breast cancer, comprising 10–15% of all cases. Due to the absence of the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin, ILC grows in a more diffuse and infiltrating pattern compared with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). As a result, accurate assessment of disease extent can be challenging for ILC. Mammography is known to have limited sensitivity for ILC, often substantially underestimating the extent of disease. Obtaining clear margins after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is a challenge in the management of ILC, and up to 60% of patients have positive margins after BCS, requiring either re-excision surgery or conversion to completion mastectomy. –

Because of these challenges, some guidelines recommend the use of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the evaluation of ILC. – While several studies show that breast MRI has higher accuracy than conventional imaging in ILC, the evidence that breast MRI is associated with improved surgical outcomes, such as lower positive margin rates and greater success of breast conservation, is less robust. – Consequently, the utility of breast MRI in the preoperative evaluation of patients with early stage breast cancer remains a topic of debate.

One factor that might explain the inconsistent accuracy of breast MRI is variation in the imaging appearance of different breast tumors, termed tumor imaging phenotype. For example, tumors that appear to grow without the formation of a discrete mass may be described as "non-mass enhancement" on MRI, with this finding being associated with higher discordance between tumor diameter as measured by imaging compared with surgical pathology.

### Breast MRI: guidelines from the European society of breast imaging [^111VNrGF]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

However, it is so far unclear whether breast MRI contributes to better control of the disease or survival of all patients with diagnosed breast cancer. Only one study has evaluated such outcomes, and although MRI appears to reduce the incidence of local recurrence (1.2% vs. 6.8%), confounding differences in tumor characteristics between patients treated with and without MRI did occur.

The British COMICE trial is a large multicenter trial that randomizes patients between MRI and no-MRI and evaluates the quality of preoperative staging, the differences in outcome, differences in quality of life and cost-effectiveness; the first results are expected in 2008. This study and similar ongoing studies may provide better evaluation of staging in the near future.

Synchronous bilateral breast cancer is reported in about 2–3% of all breast cancer patients, but it is probably more common. Synchronous contralateral lesions are occult on mammography in about 75% of cases. MRI detects otherwise occult lesions in 3–5% of patients that undergo preoperative MRI. Some studies show even more alarming results and report MRI-only detected contralateral breast cancer in 19% and 24%. These lesions would probably have presented as metachronous contralateral carcinomas without MRI, as is also clear from the above-mentioned outcome study. The rate of contralateral carcinomas detected at follow-up decreased from 4% without MRI to 1.7% with MRI.

Screening of the contralateral breast in patients with proven unilateral breast cancer is thus a valid indication for the performance of preoperative breast MRI. In practice this means that preoperative MRI is recommended in all patients with histologically proven breast cancer, even though the indication for ipsilateral staging of the cancer is still under investigation.

Especially in the case of dense breasts, MRI is recommended preoperatively. Furthermore, in patients with histologic evidence of invasive lobular carcinoma, a preoperative MRI is strongly recommended as these tumors show a more permeative growth pattern and, consequently, are more difficult to measure, are more often multifocal or multicentric (additional foci in 32%) and are more often complicated by concurrent contralateral carcinomas (occult tumors detected in 7%).

### The changing world of breast cancer: a radiologist's perspective [^113z9TGV]. Investigative Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

With the advent of breast-conserving surgery came the concept of "safety margins" for the excised breast cancer and their precursors, that is, DCIS. With this came the need for imaging methods that help the surgeon delineate the extent of disease within the breast before embarking for surgery.

Recently, the role of surgical margins is again declining. A safety margin is not required any more for invasive cancers; the new concept uses the criterion "no tumor on ink", that is, no invasive cancer abutting the resection margins, to provide sufficient protection from local recurrence, and a free margin of only 2 mm is currently considered sufficient for DCIS. Yet, as long as the aim of surgery is to ensure an R0 resection (ie, no tumor left, with or without safety margin), accurate imaging is needed to delineate the extent of disease. Breast MRI has been shown to be far more accurate than mammography and breast ultrasound for delineating the actual extent of disease in patients who are scheduled for breast conserving treatment irrespective of the type of breast cancer (ductal or lobular or other), of the size of the breast cancer, of the mammographic breast density or the age of the patient. In short, preoperative breast MRI improves the depiction of the extent of a given cancer and should therefore be offered to every patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer (Fig. 5).–

### Breast MRI: guidelines from the European society of breast imaging [^116JtTp2]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The overall aim of breast imaging can be summarized under several general headings. First, it is performed in symptomatic women to exclude breast cancer or other disease that requires immediate treatment. In this respect, it should provide a definitive diagnosis or exclude the presence of a harmful abnormality. Second, in patients with known malignancies, imaging helps in the preoperative staging and subsequent choice of appropriate therapy, either surgical or medical. Third, in patients with known malignancies that are initially treated medically with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, imaging is helpful in the assessment of response to treatment and the evaluation of residual disease afterwards. Fourth, imaging is performed in asymptomatic women to detect breast cancer in its early stages, when it can be better treated, and in this respect imaging increases the prognosis and survival of breast cancer patients. Last, imaging may be used to evaluate foreign bodies within the breast, such as the location of clips and markers or whether breast prostheses are intact.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast can be used to pursue any of the above-mentioned goals.

The aim of this paper is to provide guidelines for the performance and use of breast MRI, with respect to both the technical aspects of this procedure and the current indications.

### Breast radiologists' perceptions on the detection and management of invasive lobular carcinoma: most agree imaging beyond mammography is warranted [^1174NTao]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

A majority of radiologists in our survey routinely recommend preoperative MRI for staging disease in women with newly diagnosed ILC, regardless of breast density (307/323, 95% dense and 262/325, 81% nondense). Nearly all radiologists (320/329, 97%) reported a lack of confidence in assessing extent of ILC disease on mammography in dense breasts, and nearly half (162/329, 49%) felt similarly if breasts were nondense. Preoperative MRI for staging ILC is currently recommended by several guidelines in the United States and Europe, including the ACR (2018), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2018), American Society of Breast Surgeons (2017), European Society of Breast Imaging (2008), European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (2010), and German Gynecological Oncology Group (2018). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023) recommendation for preoperative MRI is optional for evaluating the extent of ILC that is poorly defined on mammography, US, or physical examination. These guidelines are supported by prior research demonstrating superior performance of preoperative MRI compared with mammography for staging ILC disease. One meta-analysis found that MRI detected additional sites of ipsilateral and contralateral disease in 32% and 7% of patients with ILC, respectively, that were occult on mammography and/or US. Another more recent meta-analysis found that preoperative MRI did not improve surgical outcomes for patients with ILC, and therefore, the practice remains somewhat controversial.

### Clinical role of breast MRI now and going forward [^114sQEGE]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established method in breast imaging, with manifold clinical applications, including the non-invasive differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions, preoperative staging, detection of scar versus recurrence, implant assessment, and the evaluation of high-risk patients. At present, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is the most sensitive imaging technique for breast cancer diagnosis, and provides excellent morphological and to some extent also functional information. To compensate for the limited functional information, and to increase the specificity of MRI while preserving its sensitivity, additional functional parameters such as diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient mapping, and MR spectroscopic imaging have been investigated and implemented into the clinical routine. Several additional MRI parameters to capture breast cancer biology are still under investigation. MRI at high and ultra-high field strength and advances in hard- and software may also further improve this imaging technique. This article will review the current clinical role of breast MRI, including multiparametric MRI and abbreviated protocols, and provide an outlook on the future of this technique. In addition, the predictive and prognostic value of MRI as well as the evolving field of radiogenomics will be discussed.

### Magnetic resonance imaging before breast cancer surgery: results of an observational multicenter international prospective analysis (MIPA) [^115rpym7]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hence, the MIPA study brings new insights in comparison with previous randomized studies and meta-analyses which did not report any reduction in reoperation rate in their MRI groups. However, the reduction in the reoperation rate demonstrated in our MRI group must be read in the light of the increase in mastectomy rate, as shown by the protective role of the first-line mastectomy against reoperation. This reasoning also applies to our finding that mastectomy planned on conventional imaging protected against reoperation. The trade-off between first-line mastectomy and reoperation is a matter for debate with relevant issues in terms of psychological impact, complication rates, and final cosmetic results. Regarding conserving surgery, MRI did not alter the surgical planning based on conventional imaging in 84.5% of cases. MRI-based conserving surgery was more extensive than planned on conventional imaging in 13.9% and less extensive in 1.6% of cases. The question of whether MRI-tailored surgery will benefit patients at follow-up awaits future evaluation of our MIPA cohorts, including the assessment of breast recurrence and distant metastases rates.

The strengths of this observational study are related to its real-world multicenter large-scale size, which allowed us to take into consideration real-world data on 5896 patients. The real-world data approach of the MIPA study reflects current clinical practice, providing insights on a variety of issues, frequently overlooked in the discussion about preoperative MRI, such as the selection of patients referred for preoperative MRI and the difficulties in obtaining a lesion-by-lesion radiological-pathological correlation in everyday practice.

The first limitation of this study, i.e. its non-randomized design, is indeed counteracted by the approach of the MIPA study with a large and diverse study population. Other limitations of the study are represented by the exclusion of 1349 patients from analysis and the selection of centers with considerable clinical experience and high breast MRI volumes, potentially limiting the generalizability of our results.

Background

The benefit of breast MRI for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients is uncertain. This study characterizes those receiving MRI versus those who did not, and reports on their short-term surgical outcomes, including time to operation, margin status, and mastectomy rate.

Study Design

All patients seen in a multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic from July 2004 to December 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were evaluated by a radiologist, a pathologist, and surgical, radiation, and medical oncologists.

Results

Among 577 patients, 130 had pretreatment MRIs. MRI use increased from 2004 (referent, 13%) versus 2005 (24%, p = 0.014) and 2006 (27%, p = 0.002). Patients having MRIs were younger (52.5 versus 59.0 years, p < 0.001), but its use was not associated with preoperative chemotherapy, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, presentation, or tumor features. MRI was associated with a 22.4-day delay in pretreatment evaluation (p = 0.011). Breast conserving therapy (BCT) was attempted in 320 of 419 patients with complete surgical data. The odds ratio for mastectomy, controlling for T size and stage, was 1.80 after MRI versus no MRI (p = 0.024). Patients having MRIs did not have fewer positive margins at lumpectomy (21.6% MRI versus 13.8% no MRI, p = 0.20), or conversions from BCT to mastectomy (9.8% MRI versus 5.9% no MRI, p = 0.35).

Conclusions

Breast MRI use was not confined to any particular patient group. MRI use was not associated with improved margin status or BCT attempts, but was associated with a treatment delay and increased mastectomy rate. Without evidence of improved oncologic outcomes as a result, our study does not support the routine use of MRI to select patients or facilitate the performance of BCT.

### Magnetic resonance imaging screening of the contralateral breast in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of incremental cancer detection and impact on surgical management [^117VpqFT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used for staging women with breast cancer, including screening for occult contralateral cancer. This article is a review and meta-analysis of studies reporting contralateral MRI in women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer.

Methods

We systematically reviewed the evidence on contralateral MRI, calculating pooled estimates for positive predictive value (PPV), true-positive:false-positive ratio (TP:FP), and incremental cancer detection rate (ICDR) over conventional imaging. Random effects logistic regression examined whether estimates were associated with study quality or clinical variables.

Results

Twenty-two studies reported contralateral malignancies detected only by MRI in 131 of 3,253 women. Summary estimates were as follows: MRI-detected suspicious findings (TP plus FP), 9.3% (95% CI, 5.8% to 14.7%); ICDR, 4.1% (95% CI, 2.7% to 6.0%), PPV, 47.9% (95% CI, 31.8% to 64.6%); TP:FP ratio, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.82). PPV was associated with the number of test positives and baseline imaging. Few studies included consecutive women, and few ascertained outcomes in all subjects. Where reported, 35.1% of MRI-detected cancers were ductal carcinoma in situ (mean size = 6.9 mm), 64.9% were invasive cancers (mean size = 9.3 mm), and the majority were stage pTis or pT1 and node negative. Effect on treatment was inconsistently reported, but many women underwent contralateral mastectomy.

Conclusion

MRI detects contralateral lesions in a substantial proportion of women, but does not reliably distinguish benign from malignant findings. Relatively high ICDR may be due to selection bias and/or overdetection. Women must be informed of the uncertain benefit and potential harm, including additional investigations and surgery.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111KLw24]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and omission of SLNB — 'In both the INSEMA and SOUND trials, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not routinely used'. Although 'breast MRI is considered the most accurate imaging modality to assess preoperative breast tumor size', it 'may help confirm tumor size ≤ 2 cm' when applying SOUND or INSEMA. If full-axilla assessment is needed, clinicians 'should communicate that to the radiology team, since only the low axilla is required for standard breast MRI'. 'Given the similar sensitivity and specificity of US and MRI in evaluating ALNs, it is reasonable that the same standards may apply', and 'As in the SOUND trial, if there are no suspicious lymph nodes on preoperative MRI or only one suspicious node with a subsequent benign and concordant biopsy, then the results of the SOUND and INSEMA trials with preoperative US may be extrapolated and used in the setting of a negative breast MRI inclusive of the full axilla. In these cases, SLNB may be omitted'.

### The role of magnetic resonance imaging in assessing residual disease and pathologic complete response in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a systematic review [^111eJEgH]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Studies were not excluded if other imaging modalities were performed parallel to MRI in order to evaluate treatment response.

After this initial assessment, the publications were summarised separately by two radiologists using a standard extraction form. When discrepancies were encountered, consensus opinion was reached afterwards. Extracted data included: first author, year of publication, study design (retrospective or prospective), blinding procedures, population size, mean patient age and range, magnetic field strength, contrast agent/dose used, breast cancer stage at inclusion, tumour histology, breast cancer subtypes, chemotherapy regimen, imaging response assessment [World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria or other] and histopathological response assessment.

While scoring the extraction forms in consensus, some studies were excluded if the study outcome proved not to contain information on residual disease evaluation by MRI. All reported P -values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The large heterogeneity observed in the included studies precluded us from pooling data (see also 'Discussion' section), which is why we chose to use descriptive statistics in this review. Since this was a systematic review, no approval from our institutional review board was necessary.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^112oXDeC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Invasive breast cancer (non-metastatic M0) workup — The recommended workup of localized invasive breast cancer includes a history and physical examination, while complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests (LFTs) have no added benefit and monitoring of disease relapse with any tumor markers is not recommended. Imaging with bilateral diagnostic mammography is recommended; breast ultrasonography is recommended only if necessary. The use of MRI in the workup remains controversial, and MRI findings tend to overestimate extent of disease, resulting in increased frequency of mastectomies; MRI findings alone are not sufficient to determine whether BCT is optimal, as additional tissue sampling is needed. Two prospective randomized studies of preoperative MRI showed neither demonstrated improvement in rates of re-excision after initial BCS. Evidence reviews note that breast MRI staging altered surgical treatment in 7.8% to 33.3% of patients, but no differences in local recurrence or survival have been demonstrated and there is no evidence that use of breast MRI increases rates of margin-negative resection. If breast MRI is performed, a dedicated breast coil, an imaging team experienced with reading breast MRI and performing MRI-guided biopsy, and multidisciplinary management are the standard of care. According to the NCCN Panel, the use of MRI is optional and is not universally recommended; it may be used for staging evaluation to define extent of cancer in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, to detect multifocal or multicentric cancer in the ipsilateral breast, or as screening of the contralateral breast at initial diagnosis, with additional indications including clinical axillary metastasis with an occult primary, Paget disease of the nipple not identified by other imaging or physical examination, follow-up screening after prior mammographically undetected breast cancers, and in those whose lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer is > 20%.

### Evaluating the impact of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging on the surgical management of newly diagnosed breast cancers… [^114Jxr8h]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Breast MRI results in a beneficial change in surgical management in 9. 7% of newly diagnosed breast cancers. The detection of additional, otherwise undetected ipsilateral and contralateral breast malignancies with MRI suggests that breast MRI may have a role in the evaluation of new breast cancers. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of routine breast MRI on the surgical management of newly diagnosed breast cancers. First, our objective was to determine how often MRI detected an additional lesion that was otherwise undetected by mammography and ultrasonography. Second, we sought to examine the change in preoperative evaluation as a result of the MRI findings. Third, we aimed to determine whether the change in surgical management was beneficial based on radiographic-pathologic correlation. Finally, we attempted to identify predictors of a beneficial change in surgical management based on preoperative breast MRI.

The study included women 34 to 75 years of age with a new primary breast cancer. Women were excluded if MRI was deemed unnecessary: predominantly fatty breast tissue in cases where mammography was thought to be sufficient, women older than 75 years, insurance refusal of MRI precertification, claustrophobia, pregnancy or planned bilateral mastectomy. We also excluded women presenting with a history of breast cancer and patients who had MRI performed at an outside institution. This study evaluated the impact of breast MRI on the surgical management of newly diagnosed breast cancers. Patients were treated by a strict protocol in which a single surgeon at a single institution assessed all patients before breast MRI. The timing of the MRI in the patient's workup was standardized. The patient was then reevaluated by the surgeon to determine whether a change in surgical plan was merited.

Our analysis differs from previous studies in that mammography and ultrasonography were performed exhaustively before the use of breast MRI. Breast ultrasonography has gained acceptance in the management of patients with breast cancer and has been shown to adequately assess tumor size and extent. 20 Compared with prior studies, we had a lower rate of identifying previously undetected lesions with MRI. Therefore, the use of ultrasonography before MRI may detect lesions around the primary tumor, thus lowering the apparent yield of subsequent breast MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging is a highly sensitive technique with problems in specificity, which may be forcing women into mastectomies and extra biopsies unnecessarily. It can be heard in some surgical circles that all the great surgical questions have been answered in breast cancer.

Breast cancer — treatment for possible primary breast cancer: Patients with MRI-positive breast disease should undergo evaluation with ultrasound or MRI-guided biopsy and receive treatment according to the clinical stage of the breast cancer. Treatment recommendations for those with MRI-negative disease are based on nodal status. For patients with T0, N1, M0 disease, options include mastectomy plus axillary nodal dissection or axillary nodal dissection plus whole breast irradiation with or without nodal irradiation. Systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or trastuzumab is given according to the recommendations for stage II or III disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, trastuzumab, and endocrine therapy should be considered for patients with T0, N2–N3, M0 disease followed by axillary nodal dissection and mastectomy as for patients with locally advanced disease.

### Screening and diagnostic breast MRI: how do they impact surgical treatment? Insights from the MIPA study [^1134WiXi]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The usefulness of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast, its influence on mastectomy rates, and its potential in reducing reoperation rates are still the focus of heated debates and of large studies. Meanwhile, in the last 20 years, the routine implementation of breast MRI increased in almost all clinical settings. Notably, while MRI screening programs had been established for narrowly defined very high-risk populations, the expansion to women with dense breasts has been progressively advocated from 2019 onwards after the results of the DENSE and ECOG-ACRIN EA1141 trials. As a result, an increasing number of breast cancer patients have already undergone breast MRI before diagnosis and before surgical planning: even though these MRI examinations were not performed with preoperative intent, their results ultimately go on to impact treatment.

This was also observed in the Multicenter International Prospective Analysis (MIPA) study, which aimed to compare the mastectomy and reoperation rates between patients who did and did not undergo preoperative breast MRI according to usual practice in 27 centres worldwide. Other MRI indications than preoperative MRI ultimately accounted for more than 20% of patients who underwent MRI, who were excluded from the main analysis which was focused on the preoperative indication. In this 20% cohort, two subgroups could be identified: (i) women with higher-than-average breast cancer risk who had MRI as a screening examination; (ii) women who underwent MRI as a diagnostic examination, mainly for problem-solving purposes.

As the MIPA study enrolled patients from 2013 to 2018, a further increase of the percentage of patients who come to surgical planning with screening or diagnostic MRI beyond the aforementioned 20% is easily foreseeable or — most likely — already occurring, but the effects of MRI in these subgroups on the choice between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy remain to be ascertained.

Therefore, this report from the MIPA study will address mastectomy rates and reoperation rates in women who underwent breast MRI for screening and diagnostic purposes, using multivariable analysis for investigating the role of MRI referral/nonreferral and other covariates in driving surgical outcomes.

### Advancing preoperative staging in early breast cancer: a comparative analysis of imaging modalities [^117Hyjzt]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Accurate preoperative staging is essential for guiding surgical planning and optimizing outcomes in early-stage breast cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the gold standard but is often limited by cost and availability. This study aimed to prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of full-field digital mammography (FFDM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), and MRI for tumor detection and size estimation in patients eligible for upfront surgery.

Materials and Methods

This single-center, prospective study included 46 women with histologically confirmed early-stage invasive breast cancer. All patients underwent FFDM, DBT, CEM, and MRI within one week prior to surgery. Histopathology served as the reference standard. Tumor size measurements were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficients (r), with concordance defined as a size difference within ± 10 mm. Detection rates, size accuracy, and ability to identify multifocal lesions were evaluated.

Results

The mean patient age was 55.4 years. FFDM identified the primary tumor in 89.1% of cases, DBT in 97.8%, and both CEM and MRI in 100%. Tumor size correlation with pathology was highest for MRI (r = 0.811), followed by CEM (r = 0.660), DBT (r = 0.636), and FFDM (r = 0.314). Concordance with pathology was 80.4% for MRI, 71.7% for CEM and DBT, and 58.7% for FFDM. Multifocal disease was detected in 15.2% of cases by MRI, 8.7% by DBT, and 6.5% by CEM.

Conclusion

CEM and DBT showed strong diagnostic performance and may serve as accessible and cost-effective alternatives to MRI for preoperative staging in early-stage breast cancer. These modalities offer valuable imaging options in settings where MRI is limited or contraindicated.

### Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging use and oncologic outcomes in premenopausal breast cancer patients [^1137ZyHe]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The potential benefit of preoperative breast MRI for evaluation of disease extent in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients can be assessed at two levels: short-term surgical outcomes (appropriate modification of surgical plans and reduced positive margin rates) and long-term outcomes — does MRI guidance of the surgical plan improve local control? The short-term endpoint has been addressed in other studies, with mixed results. In the present study, we have addressed the second, arguably more meaningful outcome, namely locoregional recurrence risk specifically in younger women. The relevance of a local control outcome to MRI utilization is widely acknowledged in the prior literature, where the use of this diagnostic test has been analyzed with regard to cancer recurrence outcomes, both locoregional and distant. The results of these are summarized in Table 5; they show, almost uniformly, no improvement in locoregional control when surgical resection is informed by MRI evaluation of disease extent.

### High cancer yield and positive predictive value: outcomes at a center routinely using preoperative breast MRI for staging [^113ZTXaD]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study is to report the outcomes at a center that routinely uses breast MRI for preoperative staging, regardless of lesion histology or patient characteristics.

Materials and Methods

Five hundred ninety-two patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer who underwent staging with preoperative breast MRI between January 1, 2003, and April 30, 2007, were reviewed. Five hundred seventy patients comprised the analysis set. Patient age, breast density, index tumor histology, receptor status (ER, PR, and HER2), and lymph node status were recorded. Biopsy rates, positive predictive values (PPVs) of biopsy, and overall cancer yield were calculated and compared using the chi-square test across patient age, mammographic breast density, index tumor type, receptor status, and lymph node status.

Results

Biopsy was recommended and performed for 152 of 570 (27%) patients found to have one or more suspicious lesions on MRI distinct from the index cancer. Sixty-seven of 152 women who underwent biopsy had additional cancers diagnosed, for a PPV of 44%. Overall, 12% (67/570) of women had otherwise occult cancers diagnosed by MRI, with 8% having additional sites or greater extent of ipsilateral disease and 4% having unsuspected contralateral cancer detected by MRI alone. No significant differences were found in the probability of detecting an occult cancer on the basis of patient age, breast density, index tumor characteristics, or lymph node status.

Conclusion

Breast MRI detects otherwise occult cancer with an overall added cancer yield of 12% and a high PPV of 44% when applied to a diverse population of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

### Breast ultrasound: recommendations for information to women and referring physicians by the European society of breast imaging [^114rBTBo]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Loco-regional staging

In women with a suspected breast cancer, detected with US or with other modalities, the whole breast harbouring the suspicious lesion, the ipsilateral axilla, and the contralateral breast can be examined with US. In fact, US has proven to be very valuable for assessing the size of invasive cancers, detecting other cancer foci in the affected breast, and identifying cancers in the contralateral breast. Occult ipsilateral or contralateral cancers are more frequently found with US if the known cancer is palpable or larger than 2 cm, especially in the context of dense breasts.

However, the most accurate method for detecting additional ipsilateral and contralateral cancers in women with a newly diagnosed breast cancer is breast MRI, even though its routine preoperative use is still controversial. At any rate, the additional findings of MRI can be considered for changing therapy planning only if they are pathologically verified to be malignant through a percutaneous biopsy. If an additional lesion seen on MRI is also visible on targeted (so-called second look, as mentioned above) US, the biopsy should be performed under US guidance. If an additional lesion cannot be identified at targeted second-look US, the radiologist, together with a multidisciplinary team, will decide the next step, such as an MRI-guided biopsy or follow-up.

When an invasive cancer is newly diagnosed, the status of axillary lymph nodes is important for treatment planning, in particular for decision making about axillary treatment (i.e. surgical removal or radiation therapy of axillary lymph-nodes), and prognosis. Lymph nodes suspected of harbouring metastases can be revealed by US also in the absence of palpable axillary findings. In that case, US-guided percutaneous sampling concludes the diagnostic work-up, using fine needle aspiration or larger core needles.

### Breast MR imaging for extent of disease assessment in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer [^112ZUPqg]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer staging and surgical planning are affected by the burden of pathologically proven cancer detected on clinical examination and/or imaging. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has superior sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of invasive and in situ breast cancer as compared with physical examination, mammography, and ultrasound but can be limited in specificity. The use of preoperative breast MR imaging for evaluating the extent of disease remains controversial at present because studies have not definitively shown it to improve overall survival, decrease re-excision rates, or to decrease the cost of care.

### Meta-analysis of the effect of preoperative breast MRI on the surgical management of ductal carcinoma in situ [^1168bMHA]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

MRI has been used increasingly in the diagnosis and management of women with invasive breast cancer. However, its usefulness in the preoperative assessment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) remains questionable. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effects of MRI on surgical treatment of DCIS by analysing studies comparing preoperative MRI with conventional preoperative assessment.

Methods

Using random-effects modelling, the proportion of women with various outcomes in the MRI versus no-MRI groups was estimated, and the odds ratio (OR) and adjusted OR (adjusted for study-level median age) for each model were calculated.

Results

Nine eligible studies were identified that included 1077 women with DCIS who had preoperative MRI and 2175 who did not. MRI significantly increased the odds of having initial mastectomy (OR 1.72, P = 0.012; adjusted OR 1.76, P = 0.010). There were no significant differences in the proportion of women with positive margins following breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in the MRI and no-MRI groups (OR 0.80, P = 0.059; adjusted OR 1.10, P = 0.716), nor in the necessity of reoperation for positive margins after BCS (OR 1.06, P = 0.759; adjusted OR 1.04, P = 0.844). Overall mastectomy rates did not differ significantly according to whether or not MRI was performed (OR 1.23, P = 0.340; adjusted OR 0.97, P = 0.881).

Conclusion

Preoperative MRI in women with DCIS is not associated with improvement in surgical outcomes.

### Review of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in breast cancer: should MRI be performed on all women with newly diagnosed, early stage breast cancer? [^111RMbVR]. CA (2009). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials have shown equivalent survival for women with early stage breast cancer who are treated with breast-conservation therapy (local excision and radiotherapy) or mastectomy. Decades of experience have demonstrated that breast-conservation therapy provides excellent local control based on defined standards of care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been introduced in preoperative staging of the affected breast in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer because it detects additional foci of cancer that are occult on conventional imaging. The median incremental (additional) detection for MRI has been estimated as 16% in meta-analysis. In the absence of consensus on the role of preoperative MRI, we review data on its detection capability and its impact on treatment. We outline that the assumptions behind the adoption of MRI, namely that it will improve surgical planning and will lead to a reduction in re-excision surgery and in local recurrences, have not been substantiated by trials. Evidence consistently shows that MRI changes surgical management, usually from breast conservation to more radical surgery; however, there is no evidence that it improves surgical care or prognosis. Emerging data indicate that MRI does not reduce re-excision rates and that it causes false positives in terms of detection and unnecessary surgery; overall there is little high-quality evidence at present to support the routine use of preoperative MRI. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the clinical, psychosocial, and long-term effects of MRI and to show a related change in treatment from standard care in women newly affected by breast cancer.

### Screening and diagnostic breast MRI: how do they impact surgical treatment? Insights from the MIPA study [^117MJrdo]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To report mastectomy and reoperation rates in women who had breast MRI for screening (S-MRI subgroup) or diagnostic (D-MRI subgroup) purposes, using multivariable analysis for investigating the role of MRI referral/nonreferral and other covariates in driving surgical outcomes.

Methods

The MIPA observational study enrolled women aged 18–80 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer destined to have surgery as the primary treatment, in 27 centres worldwide. Mastectomy and reoperation rates were compared using non-parametric tests and multivariable analysis.

Results

A total of 5828 patients entered analysis, 2763 (47.4%) did not undergo MRI (noMRI subgroup) and 3065 underwent MRI (52.6%); of the latter, 2441/3065 (79.7%) underwent MRI with preoperative intent (P-MRI subgroup), 510/3065 (16.6%) D-MRI, and 114/3065 S-MRI (3.7%). The reoperation rate was 10.5% for S-MRI, 8.2% for D-MRI, and 8.5% for P-MRI, while it was 11.7% for noMRI (p ≤ 0.023 for comparisons with D-MRI and P-MRI). The overall mastectomy rate (first-line mastectomy plus conversions from conserving surgery to mastectomy) was 39.5% for S-MRI, 36.2% for P-MRI, 24.1% for D-MRI, and 18.0% for noMRI. At multivariable analysis, using noMRI as reference, the odds ratios for overall mastectomy were 2.4 (p < 0.001) for S-MRI, 1.0 (p = 0.957) for D-MRI, and 1.9 (p < 0.001) for P-MRI.

Conclusions

Patients from the D-MRI subgroup had the lowest overall mastectomy rate (24.1%) among MRI subgroups and the lowest reoperation rate (8.2%) together with P-MRI (8.5%). This analysis offers an insight into how the initial indication for MRI affects the subsequent surgical treatment of breast cancer.

Key Points

- Of 3065 breast MRI examinations, 79.7% were performed with preoperative intent (P-MRI), 16.6% were diagnostic (D-MRI), and 3.7% were screening (S-MRI) examinations.

- The D-MRI subgroup had the lowest mastectomy rate (24.1%) among MRI subgroups and the lowest reoperation rate (8.2%) together with P-MRI (8.5%).

- The S-MRI subgroup had the highest mastectomy rate (39.5%) which aligns with higher-than-average risk in this subgroup, with a reoperation rate (10.5%) not significantly different to that of all other subgroups.

### Preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ: a systematic review for the European commission initiative on breast cancer (ECIBC) [^116yVJvC]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of preoperative MRI in the management of Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

Methods

We searched the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) or cohort studies assessing the impact of preoperative breast MRI in surgical outcomes, treatment change or loco-regional recurrence. We provided pooled estimates for odds ratios (OR), relative risks (RR) and proportions and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Results

We included 3 RCTs and 23 observational cohorts, corresponding to 20,415 patients. For initial breast-conserving surgery (BCS), the RCTs showed that MRI may result in little to no difference (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.00) (low certainty); observational studies showed that MRI may have no difference in the odds of re-operation after BCS (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.61) (low certainty); and uncertain evidence from RCTs suggests little to no difference with respect to total mastectomy rate (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.27) (very low certainty). We also found that MRI may change the initial treatment plans in 17% (95% CI 12 to 24%) of cases, but with little to no effect on locoregional recurrence (aHR = 1.18; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.76) (very low certainty).

Conclusion

We found evidence of low to very low certainty which may suggest there is no improvement of surgical outcomes with pre-operative MRI assessment of women with DCIS lesions. There is a need for large rigorously conducted RCTs to evaluate the role of preoperative MRI in this population.

Key Points

- Evidence of low to very low certainty may suggest there is no improvement in surgical outcomes with pre-operative MRI.

- There is a need for large rigorously conducted RCTs evaluating the role of preoperative MRI to improve treatment planning for DCIS.

### Advanced imaging modalities in early stage breast cancer: preoperative use in the United States Medicare population [^114EC9EH]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for breast cancer staging exist, but adherence remains unknown. This study evaluates patterns of imaging in early stage breast cancer usually reserved for advanced disease.

Methods

Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims from 1992–2005 were reviewed for stage I/II breast cancer patients. Claims were searched for preoperative performance of computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), bone scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ("advanced imaging").

Results

There were 67,874 stage I/II breast cancer patients; 18.8% (n = 12,740) had preoperative advanced imaging. The proportion of patients having CT scans, PET scans, and brain MRI increased from 5.7% to 12.4% (P < 0.0001), 0.8% to 3.4% (P < 0.0001) and 0.2% to 1.1% (P = 0.008), respectively, from 1992 to 2005. Bone scans declined from 20.1% to 10.7% (P < 0.0001). "Breast cancer" (174.x) was the only diagnosis code associated with 62.1% of PET scans, 37.7% of bone scans, 24.2% of CT, and 5.1% of brain MRI. One or more symptoms or metastatic site was suggested for 19.6% of bone scans, 13.0% of CT, 13.0% of PET, and 6.2% of brain MRI. Factors associated (P < 0.05) with use of all modalities were urban setting, breast MRI and ultrasound. Breast MRI was the strongest predictor (P < 0.0001) of bone scan (odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44–1.86), Brain MRI (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.15–2.63), CT (OR 2.42, 95% CI 2.12–2.76), and PET (OR 5.71, 95% CI 4.52–7.22).

Conclusions

Aside from bone scans, performance of advanced imaging is increasing in early stage Medicare breast cancer patients, with limited rationale provided by coded diagnoses. In light of existing guidelines and increasing scrutiny about health care costs, greater reinforcement of current indications is warranted.

### The influence of breast density on preoperative MRI findings and outcome in patients with a known diagnosis of breast cancer [^114yu78E]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The role of breast density as an indication for preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for surgical planning in women with breast cancer is unknown.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2007 to 2011 who underwent preoperative MRI. We obtained clinical and pathological data and grouped patients by mammographic breast density, with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density A and B considered low density, and C and D considered high density. We analyzed local recurrence rates by breast density.

Results

Among 683 patients, 66.6% had high breast density. We noted MRI abnormalities in the ipsilateral breast in 41.8% high-density and 30.7% low-density breasts, while contralateral abnormalities were noted in 24.9% high-density and 13.8% low-density breasts. Biopsy was recommended for MRI findings in a similar number of patients regardless of density cohort. While more abnormalities were found in high-density breasts, the rate of additional cancer found was not significantly different (ipsilateral: 32 vs. 23%; contralateral: 6.2 vs. 3.2%) for high-and low-density patients, respectively (both p > 0.15). With a median follow-up of 89 months, and similar rates of adjuvant systemic and radiation therapy, no difference in local recurrence rates existed when stratified according to density classification (p > 0.53).

Conclusion

While more abnormalities were identified on MRI in dense breasts, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of cancers identified or in recurrence rates. These findings question the routine use of preoperative breast MRI in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer based solely on breast density.

### Breast cancer: pre-and postoperative imaging for staging [^113vQJZe]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Mammography is considered the "gold standard" in the evaluation of the breast from an imaging perspective. Multiple studies have demonstrated the benefit of mammography in detecting smaller cancers, leading to identification of early-stage breast cancers, which largely accounts for decreased mortality from breast cancer and the increased rate of breast conservation. Identification of a suspicious lesion on a mammogram prompts further evaluation including additional mammographic views, ultrasound examination, and biopsy. Recently, MRI and positron emission tomography are being offered as adjuncts to the preoperative workup to better stage the patient; however, there is still controversy over the most appropriate use of these modalities.

### Role of MR imaging for the locoregional staging of breast cancer [^1135hBMd]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Breast MR imaging has been shown to identify unsuspected sites of cancer in the ipsilateral breast in 16% of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Breast MR imaging identifies occult cancer in the contralateral breast in 3% to 5% of women. Early evidence suggests that the added value of MR imaging for staging may be attenuated in women who also undergo tomosynthesis, particularly those with nondense breasts. Breast MR imaging is complementary to ultrasound imaging in evaluating regional nodal basins. Ongoing prospective randomized clinical trials should clarify the impact of preoperative breast MR imaging on clinical outcomes.

### The influence of preoperative MRI on breast cancer treatment [^115zux6v]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used for breast cancer treatment planning. The aim of this study was to evaluate rates of mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in patients who undergo preoperative MRI.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients who underwent surgical treatment of breast cancer at a single center between 2002 and 2009. Exclusion criteria included stage IV disease, previous breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and positive BRCA status. Univariate and multivariate analysis evaluated differences in patient demographics, surgical management, and tumor characteristics among women who underwent mastectomy compared to BCS.

Results

Patients who underwent MRI were more likely to have mastectomy than those without MRI (43 vs. 28%; P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that younger age, larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, infiltrating lobular carcinoma, and preoperative MRI were independent predictors for mastectomy (P < 0.05). MRI detected occult contralateral breast cancer in 2.7% of patients. Among patients treated with BCS, preoperative MRI was not significantly associated with lower reexcision rates (MRI, 14%; no MRI, 18%; P = 0.34).

Conclusions

Preoperative MRI was associated with higher rates of mastectomy and detection of occult contralateral breast cancer, but was not associated with lower reexcision rates.

### Role of magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating the extent of disease [^114qFD6T]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Preoperative breast imaging evaluation can contribute useful clinical information to the management of the patient with known breast cancer. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used as part of this imaging evaluation, and the ability of breast MRI to detect otherwise occult multifocal and multicentric disease has been demonstrated in multiple studies. The use of MRI for breast cancer staging remains under debate, however. This article reviews some of the current discussion regarding the use of breast MRI in this patient population. It is important to note that this discussion occurs in an evolving context of surgical and breast conservation therapies.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in the preoperative assessment of patients with primary breast cancer: systematic review of diagnostic accuracy and meta-analysis [^111hLUHS]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting additional lesions and contralateral cancer not identified using conventional imaging in primary breast cancer.

Methods

We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to estimate diagnostic accuracy indices and the impact of MRI on surgical management.

Results

Fifty articles were included (n = 10,811 women). MRI detected additional disease in 20% of women and in the contralateral breast in 5.5%. The summary PPV of ipsilateral additional disease was 67% (95% CI 59–74%). For contralateral breast, the PPV was 37% (95% CI 27–47%). For ipsilateral lesions, MRI devices ≥ 1.5 Tesla (T) had higher PPV (75%, 95% CI 64–83%) than MRI with < 1.5 T (59%, 95% CI 53–71%). Similar results were found for contralateral cancer, PPV 40% (95% CI 29–53%) and 19% (95% CI 8–39%) for high- and low-field equipments, respectively. True positive MRI findings prompted conversion from wide local excision (WLE) to more extensive surgery in 12.8% of women while in 6.3% this conversion was inappropriate.

Conclusions

MRI shows high diagnostic accuracy, but MRI findings should be pathologically verified because of the high FP rate. Future research on this emerging technology should focus on patient outcome as the primary end-point.

Disease-free survival (inferred from locoregional recurrence)

One study reported a subgroup of 135 patients with DCIS, over a follow-up of 10 years, and found no differences in disease-free survival between the use or not of breast MRI (4% vs 4%, p value = 0.25). Another study reported similar results at 8 years of follow-up for the rate of any local failure among 136 patients (6% vs 6%, p value = 0.58). Lamb et al reported similar rates of second BC events whether MRI was used or not (12.8% versus 11.5%, p = 0.68).

The largest study, which included 2212 patients with a median follow-up of 4.9 years, showed, in an adjusted multivariate analysis (i.e. age, margin status, number of excisions), that MRI may increase the risk of local recurrence (aHR = 1.18; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.76) (very low certainty).

MRI triggered treatment change

Eight cohorts and the intervention arm of one RCT informed this outcome. Our pooled estimation showed that 17% (95% CI 12 to 24%) of the initial surgical decisions may change to a more extensive resection or mastectomy when breast MRI is used (low certainty) (Supplementary Figure 2). There was important heterogeneity, with the five studies with a larger sample size reporting between 9 and 18% and those with a smaller sample size reporting much higher proportions (39% to 50%).

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis

One RCT and 11 observational studies reported the age of participants which was similar across studies. We were not able to perform subgroup analysis on the extent of microcalcifications as most studies did not provide detailed data, but we included a post hoc analysis comparing those studies that reported the proportion of patients with microcalcification lesions with those that did not.

As described above (see "Re-operation rate (after undergoing BCS)"), we found different estimates among observational studies reporting adjusted versus crude estimates for re-operations but with overlapping confidence intervals (test for subgroup differences p value = 0.499). Other subgroup analyses, including publication year, did not show meaningful results (Supplementary table S4).

### Preoperative breast MRI for early-stage breast cancer: effect on surgical and long-term outcomes [^116tBK5n]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of preoperative breast MRI on surgical and long-term outcomes among women with early-stage breast cancer undergoing breast conservation therapy.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review yielded the cases of 174 women with stage 0, I, or II breast cancer who underwent preoperative MRI between 2000 and 2004. A control group of 174 patients who did not undergo preoperative MRI before breast conservation therapy was matched by age, histopathologic finding, stage, and surgeon. Features compared included breast density, presence of mammographically occult disease, margin status, lymph node involvement, lymphovascular invasion, extensive intraductal component, hormone receptor status, and use of adjuvant therapy. Outcomes, including rates of reexcision, ipsilateral recurrence, and disease-free survival, were compared by Kaplan-Meier methods and the log-rank test.

Results

Patients referred for preoperative breast MRI were more likely to have extremely dense breasts (28% vs 6%, p < 0.0001) and mammographically occult cancer (24% vs 9%, p = 0.0003). The two groups had identical rates of final negative margins, lymph node involvement, lymphovascular invasion, extensive intraductal component status, positive hormone receptor results, and systemic adjuvant therapy. Fewer patients in the preoperative MRI group needed reexcision (29% vs 45%, p = 0.02). The median follow-up period after treatment was 8 years. There was no significant difference in locoregional recurrence (p = 0.33) or disease-free survival (p = 0.73) rates between the two groups.

Conclusion

Reexcision rates among patients with early breast cancer undergoing conservation therapy were lower among women who underwent preoperative breast MRI. There was no statistically significant effect of the use of preoperative MRI on rates of locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival.

### Role of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the surgical management of early-stage breast cancer [^114qguZT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the role of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) on time to surgery and rates of reoperation and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) using a population-based study of New Jersey breast cancer patients.

Methods

The study included 289 African-American and 320 white women who participated in the Breast Cancer Treatment Disparity Study and underwent breast surgery for newly diagnosed early-stage breast cancer between 2005 and 2010. Patients were identified through rapid case ascertainment by the New Jersey State Cancer Registry. Association between pMRI and time to surgery was examined by using linear regression and, with reoperation and CPM, by using binomial regression.

Results

Half (49.9%) of the study population received pMRI, with higher use for whites compared with African-Americans (62.5 vs. 37.5%). After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with pMRI versus those without experienced significantly longer time to initial surgery [geometric mean = 38.7 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) 34.8–43.0; vs. 26.5 days; 95% CI 24.3–29.0], a significantly higher rate of CPM [relative risk (RR) = 1.82; 95% CI 1.06–3.12], and a nonsignificantly lower rate of reoperation (RR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.54–1.08).

Conclusions

Preoperative MRI was associated with significantly increased time to surgery and a higher rate of CPM, but it did not affect the rate of reoperation. Physicians and patients should consider these findings when making surgical decisions on the basis of pMRI findings.

### Magnetic resonance imaging for screening, diagnosis, and eligibility for breast-conserving surgery: promises and pitfalls [^111y2FSC]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to visualize small tumor deposits that previously could only be identified on pathologic examination. MRI is most valuable in areas in which patient management has been problematic, including screening women with known or suspected BRCA 1 and 2 mutations, and identification of the primary tumor site in patients presenting with axillary adenopathy. The role of MRI in the patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer remains controversial. Success rates for patients selected for breast-conserving therapy without MRI are high, and rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence are low. Future efforts to improve the local therapy for breast cancer must acknowledge the heterogeneity of the disease and tailor approaches to the biology of individual subsets. This goal can only be accomplished through a multidisciplinary approach that examines the applications of newer diagnostic modalities such as MRI.

Indications for breast MRI

Inconclusive findings in conventional imaging

Patients referred by their general practitioner or through a nationwide screening program to secondary care are told that there is a chance that they might have breast cancer. In this situation imaging, with or without biopsy, should exclude the presence of a malignancy sufficiently. The sensitivity of breast MRI for the detection of cancer is the greatest of all imaging techniques, and when the findings of conventional imaging are inconclusive (i.e. BI-RADS 0), MRI can be used as a problem-solving modality. In general, a negative breast MRI excludes malignancy. Only in case of mammographic microcalcifications, MRI is unable to exclude cancer sufficiently, and the decision to perform biopsy should be based on mammographic findings in this specific situation.

Preoperative staging

Breast tumors may be solitary, well-circumscribed masses that are well recognized at mammography and/or sonography. However, tumor size may be underestimated severely by mammography and ultrasound, especially in tumors larger than 2 cm. Tumor size of invasive carcinomas on MRI correspond in general well to pathologic sizes. Unfortunately, MRI has a tendency to overestimate the size of pure DCIS lesions. Furthermore, in about 25% of the cases, the tumor is multifocal; in other words, there are more invasive tumors in one quadrant. Moreover, multicentricity, which means one or more invasive foci more than 4 cm from the primary tumor, is present in about 20% of all invasive malignancies. Inadequate size estimation or failure to detect additional foci of disease may thus result in positive resection margins after surgery or early recurrent disease.

The sensitivity of breast MRI is, in the setting of preoperative evaluation, close to 100%. MRI is the most reliable imaging technique to measure the tumor size, and it detects additional foci of the tumor in the ipsilateral breast in 10–30% of patients. Also the presence of an intraductal component (EIC+) can be better evaluated by MRI than with mammography. On MRI this may be seen as an area of contrast enhancement with a dendritic configuration close to the primary tumor. However, approximately 20% of the additional foci detected by MRI are benign. Consequently, before large adjustments to the surgical management are effectuated, histological analysis of MR-detected additional foci should be performed.

Several studies have shown a change in surgical management in about 20% to 30% of all patients undergoing preoperative MRI. Changes were greatest in patients with tumor size greater than 4 cm, lobular carcinoma or breast density 4.

### Effects of preoperative breast MRI on surgical management in women aged 40 years and younger with breast cancer… [^114f22c4]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e13656 Background: Evaluating the use of preoperative breast MRI on the management of breast cancer can help guide surgical decision making for young female patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: A retrospective chart review of the George Washington University database between January 2015 and December 2020 identified 125 women age 40 or younger diagnosed with breast cancer. Of the 125 women, 23 were excluded from the study as they were lost to follow up due to care transfers. The management impact of pre-operative MRI was examined and variables collected include age, race, family history, genetic predisposition, breast density, method of detection, initial imaging findings, initial biopsy results, preoperative MRI findings, additional biopsies, additional biopsy results, and surgery type. Results: Patient ages ranged from 22 to 40, 69 had a family history of breast cancer, 81 had dense breasts, and 82 had the cancer detected due to clinical symptoms with the remaining during surveillance due to high risk. Of all women included, 55 had additional findings on MRI warranting biopsy of which 25 were biopsy proven cancer. 39 patients had lumpectomy and 59 had mastectomy. 1 patient did not undergo surgery due to widespread metastasis. The use of preoperative MRI identified additional carcinoma in 25 out of 102 patients. 24 in the ipsilateral breast, and 1 in the contralateral breast. Conclusions: Overall, this data indicates that the use of preoperative MRI for the treatment of breast cancer in young patients increases the detection of occult breast cancer prior to definitive therapy in 24. 5% of patients, critically important information for optimal management.

We recommend that all young women with newly diagnosed breast cancer undergo pre-operative MRI to further optimize patient care.

### ASO author reflections: impact of preoperative MRI on patients with screen-detected invasive breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery [^114xoMjg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Past

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is a standard surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer. The primary goal of BCS is to obtain complete tumor excision because positive resection margins are found to be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. If tumor excision is incomplete, re-excision or mastectomy may be necessary, which can result in increased physical and emotional burden for the patient as well as extra health care costs. Preoperative assessment to determine the extent of breast cancer is crucial for complete tumor excision. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for the preoperative evaluation of tumor extent, and findings have shown this method to be better than mammography or ultrasonography for evaluating tumor size and delineating tumor margins. The high sensitivity of breast MRI for cancer detection is presumed to improve surgical planning and decrease the rates of a positive resection margin at the first BCS attempt. However, most studies investigating the impact of preoperative MRI on surgical margin status have included patients with clinically detected breast cancer, and data on the value of preoperative breast MRI in screen-detected breast cancer are lacking. Cancers detected during screening usually are non-palpable and smaller than clinically detected breast cancers. The exact localization of these screen-detected cancers is thus very important to the achievement of complete tumor excision.

### Preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging and contralateral breast cancer occurrence among older women with breast cancer [^113qgShq]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects occult contralateral breast cancers (CBCs) in women with breast cancer, but the impact of detection on long-term CBC events is unclear. We examined whether MRI use decreases the occurrence of CBCs and the detection of stages II to IV disease among women who develop a CBC.

Patients and Methods

Analyzing the SEER-Medicare database, we assessed overall, synchronous (< 6 months after primary cancer diagnosis), and subsequent (ie, metachronous) stage-specific CBC occurrences in women who were diagnosed with stages I and II breast cancer during 2004–2009 and who were observed through 2011.

Results

Among 38,971 women with breast cancer, 6,377 (16.4%) received preoperative MRI. After propensity score matching, and compared with women who did not undergo MRI, preoperative MRI use was significantly associated with a higher synchronous CBC detection rate (126.4 v 42.9 per 1,000 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio, 2.85; P < .001) but a lower subsequent CBC detection rate (3.3 v 4.5 per 1,000 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.68; p = 0.002). However, the 5-year cumulative incidence of CBC remained significantly higher among women undergoing MRI compared with those not undergoing MRI (7.2% v 4.0%, respectively; P < .001). The analyses of projected CBC events for 10,000 patients who receive MRI indicated that, after a 5-year follow-up, MRI use would detect an additional 192 in situ CBCs (95% CI, 125 to 279) and 120 stage I CBCs (95% CI, 62 to 193) but would not have a significant impact on stages II to IV CBC occurrences (∼ 6; 95% CI, -21 to 47).

Conclusion

An increased synchronous CBC detection rate, attributable to MRI, was not offset by a decrease of subsequent CBC occurrence among older women with early-stage breast cancer, suggesting that preoperative MRI in women with breast cancer may lead to overdiagnosis.

### A multi-institutional analysis of factors influencing the rate of positive MRI biopsy among women with early-stage breast cancer [^116Q7eFK]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) is increasing, but its utility in detecting additional malignancy is unclear and delays surgical management (Jatoi and Benson in Future Oncol 9:347–353, 2013. https://doi.org/10.2217/fon.12.186, Bleicher et al. J Am Coll Surg 209:180–187, 2009. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2009.04.010, Borowsky et al. J Surg Res 280:114–122, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2022.06.066). The present study sought to identify ESBC patients most likely to benefit from preoperative MRI by assessing the positive predictive values (PPVs) of ipsilateral and contralateral biopsies.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study included patients with cTis-T2N0-N1 breast cancer from two institutions during 2016–2021. A "positive" biopsy result was defined as additional cancer (Positive Cancer) or cancer with histology often excised (Positive Surg). The PPV of MRI biopsies was calculated with respect to age, family history, breast density, and histology. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression determined whether combinations of age younger than 50 years, dense breasts, family history, and pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) histology led to higher biopsy yield.

Results

Of the included patients, 447 received preoperative MRI and 131 underwent 149 MRI-guided biopsies (96 ipsilateral, 53 contralateral [18 bilateral]). Positive Cancer for ipsilateral biopsy was 54.2%, and Positive Cancer for contralateral biopsy was 17.0%. Positive Surg for ipsilateral biopsy was 62.5%, and Positive Surg for contralateral biopsy was 24.5%. Among the contralateral MRI biopsies, patients younger than 50 years were less likely to have Positive Surg (odds ratio, 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.00–0.84; p = 0.041). The combinations of age, density, family history, and histology did not lead to a higher biopsy yield.

Conclusion

Historically accepted factors for recommending preoperative MRI did not appear to confer a higher MRI biopsy yield. To prevent delays to surgical management, MRI should be carefully selected for individual patients most likely to benefit from additional imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of invasive breast cancer [^115x5CAE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

As the proportion of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer increases, the role of imaging for staging and surveillance purposes should be determined based on evidence-based guidelines. It is important to understand the indications for extent of disease evaluation and staging, as unnecessary imaging can delay care and even result in adverse outcomes. In asymptomatic patients that received treatment for curative intent, there is no role for imaging to screen for distant recurrence. Routine surveillance with an annual 2-D mammogram and/or tomosynthesis is recommended to detect an in-breast recurrence or a new primary breast cancer in women with a history of breast cancer, and MRI is increasingly used as an additional screening tool in this population, especially in women with dense breasts. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^1169z7eG]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Invasive Breast Cancer — imaging and nodal procedure footnotes state that at the time of biopsy of the most suspicious axillary lymph node(s), a marker should be placed to allow for identification and removal at the time of definitive surgery. FDG-PET/CT is most beneficial and accurate for advanced disease (stage III) and invasive ductal histology, but may be useful in selected circumstances of earlier stage disease (stage IIA disease: cT1cN1, cT2N0) such as equivocal CT+ bone scan results, suspicion of undetected nodal and/or distant disease, and treatment response assessment; an FDG-PET/CT may be utilized as an adjunct to, or in lieu of, initial standard staging and may be performed simultaneously with diagnostic CT, and a bone scan or sodium fluoride PET/CT may not be needed if an upfront FDG-PET/CT clearly indicates consistent findings on both PET and CT components. If considering preoperative therapy, consider use of a gene expression assay during workup for postmenopausal patients with cN0, operable ER-positive, HER2-negative disease, and breast MRI may be useful for characterizing extent and/or internal mammary nodal disease. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Should we screen oncotype DX eligible patients with breast MRI? [^112vu1A5]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Oncotype DX is a genomic test used to predict chemotherapy benefit and recurrence risk in early stage breast cancer patients. A previous study has shown that in patients with multiple tumors sent for Oncotype DX analysis, differing results between the tumors were yielded that ultimately changed chemotherapy management in 27% of cases. The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of preoperative MRI in Oncotype DX eligible patients.

Methods

A retrospective, Institutional review board approved study identified 888 consecutive new breast cancer patients from 2012 to 2016 at a single institution and identified 541 patients who potentially would be eligible for Oncotype DX. Frequency of additional disease in this population group was recorded. The method of imaging used, either conventional imaging (mammography and ultrasound) or additional MRI, was evaluated.

Results

Of 541 patients, 360 patients had conventional imaging performed only and 181 patients had an additional breast MRI. Of 541 patients, 73 patients (13.5%) had additional biopsy proven multifocal, multicentric, or contralateral tumors identified. The total number of additional disease within the conventional imaging group was 39 of 360 patients (10.8%), vs 34 of 181 patients (18.8%) in the MRI group, which was statistically significant (P = 0.02). Total 34 of 73 patients (46.6%) had additional disease only detected by MRI.

Conclusions

In patients who may be eligible for Oncotype DX evaluation, 13.5% of patients were found to have additional disease. Nearly half of the patients had additional disease only detected by MRI, indicating the potentially utility of preoperative MRI in this patient population.

### Practical considerations for the use of breast MRI for breast cancer evaluation in the preoperative setting [^111iH5CX]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Preoperative contrast-enhanced (CE) breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains controversial in the newly diagnosed breast cancer patient. Additional lesions are frequently discovered in these patients with CE breast MRI. As staging and treatment planning evolve to include more information on tumor biology and aggression, so should our consideration of extent of disease. Directing CE breast MRI to those patients most likely to have additional disease may be beneficial. We sought to develop practical guidance for the use of preoperative CE breast MRI in the newly diagnosed breast cancer patient based on recent scientific data. Our review suggests several populations for whom preoperative breast MRI is most likely to find additional disease beyond that seen on conventional imaging. These can be viewed in three categories: (1) tumor biology-patients with invasive lobular carcinoma or aggressive tumors such as triple negative breast cancer (estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative) and HER2 positive tumors; (2) patient characteristics-dense breast tissue or younger age, especially those age < 60; and (3) clinical scenarios-patients with more sonographic disease than expected or those who are node positive at initial diagnosis. Focusing breast MRI on patients with any of the aforementioned characteristics may help utilize preoperative breast MRI where it is likely to have the most impact.

### No effect of pretreatment breast MRI on the timing of surgical treatment of newly diagnosed breast cancer [^1177a64Q]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although breast MRI has been shown to be more sensitive in the diagnosis of breast cancer than conventional mammography, one criticism breast MRI has faced in the preoperative treatment planning is that it can delay treatment.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed of all women diagnosed and treated for breast cancer over three consecutive years at an American university hospital. The subjects were divided into two groups: those who received preoperative breast MRI and those who did not. There were 189 patients included in this study, of whom 109 (57.67%) received pretreatment breast MRI.

Results

Median time to treatment was not significantly different between pretreatment MRI and no pretreatment MRI groups (32 days versus 34.5 days, P = 0.950). Adjusting for age, detection method, stage, and histology type did not change this conclusion.

Conclusions

At this institution, preoperative breast MRI for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer seemed to have no significant effect on the timing of surgical treatment in cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer.

### Outcomes after surgery for early stage breast cancer in women staged with preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging according to breast tissue density [^114LVeMR]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine surgical outcomes and breast cancer disease-free survival outcomes of women with early stage breast cancer with and without use of preoperative breast MRI according to breast tissue density.

Methods

Women with early stage breast cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 were classified into 2 groups: 1) those with dense and heterogeneously dense breasts (DB); 2) those with nondense breasts (NDB) (scattered fibroglandular and fatty replaced tissue). The 2 groups were reviewed to determine who underwent preoperative MRI. Breast tissue density was determined with mammography according to ACR BI-RADS. Patients were compared according to tumor size, grade, stage, and treatment. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.

Results

In total, 261 patients with mean follow-up of 85 months (25–133) were included: 156 DB and 105 NDB. Disease-free survival outcomes were better in the DB group in patients with MRI than in those without MRI: patients with MRI had significantly fewer local recurrences (P < 0.016) and metachronous contralateral breast cancers (P < 0.001), but this was not the case in the NDB group. Mastectomies were higher in the DB group with preoperative MRI than in those without MRI (P < 0.01), as it was in the NDB group (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Preoperative breast MRI was associated with reduced local recurrence and metachronous contralateral cancers in the DB group, but not in the NDB group; however, the DB patients with MRI had higher mastectomy rates.

### Utilization of breast MRI and breast MRI-guided biopsy in clinical practice: results of a survey in Québec and France [^1149FbGi]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Indications for performing preoperative breast MRI are still debatable with a recent tendency to decrease preoperative staging breast MRI exams, particularly in the absence of high-level evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating benefits of breast MRI in terms of survival. Despite a lack of consensus as noted by several authors, criteria employed to recommend preoperative breast MRI exams were consistent both within and also between both countries. Unsurprisingly, in both countries, the three most frequently cited variables considered for breast MRI in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were pathologic features, age, and breast density. Of particular note, the surgeon's opinion was also an important consideration in Québec, much more so than in France. Although this factor has not been extensively evaluated in recent studies, it emphasizes the role of breast surgeons in the era of multidisciplinary approach, which is in agreement with Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines. Indeed, EBM integrates the best external evidence with individual clinical expertise and the patients' choices. The role of the surgeon in patient selection for preoperative breast MRI has been recently evaluated by Lee et al. who noted that the decision to perform a preoperative breast MRI is multifactorial and takes into account many patient and tumor-related variables, all of which are weighed at the surgeons' "discretion". This significant difference between France and Québec could be explained by their different approach in breast cancer diagnosis, since French breast radiologists have a more extensive and involved role in providing results to patients and performing a preoperative workup before referring the patient to the surgeon. In Québec, on the other hand, particularly in specialized "breast centers", patients are usually directly referred to the surgeons during the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, potentially explaining why the surgeon's opinion is weighed more heavily. The latter could also partly be related to Quebec's longer waiting times regarding breast MRI and therefore need to make a clinical decision before performing this examination.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of preoperative MRI in in-breast tumor recurrence after breast-conserving surgery [^117Gw64j]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unknown whether the identification of additional tumors in the breast using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) results in a lower risk of in-breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS).

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies were performed. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Results

From 768 citations, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The 20 studies consisted of 14 retrospective reviews, 3 matched cohorts, and 3 randomized controlled trials. Whereas 2 studies reported a statistically significant lower rate of IBTR with pMRI, 18 studies showed no difference, and no studies reported a higher rate. Of the 18 studies showing no significant difference, 12 demonstrated a trend toward a lower IBTR rate in the pMRI group. The criteria for meta-analysis were met by 16 studies. A meta-analysis of 11 studies that reported hazard ratios (HR) for IBTR showed a trend toward a lower rate of IBTR for patients who received preoperative MRI (hazard ratio (HR), 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74–1.05). A meta-analysis of five studies that reported event rates and had similar follow-up duration for both groups demonstrated a lower relative risk (RR) of IBTR (RR, 0.45; 95% CI 0.25–0.81).

Conclusions

Although some evidence supports the hypothesis that identification of additional tumors in the breast using pMRI results in lower rates of IBTR after BCS, the main meta-analysis in this study did not confirm this hypothesis.

### Preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging in women with local ductal carcinoma in situ to optimize surgical outcomes: results from the randomized phase III trial IRCIS [^11129nUh]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the addition of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to standard radiologic evaluation on the re-intervention rate in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergoing breast-conserving surgery.

Patients and Methods

Women with biopsy-proven DCIS corresponding to a unifocal microcalcification cluster or a mass less than 30 mm were randomly assigned to undergo MRI or standard evaluation. The primary end point was the re-intervention rate for positive or close margins (< 2 mm) in the 6 months after randomization (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01112254).

Results

A total of 360 patients from 10 hospitals in France were included in the study. Of the 352 analyzable patients, 178 were randomly assigned to the MRI arm, and 174 were assigned to the control arm. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 82 of 345 patients with the assessable end point were reoperated for positive or close margins within 6 months, resulting in a re-intervention rate of 20% (35 of 173) in the MRI arm and 27% (47 of 172) in the control arm. The absolute difference of 7% (95% CI, -2% to 16%) corresponded to a relative reduction of 26% (stratified odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.1; p = 0.13). When considering only the per-protocol population with an assessable end point, the difference was 9% (stratified odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.0; p = 0.05). Total mastectomy rates were 18% (31 of 176) in the MRI arm and 17% (30 of 173) in the control arm (stratified P = 0.93). For 100 lesions seen on MRI, nonmass-like enhancement was more predominant (82%) than mass enhancement (20%). Nevertheless, no specific morphologic and kinetic parameters for DCIS were identified.

Conclusion

The study did not show sufficient surgical improvement with the use of preoperative MRI to be clinically relevant in DCIS staging. However, this could be reconsidered with the improvement of new MRI sequences and new modalities in magnetic resonance techniques.

### Preoperative breast MRI: current evidence and patient selection [^117SMPqt]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for the assessment of newly diagnosed breast cancer extent and can detect additional mammographically and clinically occult breast cancers in the ipsilateral and contralateral breasts. Nonetheless, appropriate use of breast MRI in the setting of newly diagnosed breast cancer remains debated. Though highly sensitive, MRI is less specific and may result in false positives and overestimation of disease when MRI findings are not biopsied prior to surgical excision. Furthermore, improved anatomic depiction of breast cancer on MRI has not consistently translated to improved clinical outcomes, such as lower rates of re-excision or breast cancer recurrence, though there is a paucity of well-designed studies examining these issues. In addition, current treatment paradigms have been developed in the absence of this more accurate depiction of disease span, which likely has limited the value of MRI. These issues have led to inconsistent and variable utilization of preoperative MRI across practice settings and providers. In this review, we discuss the history of breast MRI and its current use and recommendations with a focus on the preoperative setting. We review the evidence surrounding the use of preoperative MRI in the evaluation of breast malignancies and discuss the data on breast MRI in the setting of specific patient factors often used to determine breast MRI eligibility, such as age, index tumor phenotype, and breast density. Finally, we review the impact of breast MRI on surgical outcomes (re-excision and mastectomy rates) and long-term breast recurrence and survival outcomes.

### Avoiding preoperative breast MRI when conventional imaging is sufficient to stage patients eligible for breast conserving therapy [^1136E4Ay]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine when preoperative breast MRI will not be more informative than available breast imaging and can be omitted in patients eligible for breast conserving therapy (BCT).

Methods

We performed an MRI in 685 consecutive patients with 692 invasive breast tumors and eligible for BCT based on conventional imaging and clinical examination. We explored associations between patient, tumor, and conventional imaging characteristics and similarity with MRI findings. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was employed to compute the area under the curve (AUC).

Results

MRI and conventional breast imaging were similar in 585 of the 692 tumors (85%). At univariate analysis, age (p < 0.001), negative preoperative lymph node status (p = 0.011), comparable tumor diameter at mammography and at ultrasound (p = 0.001), negative HER2 status (p = 0.044), and absence of invasive lobular cancer (p = 0.005) were significantly associated with this similarity. At multivariate analysis, these factors, except HER2 status, retained significant associations. The AUC was 0.68.

Conclusions

It is feasible to identify a subgroup of patients prior to preoperative breast MRI, who will most likely show similar results on conventional imaging as on MRI. These findings enable formulation of a practical consensus guideline to determine in which patients a preoperative breast MRI can be omitted.

### Screening and diagnostic breast MRI: how do they impact surgical treatment? Insights from the MIPA study [^111VAzWo]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Details on the design and methods of the MIPA study have been previously reported and are summarised here. The MIPA study observationally enrolled women aged 18–80 years with newly diagnosed breast cancer at core-needle or vacuum-assisted biopsy (CNB/VAB), without indications for neoadjuvant therapy and amenable to upfront surgery. Following routine practice of each centre, the diagnostic pathway included a variable combination of the following: conventional imaging, i.e. mammography and/or breast ultrasonography; stereotactic, ultrasound- or MRI-guided CNB/VAB; bilateral contrast-enhanced MRI; and eventual further CNB/VAB sampling of additional lesions detected by preoperative MRI. Data from all these steps were recorded alongside data from surgical planning stages (multidisciplinary team meetings or direct interview with clinicians) and from surgical pathology.

Patient subgroups

Purpose and timing of MRI referral were recorded and classified as "screening", "diagnostic", or "preoperative", specific purposes behind MRI referral in the first two subgroups being detailed in Table 1. Notably, screening and diagnostic MRI had to be performed before CNB/VAB. This work extends the per-protocol and patient-based analysis of surgical endpoints (detailed below), already performed for patients who did not undergo MRI (noMRI subgroup) and patients who underwent MRI with a preoperative purpose (P-MRI subgroup), to patients from the screening (S-MRI) and diagnostic (D-MRI) subgroups.

Table 1
Referral purposes among the S-MRI and D-MRI subgroups

MRI, magnetic resonance imaging

Evaluation of surgical planning and outcomes was recorded at four different timepoints: (1) surgical planning according to findings from conventional imaging only; (2) surgical planning according to findings from conventional imaging and MRI; (3) actual surgery performed; (4) surgical outcome and immediate/short-term reoperation for close or positive margins. While data from all four timepoints were available for the P-MRI subgroup, timepoint 1 was not available for the S-MRI and D-MRI, as MRI was embedded in the diagnostic process and no surgical treatment was planned before the patient underwent MRI. Therefore, while analyses on timepoints 3 and 4 were conducted as planned, timepoints 1 and 2 were collapsed into a single timepoint, i.e. "surgical planning after imaging", considering surgical planning after MRI for the S-MRI, D-MRI, and P-MRI subgroups and surgical planning after conventional imaging for the noMRI subgroup.

### Does preoperative MRI reduce positive margins after breast-conserving surgery? [^115h6izs]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is a mainstay for breast cancer management, and obtaining negative margins is critical. Some have advocated for the use of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in reducing positive margins after BCS. We sought to determine whether preoperative MRI was associated with reduced positive margins.

Patients and Methods

The SHAVE/SHAVE2 trials were multicenter trials in ten US centers with patients with stage 0–3 breast cancer undergoing BCS. Use of preoperative MRI was at the discretion of the surgeon. We evaluated whether or not preoperative MRI was associated with margin status prior to randomization regarding resection of cavity with shave margins.

Results

A total of 631 patients participated. Median age was 64 (range 29–94) years, with a median tumor size of 1.3 cm (range 0.1–9.3 cm). Patient factors included 26.1% of patients (165) had palpable tumors, and 6.5% (41) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Tumor factors were notable for invasive lobular histology in 7.0% (44) and extensive intraductal component (EIC) in 32.8% (207). A preoperative MRI was performed in 193 (30.6%) patients. Those who underwent preoperative MRI were less likely to have a positive margin (31.1% versus 38.8%), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.073). On multivariate analysis, controlling for patient and tumor factors, utilization of preoperative MRI was not a significant factor in predicting margin status (p = 0.110). Rather, age (p = 0.032) and tumor size (p = 0.040) were the only factors associated with margin status.

Conclusion

These data suggest that preoperative MRI is not associated margin status; rather, patient age and tumor size are the associated factors.

### Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging use and oncologic outcomes in premenopausal breast cancer patients [^1154DPu4]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A key aspect of local therapy of breast cancer is the complete resection of the breast tumor, with pathologically tumor-free margins. Imaging of the breast is a necessary component of the initial evaluation of the extent of disease in the breast and enables assessment of the feasibility of breast-conserving resection; i.e. imaging selects out women who are not candidates for breast conservation based on the extent of in-breast disease. The notion that more sensitive imaging will lead to better selection of surgical therapy to enable more complete surgical excision, and therefore improved local control is implicit in the care devoted to preoperative "extent of disease" evaluation. Currently, the most sensitive imaging modality for delineating the tumor extent is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) –, yet its role in the preoperative evaluation of tumor extent remains controversial. In multiple studies, the expected benefits of lower re-excision rates and improved short and long-term cancer outcomes have failed to materialize –, while the odds of receiving therapeutic mastectomy and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy are increased. In particular, a meta-analysis of four studies (three retrospective and one prospective) does not show a clear benefit from preoperative breast MRI. However, the published retrospective studies are of varying size, and most report few recurrence events. Furthermore, there are differences in the follow-up time between the MRI and no-MRI groups in these studies, since women diagnosed later in the study period received MRI more frequently. The available literature also suggests a propensity for more frequent MRI use in younger women. which is likely driven by their greater breast density, their higher local recurrence risk, and the higher likelihood of genetic susceptibility. Thus, if MRI-based planning of surgical resection were to reduce cancer recurrence risk, it would be more likely to do so in younger women, but no study so far has specifically examined the effect of young age on cancer outcomes with and without MRI use.

### Society of Surgical Oncology breast disease site working group statement on contralateral mastectomy: indications, outcomes, and risks [^116hQ2HT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Imaging considerations before CM — screening intervals, limited MRI role, and performance characteristics. Patients with newly diagnosed UBC should undergo contralateral mammography within 6–12 months of diagnosis and 6–12 months thereafter, and there is no screening role for MRI before CM. MRI identifies mammographically occult contralateral malignancies in 2.9–5.0% of patients; in one study, adding MRI to conventional imaging increased contralateral breast cancer (CBC) detection to 2.9% vs. 1.1% (n = 735 vs. n = 733). For detecting CBC, MRI has a positive predictive value of 47–49% and a negative predictive value of 97–99%. MRI use has been associated with a more than twofold increase in CM; although sensitivity is high (89–100%), specificity is low (65–86%), leading to biopsies, with 13–20% of UBC patients undergoing contralateral biopsy from preoperative MRI and only one-quarter revealing cancer, and biopsy delayed treatment by almost 2 weeks.

### Breast-conserving surgery / partial mastectomy [^112yN8X5]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) — prerequisites and preoperative evaluation include a histological diagnosis of cancer, preferably by needle biopsy, adequate imaging, complete medical history and physical examination, and a fully informed discussion of options; imaging should always include bilateral mammography, ultrasound is appropriate when mammography sensitivity is reduced by breast density and/or younger age, and MRI is not mandatory but may be useful when size and extent are incompletely characterized; most candidates for breast-conserving therapy (BCT) have stage I-II disease and a metastatic workup is not required; nonpalpable lesions should be localized preoperatively by guidewire, radioactive seed, or intraoperative ultrasound when appropriate.

### PROMRIINE (PRe-operatory magnetic resonance imaging is INEffective) study: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of magnetic resonance imaging on surgical decisions and clinical outcomes in women with breast cancer [^114pscLv]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is the standard treatment for early stage breast cancer (BC), and no ink on the tumor is considered as clear marginsfor invasive BC. Therefore, preoperative evaluation is essential once multifocality and multicentricity are well-known characteristics of BC. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not only a morphological examination, but also a functional technique that provides a higher detection rate of additional lesions than mammography and breast ultrasound.MRI is typically used for BC staging. However, according to a meta-analysis study, the incremental cancer detection rate was only 4.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7–6]; its false-positive rates are still considered high, leading to unnecessary biopsies and eventually surgical procedures that result in benign pathological results. –

Currently, BC specialists recommend that MRI may be useful for some groups of patients with BC, such as those with: (1) invasive lobular carcinoma;, (2) aggressive types of BC, such as triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumors;(3) dense breast tissue or younger age, especially age < 50 years; and (4) those who plan to undergo neoadjuvant treatment. MRI is also used for BC screening, especially in patients with BRCA- mutated BC – and those with BC with metastatic lymph node disease with occult primary; however, it is not yet considered a standard of care – for preoperative purposes.

In this context, in 2023, a newly published randomized trial composed a list of evidence that assessed the impact of MRI in planning BC surgeries. The trial conducted by the research group included surgical management, local and systemic recurrences, and survival as important outcomes. Therefore, considering the current evidence, a new systematic review with meta-analyses is required to assess whether a new trial can change previous estimates.

To summarize, we hypothesized that women exposed to MRI might have detrimental outcomes due to a higher risk of extensive surgeries, lower quality of life, and no proven clinical benefits such as survival, disease-free survival, and other cancer-related outcomes. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of MRI as a preoperative tool in women with BC.

### Impact of preoperative breast MRI on surgical decision making and clinical outcomes: a systematic review [^114qsuD1]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in the workup of breast cancer patients and could lead to changes in surgical management. It is unclear how the information gained from MRI studies affects surgical decision making and influences clinical outcomes. These issues are addressed in this review.

Methods

PubMed database searches were performed to retrieve and analyze respective original research and review articles on preoperative MRI in the evaluation of breast cancer patients.

Results

Preoperative MRI is a highly sensitive but nonspecific method that leads to changes in surgical management with increased numbers of more extended surgical interventions. It appears that a relatively large proportion of MRI-driven changes in surgical management result in overtreatment without conclusively proven beneficial effects on such clinical outcomes as decrease in reoperation rates or improved patient survival.

Conclusions

Thus, routine use of supplementary preoperative breast MRI should be discouraged until compelling evidence of its effectiveness is available.

### Surgical considerations in early-stage breast cancer: lessons learned and future directions [^111M6S1W]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Emerging evidence regarding the relationship between local failure and outcome in breast cancer has placed increased emphasis on the surgeon's role in reducing local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery. This includes both improving patient selection and optimizing the procedure. Proper patient selection, selective use of magnetic resonance imaging, and better patient-physician communication including the use of decision aids can optimize both local control and patient satisfaction without unnecessarily increasing the mastectomy rate. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy can increase both the number of patients eligible for breast-conservation surgery as well as the likelihood of success. Adequate surgical margins are crucial and can be achieved without excessive re-excision rates with detailed preoperative planning, consideration of oncoplastic resections. and intraoperative margin analysis. This article reviews several areas in which the surgeon can help ensure the success of breast-conservation therapy.

Guidelines on the Use of Imaging for Breast Surgery

Guidelines for breast surgery are fairly consistent, with broad support for the importance of mammography and ultrasound to guide BC surgery. There are conflicting views and recommendations regarding appropriate use of MRI in the preoperative setting, - although MRI has been consistently shown to offer the highest diagnostic accuracy for staging the affected breast and for identifying CBC. This paradox is best explained by the fact that published results on the impact of MRI on surgical outcome (reoperation rates) are conflicting; several retrospective studies demonstrated an association of use of pre-operative MRI with an increased mastectomy rate. -

The COMICE (Comparative Effectiveness of MRI in Breast Cancer) trial — the first randomized study to investigate reoperation rates with versus without MRI — was conducted from 2001–2007 on 1,623 women recruited in 45 different sites throughout the United Kingdom. It did not find reduced reoperation rates in the MRI group. However, at the time the study was done, none of the sites had access to magnetic resonance (MR)–guided biopsy or MR-guided localization/bracketing — methods that today are prerequisites to obtain American College of Radiology accreditation for performing breast MRI. Predictably, if one adds a more sensitive diagnostic test, there will be additional findings. If one then lacks the methods required to nonoperatively obtain histologic verification of these additional findings, one will need additional surgery to confirm or refute the additional diagnoses, which will lead to more, not fewer, surgical procedures. Moreover, without tools for MR-guided lesion localization/bracketing, it is difficult, if not impossible, to translate the MRI information into the operating room, ie, to actually use the information for improved definition of resection margins (Fig 3). The second randomized trial on the use of MRI for treatment planning, the PreOperative MRI of the Breast (POMB) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), enrolled 440 women recruited in three breast centers in Sweden, had these tools available. It did find a significantly reduced reoperation rate which was 5% (11/220) in the MRI-group, versus 15% (33/220) in the no-MRI group (P < 0.00), with equal numbers of mastectomies in both groups. A third randomized trial, the IRCIS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), enrolled 360 patients with biopsy-proven DCIS, recruited in 10 different hospitals in France from 2010–2014 — unfortunately, again, without tools for MR-guided bracketing. Still, a mild reduction of reoperation rates was observed in the MRI arm by 7 percentage points, corresponding to a relative reduction by 26%.

Assessment after neoadjuvant systemic therapy — imaging and examination: The accurate assessment of in-breast tumor or regional lymph node response to preoperative systemic therapy is difficult, and should include physical examination and performance of imaging studies that were abnormal at initial staging; MRI is more accurate than mammography for assessing tumor response to preoperative therapy.

### Obtaining adequate surgical margins in breast-conserving therapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer: current modalities and future directions [^114F6HfG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive imaging technique, which is reported to be a substantial improvement in detecting multinodular disease and assessment of tumor spread compared with conventional techniques.MRI provides highly sensitive information on ductal carcinoma in situ. In a trial conducted in Belgium, MRI detected intraductal extent in 34 out of 50 (68%) patients who were reported to have an intraductal component, compared with 48.5% in mammography and 34.2% in ultrasound. Furthermore, MRI has an accurate capability to differentiate between malignant tissue and fibrosis, enabling assessment of breast tissue after irradiation or chemotherapy for the presence of recurrent disease.MRI is equally accurate in distinguishing malignancies in younger women with more extensive fibroglandular tissue. In a meta-analysis of 2,160 patients in 16 studies, Houssami et al. showed that MRI detects additional disease in 16% of patients with breast cancer, leading to conversion of local excision to mastectomy in 1.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3–3.6) and to otherwise extended surgery in 5.5% (95% CI, 3.1–9.5). The authors reported a relatively high false-positive ratio (true-positive to false-positive ratio of 1.91 (95% CI, 1.09–3.34)), for which further research on its clinical value is necessary. Nevertheless, MRI has been shown to have a profound clinical impact on selection of patients for BCT and is currently regarded as the preferred imaging modality for preoperative assessment and clinical decision making.

It should be emphasized that several studies have shown that MRI assessment before surgery fails to improve postoperative margin status and subsequent LR, even compared with conventional imaging modalities. The intraoperative limitation may be due to the limited provision of real-time margin assessment.

### Use of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging for breast cancer: a Canadian population-based study [^116jZF2Y]. JAMA Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Contrary to practice guidelines, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used in the preoperative evaluation of women with breast cancer. While existing literature has found little benefit to MRI in most patients, potential downstream consequences associated with breast MRI are not well described.

Objective

To describe patterns of preoperative breast MRI utilization in a health care system with universal insurance and its association with downstream investigations and clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative heath care databases in Ontario, Canada (2012 population, 13.5 million) over 14 geographic regions were evaluated within the data set. Participants comprised 53 015 patients with primary operable breast cancer treated from 2003 to 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Use of preoperative breast MRI by year, geographic region, and breast cancer stage. Postdiagnosis imaging, biopsy, and short-term surgical outcomes were also evaluated between those who did and did not receive MRI.

Results

Overall, 14.8% of patients (7824 of 53 015) had a preoperative MRI. During the 10-year study period, MRI use increased across all stages by 8-fold (from 3% to 24%; P < .001 for trend). Factors associated with MRI use were younger age, higher socioeconomic status, higher Charlson comorbidity score, surgery performed in a teaching hospital, and fewer years of surgeon experience. Multivariate analyses showed that preoperative breast MRI was associated with higher likelihood of the following: postdiagnosis breast imaging (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.92–2.28), postdiagnosis breast biopsies (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.57–1.93), postdiagnosis imaging to assess for distant metastatic disease (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42–1.61), mastectomy (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.62–1.85), contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.23–1.77), and a greater than 30-day wait to surgery (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 2.36–2.70) (all ORs are adjusted).

Conclusions and Relevance

Preoperative breast MRI use has increased substantially in routine clinical practice and is associated with a significant increase in ancillary investigations, wait time to surgery, mastectomies, and contralateral prophylactic mastectomies.

### Diagnostic breast magnetic resonance imaging and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy [^114uRQos]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative use of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in women with breast cancer may increase rates of mastectomy. This study investigated relationships between breast MRI and therapeutic and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) in women with breast cancer.

Methods

A total of 3606 women diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer from 1998 through 2000 (n = 1743; early period) or from 2003 through 2005 (n = 1863; late period) were retrospectively identified. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from our institution's tumor registry. MRI use in the diagnostic evaluation was obtained from a prospective radiology database. Rates of therapeutic mastectomy, CPM, and associations with breast MRI were compared between the two time periods by multiple logistic regressions controlling for disease stage, age, family history, and calendar year of diagnosis.

Results

A total of 14.2% of women underwent MRI, 29.0% had mastectomy, and 5.3% had CPM. Use of breast MRI increased substantially between the two time periods (4.1% to 23.7%, P < 0.001). Mastectomy rates increased from 28% to 30% (P > 0.05). The rate of CPM increased by > 50% from the early to late period (4.1% to 6.4%, P < 0.002). Women who underwent MRI were nearly twice as likely to have CPM (9.2 vs. 4.7%, P < 0.001). Multivariate models found MRI was associated with increased rates of CPM for women with stage I or II disease (odds ratio 2.04, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

MRI changes the surgical treatment of breast cancer among subsets of women diagnosed with breast cancer, suggesting there are hidden monetary and nonmonetary costs associated with its use.

### Association of preoperative MRI with breast cancer treatment and survival: a single institution observational study [^116ne4aY]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the association between preoperative breast MRI with surgery type, contralateral cancer, recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in women with early-stage breast cancer.

Materials and Methods

In this dual-affiliated single institution, retrospective study, we identified women with Stage I-III breast cancer diagnosed between 03/01/2013–03/31/2016 with available follow-up. Patient and tumor characteristics were recorded. Two cohorts were created based on the use of preoperative MRI(PMRI) versus no preoperative MRI(no-MRI) with Wilcoxon signed-rank and χ2 tests utilized for cross-group comparisons. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank and cox proportional hazards model analysis were used to compare RFS and OS in women with and without MRI.

Results

593 eligible patients were included [322(54.3%) with PMRI, 271(45.7%) no-MRI]. Mean patient age was younger (53.8 ± 11.8vs59.3 ± 12.6 years, p < 0.001) and dense breasts more common (51.6%vs22.5%, p < 0.001) in PMRI group. Seventeen bilateral cancers (5.3%) were in PMRI [14/17(82.4%) detected only on MRI] vs 10 (3.7%) in no-MRI (p = 0.34). Molecular subtype distribution(luminal A:27.2% vs 31.1%; luminal B:51.8%vs44.2%; HER2:5.4%vs4.2%; triple negative:15.6%vs20.5%, p = 0.28) were similar in PMRI vs no-MRI groups. PMRI group had higher rates of cT2–4(45.0%vs28.8%, p < 0.001), cN+(27.3% vs 18.1%, p < 0.01), and neoadjuvant therapy (NAC, 41.3% vs 18.8%, p < 0.001). Total mastectomy(57.8%vs51.3%, p = 0.12), margin positivity(6.2%vs7.4%, p = 0.63), recurrence(10.2%vs7.0%, p = 0.20) and death rates(8.1%vs7.7%, p = 0.88) were similar in PMRI vs no-MRI. Mastectomy rates remained comparable after adjusting for age and breast density (p = 0.28). At median follow-up of 70 months(IQR, 64–70), time to recurrence was [PMRI:30(IQR, 19–47)vs no-MRI:23(IQR, 9–31) months, p = 0.04]. Contralateral cancers were identified sooner and more frequently in the no-MRI group [4(2.1%)vs2(0.9%) cancers, p = 0.32, 21 ± 20vs48 ± 13 months, p = 0.27]. There was no significant difference in 5-year RFS[hazard ratio(HR) 1.05, 95%CI 0.67–1.67, p = 0.84] and OS[HR 0.94, 95%CI: 0.51–1.74, p = 0.85] between PMRI and no-MRI groups even after adjusting for age, cancer type, breast density, cN stage, and NAC. which were different between two groups (RFS, HR 0.87, 95%CI: 0.53–1.43, p = 0.57; OS, HR 0.78, 95%CI: 0.40–1.52, p = 0.46). NHW patients had higher RFS compared to Black patients in PMRI group (HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21–0.96, p = 0.04) in adjusted analysis.

Conclusions

Preoperative MRI utilization is not associated with improved surgical margin, 5-year RFS or OS in our cohort. This effect persisted after adjusting for patient age, tumor stage, cancer type, breast density and NAC. At post therapy surveillance, contralateral cancers are identified earlier and more frequently in the no-MRI group.

### Contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) versus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for staging of breast cancer: the pro CEM perspective [^113NJSz3]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, preoperative staging is required to assess disease extent, enabling us to decide on the most optimal treatment strategy. For locoregional staging, assessment of intramammary tumor extent and presence of axillary and perhaps also internal mammary lymph node metastases is required. Due to the similarity in the underlying principle, contrast-enhanced mammography is increasingly considered instead of breast MRI for this purpose. When considering the combination of CEM and US as a single appointment imaging strategy for preoperative staging of breast cancer, there is only limited room for an additional benefit of breast MRI. For tumor size measurements, equal performance of both CEM and MRI are observed. Sensitivity of both techniques for detecting breast cancer is comparable, meaning that both techniques are capable of detecting additional ipsilateral or contralateral tumor foci. However, specificity is in favor of CEM, meaning that there is a slightly lower chance of having false positive findings in preoperative staging of the breast. Axillary US can be performed during the same appointment as CEM, with equal performance and limitations as evaluation of the axilla on standard breast MRI examinations. Finally, there is no need to actively pursue the detection of IMLN metastases, meaning that additional MRI to do so is not required. This review provides a 'pro-CEM' perceptive on the arguments why breast MRI is hardly necessary when CEM in combination with US has been performed as a single appointment imaging strategy in breast cancer patients.

### Mastectomy [^1167hcQg]. ASBrS (2018). Medium credibility.

Mastectomy — prerequisites and preoperative planning include a histological diagnosis of cancer (preferably by needle biopsy), sufficient breast imaging to define the lesion extent, a complete medical history and physical examination, and a fully informed discussion of all surgical options with risks and benefits. This discussion should include mastectomy vs breast-conserving surgery (BCS), types of mastectomy (conventional, skin-sparing, nipple-sparing), reconstruction options (none, straight-to-implant, tissue expander, autologous tissue [latissimus, TRAM/DIEP]), timing (immediate, delayed), approach to the axilla (none, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)), and the role/timing of systemic therapy and radiation therapy (RT). Preoperative consultation should include, if appropriate, the plastic surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist, and emotional and psychologic support should be offered whenever necessary. Imaging should always include bilateral mammography, with ultrasound as appropriate for dense breasts and/or younger age; MRI is not mandatory, but may be useful to confirm the need for mastectomy, to monitor the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and to clear the contralateral breast; a metastatic workup is appropriate for patients with clinical stage III disease.

### Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging use and oncologic outcomes in premenopausal breast cancer patients [^11297L46]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

To clarify the potential benefit of preoperative breast MRI on the youngest women, we further evaluated cancer outcomes following preoperative MRI use among women aged 40 years or less in multivariable models. While 119 women were included in this analysis, their chance of receiving MRI was comparable (84 MRI vs. 44 no MRI, 1.9-fold) to the full cohort higher (330 MRI vs. 182 no MRI, 1.8-fold). There were no significant differences in age (36.2 vs. 35.6, p = 0.39), follow-up length, race distribution, tumor size, histology, grade, nodal or hormone receptor status, or systemic therapy between the MRI and no MRI group. When adjusted for important tumor and treatment parameters, we found no difference in the hazard of local (aHR = 1.82; 95% CI: 0.43–7.76; p = 0.42) or distant recurrence (aHR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.26–3.34; p = 0.91) in women who underwent preoperative MRI and those who did not, suggesting that women aged 40 years or less did not fare better with MRI-guided surgical treatment than their counterparts who were treated without MRI (Table 4b).

Future

The study results suggest that selective use of preoperative MRI for women with screen-detected invasive breast cancer promises to minimize the risk of positive resection margins after BCS. Future studies should focus on the prognostic impact of the study findings and investigate the cost-effectiveness of preoperative breast MRI for surgical planning.

### Role of breast MRI in the preoperative evaluation of patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer [^1118Nw4j]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to evaluate in a non-investigational setting the effect of preoperative breast MRI on the diagnosis of unsuspected additional malignant tumors and on surgical management choices.

Subjects and Methods

One hundred ninety-nine patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer who underwent preoperative bilateral breast MRI were enrolled. Data included additional imaging and biopsies performed, final surgical management, and pathologic correlation. To reduce bias due to patient preference and variable surgical approaches, ipsilateral malignant lesions found on breast MR images were retrospectively reviewed by a surgeon blinded to final surgical treatment.

Results

MRI detected additional suspicious previously unsuspected lesions in 74 patients (37%). Fifty-four of these lesions, in 38 patients (19%), were identified as malignant, of which 41 (76%) were invasive. Retrospective review of the MRI-identified ipsilateral malignant lesions resulted in hypothetical recommendations that would have altered the surgical treatment of 26 of the patients (13%), principally as mastectomy or wider excision.

Conclusion

For patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer, breast MRI in a mid-sized regional hospital depicts unsuspected malignant lesions in both the ipsilateral and contralateral breasts in proportions consistent with the results of earlier studies at larger institutions. Whether clinical outcome is improved by changes in surgical management consequent to MRI detection of unsuspected malignant lesions remains unproven.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaStage I breast cancer: initial workup and surveillance for local recurrence and distant metastases in asymptomatic women [^115x3CWr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Women and health care professionals generally prefer intensive follow-up after a diagnosis of breast cancer. However, there are no survival differences between women who obtain intensive surveillance with imaging and laboratory studies compared with women who only undergo testing because of the development of symptoms or findings on clinical examinations. American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines state that annual mammography is the only imaging examination that should be performed to detect a localized breast recurrence in asymptomatic patients; more imaging may be needed if the patient has locoregional symptoms (eg, palpable abnormality). Women with other risk factors that increase their lifetime risk for breast cancer may warrant evaluation with breast MRI. Furthermore, the quality of life is similar for women who undergo intensive surveillance compared with those who do not. There is little justification for imaging to detect or rule out metastasis in asymptomatic women with newly diagnosed stage I breast cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging use and oncologic outcomes in premenopausal breast cancer patients [^114f4cNZ]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delineates disease extent sensitively in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, but improved cancer outcomes are uncertain. Young women, for whom mammography is less sensitive, are expected to benefit from MRI-based resection. We identified 512 women aged ≤ 50 years, undergoing breast-conserving treatment (BCT: tumor-free resection margins and radiotherapy) during 2006–2013 through Northwestern Medicine database queries; 64.5% received preoperative MRI and 35.5% did not. Tumor and treatment parameters were similar between groups. We estimated the adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for local and distant recurrences (LR and DR), using multivariable regression models, accounting for important therapeutic and prognostic parameters. LR rate with MRI use was 7.9 vs. 8.2% without MRI, aHR = 1.03 (95% CI 0.53–1.99). DR rate was 6.4 vs. 6.6%, aHR = 0.89 (95% CI 0.43–1.84). In 119 women aged ≤ 40, results were similar to LR aHR = 1.82 (95% CI 0.43–7.76) and DR aHR = 0.93 (95% CI 0.26–3.34). Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. The use of preoperative MRI in women aged ≤ 50 years should be reconsidered until there is proof of benefit.

MRI for screening is supported in specific high-risk populations, namely, women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, a family history suggesting a hereditary breast cancer syndrome, or a history of chest wall radiation.

### Solving the preoperative breast MRI conundrum: design and protocol of the MIPA study [^115nXC3e]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite its high diagnostic performance, the use of breast MRI in the preoperative setting is controversial. It has the potential for personalized surgical management in breast cancer patients, but two of three randomized controlled trials did not show results in favor of its introduction for assessing the disease extent before surgery. Meta-analyses showed a higher mastectomy rate in women undergoing preoperative MRI compared to those who do not. Nevertheless, preoperative breast MRI is increasingly used and a survey from the American Society of Breast Surgeons showed that 41% of respondents ask for it in daily practice. In this context, a large-scale observational multicenter international prospective analysis (MIPA study) was proposed under the guidance of the European Network for the Assessment of Imaging in Medicine (EuroAIM). The aims were (1) to prospectively and systematically collect data on consecutive women with a newly diagnosed breast cancer, not candidates for neoadjuvant therapy, who are offered or not offered breast MRI before surgery according to local practice; (2) to compare these two groups in terms of surgical and clinical endpoints, adjusting for covariates. The underlying hypotheses are that MRI does not cause additional mastectomies compared to conventional imaging, while reducing the reoperation rate in all or in subgroups of patients. Ninety-six centers applied to a web-based call; 36 were initially selected based on volume and quality standards; 27 were active for enrollment. On November 2018, the target of 7000 enrolled patients was reached. The MIPA study is presently at the analytic phase. Key Points
- Breast MRI has a high diagnostic performance but its utility in the preoperative setting is controversial.
- A large-scale observational multicenter prospective study was launched to compare women receiving with those not receiving preoperative MRI.
- Twenty-seven centers enrolled more than 7000 patients. The study is presently at the analytic phase.

### The impact of preoperative breast MRI on surgical margin status in breast cancer patients recalled at biennial screening mammography: an observational cohort study [^115n4yg6]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the 1980s, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has gradually replaced mastectomy as the standard treatment for early breast cancer.BCS requires complete removal of the tumor, as positive resection margins have shown to be associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. In case of tumor-positive resection margins after BCS, a re-excision or mastectomy is performed. Reoperations are associated with physical and emotional burden for the patient, worse cosmetic results, and higher healthcare costs. Consequently, the re-excision rate is a national breast treatment quality indicator.

Preoperative assessment of the extent of disease is crucial for surgical planning. To assess tumor size and location, clinical examination, mammography, and ultrasound are usually performed. However, measurement of tumor size by clinical examination and conventional imaging correlates poorly with histopathologic tumor size. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be more accurate than mammography or ultrasound to evaluate tumor size, multifocality, and the presence of contralateral breast cancer.–As a result, breast MRI is increasingly being used in the preoperative evaluation of breast cancer.

Despite its increased use, the clinical value of preoperative breast MRI in patients with breast cancer undergoing BCS remains a topic of debate. The fact that breast MRI detects additional disease, not seen with conventional imaging, has created the impression that preoperative MRI improves surgical planning and the likelihood of complete tumor excision. However, meta-analyses have shown that preoperative MRI might lead to higher mastectomy rates without reducing re-excision rates after BCS. Since 2012, the use of preoperative MRI in The Netherlands has been advised in patients with invasive lobular breast cancer and in case of discrepancies between physical examination, mammography, and/or ultrasound.

Most studies on the potential benefits of preoperative MRI have included patients with clinically detected breast cancer. To our knowledge, data on the value of preoperative breast MRI in screen-detected cancer is lacking. Cancers detected in a screening program are usually non-palpable and smaller compared with clinically detected breast cancers. Exact localization of these screen-detected cancers is very important to be able to obtain clear resection margins. We used data from women who were recalled at biennial screening mammography in the south of The Netherlands to assess whether preoperative MRI reduces the risk of positive resection margins in patients with screen-detected breast cancer undergoing BCS. Second, we aimed to determine the factors associated with the risk of positive resection margins in patients with screen-detected breast cancer undergoing BCS.

### Preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ: a systematic review for the European commission initiative on breast cancer (ECIBC) [^114eKWfg]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Re-operation rate (after undergoing BCS)

Two RCTs suggested no difference in the risk of having a re-operation after an initial BCS (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.84), but the evidence was uncertain (very low certainty). The pooled estimate from 12 observational studies suggested a decrease in the risk of re-operation (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.04) (Fig. 3b).

Fig. 3
Meta-analyses of re-operation rate. a Randomised clinical trial; b cohort studies (prospective and retrospectives)

The observational studies providing adjusted estimates had an inconsistent effect (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.61) compared to studies with unadjusted estimates (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.99). Therefore, only those providing adjusted estimates were included in the evidence profile for observational studies (low certainty). One study reported the mean number of re-operations among those patients who received lumpectomy and showed no relevant differences (0.42 vs 0.58, p value = 0.31).

Total mastectomy

Two RCTs, including 429 patients, showed that MRI may result in little to no difference in total mastectomy surgeries (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.27), equivalent to 21 fewer total mastectomies (95% CI 82 fewer to 63 more) performed per 1000 patients assessed (very low certainty) (Table 2). Eight observational studies suggested that MRI may increase the odds of total mastectomies (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.48) (very low certainty) (Fig. 4b), with a larger but imprecise effect observed in studies providing adjusted results (aOR 1.74; 95% CI 0.53 to 5.68).

### Magnetic resonance imaging in the preoperative setting for breast cancer patients with undetected additional disease [^116gss2s]. European Journal of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The last few years have witnessed a significant increase in the preoperative use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for staging purposes in breast cancer (BC) patients. Many studies have confirmed the improvement that MRI can provide in terms of diagnostic assessment, especially with regard to additional disease foci. In the present study, we address the advantages and disadvantages of MRI in the preoperative setting for BC patients.

Patients and Methods

There were 1513 consecutive breast MRI studies performed in patients with either primary or recurrent BC, who were scheduled for surgery.

Results

Beyond the primary lesion, 10.4% of our cases had additional disease at the final histological assessment. MRI overall sensitivity, when considering tumour size and additional foci together, was 74.3%, and 80.3% when considering additional foci exclusively. MRI specificity for additional disease was 95.3%, positive predictive value was 77.4%, and negative predictive value was 94.6%. Nevertheless, 5% of cases had additional tumours that were missed by MRI or, conversely, had additional foci on MRI that were not confirmed by histology. Age (p = 0.020) and lobular carcinomas (p = 0.030) showed significance in the multivariate analysis by logistic regression, using the presence of additional foci diagnosed by MRI as a dependent variable.

Conclusion

Preoperative MRI seems to have a role in preoperative tumour staging for breast cancer patients, as it discloses additional disease foci in some patients, including contralateral involvement. However, given the lack of absolute accuracy, core-needle biopsy cannot be neglected in the diagnosis of such additional malignant foci, which could result in a change in surgical treatment.

### Breast MR imaging in newly diagnosed breast cancer [^1173Kku1]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The role of breast MR imaging in preoperative evaluation of disease extent remains controversial. MR imaging increases detection of mammographically occult ipsilateral and contralateral disease, but the clinical impact of these incidental cancers in unknown. There are no randomized trials of recurrence or mortality as the primary end point. This missing evidence is needed before the role of extent of disease MR imaging can be outlined. There are specific clinical scenarios in which breast MR imaging plays a clear role. In most cases, the decision to obtain MR imaging depends on physician practice style and patient preference.

### Magnetic resonance imaging before breast cancer surgery: results of an observational multicenter international prospective analysis (MIPA) [^116xf8TA]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer, the routine use of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery is a controversial topic, attracting extensive debate and little consensus. Proponents reasonably draw on the established evidence of MRI sensitivity to detect additional disease, allowing more tailored surgical planning. Opponents point out the lack of evidence on clinical benefit from preoperative MRI and raise concerns that it causes more mastectomies than needed. Guidelines are heterogenous, ranging from defined but limited indications to recommendations against.

The Multicenter International Prospective Analysis (MIPA) study was undertaken to provide new knowledge on this topic, building evidence on whether and to what extent MRI impacts surgical treatment in breast cancer practice.

### Indications for breast MRI in the patient with newly diagnosed breast cancer [^112yr8oN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

Use of breast MRI in the preoperative evaluation of patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer has increased significantly over the past 10 years because of its well-documented high sensitivity for detecting otherwise occult breast cancer in the affected and contralateral breasts. However, published research reports on the impact of this improved cancer detection are limited. Equally important are growing concerns that the quality of breast MRI may vary significantly across practice sites, and therefore the published value of MRI may not be achieved for many patients. This article describes the peer-reviewed, published clinical research trials evaluating breast MRI in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer on which the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) practice guidelines are based. The current NCCN guidelines recommend that breast MRI be considered for patients with a newly diagnosed breast cancer to evaluate the extent of ipsilateral disease and to screen the contralateral breast, particularly for women at increased risk for mammographically occult disease. In addition, the guidelines indicate that breast MRI may be used for patients with axillary nodal adenocarcinoma to identify the primary malignancy. The guidelines stress the importance of having proper equipment, imaging technique, and provider training necessary to achieve high-quality breast MRI, and emphasize that MRI practice sites should have the ability to perform MRI-guided biopsy or needle localization. In addition to describing the data regarding use of breast MRI in women with newly diagnosed cancer, this article provides recommendations for the performance of high-quality breast MRI and suggestions for future research.

### Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging in breast cancer: meta-analysis of surgical outcomes [^115MjXsn]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The role of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) is controversial. This meta-analysis examines the effect of preoperative MRI compared with standard preoperative assessment on surgical outcomes, focusing on studies that used a controlled design.

Methods

Using random-effects logistic meta-regression modeling, we estimated the proportion of women with each outcome in the MRI versus no-MRI groups, and calculated the odds ratio (OR) and adjusted OR (adjusted for study-level median age, and, where appropriate, for temporal effect) for each model.

Results

There were 9 eligible studies (2 randomized trials; 7 comparative cohorts). Outcomes in 3112 patients with BC (any histological tumor type) for MRI versus no-MRI (referent) were as follows: initial mastectomy 16.4% versus 8.1% [OR, 2.22 (P < 0.001); adjusted OR, 3.06 (P < 0.001)]; re-excision after initial breast conservation 11.6% versus 11.4% [OR, 1.02 (P = 0.87); adjusted OR, 0.95 (P = 0.71)]; overall mastectomy 25.5% versus 18.2% [OR, 1.54 (P < 0.001); adjusted OR, 1.51 (P < 0.001)]. In 766 patients with invasive lobular cancer (ILC), outcomes were as follows: initial mastectomy 31.1% versus 24.9% [OR, 1.36 (P = 0.056); adjusted OR, 2.12 (P = 0.008)]; re-excision after initial breast conservation 10.9% versus 18.0% [OR, 0.56 (P = 0.031); adjusted OR, 0.56 (P = 0.09)]; overall mastectomy 43.0% versus 40.2% [OR, 1.12 (P = 0.45); adjusted OR, 1.64 (P = 0.034)].

Conclusions

Our summary of the evidence showed that MRI significantly increased mastectomy rates and suggests an unfavorable harm-benefit ratio for routine use of preoperative MRI in BC. We found weak evidence that MRI reduced re-excision surgery in patients with ILC -although this was at the expense of increased mastectomies-and overall patient benefit from MRI in ILC is not clear from this study.

### Disparities in the use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging after breast cancer diagnosis [^111toKa7]. JCO Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after breast cancer diagnosis is increasingly used to improve locoregional staging, particularly among women with dense breasts, extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, and lobular histology. The goals of this study were to (1) assess whether use of preoperative MRI varies by race and insurance type; and (2) determine whether preoperative MRI is associated with downstream surgical management.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of women with stage 0-III breast cancer who were treated with surgical resection within our academic health system (2016–2019). Patients were categorized by race and insurance type. The primary outcome was receipt of preoperative MRI. Secondary outcomes included surgery extent (lumpectomy v mastectomy) and receipt of a second operation.

Results

A total of 1,410 women (27% Black, 73% White; 67% private insurance, 26% Medicare, 6% Medicaid) were included. Black patients were significantly less likely to undergo preoperative MRI than White patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.76]; P < .001). There was no association between insurance type and preoperative MRI (Medicare v private: OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.52 to 1.15]; p = 0.208; Medicaid v private: OR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.36 to 1.25]; p = 0.210). White patients who underwent preoperative MRI were less likely to undergo lumpectomy versus those who did not (OR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.76]; P < .001). Likelihood of re-excision was lower for Black women who had undergone MRI versus those who had not (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.20 to 0.93]; p = 0.031).

Conclusion

Black patients were less likely than White patients to undergo preoperative MRI, yet Black women who underwent MRI were less likely to require re-excision. Standardizing preoperative MRI use may mitigate provider- and system-level biases and promote more equitable care.

### Preoperative MRI of the breast (POMB) influences primary treatment in breast cancer: a prospective, randomized, multicenter study [^116YeQfg]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown high sensitivity in determining tumor extent, multifocality, and occult contralateral breast cancer. Low specificity, unnecessary mastectomies, and costs are arguments against MRI. The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative breast MRI would affect primary surgical management, reduce reexcision/reoperation procedures, and influence the choice of neoadjuvant treatment in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, multicenter study included 440 breast cancer patients younger than aged 56 years from three, Swedish, large-volume breast units. Patients were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to either preoperative staging with breast MRI (n = 220) or no breast MRI (n = 220) (control group). Treatment planning of all patients was discussed at multidisciplinary team conferences.

Results

In patients randomized to the MRI group, who had an observed higher percentage of planned breast-conserving surgery (BCS) compared with the control group, a change from suggested breast conservation to mastectomy occurred in 23 of 153 (15%) patients. Breast MRI provided additional information in 83 of 220 (38%) patients, which caused a change in treatment plan in 40 (18%). The breast reoperation rate was significantly lower in the MRI group: 11 of 220 (5%) versus 33 of 220 (15%) in the control group (p < 0.001). The number of mastectomies, axillary reoperations, and the number of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy after definitive treatment did not differ significantly between the groups.

Conclusions

Preoperative staging with breast MRI in women younger than age 56 years altered the treatment plan in 18% of the patients. Although a higher MRI-related conversion rate from breast conservation to mastectomy was found, the final numbers of mastectomies did not differ between the two groups. The breast reoperation rate in the MRI group was significantly reduced.

### Utility of magnetic resonance imaging in the management of breast cancer: evidence for improved preoperative staging… [^114xZDDy]. ASCO (1999). Low credibility.

Abstract PURPOSE: The staging and treatment for breast cancer are changing; there is an increase in the incidence of ductal carcinoma-in-situ, the use of fine-needle aspiration and stereotactic biopsy for diagnosis, and the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, there is a need for a tool to assess more precisely the extent of cancer in the breast before surgery. To better plan surgical and chemotherapeutic interventions, we evaluated high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging as such a tool. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with 58 cases of breast cancer were evaluated preoperatively with MRI using a technique called the triple-acquisition rapid gradient echo technique to maximize anatomic detail. Imaging results were compared with mammography and subsequent pathology results. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging correctly identified residual or primary cancer in 55 of 58 cases and accurately predicted the extent of the cancer in 54 of 58 cases.

The anatomic extent was more accurately defined with MRI compared with mammography. Magnetic resonance imaging added the greatest value in cases of multifocal disease. CONCLUSION: By applying MRI selectively to patients with a known diagnosis of cancer and focusing on defining the extent of malignant lesions, we were able to obtain clear and accurate anatomic information. Our results suggest that MRI could provide very valuable information for preoperative planning and single-stage resection in breast cancer. Based on preliminary data from our series, MRI would be valuable as a staging tool in the preoperative setting even if the cost is in the range of $1, 300 to $2, 000. It is already significantly less than the target cost, so it is reasonable to refine this technique for clinical use to help plan the most appropriate surgical intervention and possibly reduce costs as well. A careful prospective study is warranted to validate our findings.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^1124bAP3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN DCIS workup — For ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; Tis, N0, M0), evaluation includes history and physical exam, diagnostic bilateral mammogram, pathology review, determination of tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status, genetic counseling for patients at risk of hereditary breast cancer, and breast MRI as indicated. The use of MRI has not been shown to increase likelihood of negative margins or decrease conversion to mastectomy and data to support improved long-term outcomes are lacking. Surgical axillary staging should not be performed for preoperative (biopsy-determined) pure DCIS unless there is some clinical-pathologic suggestion of invasion or axillary metastasis. A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may be considered in the setting of mastectomy for DCIS, excision in an anatomic location compromising the performance of a future SLNB procedure, or oncoplastic breast conserving surgery.

### Preoperative MR imaging in patients with breast cancer: preoperative staging, effects on recurrence rates, and outcome analysis [^116Xrvmi]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

As well documented for other diseases (ie, lymphoma), an accurate pretherapeutic assessment of the extent of breast cancer is essential for planning the appropriate treatment to get the best long-term results, decrease recurrence rates, and increase patient survival. This article presents an overview of the effects of preoperative local staging with MR imaging in breast cancer patients.
