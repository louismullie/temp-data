## Question

In a newly diagnosed, high-risk essential thrombocythemia patient (WHO-defined) who prefers to avoid hydroxyurea, is anagrelide an evidence-based first-line option to prevent thrombotic complications?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether anagrelide is an evidence-based first-line option to prevent thrombotic complications in a newly diagnosed, high-risk essential thrombocythemia patient who prefers to avoid hydroxyurea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "high-risk" ET and the diagnostic framework. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend as first-line cytoreductive therapy. Next, I will examine head-to-head randomized trials comparing anagrelide versus hydroxyurea for thrombotic outcomes. After that, I need to check real-world and long-term safety data, including myelofibrosis transformation and bleeding. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit recommendation and outline practical alternatives if hydroxyurea is declined, including interferon and ropeginterferon, with attention to aspirin dosing and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the risk stratification and diagnostic context. High-risk ET is typically defined by age over 60 years with JAK2 mutation or a history of thrombosis at any age, and cytoreductive therapy is indicated in this setting to reduce thrombotic events, with low-dose aspirin added unless contraindicated [^d643b2af] [^246e06fa]. I should confirm that the patient meets WHO criteria for ET rather than prefibrotic myelofibrosis, because misclassification can confound interpretation of cytoreduction outcomes and fibrosis risk, and this distinction is emphasized in contemporary reviews and algorithms [^6e556fe1] [^0d37e69f].

> Next, I should review guideline positions before jumping to conclusions. NCCN lists hydroxyurea as the preferred first-line cytoreductive regimen, with peginterferon alfa-2a as another recommended option, and anagrelide as an additional recommended regimen, particularly relevant when hydroxyurea is deferred or contraindicated, which directly addresses the patient's preference scenario [^d643b2af] [^246e06fa]. European LeukemiaNet similarly recommends hydroxyurea or interferon as first-line, with anagrelide as a reasonable alternative in selected patients, aligning with a patient-centered approach when hydroxyurea is not acceptable [^b822f069] [^a6021128].

> Now, I will examine the pivotal randomized evidence. The UK-PT1 trial in 809 high-risk ET patients showed that hydroxyurea plus low-dose aspirin was superior to anagrelide plus low-dose aspirin for the composite of arterial or venous thrombosis, serious hemorrhage, or vascular death, driven by fewer arterial events and less serious bleeding with hydroxyurea, though anagrelide reduced venous thrombosis more, which is a nuanced trade-off [^8fd92e32] [^e4f77d97]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: the odds ratio for the composite endpoint favored hydroxyurea at 1.57, with significant increases in arterial thrombosis and serious hemorrhage on anagrelide, and more treatment withdrawals, which materially affects first-line choice in the absence of compelling reasons to prefer anagrelide [^8fd92e32].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial. The ANAHYDRET study, conducted in strictly WHO-defined ET, tested anagrelide versus hydroxyurea and met noninferiority for thrombohemorrhagic events at 6 months, with no significant differences in major arterial or venous thrombosis over longer follow-up, suggesting that in carefully selected WHO-ET patients, anagrelide can perform comparably for some outcomes, albeit with different toxicity profiles [^c49c9d2b] [^1e9b94b2]. I should double-check the limitations: this was a smaller study with fewer events and shorter follow-up than UK-PT1, and it did not demonstrate superiority of anagrelide, so it supports acceptability rather than preference for first-line use [^c49c9d2b].

> I need to check long-term safety signals, especially myelofibrosis transformation. Multiple analyses, including EXELS and subsequent publications, have associated anagrelide with higher rates of transformation to myelofibrosis compared with hydroxyurea, particularly in cohorts that included patients diagnosed by older PVSG criteria who may have harbored early prefibrotic myelofibrosis, whereas the signal appears attenuated in strictly WHO-defined ET, though it does not disappear entirely [^d2a7fd53] [^164ccfba] [^6e556fe1]. But wait, what if this is just confounding by indication or age? Even after multivariable adjustment, the excess MF risk with anagrelide persisted in several datasets, so I should counsel that this remains a credible concern requiring surveillance if anagrelide is chosen [^d2a7fd53] [^164ccfba].

> Let me consider bleeding risk and drug interactions. Anagrelide is associated with more serious hemorrhage than hydroxyurea in randomized data, and concomitant aspirin increases bleeding risk, with EXELS showing higher major hemorrhage rates on anagrelide, especially when combined with antiplatelet therapy, which is clinically relevant since high-risk ET patients are typically on aspirin [^8fd92e32] [^635f2d96]. I should confirm that we screen for acquired von Willebrand syndrome in extreme thrombocytosis and adjust aspirin accordingly, because that can further tilt the bleeding risk calculus in this setting [^246e06fa].

> Next, I should review alternatives when hydroxyurea is declined. Peginterferon alfa-2a is guideline-endorsed and particularly attractive in younger patients, those deferring hydroxyurea, or in pregnancy planning, with randomized data showing noninferior hematologic responses and acceptable thrombotic outcomes versus hydroxyurea in ET and PV cohorts, though head-to-head thrombosis data are limited and interferon-related toxicities require monitoring [^d643b2af] [^c181b8ff]. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b has now shown superiority to anagrelide for durable responses in hydroxyurea-intolerant or -resistant ET with leukocytosis, providing a modern interferon option with supportive phase 3 data, though this is second-line context and not first-line, it strengthens the interferon class as a reasonable alternative when hydroxyurea is not used [^e5d31cb1].

> I should confirm practical implementation details. If anagrelide is selected despite the above, I would start low, titrate to a platelet target generally less than 450–600 × 10⁹/L, monitor for palpitations, tachycardia, and fluid retention, and reassess bleeding risk with aspirin coadministration, while planning periodic bone marrow surveillance for fibrosis given the transformation signal, especially if baseline morphology was not definitive for pure ET [^d643b2af] [^246e06fa]. Hold on, I should verify aspirin strategy: given accelerated platelet turnover in ET, twice-daily aspirin may improve platelet inhibition in selected high-risk arterial scenarios, but this must be balanced against bleeding risk and is not universally required, so I would individualize and consider pharmacodynamic testing where available [^1348b16d] [^bde46531].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. No, anagrelide is not the preferred first-line evidence-based choice for high-risk ET when hydroxyurea can be used, because hydroxyurea has demonstrated superiority for preventing arterial events and serious bleeding in the largest randomized trial and remains the guideline-preferred agent, whereas anagrelide carries higher risks of arterial thrombosis, serious hemorrhage, and possibly myelofibrosis transformation, even though it may reduce venous thrombosis and can be noninferior in strictly WHO-defined ET cohorts [^8fd92e32] [^d643b2af] [^c49c9d2b]. That said, anagrelide is an acceptable alternative when hydroxyurea is declined or contraindicated, with counseling on risks, close monitoring, and consideration of interferon-based therapy, particularly peginterferon alfa-2a or ropeginterferon in appropriate patients, to optimize thrombotic risk reduction while minimizing toxicity [^d643b2af] [^e5d31cb1].

Anagrelide is **not the preferred first-line therapy** for high-risk essential thrombocythemia (ET) because hydroxyurea remains the standard of care [^d643b2af] [^b822f069]. However, anagrelide is a **reasonable alternative** when hydroxyurea is declined or not tolerated, supported by the ANAHYDRET trial showing non-inferiority to hydroxyurea for thrombotic events in WHO-defined ET [^c49c9d2b] [^1e9b94b2]. Anagrelide is **less effective for arterial thrombosis** and carries higher risks of bleeding and myelofibrosis transformation than hydroxyurea [^8fd92e32] [^242a7a48], so it should be used with caution and close monitoring. If hydroxyurea is declined, consider peginterferon alfa-2a or ropeginterferon alfa-2b as safer first-line alternatives [^d643b2af] [^e5d31cb1].

---

## Evidence supporting anagrelide as first-line therapy

The **ANAHYDRET trial** (259 patients, WHO-defined ET) showed anagrelide was non-inferior to hydroxyurea for thrombotic events at 6, 12, and 36 months (HR 1.19, 1.03, and 0.92, respectively) [^c49c9d2b] [^1e9b94b2]. Platelet control and discontinuation rates were similar between groups, supporting anagrelide as a viable alternative when hydroxyurea is not used [^c49c9d2b] [^1e9b94b2].

---

## Limitations and concerns with anagrelide

Despite ANAHYDRET, **several concerns limit anagrelide's first-line role**:

- **Arterial thrombosis**: Higher rates of arterial thrombosis and serious bleeding vs hydroxyurea in the UK-PT1 trial (809 patients) [^8fd92e32] [^242a7a48].
- **Myelofibrosis transformation**: Higher risk of progression to myelofibrosis vs hydroxyurea in observational data (EXELS) [^d2a7fd53] [^164ccfba].
- **Bleeding risk**: Increased hemorrhage, especially with antiplatelet therapy, requiring careful monitoring [^635f2d96] [^164ccfba].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Guidelines **do not prefer anagrelide as first-line** but accept it as an alternative:

| **Guideline** | **First-line recommendation** | **Anagrelide positioning** |
|-|-|-|
| NCCN | Hydroxyurea (preferred), peginterferon alfa-2a | Other recommended option if hydroxyurea declined or not tolerated [^d643b2af] [^246e06fa] |
| ELN | Hydroxyurea or interferon-alpha | Reasonable alternative in selected patients [^b822f069] [^a6021128] |
| ESMO | Hydroxyurea | Consider interferon or anagrelide in specific cases [^a6021128] |

---

## Alternative first-line options

If hydroxyurea is declined, **peginterferon alfa-2a** is guideline-endorsed, particularly for younger patients, those who defer hydroxyurea, or during pregnancy [^d643b2af] [^246e06fa]. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b has recently shown superiority to anagrelide in hydroxyurea-intolerant/resistant ET with leukocytosis, supporting its use as a first-line alternative in selected patients [^e5d31cb1].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

If anagrelide is used first-line, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor**: Regular CBCs, liver function, and cardiovascular symptoms (palpitations, arrhythmias) [^d763c77d] [^ed39ce90].
- **Bleeding risk**: Use caution with aspirin, especially at high platelet counts or with acquired von Willebrand syndrome [^635f2d96] [^164ccfba].
- **Transformation**: Watch for myelofibrosis with periodic clinical and laboratory assessment [^d2a7fd53] [^164ccfba].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Anagrelide is **not the preferred first-line therapy** for high-risk ET because hydroxyurea remains the standard due to stronger evidence and a more favorable risk profile [^8fd92e32] [^d643b2af]. However, anagrelide is a **reasonable alternative** when hydroxyurea is declined or not tolerated, supported by ANAHYDRET's non-inferiority data, but it requires careful monitoring for bleeding, arterial events, and myelofibrosis transformation [^c49c9d2b] [^d2a7fd53]. Peginterferon alfa-2a or ropeginterferon alfa-2b should be considered as safer first-line alternatives in appropriate patients [^d643b2af] [^e5d31cb1].

### Anagrelide compared with hydroxyurea in WHO-classified essential thrombocythemia: the ANAHYDRET study, a randomized controlled trial [^c49c9d2b]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

High platelet counts in essential thrombocythemia (ET) can be effectively lowered by treatment with either anagrelide or hydroxyurea. In 259 previously untreated, high-risk patients with ET, diagnosed according to the World Health Organization classification system, the efficacy and tolerability of anagrelide compared with hydroxyurea were investigated in a prospective randomized noninferiority phase 3 study in an a priori-ordered hypothesis. Confirmatory proof of the noninferiority of anagrelide was achieved after 6 months using the primary end point criteria and was further confirmed after an observation time of 12 and 36 months for platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, leukocyte counts (P < .001), and ET-related events (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.61–2.30], 1.03 [95% CI, 0.57–1.81], and 0.92 [95% CI, 0.57–1.46], respectively). During the total observation time of 730 patient-years, there was no significant difference between the anagrelide and hydroxyurea group regarding incidences of major arterial (7 vs 8) and venous (2 vs 6) thrombosis, severe bleeding events (5 vs 2), minor arterial (24 vs 20) and venous (3 vs 3) thrombosis and minor bleeding events (18 vs 15), or rates of discontinuation (adverse events 12 vs 15 or lack of response 5 vs 2). Disease transformation into myelofibrosis or secondary leukemia was not reported. Anagrelide as a selective platelet-lowering agent is not inferior compared with hydroxyurea in the prevention of thrombotic complications in patients with ET diagnosed according to the World Health Organization system. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01065038.

### Anagrelide compared with hydroxyurea in WHO-classified essential thrombocythemia: the ANAHYDRET study, a randomized controlled trial [^1e9b94b2]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

The study ANAHYDRET was published by Gisslinger H and colleagues in 2013 in the journal Blood. This study is related to the following diseases: Essential thrombocythemia. In the ANAHYDRET study, the trial question was: is anagrelide noninferior to hydroxyurea in patients with essential thrombocythemia? In the ANAHYDRET study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the ANAHYDRET study, the population was: 259 patients (166 female, 93 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with essential thrombocythemia who have high-risk profile. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy, contraindications to the study drugs, known lactose intolerance, severe renal disease, severe liver disease, coexisting malignancy, or systemic diseases. In the ANAHYDRET study, the interventions were: n = 122 anagrelide (started at a dose of 1.0 mg/day during the first week and adjusted until maintenance of the platelet count at normal or close to normal levels) n = 137 hydroxyurea (started at a dose of 1,500 mg/day and adjusted until maintenance of the platelet count at normal or close to normal levels). In the ANAHYDRET study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in ET-related major and minor thrombohemorrhagic events at 6 months (22 events vs. 29 events; HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.3). In the ANAHYDRET study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in ET-related major and minor thrombohemorrhagic events at 12 months (33 events vs. 31 events; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.81) No significant difference in ET-related events, after 36 months (51 events vs. 47 events; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.46) No significant difference in the rate of no ET-related thrombotic or bleeding events after observation of up to 6 years (63.9% vs. 67.4%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.5). In the ANAHYDRET study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of drugs. significant differences in anemia (9.0% vs. 18.3%), leukopenia (0.8% vs. 28.2%), palpitations (24.6% vs. 2.3%). In the ANAHYDRET study, the conclusion was: in patients with essential thrombocythemia who have high-risk profile, anagrelide was noninferior to hydroxyurea with respect to a ET-related major and minor thrombohemorrhagic events at 6 months.

### Hydroxyurea compared with anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia [^8fd92e32]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

The study Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia was published by Harrison CN and colleagues in 2005 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Essential thrombocythemia. In the Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia study, the trial question was: what is the role of hydroxyurea in patients with essential thrombocythemia? In the Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia study, the population was: 809 patients (467 female, 342 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with essential thrombocythemia who were at high-risk for vascular events and already receiving low-dose aspirin. The key exclusion criteria were myelodysplasia or myelofibrosis, and known causes of reactive thrombocytosis, myocardial infarction within the previous three months, severe congestive HF, severe ventricular arrhythmia, pregnancy or lactation, or leg ulceration. In the Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia study, the interventions were: n = 401 hydroxyurea (at a starting dose of 0.5–1.0 g daily, subsequent adjustment to maintain platelet count < 400,000 per m³ plus aspirin 75–100 mg daily) n = 405 anagrelide (starting dose of 0.5 mg BID, subsequent adjustment to maintain platelet count < 400,000 per m³ plus aspirin 75–100 mg daily). In the Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in arterial or venous thrombosis, serious hemorrhage, or death from vascular causes (36 vs. 55; OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.37). In the Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in arterial thrombosis (17 vs. 37; OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.69) Significant increase in serious hemorrhage (8 vs. 22; OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.27 to 5.33) Significant increase in transformation to myelofibrosis (5 vs. 16; OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.24 to 6.86). In the Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in study drug withdrawal due to side-effects (43 vs. 88, p < 0.001). In the Hydroxyurea vs. anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia study, the conclusion was: in patients with essential thrombocythemia who were at high-risk for vascular events and already receiving low-dose aspirin, hydroxyurea was superior to anagrelide with respect to arterial or venous thrombosis, serious hemorrhage, or death from vascular causes.

### The new WHO classification for essential thrombocythemia calls for revision of available evidences [^6e556fe1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

A recent update on risk-stratification and management of WHO-defined ET recommends also risk-adapted therapy. Very low-risk ET might not require treatment, whereas aspirin therapy is advised for low-risk disease. Cytoreductive therapy is recommended for high-risk ET but it is not mandatory for intermediate-risk ET. First-line drug of choice for cytoreductive therapy is hydroxyurea and second-line drugs of choice are interferon-α and busulfan.

The results of two clinical trial support the importance of this distinction, and suggest a re-interpretation of the data. In UK-PT1-randomized clinical trialit was proved that hydroxyurea was superior to Anagrelide (ANA) in reducing arterial thromboses, particularly, in JAK2-mutated patients; whereas ANA was more efficient in reducing venous thromboses. However, these results did not take into account the distinction between "true" ET and pre-PMF. In contrast, Gisslinger et al.failed to confirm these results in a randomized clinical trial on patients with confirmed WHO-ET, in which, ANA was not inferior to hydroxyurea in reducing thrombosis. This was attributed to "true" ET having clinical and hematological features different from pre-PMF. Unfortunately, in the ANA arm of the UK-PT1 trialan excess of MF evolution was shown and this event was confirmed in a large cohort of 3649 high-risk European ET patients.

In conclusion, this review summarizes the most recent changes in ET definition and characteristics following the recent approval of pre-PMF as separate MPN entity. For clinical decision-making, we need a more systematic, controlled, and prospective analysis of the clinical implications of this newly identified variant. A first step would be to launch an expert and critical re-evaluation of cohorts containing old ET and thrombocythemic PMF cases according to the 2016 revised WHO classification, and assess whether the former conclusions, particularly regarding therapy, can be validated. A multicenter prospective study on ET vs. thrombocythemic PMF would be desirable, but its feasibility is questionable.

### Cytoreduction for ET and PV: who, what, when, and how? [^84b71b83]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic complications are the primary contributor to morbidity and mortality in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). Cytoreductive therapy is the main tool for primary or tertiary thrombosis prevention in these diseases. In general, high-thrombotic-risk patients and those with symptoms that may be ameliorated from cytoreductive therapy are candidates for this treatment, although the decision is highly individualized. Approved options for cytoreduction in ET and PV include hydroxyurea, long-acting interferons, anagrelide in ET, and ruxolitinib in PV. Selecting the ideal agent requires careful consideration of the toxicity profiles and individual treatment goals. In this review the existing literature on cytoreductive decisions in ET and PV is summarized, with an emphasis on risk-stratification, highlighting the need for personalized care in order to maximize the benefit of these therapies while minimizing toxicities.

### Treatment of essential thrombocythemia in Europe: a prospective long-term observational study of 3649 high-risk patients in the evaluation of anagrelide efficacy and long-term safety study [^1b815337]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombohemorrhagic events

Importantly, overall thrombohemorrhagic event rates were low with a rate of < 2.5 independent of therapy, in line with other large studies, and fairly comparable between the 'anagrelide' and 'other CRT' group, consistent with the Anagrelide vs. Hydroxyurea - Efficacy and Tolerability Study in Patients With Essential Thrombocythaemia (ANAHYDRET) studyand the Primary Thrombocythaemia 1 (PT-1) trial. The total thrombotic event rate was lower in the 'anagrelide' group, which may reflect the age difference between the groups. The venous thrombotic event rate was lower in the 'anagrelide' group, which supports findings from both the PT-1 trial and the ANAHYDRET study. Currently there is no validated explanation for such disparity, but the confirmation in two large studies suggests that the difference warrants further investigation. The hemorrhagic event rate was higher in the 'anagrelide' vs. 'other CRT' group, especially when anagrelide was combined with A-A therapy, which also corresponds with findings from the PT-1 trialand underlines the importance of cautious use of this combination, especially in patients with previous hemorrhages.

A protective effect of A-A therapy for thrombosis was seen in the 'other CRT' and 'anagrelide + other' CRT groups, but not in the 'anagrelide' group. A possible explanation for this is that the 'other CRT' patients had more benefit from A-A therapy due to their older age. These results are consistent with current guidelines recommending A-A therapy in high-risk ET patients. A recent systematic review of A-A therapy in ETreported significant uncertainty regarding evidence for a protective effect against thrombosis. The study herein gives some evidence for such an effect, at least in HC-treated patients. The multivariate analysis did not detect any difference in the efficacy of anagrelide between WHO- vs. PVSG-diagnosed ET.

### Ropeginterferon alfa-2b in hydroxyurea-intolerant or hydroxyurea-refractory essential thrombocythaemia (SURPASS ET): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 study [^e5d31cb1]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Background

The initial therapy for high-risk essential thrombocythaemia is usually hydroxyurea, but about a third of patients develop intolerance or resistance. A standard second-line agent has been anagrelide. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b, a new-generation interferon-based therapy, is approved for polycythaemia vera. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b compared with anagrelide in patients with essential thrombocythaemia with leukocytosis who are intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea.

Methods

The SURPASS ET open-label, randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 55 clinical sites across China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, the USA, Singapore, and Canada and enrolled patients aged 18 years and older with high-risk (age > 60 years with JAK2 Val617Phe or a history of disease-related thrombosis or haemorrhage), hydroxyurea-intolerant or hydroxyurea-resistant essential thrombocythaemia and white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 10×10⁹ cells/L. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to ropeginterferon alfa-2b or anagrelide, stratified by platelet count, symptom score, and country. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b was subcutaneously dosed every 2 weeks, initially at 250 μg, then titrated to 350 μg at week 2, and to 500 μg from week 4 onward. Anagrelide was orally dosed according to the US Food and Drug Administration-approved prescribing information. The primary endpoint was the rate of response at months 9 and 12, as per modified European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria. The main planned analysis for the study was done in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04285086 and is completed, and an extension study for collecting long-term data is ongoing.

Findings

Between Aug 25, 2020, and Nov 12, 2024, 245 patients were screened and 174 were randomly assigned (91 to ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 83 to anagrelide). The median follow-up was 12.5 months (IQR 11.5–12.9). At baseline, 47 (52%) of 91 participants in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and 44 (53%) of 83 participants in the anagrelide group were female. 167 (96%) of 174 participants were Asian and seven (4%) were White. The trial met its primary endpoint, with 39 (43%) of 91 participants in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group showing durable modified ELN criteria responses at months 9 and 12, compared with five (6%) of 83 participants in the anagrelide group. This difference (36.5%, 95% CI 25.4–47.7) was significant (p = 0.0001). Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 27 (34%) of 80 patients in the anagrelide group and 21 (23%) of 91 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group. In the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group, the most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were infections and infestations, occurring eight (9%) of 91 patients, compared with five (6%) of 80 patients in the anagrelide group. In the anagrelide group, the most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were nervous system disorders, occurring in six (8%) of 80 patients, compared with one (1%) of 91 patients with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Serious adverse events occurred in 24 (30%) of 80 participants in the anagrelide group and 13 (14%) of 91 participants in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group). The most common serious adverse event was cerebral infarction, which occurred in four (5%) of 80 patients in the anagrelide group but was not observed in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group. There were no treatment-related deaths in either study group.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that ropeginterferon alfa-2b could be considered as a second-line treatment option for patients with essential thrombocythaemia and leukocytosis.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms — essential thrombocythemia (ET) antithrombotic therapy evidence indicates that hydroxyurea, peginterferon alfa-2a, and possibly anagrelide have been shown to be effective for preventing venous thrombotic complications in high-risk ET. In a randomized study of 114 high-risk ET patients (> 60 years and high risk of thrombosis), hydroxyurea (n = 56) given to maintain platelets < 600 x 10^9/L versus no myelosuppressive therapy (n = 58) yielded significantly lower thrombotic episodes with hydroxyurea at 3.6% compared to 24% (P = 0.003). In another randomized study of 809 patients, hydroxyurea plus low-dose aspirin was superior to anagrelide plus low-dose aspirin; initial doses were 0.5 to 1 g daily for hydroxyurea and 0.5 mg twice daily for anagrelide, with dose adjustments to keep platelets at < 400 x 10^9/L. After a median follow-up of 39 months, long-term platelet control was equivalent, anagrelide plus aspirin was better for prevention of venous thrombosis (P = 0.006), but had higher incidences of arterial thrombosis (P = 0.004), serious hemorrhage (P = 0.008), and transformation to MF (P = 0.01), with significantly higher treatment discontinuation for anagrelide plus aspirin. A phase III randomized study using WHO diagnostic criteria showed anagrelide was not inferior to hydroxyurea for first-line prevention of thrombotic complications, with 259 patients randomized to hydroxyurea (n = 122) or anagrelide (n = 137).

### A critical review of anagrelide therapy in essential thrombocythemia and related disorders [^434068c6]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2005). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem and it represents either a primary myeloid disorder (a clonal process) or a reactive phenomenon. While reactive thrombocytosis is often inconsequential, clonal thrombocytosis may require cytoreductive therapy to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In this regard, a controlled clinical trial has previously demonstrated the efficacy of hydroxyurea in reducing the risk of thrombosis in high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Despite the absence of similar evidence for clinical benefit, the platelet-lowering agent anagrelide has been widely used in both ET and polycythemia vera (PV) and recent reports of serious side-effects suggest that such practice might be detrimental to patients. In the current review we provide basic drug information as well as a critical assessment of anagrelide treatment in ET and related disorders.

### Philadelphia-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms: critical concepts and management recommendations from European LeukemiaNet… [^d58f008e]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

High-risk patients with PV should be managed with phlebotomy, low-dose aspirin, and cytoreduction, with either hydroxyurea or interferon at any age. High-risk patients with ET should be managed with cytoreduction, using hydroxyurea at any age. Monitoring response in PV and ET should use the ELN clinicohematologic criteria. Corticosteroids, androgens, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and immunomodulators are recommended to treat anemia of PMF, whereas hydroxyurea is the first-line treatment of PMF-associated splenomegaly. Indications for splenectomy include symptomatic portal hypertension, drug-refractory painful splenomegaly, and frequent RBC transfusions. The risk of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation–related complications is justified in transplantation-eligible patients whose median survival time is expected to be less than 5 years.

Goal of Therapy Goals of therapy in patients with PV and ET are to avoid first occurrence and/or recurrence of thrombotic and bleeding complications; to minimize the risk of acute leukemia and post-PV/ET myelofibrosis; and to control systemic symptoms, treat complications, and manage risk situations. However, overall long-term survival at 10 years showed no statistical significant difference between phosphorus-32 and phlebotomy. In patients given hydroxyurea, the incidence of thrombosis was inferior to historical controls treated with phlebotomy. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial compared 32P with intermittent busulphan, and the overall survival was significantly better in the busulphan arm as a result of less vascular deaths. Patients with PV enrolled onto the ECLAP study were randomly assigned to receive aspirin 100 mg or placebo.

After a follow-up of approximately 3 years, data analysis showed a significant reduction of events on aspirin. Major bleeding was not significantly increased by aspirin. Interferon alfa-2 has been used in therapy of PV showing up to an 80% hematologic response rate. 9/L, and progressive leukocytosis are indications for cytoreductive therapy. Either hydroxyurea or IFN-α is first-line cytoreductive therapy at any age. Hydroxyurea should be used with caution in young patients. Busulphan may be considered in elderly patients. All patients should be managed aggressively for their generic cardiovascular risk factors and advised to stop smoking. The use of cytoreductive drugs in otherwise low-risk patients who have well-controlled cardiovascular risk factors is not indicated. Low-risk patients with PV who are ≥ 60 years old or develop major thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications require the introduction of cytoreductive therapy.

In such patients, progressively increasing leukocyte and/or platelet count, enlarging spleen, uncontrolled disease-related symptoms, and poorly tolerated phlebotomy regimen may also justify the introduction of cytoreductive therapy. In high-risk patients, first-line therapy should be changed when intolerance has been demonstrated. 35Aspirin should be withdrawn in the event of major bleeding, most frequently GI, or in the rare cases of allergy or intolerance. Second-line therapy of PV is IFN-α in patients intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea therapy. Conversely, hydroxyurea is the second-line therapy for patients who are intolerant or refractory to first-line therapy with IFN-α. Pipobroman, busulphan, and 32P are second-line therapies reserved for patients with short life expectancy. | Essential thrombocythemia|1.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is associated with an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications and transformation to myelofibrosis (MF) or acute leukemia (AL). Cytoreductive therapy (CRT) is used to reduce thrombosis and hemorrhage in high-risk ET. European LeukemiaNet recommends hydroxycarbamide (HC) as first-line therapy, but advises caution in patients < 40 years. Anagrelide (Xagrid ®) is licensed in Europe for patients with ET intolerant/refractory to HC, and in some countries (i.e. USA, Japan) it is authorized as first-line therapy.

CRT decreases thrombosis upon the reduction and control of platelet counts.HC carries a potential leukemogenic risk; however, this remains a matter of debate. – Few prospective studies have been conducted to compare the effect of different CRT therapies on complications in ET, or to report on the long-term safety outcomes. Herein, we report final data from the Evaluation of Anagrelide Efficacy and Long-term Safety (EXELS) study, the largest prospective study in high-risk ET patients treated with CRT, including post hoc multivariate analyses identifying risk factors for thrombohemorrhagic events, and transformation to MF and AL.

Regarding medical management for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically with respect to cytoreductive therapy, ESMO 2015 guidelines recommend to administer hydroxyurea as first-line cytoreductive therapy in patients with high-risk ET.

### Hydroxyurea compared with anagrelide in high-risk essential thrombocythemia [^e4f77d97]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

We conducted a randomized comparison of hydroxyurea with anagrelide in the treatment of essential thrombocythemia.

Methods

A total of 809 patients with essential thrombocythemia who were at high risk for vascular events received low-dose aspirin plus either anagrelide or hydroxyurea. The composite primary end point was the actuarial risk of arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial thrombosis), venous thrombosis (deep-vein thrombosis, splanchnic-vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism), serious hemorrhage, or death from thrombotic or hemorrhagic causes.

Results

After a median follow-up of 39 months, patients in the anagrelide group were significantly more likely than those in the hydroxyurea group to have reached the primary end point (odds ratio, 1.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 2.37; P = 0.03). As compared with hydroxyurea plus aspirin, anagrelide plus aspirin was associated with increased rates of arterial thrombosis (P = 0.004), serious hemorrhage (P = 0.008), and transformation to myelofibrosis (P = 0.01) but with a decreased rate of venous thromboembolism (P = 0.006). Patients receiving anagrelide were more likely to withdraw from their assigned treatment (P < 0.001). Equivalent long-term control of the platelet count was achieved in both groups.

Conclusions

Hydroxyurea plus low-dose aspirin is superior to anagrelide plus low-dose aspirin for patients with essential thrombocythemia at high risk for vascular events.

Essential thrombocythemia (WHO criteria) phase III trial — anagrelide versus hydroxyurea: anagrelide was not inferior to hydroxyurea as first-line therapy, with 259 patients randomized to hydroxyurea (n = 122) or anagrelide (n = 137); drug doses were increased to maintain platelet counts at a normal level (< 450 × 10⁹/L) or close to it (> 450 × 10⁹/L to 600 × 10⁹/L), and after 730 patient-years there was no significant difference in arterial or venous thrombotic events, severe bleeding, or discontinuation; another study over a median 10 years found anagrelide led to fewer minor arterial events (P < .001), more major arterial events (P = 0.049), and improved OS (overall survival) (P = 0.001) and PFS (progression-free survival) (P = 0.004) versus hydroxyurea and aspirin.

### Essential thrombocythemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^bf604c92]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Anagrelide has been evaluated, in controlled studies, for its efficacy and safety as first-line therapy for ET; the results of these studies suggested that anagrelide was not inferior to hydroxyurea in one study, but might have been harmful to patients in the second study. In the latter study, patients receiving anagrelide experienced higher incidences of arterial thrombosis, bleeding complications, and fibrotic progression. Similarly, non-controlled studies have suggested that more than a quarter of patients receiving anagrelide therapy become anemic while a lesser percentage experience renal insufficiency and cardiac complications including arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy –. Therefore, we currently consider anagrelide therapy only after failure of all other drug options, including hydroxyurea, IFN-α, and busulfan. Finally, despite some uncontrolled reports of safety and efficacy –, we currently do not recommend pipobroman treatment in ET, because of controlled evidence for leukemogenicity, seen in patients with PV.

Management during pregnancy

Current treatment recommendations in young women wishing to be pregnant or are pregnant include once-daily aspirin for "very low-risk" or "low-risk" disease and pegylated IFN-α for high-risk disease. Both aspirin and IFN-α therapy have been shown to be safe for use during pregnancy and might be associated with lower miscarriage rates in women with ET –. The additional value of other measures, including platelet apheresis or low molecular weight heparin, is unclear and not recommended.

### How to manage essential thrombocythemia [^702b5e35]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

I use the hematological, morphological and molecular criteria recently established by the World Health Organization to diagnose essential thrombocytemia. In these patients, major causes of morbidity and mortality are represented by thrombosis and bleeding, whereas progression to myelofibrosis and transformation to acute leukemia are more rare. Myelosuppressive therapy can reduce the rate of vascular complications, but there is some concern about treatment-related toxicity. Therefore, I follow a risk-oriented therapeutic approach to avoid inappropriate exposure to cytotoxic drugs on one side or suboptimal treatment on the other. Established predictors of cardiovascular events are represented by older age and previous thrombosis, whereas recent data suggest a prognostic role for novel risk factors, including leukocytosis and JAK2V617F mutational status. There is no indication for therapeutic intervention in asymptomatic, low-risk patients, while I treat high-risk patients with hydroxyurea (HU) first. Other therapeutic options, such as interferon alpha or anagrelide, may find place in selected patients including those who are resistant or intolerant to HU. I follow a risk-oriented approach also for management of pregnancy. Low-risk women are given low-dose aspirin throughout pregnancy and prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) post partum, whereas LMWH throughout pregnancy and/or interferon-alpha can be required in high-risk cases.

Discussion

EXELS represents the largest prospective cohort of patients with ET reported to date, and as such it provides several important real-world insights into the therapeutic management of this disease. Patients receiving anagrelide were younger than those receiving another CRT, likely due to investigators choosing to use anagrelide as first-line therapy in younger patients in order to avoid a transformation related to the potential leukemogenic risk associated with long-term HC treatment. Differences in age may confound analysis of the event rates in the various treatment groups.

### Management of essential thrombocythemia [^2c4498db]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by thrombocytosis and megakaryocytic hyperplasia of the bone marrow, with presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation in 50%-60% of patients. ET evolves to myelofibrosis in a minority of cases, whereas transformation to acute leukemia is rare and increases in association with the use of certain therapies. Survival of ET patients does not substantially differ from that of the general population. However, important morbidity is derived from vascular complications, including thrombosis, microvascular disturbances, and bleeding. Because of this, treatment of ET must be aimed at preventing thrombosis and bleeding without increasing the risk of transformation of the disease. Patients are considered at high risk of thrombosis if they are older than 60 years or have a previous history of thrombosis and at high risk of bleeding if platelet counts are > 1500 × 10(9)/L. Patients with low-risk ET are usually managed with low-dose aspirin, whereas treatment of high-risk ET is based on the use of cytoreductive therapy, with hydroxyurea as the drug of choice and IFN-α being reserved for young patients or pregnant women. For patients resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea, anagrelide is recommended as second-line therapy. Strict control of coexistent cardiovascular risk factors is mandatory for all patients. The role in ET therapy of new drugs such as pegylated IFN or the JAK2 inhibitors is currently under investigation.

### Essential thrombocythaemia: a contemporary approach with new drugs on the horizon [^1f18cd87]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an increased risk of vascular complications and a tendency to progress to myelofibrosis and acute leukaemia. ET patients have traditionally been stratified into two thrombosis risk categories based on age older than 60years and a history of thrombosis. More recently, the revised IPSET-thrombosis scoring system, which accounts for the increased risk linked to the JAK2 mutation, has been incorporated into most expert recommendations. However, there is increasing evidence that the term ET encompasses different genomic entities, each with a distinct clinical course and prognosis. Moreover, the effectiveness and toxicity of cytoreductive and anti-platelet treatments differ depending on the molecular genotype. While anti-platelets and conventional cytoreductive agents, mainly hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), anagrelide and pegylated interferon, remain the cornerstone of treatment, recent research has shed light on the effectiveness of novel therapies that may help improve outcomes. This comprehensive review focuses on the evolving landscape of treatment strategies in ET, with an emphasis on the role of molecular profiling in guiding therapeutic decisions. Besides evidence-based management according to revised IPSET-thrombosis stratification, we also provide specific observations for those patients with CALR-, MPL-mutated and triple-negative ET, as well as cases with high-risk mutations.

In a separate multivariate analysis conducted in the first treatment analysis group ('anagrelide' vs. 'other CRT'), the influence of treatment on risk for thrombosis and hemorrhage, as well as transformation to MF, was analyzed (Table 5). Anagrelide was associated with a higher risk for major thrombosis (HR 1.68, CI 1.09 to 2.60, P = 0.02) and arterial thrombosis (HR 1.91, CI 1.20 to 3.04, P = 0.0067). There was no difference between WHO-defined and PVSG-defined ET in this respect (HR 1.49 vs. 1.45). There was also no difference in risk for arterial thrombosis in general between WHO-defined and PVSG-defined ET. In a Cox regression analysis with arterial events as the outcome and ET diagnosis as the single explanatory variable, HR was 1.06 (CI 0.77 to 1.46, P = 0.73).

Conclusions

The EXELS study provides important observations that may influence clinical practice for patients with high-risk ET. It is the largest ever prospective real-world study in this condition. Overall, total thrombohemorrhagic event rates were low (< 2.5/100 patient-years), but a lower rate of venous thrombotic and a higher rate of hemorrhagic events were observed in the 'anagrelide' group. A post hoc multivariate analysis confirmed these differences, but also suggested a higher arterial thrombosis risk in anagrelide-treated patients, especially smokers. Transformation to MF was more frequent in PVSG-defined than in WHO-defined ET and was more frequent in the 'anagrelide' than in the 'other CRT' group. Transformation to AL and other malignancies was more common with other CRTs. A history of thrombohemorrhagic events, age ≥ 65 years, cardiovascular risk factors, or hypertension were identified as baseline risk factors for thrombohemorrhagic events. These factors, time since diagnosis and an increase in platelet counts above normal were identified as risk factors for transformation to MF.

### Impact of treatment for adolescent and young adults with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^711ff35e]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) belong to the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) category of the WHO classification. These disorders involve myeloid proliferation, presenting as thrombocytosis in ET, increased red cell mass in PV and varyingly mild leukocytosis, splenomegaly or general symptoms, and an elevated risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events. Additionally, there is a potential, albeit less common, progression to secondary myelofibrosis (sMF), acute leukemia (AL), and a reduction in life expectancy.

While ET and PV typically manifest in the sixth decade, approximately 20% of cases are diagnosed in individuals under 40, with limited available data on adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients. Current recommendations and risk classifications for ET and PV, such as ELN and IPSET-T, are primarily based on data from older patients. The primary objective in managing these conditions is thrombotic risk reduction, achieved through pharmacological cytoreduction. Hydroxycarbamide (HU), interferon (IFN), and anagrelide (ANA) are commonly employed as first-line treatments, with IFN uniquely demonstrating long-term disease modification potential, including allele burden reduction and the possibility of treatment discontinuation.

Our study aimed to explore long-term complications, evaluating the impact of treatment on thrombotic risk and sMF progression. This becomes particularly pertinent given the extended life expectancy of these patients spanning several decades.

### Decreased survival and increased rate of fibrotic progression in essential thrombocythemia chronicled after the FDA approval date of anagrelide [^e70a963b]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

First-line cytoreductive drug of choice in high risk essential thrombocythemia (ET) is currently hydroxyurea, a practice based on the results of a randomized study; second-line drugs of choice include pegylated interferon-α, busulfan and anagrelide. Anagrelide clinical trials were pioneered by the late Murray N. Silverstein (1928–1998) of the Mayo Clinic whose studies led to FDA approval in March 1997. The current study represents a retrospective examination of the potential impact of anagrelide therapy on survival and disease complications in ET. 1076 patients with ET were considered (median age 58years; females 63%); risk distribution, according to the international prognostic score for ET (IPSET), was 28% high, 42% intermediate, and 30% low. Overall (OS), myelofibrosis-free (MFFS) and thrombosis-free survival data were compared for ET patients diagnosed before and after the 1997 FDA approval date for anagrelide; a significant difference was apparent in OS (P = 0.006; HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.7) and MFFS (P < .001; HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.7–6.5), in favor of patients diagnosed prior to 1997; the difference was sustained during multivariable analysis that included IPSET. Similarly stratified survival data in polycythemia vera (n = 665) and primary myelofibrosis (n = 1282) showed no similar impact on survival (P = 0.3 and .17, respectively). The current study represents a retrospective analysis and suggests significantly decreased OS and MFFS in ET patients diagnosed after the FDA approval date of anagrelide. Whether or not anagrelide therapy was to blame for the worsening of OS and MFFS over time cannot be assumed and requires validation in a prospective study.

Thrombotic and hemorrhagic events

In the first-treatment analysis group, the event rate for major thrombosis was lower in the 'anagrelide' vs. the 'other CRT' group (1.62 vs. 2.06; Table 3). Arterial thrombotic event rates were similar between the 'anagrelide' and 'other CRT' group (1.47 vs. 1.55), whereas the venous thrombotic rate was lower in the 'anagrelide' compared with the 'other CRT' group (0.15 vs. 0.53). The major hemorrhagic event rate was higher in the 'anagrelide' group (0.89 vs. 0.43), especially in patients treated with A-A (1.35 vs. 0.33, respectively). The composite thrombohemorrhagic event rate was slightly higher in the 'anagrelide' (2.47) compared to 'other CRT' (2.41) group, largely due to hemorrhagic events. Similar results for thrombosis and hemorrhage event rates were observed in the overall treatment analysis group (Online Supplementary Table S4).

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) high-risk management — defined as "High-risk (history of thrombosis at any age; or, age > 60 years with JAK2 mutation)" — includes to "Manage cardiovascular risk factors (MPN-H)", use "Aspirin (81–100 mg/ day)", and start cytoreductive therapy with "Preferred regimens for cytoreductive therapy: Clinical trial or Hydroxyurea", with "Other recommended regimens for cytoreductive therapy: Peginterferon alfa-2a (based on other patient-specific variables) or Anagrelide". Ongoing care should "Monitor for new thrombosis, acquired VWS, and/or disease-related major bleeding", and disease progression leads to "Post-ET MF see MPN-2; Accelerated/blast phase MPN, see MPN-AP/BP-1". Aspirin-related precautions state: "Aspirin should be used with caution in patients with acquired VWS. Higher-dose aspirin may be appropriate in selected patients as clinically indicated. The risks and benefits of higher-dose aspirin (> 100 mg) must be weighed based on the presence of vasomotor symptoms versus the risk of bleeding", and "Aspirin twice daily may be considered for patients with refractory symptoms". For suspected transformation, "Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be performed to rule out disease progression to MF if clinical/laboratory suspicion of MF". Treatment targets are qualified: "it is not associated with long-term clinical benefit and there are no evidence-based data to recommend a target WBC or platelet count for patients receiving cytoreductive therapy", though "In selected patients with a severe thrombotic event or other disease-related symptoms, normalization of blood counts might be a goal of treatment".

### Evidence and expertise in the management of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^49ecbb58]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

Major causes of morbidity and mortality in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are represented by thrombosis and bleeding, progression to myelofibrosis and transformation to acute leukemia. Myelosuppressive therapy, preferentially with hydroxyurea, can reduce the rate of vascular complications, but there is some concern about an increased rate of leukemic transformation with this agent. Therefore, management of these disorders poses a significant challenge, and a risk-oriented therapeutic approach should be strictly followed to avoid inappropriate exposure to cytotoxic drugs on one side or suboptimal treatment on the other. Established risk factors for cardiovascular events are represented by older age and previous thrombosis, whereas impact of novel biological factors, including leukocytosis and JAK2V617F mutational status and/or mutational burden, is under active investigation. Low-risk PV patients should be managed only with phlebotomy and aspirin, whereas high-risk patients should also receive cytotoxic therapy. Regarding the management of ET, there is no clear indication for intervention in low-risk patients, whereas high-risk patients should be managed with chemotherapy. Other therapeutic options, such as interferon-alpha or anagrelide, may find place in selected patients including those who are resistant/intolerant to hydroxyurea. Finally, there is great expectation for novel drugs targeting the constitutively active JAK2/STAT pathway.

General management of myeloproliferative neoplasms

The main goal of the management of ET and PV patients is the prevention of vascular events (thrombosis and hemorrhages) and relies on rigorous treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in all patients, and the administration of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and cytoreductive therapy depending on individual vascular risk. International guidelines, recommend using the revised International Prognostic Score of Thrombosis for Essential Thrombocythemia (IPSET-thrombosis) scoring system to stratify the vascular risk of ET patients. All ET patients should receive acetylsalicylic acid, apart from very low-risk, asymptomatic ET patients with CALR mut for whom observation only is recommended. Cytoreductive treatment is indicated in patients > 60 years with JAK2 V617F mutation and/or cardiovascular risk factors, in patients with a history of vascular events and in patients with extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1,500x10 9 /L). Current international guidelines recommend that all PV patients should receive acetylsalicylic acid and undergo phlebotomies to maintain their hematocrit ≤ 45%. High-risk PV patients, defined by age ≥ 60 years and/or a prior history of thrombosis, are eligible for cytoreductive drugs. The risk of complications in PV does not only rely on the increase of the hematocrit level. Several criteria reflecting a higher thrombotic risk (e.g. leukocytosis, inadequate hematocrit control with phlebotomies, relevant cardiovascular risk factors), a bleeding risk (thrombocytosis > 1,500×10 9 /L), as well as disease-related symptoms (e.g. splenomegaly, pruritus) are additional indications for cytoreductive treatment in low-risk PV patients. -For both ET and PV, the recommended first-line agents are hydroxyurea and pegylated interferon alpha (IFNα). Anagrelide and ruxolitinib are second-line therapeutic options in ET and PV, respectively. -

Results

Patients

The EXELS study included 3721 patients from 13 European countries. At time of registration, 110 patients were not receiving CRT and were excluded from the first-treatment safety population (n = 3611). Of these, 38 subsequently received CRT and were included in the overall-treatment safety population (n = 3649; Online Supplementary Figure S1). 66% of the patients were diagnosed according to WHO diagnostic criteria, 29% were diagnosed by PVSG diagnostic criteria, and 5% were diagnosed by unknown criteria.

Baseline characteristics in the first-treatment safety population are shown in Table 1. Anagrelide was more frequently used in younger patients (Figure 1). Median age was therefore lower in the 'anagrelide' (55.5 years, range: 18–89) and 'anagrelide + other CRT' (59.0 years, range: 22–88) vs. the 'other CRT' groups (70.0 years, range: 17–95). At baseline, the proportion of patients with prior thrombohemorrhagic events were similar at 25–30% across treatment groups (Table 1). More than 80% of patients received either HC (n = 2341) or anagrelide (n = 804) therapy. In the safety population, median duration of exposure was 1717.0 days (range: 1–2573) and 1481.0 days (range: 1–2677) in the 'HC' and 'anagrelide' groups, respectively. Exposure to HC and anagrelide was 10377 and 4320 patient-years, respectively. IFN was used by 136 patients, and monotherapy with busulfan, pipobroman or P32 by < 5% together; therefore, outcome analyses were not performed for these subgroups. A-A was used by 58.1% in the 'anagrelide' group and 72.8% in the 'other CRT' group. JAK2V617F mutation status was reported in too few patients to allow for statistical analysis.

Removal of outliers resulted in similar median results. ANA: anagrelide.

Multivariate analysis, risk factors for thrombohemorrhagic and transformation events

'Prior thrombohemorrhagic events' and 'age ≥ 65 years' at baseline were identified as risk factors for major thrombotic, arterial thrombotic, venous thrombotic and total thrombohemorrhagic events (Online Supplementary Table S5). The presence of baseline cardiovascular risk factors was associated with a higher risk of arterial thrombotic events. A higher platelet count at baseline correlated with an increased risk for transformation to MF (HR 1.18, confidence interval [CI] 1.08 to 1.30, P = 0.0004) for each platelet count increase of 100×10⁹/L at baseline. A lower risk for MF transformation was indicated for patients diagnosed with ET by WHO criteria than those diagnosed by PVSG criteria (HR 0.55, P = 0.03; Table 5). As expected, a time from diagnosis > 10 years indicated a higher risk for MF transformation (HR 4.38, CI 1.49 to 12.88 compared with < 1 year, P = 0.0073; Table 6).

Are the current prevention methods for thrombosis adequate?

The current annual incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis in patients with PV and ET is 2.62% and 1.77%, respectively, a figure 1.5-fold and 3.2-fold higher than that in the general population.– The antithrombotic role of cytoreductive drugs is uncertain. Hydroxyurea (HU) has demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing arterial thromboses, but doubts remain as to its ability to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), – particularly in patients with splanchnic venous thrombosis. The antithrombotic efficacy of interferon-α has not yet been convincingly demonstrated, and the performance of ruxolitinib in PV patients resistant/intolerant to HU is largely uncertain. Although there is no direct evidence that thrombocytosis per se is a risk factor for thrombosis, the favorable effect of anagrelide versus HU in preventing the occurrence of venous thromboembolism in ET, as shown in the PT1 randomized clinical trial, is of interest. However, the interpretation of that study is complicated by the heterogeneity of the patient population that was diagnosed according to WHO 2008 criteria. Of note, the ANAHYDRET study, that included patients with a diagnosis of ET that strictly followed WHO 2016 criteria, showed non-inferiority in terms of arterial and venous events. As a whole, there is still no convincing evidence of a clear antithrombotic action of cytoreductive drugs in ET and PV, and new randomized clinical trials with thrombosis as the primary end point are warranted.

The indication of low-dose aspirin (LDA) is mainly based on a phase III trial in PVand on retrospective studies in ET, but the quality of evidence is low. However, new hypotheses are now being tested to improve the antithrombotic efficacy of aspirin in ET. These are based on the notion that accelerated release of new platelets in ET may accelerate the recovery of thromboxane (TX)A2-dependent platelet function during the once-daily (od) LDA dosing interval. Accordingly, inhibition of the surrogate biomarker platelet TXA2 by o.d. LDA is incomplete in ≥ 80% of ET patients, but it was seen to be improved by a twice-daily regimen. In the phase II ARES randomized trial, most of the 245 ET patients treated with LDA displayed incomplete platelet inhibition, which was improved by shortening the dosing interval to 12 hours. The long-term superiority, compliance, and tolerability of an optimized LDA regimen is now being investigated in a clinical trial.

Regarding medical management for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically with respect to cytoreductive therapy, ESMO 2015 guidelines recommend to reduce the dose of hydroxyurea by adjusting therapeutic targets (such as raising the platelet count target to 600×10⁹/L) or switch therapy, usually to interferon or anagrelide, in patients with resistance or modest intolerance to hydroxyurea. Consider administering busulfan, preferably in older patients. Recognize that when hydroxyurea is used with (or succeeded by) other agents, including busulfan, it will significantly increase the long-term risk of leukemia.

Evaluation of Anagrelide (Xagrid ®) Efficacy and Long-term Safety, a phase IV, prospective, non-interventional study performed in 13 European countries enrolled high-risk essential thrombocythemia patients treated with cytoreductive therapy. The primary objectives were safety and pregnancy outcomes. Of 3721 registered patients, 3649 received cytoreductive therapy. At registration, 3611 were receiving: anagrelide (Xagrid ®) (n = 804), other cytoreductive therapy (n = 2666), or anagrelide + other cytoreductive therapy (n = 141). The median age was 56 vs. 70 years for anagrelide vs. other cytoreductive therapy. Event rates (patients with events/100 patient-years) were 1.62 vs. 2.06 for total thrombosis and 0.15 vs. 0.53 for venous thrombosis. Anagrelide was more commonly associated with hemorrhage (0.89 vs. 0.43), especially with anti-aggregatory therapy (1.35 vs. 0.33) and myelofibrosis (1.04 vs. 0.30). Other cytoreductive therapies were more associated with acute leukemia (0.28 vs. 0.07) and other malignancies (1.29 vs. 0.44). Post hoc multivariate analyses identified increased risk for thrombosis with prior thrombohemorrhagic events, age ≥ 65, cardiovascular risk factors, or hypertension. Risk factors for transformation were prior thrombohemorrhagic events, age ≥ 65, time since diagnosis, and platelet count increase. Safety analysis reflected published data, and no new safety concerns for anagrelide were found. Live births occurred in 41/54 pregnancies (76%). clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: 00567502.

### Unmet clinical needs in the management of CALR-mutated essential thrombocythaemia: a consensus-based proposal from the European LeukemiaNet [^05202f12]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Recommendations regarding management of essential thrombocythaemia rely on studies done before the discovery of the CALR mutation. On May 20, 2020, the European LeukemiaNet annual meeting was held with the goal to identify unmet clinical needs in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Because patients with a CALR mutation have specific clinical characteristics, treatment of CALR-mutated essential thrombocythaemia was considered an unmet clinical need by the European LeukemiaNet. The elaboration of a consensus document with recommendations according to current evidence was proposed as a solution for resolving uncertainties in the treatment of CALR-mutated essential thrombocythaemia. A steering committee comprising four European LeukemiaNet members was then formed and a panel of ten experts in the field was recruited. The experts proposed 51 potential unmet clinical needs in the management of CALR-mutated essential thrombocythaemia and were asked to score the relevance of each topic. Those topics that obtained the highest scores as relevant unmet clinical needs were identified, including antiplatelet therapy in patients at low risk, definition of extreme thrombocytosis and its management in patients at low risk, indications of cytoreduction and targets of therapy, first-line treatment of choice in young patients (< 60 years), and management of pregnancy. After the steering committee revised the available evidence for each topic, a consensus on management and proposal for improving knowledge was achieved by use of an email-based, two round, Delphi approach. Consensus was achieved when 90% of the panellists agreed with a statement and included 14 recommendations and six solution proposals. Key recommendations included careful observation for asymptomatic patients with classical, low-risk, CALR-mutated essential thrombocythaemia without cardiovascular risk factors; caution in the use of antiplatelet therapy for symptomatic patients at low risk with platelet counts of 1000–1500×10 9 platelets per L, in such cases cytoreduction is an adequate option, especially if adquired Von Willebrand disease is present; cytoreduction is recommended for extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1500×10 9 platelets per L) with pegylated interferon alfa being the preferred option for younger patients; both hydroxycarbamide and anagrelide might be given to patients ineligible for pegylated interferon alfa; and treatment algorithms for patients with high-risk pregnancies should not be changed according to genotype. The European LeukemiaNet proposes to use these recommendations in the routine management of patients with CALR-mutated essential thrombocythaemia, and designing new clinical studies in this field might be useful.

Transformation

Transformation to AL was more frequent in the 'other CRT' vs. the 'anagrelide' group. All six patients in the 'anagrelide' group who developed AL had previously been treated with HC. In patients who had only ever received anagrelide, there were no cases of AL. Non-hematological malignancies were also less frequent in the 'anagrelide' than in either the 'other CRT' or the 'HC' groups. This warrants further analysis and will be addressed in a separate publication. The multivariate analysis identified both a history of thrombohemorrhagic events and an age of ≥ 65 years at baseline as risk factors for predicting transformation to AL/MDS events.

Transformation to MF was higher in the 'anagrelide' vs. 'HC' group, in line with data from the PT-1 trial. In both studies, patients included those with both 'true ET' according to the WHO classification, as well as ET diagnosed by PVSG criteria, some of whom may have had early MF according to the new WHO criteriawith significant bone marrow fibrosis at entry. This does not explain the difference in the MF transformation event rate, but illustrates that anagrelide does not seem to hinder fibrosis development. Considering the much lower rate of MF development in correctly diagnosed ET, also supported by our results, the optimal patient group for anagrelide treatment could be those with true ET rather than early MF. This is further supported by our finding that the risk for transformation to MF in anagrelide-treated patients was more pronounced in PVSG-defined than in WHO-defined ET. Regular surveillance for features of MF should be considered with anagrelide, especially in patients with primary MF 0–1. A higher platelet count at baseline was identified as a risk factor for MF transformation in the multivariate analysis, a new and interesting finding that requires further confirmation.

Methods

Trial design

EXELS is a phase IV, prospective, non-interventional, post-authorization, multicenter cohort study which was conducted in 125 centers in 13 European countries from May 2005 to April 2014. The results represent the final data from the 5-year observation period. High-risk ET patients (age > 60 years, prior thrombosis/hemorrhage, or platelets > 1000×10⁹/L) were eligible if receiving/scheduled to receive CRT. The Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG)or the World Health Organization (WHO) 2001/2008diagnostic criteria were used. As an observational study, the protocol could not mandate mutation analysis; however, investigators were encouraged to report JAK2 status. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Treatment

CRT was determined prior to registration. Patients could be newly diagnosed or continuing prior CRT, including anagrelide, HC, busulfan, interferon-α (IFN), pegylated interferon, pipobroman and sodium phosphate (P32). Patients could receive concomitant anti-aggregatory (A-A) therapy and have CRT changed at any time at the investigator's discretion.

Objectives

The primary objective was safety and pregnancy outcomes with anagrelide vs. other CRTs in high-risk ET patients in routine clinical practice. The secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy, as measured by the incidence of thrombotic/hemorrhagic events, and platelet counts.

Data capture

Data were collected at registration and every 6 months for 5 years. Suspected serious adverse reactions (SSARs) and predefined events (PDEs) of specific interest in this study were recorded. An independent event validation panel blinded to CRT validated PDEs for consistent/correct PDE group allocation. Study conduct/monitoring was overseen by a steering committee and an independent data and safety monitoring board.

Essential thrombocythemia

Box 2. Management of essential thrombocythemia in a snapshot.

ET phenotypically affects the megakaryocytic cell line and is characterized by peripheral thrombocytosis and hyperproliferation of large, hyperlobulated megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. ET should be distinguished from pre-fibrotic MF or PV. Reactive thrombocytosis represents a further differential diagnosis and should be strongly considered in 'triple-negative ET'. The primary therapeutic goal in the treatment of ET is to prevent thromboembolism and bleeding events (due to extreme thrombocytosis-related secondary von Willebrand syndrome), as well as to reduce disease-associated symptoms. The indication for treatment is based on the thrombosis risk profile guided by established and guideline-anchored risk stratification systems, dividing patients into low, intermediate and high risk for thrombosis. Numerous studies have shown that the presence of a JAK2 mutation is associated with a significantly higher risk of thrombosis compared to the presence of CALR mutations. JAK2 mutation is incorporated as a risk factor into scores such as the International Prognostic Score of thrombosis in Essential Thrombocythemia (IPSET-thrombosis) score. Treatment strategies include low-dose aspirin for intermediate- and high-risk patients with microcirculatory disturbances, in those without contraindications due to bleeding risk, although prospective studies for this recommendation are lacking. Data suggest that low-risk patients with a CALR mutation do not benefit from antiplatelet therapy. Cytoreductive medication is specifically indicated for high-risk patients and options include hydroxyurea, anagrelide and peg-interferon (where approved). Ropeg-interferon is being evaluated in an international multicenter trial of patients with ET. Data on ruxolitinib from two studies in relatively small patient populations with hydroxyurea-refractory or -intolerant ET showed a reduction in platelets and leukocytes and an improvement in ET-associated symptoms, but no significant improvement in the hematologic complete remission rate or the rate of thrombosis, hemorrhages, or leukemic transformation.

Influence of high molecular risk on prognostication in essential thrombocythemia

In ET, mutations in SH2B3, SF3B1, U2AF1, TP53, IDH2, and EZH2 were associated with inferior overall survival. In a further analysis, SF3B1 and SRSF2 predicted reduced overall survival, while mutations in SF3B1 and U2AF1 predicted reduced MF-free survival and those in TP53 predicted inferior leukemia-free survival. These genes have been integrated into the MIPSS-ET score that significantly stratifies patients into low, intermediate and high risk for survival.

Statistical methods

Patients receiving a treatment for ≥ 1 day were allocated to treatment groups. The safety population included patients receiving ≥ 1 dose of CRT, analyzed as: 1) first-treatment analysis; PDEs or SSARs that occurred before a patient switched CRT, and 2) overall-treatment analysis; PDEs or SSARs allocated to the treatment at time of event. Patients could be included in more than one treatment group; as such the number of events is higher in the overall - vs. first-treatment group.

Data were analyzed according to 'anagrelide only', 'other CRT', and 'anagrelide + other CRT'. Patients with multiple events of the same PDE/SSAR category were counted once for each treatment received. Selected PDEs were combined into the following five endpoints: 1) all major thrombotic events (arterial plus venous), 2) arterial thrombotic events, 3) venous thrombotic events, 4) major hemorrhagic events, and 5) thrombohemorrhagic events (all major thrombotic/hemorrhagic events). Event rates were calculated as the number of affected patients per 100 patient-years exposure.

Multivariate analysis

Two post hoc multivariate analyses were performed, first for the overall group in order to evaluate potential risk factors (except treatment) for thrombotic/hemorrhagic events, and death, and second for the first-treatment group to investigate risk factors and treatment effect for thrombotic/hemorrhagic events and MF transformation. Regression analysis followed the strategy for model selection. The final model was fit by using a significance level of 0.05. To facilitate interpretation, "significant" is used for "variable" or "variable treatment" interaction term significant at P ≤ 0.001 level as no multiplicity adjustment was made.

### Hydroxyurea prevents arterial and late venous thrombotic recurrences in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms but fails in the splanchnic venous district. pooled analysis of 1500 cases [^c0c7fbf1]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The principal burden of illness in patients with Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) is arterial thrombosis and venous thromboembolism (VTE), which can occur since the very early stages of disease and complicate the course of the follow-up with an elevated rate constant over time; on the other hand, fibrotic or leukemic transformation are late complications. The incidence of either arterial thrombosis or VTE is approximately tenfold higher than in the general population.

In MPN patients having experienced a first thrombosis, the rate of recurrence is 4.8% patient-years after an ischemic cerebrovascular eventand 6–7.6% patient-years after a venous event –. Prevention of thrombosis or re-thrombosis is the major goal of care in MPN patients. However, the efficacy of conventional strategies of secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis is unsatisfactory either using antiplatelet agents after arterial events, or vitamin K-antagonists (VKA) after venous events –.

Three randomized clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of hydroxyurea (HU) in reducing the rate of thrombosis in high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) –; moreover, in a recent reappraisal of the European Collaborative Low-dose aspirin (ECLAP) study, high-risk patients with polycythemia vera (PV) resulted better protected by HU than phlebotomies alone. However, there is some evidence that the benefit of HU is somewhat vessel site-related. In the PT-1 trial, the HU arm had an excess of venous thromboses in respect to the anagrelide arm. Moreover, in a retrospective cohort of 494 MPN patients with previous thrombosis, HU was effective in preventing recurrences in patients with a first arterial event but not in those with a first venous event. On the other hand, in a retrospective cohort of 597 MPN patients with ischemic stroke or TIA, HU resulted in a strong protective factor for the development of recurrent ischemic stroke. Finally, we recently investigated more thoroughly the PV patients recruited in the ECLAP cohort, showing that HU was more effective than phlebotomy in preventing either first or recurrent arterial thromboses, but not venous thromboses.

To investigate further on whether different antithrombotic or cytoreductive agents can play different roles in the prevention of recurrent thrombosis in MPN patients, we took advantage of several large databases built in the last decade, pooling a cohort of 1500 patients with MPN and previous thrombosis.

The risk for MF transformation was greater in the 'anagrelide' vs. 'other CRT' group (HR 3.33, CI 1.94 to 5.73, P < 0.0001), but this difference was smaller in WHO-defined than in PVSG-defined ET (HR 2.79, CI 1.24 to 6.27, P = 0.0132 vs. HR 4.67, CI 2.10 to 10.37, P = 0.0002). The risk for MF transformation was also generally lower in WHO-defined than in PVSG-defined ET (Table 5).

The HR for venous thrombosis, on the other hand, was lower (HR 0.43, CI 0.15 to 1.21, P = 0.11), although it did not reach statistical significance. In anagrelide patients, the concomitant use of A-A therapy showed an increased risk of bleeding (HR 3.55, CI 1.96 to 6.44, P < 0.0001), which increased the total thrombohemorrhagic risk (HR 2.46, CI 1.65 to 3.66, P < 0.0001). An increased risk for total thrombohemorrhagic events was also seen for anagrelide patients who were smokers (HR 2.34, CI 1.21 to 4.54, P = 0.0118). A similar effect was seen for arterial thrombotic events, where the risk was also greater for patients receiving anagrelide who were smokers (HR 3.18, CI 1.41 to 7.16, P = 0.005). Furthermore, in patients with no prior thrombohemorrhagic events, the risk for thrombohemorrhagic events was higher with anagrelide treatment than with other CRT (HR 2.20, CI 1.38 to 3.53, P = 0.001). It was confirmed that age > 65 and previous thrombosis increased the risk of thrombohemorrhagic events. An initial platelet count of > 1000×10 9 /L and hypertension were associated with a risk for hemorrhage.

### Clinical outcomes under hydroxyurea treatment in polycythemia vera: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4ca05fdc]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by clonal proliferation of the erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocyte lineages. This disease is recognized for its distinct molecular profile (JAKV 617F mutation) and has a characteristic natural history marked by high frequency of thrombosis and a tendency to transform into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelofibrosis (MF). The first step in approaching an individual patient with PV is to identify the potential risk of developing major thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications. In patients under 60 years of age, carrying only reversible or controllable cardiovascular risk factors and without prior history of thrombosis, phlebotomy (PHL) or low-dose aspirin are recommended. Cytoreductive therapy with either hydroxyurea (HU), a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor considered non-mutagenic, or interferon-alfa (IFN) are appropriate first-line drugs to prevent vascular complications in high-risk patients (age > 60 years and/or prior thrombosis).

Hydroxyurea was recommended in the treatment of high-risk PV based on the results of the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) protocol 08 in which this drug was found to be effective in reducing the rate of thrombotic events in 51 patients compared to historical controls treated with PHL alone. Very few studies were designed to confirm these conclusions. Recently, a propensity score analysis of patients enrolled in the European Collaboration on Low-dose Aspirin in Polycythaemia Vera (ECLAP) trial documented superiority of HU in reducing thrombosis compared with well-matched control patients treated with PHL only. In three recent randomized controlled trials (RCT) in PV, – HU was compared to IFN; unfortunately, the primary end point was not the reduction of vascular complications but included only hematologic response that cannot be considered a surrogate of vascular events. The only demonstration of an antithrombotic efficacy results from two RCT in essential thrombocythemia (ET) in which the drug was superior to chemotherapy-free and to anagrelide control arms. Therefore, the lack of a solid demonstration of thrombosis prevention or survival advantage in PV, and the concern that HU may increase the risk of leukemia led to this drug being under-used in clinical practiceand to suggest that the first-line cytoreductive therapy in PV should be PHL only, irrespective of patient risk category.

High risk (history of thrombosis at any age; or age > 60 years with JAK2 mutation) — initial therapy specifies that cytoreductive therapy with aspirin 81–100 mg/day is recommended, with options including clinical trial, hydroxyurea, peginterferon alfa-2a, or anagrelide; peginterferon alfa-2a can be considered for younger, pregnant, or hydroxyurea-deferring patients, and other pegylated interferons (eg, ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft) are appropriate if peginterferon alfa-2a is unavailable.

### Anagrelide is effective in treating patients with hydroxyurea-resistant thrombocytosis in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [^6c9fbb1a]. Leukemia (2005). Low credibility.

We report phase II trial results of the use of oral anagrelide hydrochloride for treating 38 patients with hydroxyurea (HU)-resistant thrombocytosis accompanying chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Anagrelide's efficacy was well established during a phase II study of more than 400 patients with one of the four myeloproliferative disorders: essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia, idiopathic myelofibrosis, and CML. In the last subgroup, there were 114 CML patients with significant thrombocytosis treated with anagrelide. Out of these patients, 38 had symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage and had thrombocytosis resistant to HU. They were then treated with anagrelide at an initial dose of 2.0 mg/day, followed by modifications based upon response and toxicity. In all, 71% of these patients responded with platelet reductions of more than 50% in a median time of approximately 4 weeks. The response rate was not influenced by age, gender, or prior thrombosis or hemorrhage. Importantly, the response rate to anagrelide in patients refractory to prior HU was essentially the same as that of the other 76 CML patients. Treatment with anagrelide was well tolerated and without undue toxicity. Reduction of excessive platelet counts by anagrelide sometimes occurring in CML may lead to the prevention of thrombohemorrhagic complications occurring in this clinical setting and is relevant even in those patients in whom imatinib mesylate is primary therapy.

### Treatment of essential thrombocythemia in Europe: a prospective long-term observational study of 3649 high-risk patients in the evaluation of anagrelide efficacy and long-term safety study [^457b2cd7]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Blood counts

Platelet levels were well controlled throughout the study across treatment groups (Figure 2). The median counts for 'anagrelide' and 'other CRT' were 431×10⁹/L and 413×10⁹/L at 6 months, respectively, and 390×10⁹/L and 404×10⁹/L at 5 years, respectively. In patients who experienced a major thrombotic event, median platelet counts ranged from 402 to 430×10⁹/L at the time of event, and the percentages of patients with a platelet count ≤ 450×10⁹/L or > 600×10⁹/L were similar in patients with and without thrombosis (data not shown). As expected, median white blood cell (WBC) counts were lower at registration in the 'other CRT' group (6.1×10⁹/L) compared with the 'anagrelide' (8.7×10⁹/L) and 'anagrelide + other CRT' (7.6×10⁹/L) groups (Table 1) throughout the study, and remained relatively stable over time (Figure 2). The WBC count > 15×10⁹/L at any time prior to thrombosis was seen in 4.3% (n = 14/327) compared with 4.9% (n = 162/3322) in patients without thrombosis. The amount of reported WBC data was too low to allow for a Cox regression analysis of any correlation between WBC counts and thrombosis. Notably, 11.4% (n = 50/439) of patients who died during the study had a WBC count > 15×10⁹/L at any time prior to death vs. 4.2% (n = 135/3210) of patients who remained alive. Median hemoglobin levels remained stable throughout the study across all treatment groups (Figure 2), with ranges of 12.3–13.0 g/dL at registration and 12.0–13.0 g/dL at 5 years.

### A long-term study of young patients with essential thrombocythemia treated with anagrelide [^eea560c0]. Haematologica (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) can be complicated by life-threatening thrombosis and has a risk of converting into acute leukemia. Cytoreductive therapy may reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications. Herein, we report the results of a long-term study of patients with ET treated with anagrelide to control thrombocytosis.

Design and Methods

Thirty-nine (34 evaluable) patients (median age, 33 years; 24 previously untreated) were enrolled between 1989–1996; the mean platelet count prior to therapy was 1197×10⁹/L. Only 9 out of 34 evaluable patients were at high risk of thrombosis (platelet count more than 1500×10⁹/L). The initial dose of anagrelide (0.5 mg/bid for 7 days) was increased by 0.5 mg/day (maximum dose: 3 mg/day) until a response was seen.

Results

A complete response (platelets < 450×10⁹/L for > 1 month) was seen in 15 /34 (44%) patients and a partial response (platelets 450–600×10⁹/L for > 1 month) was seen in 17/34 (50%), so that the some kind of response was seen in 32/34 (94%) of the patients at a median time of 4.2 months after starting treatment. Seventeen patients (50%) are still being treated and have achieved platelet control for a maximum follow-up of 12.5 years. Late onset anemia occurred in 4/39 patients. Three out of 39 patients (8%) had cardiac disorders.

Interpretation and Conclusions

Anagrelide appears suitable for controlling thrombocytosis in ET patients over the long-term. This drug may be used in patients younger than 60 years, with the exclusion of women of child-bearing potential and subjects aged 40–60 years with a history of major thrombotic events. Anagrelide should not be administered to patients with cardiac disorders, and a careful approach to patients should include monitoring of heart function before and during treatment.

### A phase III randomized, multicentre, double blind, active controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of two different anagrelide formulations in patients with essential thrombocythaemia-the TEAM-ET 2. 0 trial [^e3870755]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Anagrelide is an established treatment option for essential thrombocythaemia (ET). A prolonged release formulation was developed with the aim of reducing dosing frequency and improving tolerability, without diminishing efficacy. This multicentre, randomized, double blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of anagrelide prolonged release (A-PR) over a reference product in high-risk ET patients, either anagrelide-naïve or -experienced. In a 6 to 12-week titration period the individual dose for the consecutive 4-week maintenance period was identified. The primary endpoint was the mean platelet count during the maintenance period (3 consecutive measurements, day 0, 14, 28). Of 112 included patients 106 were randomized. The mean screening platelet counts were 822 × 10⁹/l (95% confidence interval (CI) 707–936 × 10⁹/l) and 797 × 10⁹/l (95% CI 708–883 × 10⁹/l) for A-PR and the reference product, respectively. Both treatments effectively reduced platelet counts, to mean 281 × 10⁹/l for A-PR (95% CI 254–311) and 305 × 10⁹/l (95% CI 276–337) for the reference product (P < 0.0001, for non-inferiority). Safety and tolerability were comparable between both drugs. The novel prolonged-release formulation was equally effective and well tolerated compared to the reference product. A-PR provides a more convenient dosing schedule and will offer an alternative to licensed immediate-release anagrelide formulations.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia… [^31d64317]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are chronic myeloproliferative diseases. The main goal of treatment in patients with these conditions is to prevent thrombo-hemorrhagic complications. Tefferi and colleagues reviewed the medical literature to summarize the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Polycythemia vera can be diagnosed when a patient has all three major criteria or the first two major criteria plus any two of the minor criteria. Men are more often affected by polycythemia vera than women, and about one fifth of patients present with a thrombotic event. Bleeding complications occur less frequently than thrombotic complications but are more likely in patients who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Other symptoms of polycythemia vera include headaches, transient neurologic or ocular complaints, and paresthesias. Pruritus after bathing may also occur. The risk of thrombosis does not correlate with the degree of thrombocytosis or the level of platelet function, although the number of patients analyzed in studies may not be large enough to show a correlation.

When phlebotomy was the sole treatment of polycythemia vera, the average rate of survival was extended to more than 12 years. Adding chlorambucil therapy to phlebotomy decreased the rate of survival to about nine years. Similarly, radioactive phosphorus plus phlebotomy decreased the rate of survival to less than 11 years. Patients who received these medications also had a higher risk of acquiring acute leukemia than those being treated with phlebotomy alone. However, chlorambucil and radioactive phosphorus were associated with a lower risk of thrombosis than treatment with phlebotomy alone. Patients taking hydroxyurea had lower incidences of early thrombosis and acute leukemia. Based on this information, the authors recommend that all patients with polycythemia vera be treated with phlebotomy; patients at high risk for thrombosis should also receive hydroxyurea.

Essential thrombocythemia is diagnosed after reactive and clonal thrombocytosis are excluded. This can be done by measuring Creactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates and fibrinogen levels. A bone marrow biopsy can rule out other chronic myeloid disorders. Women have essential thrombocythemia more often than men. Vasomotor symptoms such as headaches and paresthesias are more common, while thrombotic and bleeding events are progressively less common. There is a low incidence of transformation into acute leukemia or myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Prognosis is worse in patients older than 60 years and those who have a history of thrombosis. Qualitative or quantitative platelet abnormalities are not consistent predictors of thrombosis risk, although extreme thrombocytosis may be related to a higher incidence of gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage.

### Current management of the myeloproliferative disorders: a case-based review [^19b9dbc3]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Properly managed, the myeloproliferative disorders are generally compatible with prolonged survival. Challenges to the hematologist include knowing when and how best to intervene to prevent and manage complications. The cytoreductive agent of choice for these disorders is currently hydroxyurea, emerging from randomized trials beginning with those of the Polycythemia Vera Study Group.

Objective

To examine the roles and shortcomings of interventions (including hydroxyurea, antiplatelet agents, anagrelide, interferon, thalidomide, alkylating agents, cell cytopheresis, erythropoietins, splenectomy, bone marrow transplantation, and imatinib) for myeloproliferative disorders.

Data Sources

This report uses actual case histories to illustrate the roles and shortcomings of these interventions.

Conclusions

Beyond phlebotomy for polycythemia vera, patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia can be stratified by their risk for thrombosis, which guides the institution of cytoreductive therapies. High-risk patients generally benefit from cytoreductive therapy, and hydroxyurea has emerged as the agent of choice, because alkylating agents (and P32) have high leukemogenic potentials. Anagrelide and interferon are second-line agents. The addition of low-dose aspirin is beneficial for most, helping to prevent arterial thrombotic complications. Therapy in any of these disorders should be tailored to the unique characteristics of the individual patient. With myelofibrosis, therapeutic options run the gamut from observation, erythropoietic stimulators, cytotoxic agents, splenectomy, and bone marrow transplantation. Thalidomide and imatinib have shown some utility. Future challenges are the refinement of individualized treatment strategies and the development of targeted therapies based on rapidly expanding understanding of the molecular perturbations in these disorders.

Limitations

EXELS is not a randomized study, thus treatment arms were not balanced for risk factors or baseline characteristics. The age difference between treatment groups was due to clinicians' treatment preferences. Assessments were only conducted as part of local routine clinical practice, therefore data were missing for variables such as laboratory values and mutation status. Events are few in ET, and even though EXELS is the largest prospective ET study performed, caution must be advocated in the interpretation of statistics, especially for PDEs with low numbers.

### Splanchnic vein thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms: treatment algorithm 2018 [^8b8d1b08]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia

Current guidelines favor hydroxyurea as first-line therapy of ET patients in need of cytoreduction, including those with SVT. Anagrelide or rINFα are the recommended second-line therapy in patients resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea. In a randomized phase II trial of ruxolitinib vs. best available therapy (BAT) in ET patients resistant or intolerant to HU, no evidence of improvement in complete response and in the rates of thrombosis, hemorrhage, and transformation were observed. However, some disease-related symptoms improved in patients receiving ruxolitinib relative to BAT, as reported also in another long-term, uncontrolled phase II study. Thus, at variance of PV, ruxolitinib is not indicated in ET patients resistant or intolerant to HU, with the possible exception of those severely symptomatic, particularly for pruritus.

Primary myelofibrosis

Current prognostication systems in myelofibrosis are based on the risk of mortality rather than of thrombosis –. Thus, the presence of SVT does not change the risk classification of PMF patients and SVT can be observed in all risk categories.

In asymptomatic patients with low or intermediate-1 risk disease according to IPSS/DIPPS/DIPSS plus classifications, there is no evidence to support the value of disease-modifying therapy and observation alone is recommended. Some of these patients might require palliative therapy for anemia, splenomegaly, or constitutional symptoms. If cytoreductive treatment for the reduction of leukocytosis or thrombocytosis is indicated, the first-line drug of choice is hydroxyurea. Ruxolitinib is recommended as first-line approach in PMF patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk disease, not candidates to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). This drug is also indicate in PMF patients with intermediate-1 disease when splenomegaly or systemic symptoms in need of treatment are present.

### A phase III randomized, multicentre, double blind, active controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of two different anagrelide formulations in patients with essential thrombocythaemia-the TEAM-ET 2. 0 trial [^84f6d462]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a sustained elevation in platelet counts (> 450 × 10⁹/l) caused by increased megakaryopoiesis in the bone marrow (Barbui et al, 2015). ET is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and/or haemorrhage, as well as progression to myelofibrosis (Passamonti et al, 2008; Barbui, 2011). The most important risk factors include previous thromboembolic events, age > 60 years, and JAK2 V617F mutation (Barbui et al, 2011; Prajs & Kuliczkowski, 2017). Cytoreductive therapy is recommended for these patients (Barbui et al, 2011).

Anagrelide, an established treatment option for ET (Kanakura et al, 2014; Kreher et al, 2014; Samuelson et al, 2015), was originally developed as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation because, together with its active metabolite 3‐hydroxyanagrelide, it inhibits the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase III within platelets (Fleming & Buyniski, 1979; Ahluwalia et al, 2015; Espasandin et al, 2015). However, even low doses of the drug exert profound thrombocytopenic actions (Silverstein et al, 1988). It was recently demonstrated that anagrelide inhibits the maturation of megakaryocytes and thereby reduces platelet counts (Abe Andes et al, 1984; Ahluwalia et al, 2015). Moreover, anagrelide seems to be more effective in reducing venous thrombosis compared to the second most widely used ET treatment, hydroxycarbamide (also known as hydroxyurea) (Samuelson et al, 2015). In contrast to hydroxycarbamide, anagrelide is thrombocyte‐specific and therefore does not suppress other cell lineages (Fruchtman et al, 2005). Finally, anagrelide treatment may be associated with a lower leukaemogenic risk compared to other treatments (Fruchtman et al, 2005).

### Combination therapy of hydroxycarbamide with anagrelide in patients with essential thrombocythemia in the evaluation of xagrid (R) efficacy and long-term safety study [^4de0fc39]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Available information is limited regarding the use of cytoreductive combination therapy in high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia. This analysis aims to evaluate the clinical relevance and patterns of cytoreductive combination treatment in European high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia in the Evaluation of Xagrid(®) Efficacy and Long-term Safety study. Of 3643 patients, 347 (9.5%) received combination therapy. Data were recorded at each 6-month update. Of 347 patients who received combination therapy, 304 (87.6%) received hydroxycarbamide + anagrelide. Monotherapies received before this combination were hydroxycarbamide (n = 167, 54.9%) and anagrelide (n = 123, 40.5%). Median weekly doses of hydroxycarbamide and anagrelide were: 7000 and 10.5 mg when used as prior monotherapy; 3500 and 7.0 mg when used as add-on treatment. Overall, median platelet counts were 581 × 10(9)/L and 411 × 10(9)/L before and after starting hydroxycarbamide + anagrelide, respectively. In patients with paired data (n = 153), the number of patients with platelet counts less than 400 × 10⁹/L increased from 33 (21.6%) to 74 (48.4%; P < 0.0001), and with platelet counts less than 600 × 10⁹/L, from 82 (53.6%) to 132 (86.3%; P < 0.0001). Hydroxycarbamide + anagrelide was discontinued in 158 patients: 76 (48.1%) stopped hydroxycarbamide, 59 (37.3%) stopped anagrelide, 19 (12.0%) stopped both and 4 (2.5%) had another therapy added. The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were intolerance/side-effects, lack of efficacy, and therapeutic strategy. Combination therapy, usually hydroxycarbamide + anagrelide, is used in approximately 10% of all high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia and may be a useful approach in treating patients for whom monotherapy is unsatisfactory.

### Treatment of essential thrombocythemia in Europe: a prospective long-term observational study of 3649 high-risk patients in the evaluation of anagrelide efficacy and long-term safety study [^27099be6]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

With regard to thrombosis, bleeding and MF transformation, some treatment-related findings arose from the multivariate analysis. Both major thrombosis and arterial thrombosis were higher in the 'anagrelide' group (HR 1.68, CI 1.09 to 2.60, P = 0.02 and HR 1.91, CI 1.20 to 3.04, P = 0.0067, respectively), in line with results of the PT-1 trial, but not the ANAHYDRET study. The main statistical analysis of event rates performed in the overall group showed a lower event rate for major thrombosis and similar event rates for arterial thrombosis in the 'anagrelide' vs. the 'other CRT' groups. However, one has to take into consideration that on the one hand the age difference between the groups could influence the event rate analysis, and on the other hand the uncertainty of a post hoc multivariate analysis. The HR for venous thrombosis was lower with anagrelide treatment (HR 0.43, CI 0.15 to 1.21, P = 0.12, not significant), consistent with the PT-1 trial and the ANAHYDRET study. A new finding was that the combination of anagrelide and smoking may increase the risk for arterial thrombosis vs. smoking plus other CRT (HR 3.18, CI 1.41 to 7.16, P = 0.005, not significant). Another unexpected finding was the increased combined thrombohemorrhagic risk in anagrelide-treated patients (vs. other CRT) with no prior vascular event (HR 2.20, CI 1.38 to 3.53, P = 0.001). The increased risk of hemorrhage with concomitant use of anagrelide and A-A therapy has been previously shown. The higher risk for MF in the anagrelide group, especially in women, is consistent with the event rate analysis and with the PT-1 trial. The higher risk for MF transformation in patients diagnosed according to the PSVG criteria rather than the WHO criteria is in line with previous reports.

### Long-term use of anagrelide in young patients with essential thrombocythemia [^b1b0affd]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

Anagrelide is a novel platelet-lowering agent that has recently been approved for use in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and related disorders. Short-term drug efficacy and toxicity data have previously been presented. The purpose of this study was to obtain additional information regarding long-term anagrelide use. This is a retrospective series of 35 young patients (17 to 48 years) with ET who received anagrelide treatment before 1992. Initial drug dosage ranged between 1 and 10 mg/d, and the median maintenance dosage was 2.5 mg/d. The overall initial response rate of 94% included 74% complete remissions and 20% partial remissions. Of the 33 responding patients, 27 (82%) remained on anagrelide therapy for a median of 10.8 years (range, 7 to 15.5). Of these, 66% maintained a complete and 34% a partial remission over the study period. In general, the reporting of somatic side effects decreased over time, and anemia was the only new side effect that emerged after long-term therapy. Eight patients (24%) experienced a more than 3 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin level. Despite active therapy, 20% of the patients experienced a total of 10 thrombotic episodes, and a similar proportion experienced major hemorrhagic events. All thrombohemorrhagic complications occurred at a platelet count of more than 400 x 10(9)/L. It is concluded that long-term treatment of ET with anagrelide is associated with decreased reporting of initial side effects and the development of mild-to-moderate anemia. Complete normalization of platelet counts may be needed to minimize residual thrombohemorrhagic risk during therapy. (Blood. 2001;97:863–866)

### Essential thrombocythemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^4c4bd968]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Current drug therapy for myeloproliferative neoplasms, including essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV), is neither curative nor has it been shown to prolong survival. Fortunately, prognosis in ET and PV is relatively good, with median survivals in younger patients estimated at 33 and 24 years, respectively. Therefore, when it comes to treatment in ET or PV, less is more and one should avoid exposing patients to new drugs that have not been shown to be disease-modifying, and whose long-term consequences are suspect (e.g., ruxolitinib). Furthermore, the main indication for treatment in ET and PV is to prevent thrombosis and, in that regard, none of the newer drugs have been shown to be superior to the time-tested older drugs (e.g., hydroxyurea). We currently consider three major risk factors for thrombosis (history of thrombosis, JAK2/MPL mutations, and advanced age), in order to group ET patients into four risk categories: "very low risk" (absence of all three risk factors); "low risk" (presence of JAK2/MPL mutations); "intermediate-risk" (presence of advanced age); and "high-risk" (presence of thrombosis history or presence of both JAK2/MPL mutations and advanced age). Herein, we provide a point-of-care treatment algorithm that is risk-adapted and based on evidence and decades of experience.

Preventing major bleeding and thrombosis

Specific prognostic scores for predicting the risk of bleeding and thrombosis in PMF patients are not available. The IPSET-T, that is the prognostic system for thrombosis currently recommended for ET, specifically excluded from the analysis patients re-classified as pre-PMF according to the WHO criteria. Thus, for the time being, a pragmatic approach can be suggested (Fig. 3). In pre-PMF patients without a previous history of bleeding or thrombosis, no treatment is the first option. In selected patients with clinical or laboratory features that are very likely to point to a high risk of thrombosis in pre-PMF, or in other MPNs, such as age > 60 years, general cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking), leukocytosis and presence of JAK2V617F mutation, or with microvascular symptoms (e.g. erythromelalgia), low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) can be considered, provided that a high bleeding risk is ruled out. In patients with previous vascular events, low-dose ASA in arterial or oral anticoagulation in venous thrombosis are recommended. Cytoreductive therapy should be added in the presence of thrombocytosis or leukocytosis and hydroxyurea is the drug of choice. In patients with previous bleeding, or high bleeding risk, such as extreme thrombocytosis with acquired von Willebrand disease –, ASA should be avoided and HU is the recommended treatment. In pre-PMF patients requiring cytoreduction but resistant or intolerant to HU, recombinant interferon-alpha is indicated. Anagrelide is not recommended, since this drug was associated with the development of post-ET myelofibrosis in the randomized PT-1 clinical trial, which based the diagnosis of ET on PVSG criteria and thus did not exclude pre-PMF patients. On the other hand, in a strictly WHO-defined cohort of ET patients a prospective randomized noninferiority phase 3 study provided no evidence for transformation into myelofibrosis.

Concluding remarks

The main objectives of the current perspective are to underscore the prognostic relevance of distinguishing WHO-defined ET from early/prefibrotic MF and to increase awareness regarding the relatively high risk of residual thrombosis in certain group of patients with WHO-defined ET. We believe that these issues constitute actionable challenges and need to be ultimately evaluated in prospective controlled studies. Our recommendations outlined in Figure 1 are neither binding nor absolute. They are simply there to assist those who seek our opinion.

Complications as predefined events

The recorded PDEs included complications of the disease, adverse effects of treatment and non-related adverse events (Table 2). In the first treatment analysis population the most common PDEs (apart from thrombosis and hemorrhage) in the 'anagrelide' group were cardiovascular symptoms (i.e. palpitations and tachycardia), and in the 'other CRT' group non-hematological malignancies and non-PDE death. The same pattern was seen in the overall-treatment population (Online Supplementary Table S1).

Table 2.
Cumulative event rates of other predefined events for the first-treatment analysis population.

The most common cardiovascular events, tachycardia (2.0% vs. 0.1%) and palpitations (1.7% vs. 0.2%), were reported with more frequency in the 'anagrelide' vs. 'other CRT' group (Online Supplementary Table S2). Arrhythmias consisted almost exclusively of atrial fibrillation, which showed similar event rates (0.30 vs. 0.33) in both groups (Online Supplementary Table S1). Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was recorded in one patient each in the 'other CRT' group. Cardiac failure was reported in a very low proportion of patients in the 'anagrelide' and 'other CRT' groups (both < 0.1%, event rates: 0.37 vs. 0.32; Table 2).

Suspected serious adverse reactions

The SSAR event rate was low across all treatments, albeit slightly higher in the 'anagrelide' vs. 'other CRT' group, at 0.86 vs. 0.60, respectively (Online Supplementary Table S3). This difference was predominantly caused by cardiac events, and to a lesser extent by gastrointestinal disorders. No unexpected side effects were noted for anagrelide.

### Management of refractory essential thrombocythemia with anagrelide in a patient undergoing hemodialysis [^a1095cf4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Management of essential thrombocythemia (ET) in high-risk patients is difficult because high platelet numbers can lead to vascular occlusive events and bleeding. Therapeutic interventions in ET are limited to hydroxyurea and anagrelide; however, in Europe, anagrelide is contraindicated in patients with chronic renal disease.

Objective

The aim of this case report was to describe the use of anagrelide in a patient with ET and renal impairment.

Case Summary

A 73-year-old white female patient with severe renal impairment who was diagnosed with ET was receiving treatment with hydroxyurea 1 g/d since 2001. At this time she was also receiving aspirin 80 mg/d; calcium carbonate 1 g/d; pravastatin 40 mg/d; folic acid 5 mg/d; furosemide 40 mg/d; cetirizine 10 mg/d; erythropoietin 10,000 U once monthly; a vitamin B complex, 1 tablet a day; and iron tablets 105 mg/d. In February 2007, because her white blood cell count fell to 2.1 x 10(9)/L, myelodepression was suspected and hydroxyurea was stopped. This led to enhanced platelet levels and the introduction of anagrelide at an initial dose of 0.5 mg/d that was steadily increased to 2.5 mg/d. All other treatments were continued with some dosage adjustments. Sodium bicarbonate 1 g/d and vitamin D were added to her regimen. After 18 months of anagrelide treatment, a sudden but moderate fall of platelets to 142 x 10(3)/microL with severe anemia (hemoglobin, 6.5 g/dL) was observed. The patient had anemia since 2004, but the condition worsened due to bleeding related to an ulcer at the cecal valve. The patient refused blood and platelet transfusions and surgical intervention for religious reasons. Because of hemodynamic instability, she was admitted to the intensive care unit in December 2008 and died 24 hours after admission.

Conclusion

We report a case of ET and chronic renal failure treated with anagrelide and low-dose aspirin in a patient who did not receive transfusion and surgical intervention due to religious reasons, and had a fatal outcome.

### A phase III randomized, multicentre, double blind, active controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of two different anagrelide formulations in patients with essential thrombocythaemia-the TEAM-ET 2. 0 trial [^1611eb1b]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the Table SI. Briefly, patients diagnosed with ET according to the 2008 World Health Organization criteria (Tefferi & Vardiman, 2008) and at a high risk, with or without prior treatment, were available for inclusion.

Patients were randomized to receive an A‐PR or RP in a 1:1 ratio. Participants were allocated to unique identification numbers in sequential order according to their admission to the study. Randomization was performed using an interactive web response system that assigned a kit number to one of the two treatments. The randomization was stratified based on previous anagrelide exposure and age (< 60/ ≥ 60 years of age). After randomization, patients entered a titration period, which lasted 6–12 weeks. As soon as two consecutive platelet counts were "stable" (definition of "stable" see supplementary information) patients entered the maintenance period, which lasted for 4 weeks. The end of study and safety follow‐up visit was 28 days after the end of the maintenance period. An overview of the trial design is presented in Fig 1. An independent safety data monitoring committee was established as an additional safety measure. Both patients and treating physicians were blinded.

Pregnancy

Most subjects became pregnant while receiving IFN or no CRT. Of the 54 pregnancies, 75.9% resulted in live births, a better result than has been seen in many other reports, which may reflect a development in patient management during pregnancy and the selection of patients who chose to become pregnant. Almost all miscarriages occurred during the first trimester, which supports the review of Valera et al. There were too few miscarriages to make any comparison between treatment groups. The high percentage of successful pregnancies in this large study may support clinicians' decisions to give their patients positive information with regard to the chance for planned childbirth.

Multivariate risk factor analysis

Multivariate analyses were performed both in the overall- and first-treatment populations. These were post hoc analyses and results must therefore be interpreted with caution; however, given the age imbalance between the patient populations, the data are important to assess alongside the event rates. Risk factors identified for thrombohemorrhagic events and for major thrombosis included age, history of thrombosis or hemorrhage, and cardiovascular risk factors, previously reported in retrospective studies. – In line with the International Prognostic Score of thrombosis in World Health Organization-essential thrombocythemia (IPSET-thrombosis) risk score model, the WBC count was not indicative of higher thrombosis risk. Platelets > 1000×10⁹/L indicated a higher risk for MF transformation, consistent with both previous retrospective studies and the role of clonal megakaryocytes in the development of fibrosis. WBC counts > 15×10 9 /L during the study were more common in patients who died.

Risk-adapted therapy: "high-risk" disease

Decades ago, "high-risk" disease in ET was defined by the presence of one of three clinical parameters: history of thrombosis, advanced age, and long duration of thrombocytosis. Subsequently, in a randomized study using hydroxyurea for high-risk disease, patients with platelet count > 1500 × 10(9)/L were excluded because it was felt that such patients required treatment because of increased bleeding diathesis. Over the years, it has become evident that extreme thrombocytosis in ET did not, by itself, increase thrombosis risk and might actually be associated with a reduced risk of arterial thrombosis. Also, the bleeding diathesis associated with extreme thrombocytosis has been linked to AVWS, which might occur both in the presence and absence of extreme thrombocytosis, and is effectively screened for and managed appropriately. Therefore, platelet count per se should no longer be used for risk stratification in ET.

Regardless, management of "traditionally high-risk" ET has been primarily guided by results of a randomized study of hydroxyurea vs no cytoreductive treatment, in high-risk patients, with the goal of keeping the platelet count below 600 × 10⁹/L; the study showed a statistically significant benefit for hydroxyurea therapy (thrombosis rate of 3.6 vs 24%). Since then, unsuccessful attempts have been made to improve upon hydroxyurea treatment in ET. Accordingly, hydroxyurea, combined with once-daily aspirin therapy, remains the standard of care for contemporarily classified "high-risk" patients (Fig. 1). However, there is room for improvement in our conventional treatment approach, and we underscore the need to maximize anti-thrombotic activity, by shortening the aspirin dosing schedule to every 12 h, for patients with history of arterial thrombosis, and securing long-term systemic anticoagulation, in patients with history of venous thrombosis (Fig. 1). In addition, it is reasonable to continue with once-daily aspirin therapy, along with systemic anticoagulation, in patients who are at risk for arterial thrombosis (Fig. 1). In this regard, there is evidence for the additional value of aspirin therapy in the prevention of recurrent venous thrombosis.

### Cerebrovascular manifestations in hematological diseases: an update [^4a7d7c2b]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

MPN should also be considered as a possible cause of cerebral venous thrombosis in middle-aged/elderly patients (Fig. 1). MPN are also a risk factor for CVT recurrence. Hemorrhagic stroke is very rare in MPN, but may be fatal. A recent report confirmed the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhages and subarachnoid convexity hemorrhage in MPN.

The current algorithm treatment for patients with PV and ET recommends a careful assessment of cardiovascular risk factors and the use of low-dose aspirin (80–100 mg), unless contraindicated. Erythromelalgia and atypical TIAs also respond to aspirin, which is an irreversible inhibitor of platelet COX-1 activity. Antiplatelet drugs with other mechanisms of action are ineffective. Twice-daily aspirin dosing may be considered in low-risk patients whose microvascular symptoms are not adequately controlled with once-daily dosing or in those with cardiovascular risk factors and a leukocytosis (> 15,000/μL). In PV, erythrocytosis should be controlled by phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit below 45%.

The risk of thrombotic events modulates the need for cytoreductive therapy, in addition to aspirin and phlebotomies. In high-risk PV patients for thrombotic events, defined as having a prior thrombotic event (e.g. stroke) and/or age > 60 years, pharmacological therapy is needed to lower and control the red blood cell. Other risk factors in high-risk PV patients include other vascular risk factors for ischemic stroke or CVT, and JAK2 mutations. Hydroxyurea is the most commonly used cytoreductive drug. Busulfan is an alternative in older patients, while younger patients may receive interferon α and/or anagrelide. Recently, effective and nongenotoxic JAK inhibitors (ruxolitinib and fedratinib) have been developed and may be used in patients refractory to first-line therapies.

### Therapeutic options for patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia refractory / resistant to hydroxyurea [^b13882dd]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Hydroxyurea (HU) has traditionally been the first-line treatment for patients with polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) at high risk for vascular complications. However, approximately 20–25% of patients develop resistance or intolerance to HU and must be treated with second-line therapies. Resistance is associated with disease transformation and reduced survival. However, given the dearth of large-scale controlled clinical trials in this patient population, there is no clear consensus on how to best treat patients who develop resistance or intolerance to HU. Herein, we review current literature on treatment options for patients with HU-refractory/resistant PV or ET and provide recommendations for treating these patients.

Platelet control, white blood cell count and thrombosis

Generally, platelet counts were well controlled throughout the study. No obvious advantage for protection against thrombosis by reducing platelet counts to values below 450×10 9 /L was seen. Of note, in EXELS, platelet levels were already well controlled at registration. These results suggest that platelet counts do not provide a prognostic value for thrombosis in patients with reasonable platelet control. In contrast, other studies indicate an effect on thrombosis rate by platelet control, – and two recent studies show a higher platelet count at time of event for patients with thrombosis. Taken together, it remains uncertain whether reducing platelets to normal levels gives better protection against thrombosis compared with a more tolerant treatment goal. This does not alter the treatment goal in general, but is of importance in situations with moderate treatment efficacy or side effects. Notably, WBC > 15×10 9 /L did not correlate with thrombotic events, and anagrelide was not associated with a time-dependent hemoglobin-lowering effect.

Safety

The most common cardiovascular adverse events associated with anagrelide in our study were palpitation and tachycardia, in line with previous reports, and caused by the PDEIII inhibition and positive chronotropic effect of anagrelide. However, the rate of atrial fibrillation was similar for both groups (0.30 vs. 0.33), and other, more severe arrhythmias were rare in both groups. Likewise, heart failure had similar event rates in both groups, which contrast with previous reports that anagrelide may worsen cardiac failure due to the positive chronotropic effect. The difference in median age between the treatment groups may have contributed to this.

Overall, the SSAR event rate was low, with a slightly higher rate in the 'anagrelide' compared with the 'other CRT' group, predominantly caused by the difference in cardiac event rates for events like tachycardia and palpitations. Cardiac symptoms reported in this study are consistent with the known safety profile for anagrelide.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Clinical Studies in Adult Patients:

A total of 942 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms including 551 patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), 117 patients with Polycythemia Vera (PV), 178 patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), and 96 patients with other myeloproliferative neoplasms (OMPN), were treated with anagrelide in three clinical trials. Patients with OMPN included 87 patients who had Myeloid Metaplasia with Myelofibrosis (MMM), and 9 patients who had unclassified myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Patients were enrolled in clinical trials if their platelet count was ≥ 900,000/μL on two occasions or ≥ 650,000/μL on two occasions with documentation of symptoms associated with thrombocythemia. The mean duration of anagrelide therapy for ET, PV, CML, and OMPN patients was 65, 67, 40, and 44 weeks, respectively; 23% of patients received treatment for 2 years. Patients were treated with anagrelide starting at doses of 0.5 to 2 mg every 6 hours. The dose was increased if the platelet count was still high, but to no more than 12 mg each day. Efficacy was defined as reduction of platelet count to or near physiologic levels (150,000 to 400,000/μL). The criteria for defining subjects as "responders" were reduction in platelets for at least 4 weeks to ≤ 600,000/μL, or by at least 50% from baseline value. Subjects treated for less than 4 weeks were not considered evaluable. The results are depicted graphically below:

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera diagnosed before 20 years of age: a systematic review [^93fd2eef]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

As expected in this population, there was a very low number of high-risk patients (5.7%) based on a history of thrombosis (data on the number of patients with platelet counts over 1500×10 9 /L were not available). Despite the low percentage of high-risk patients, most of the subjects were treated with a cytoreductive drug or related therapy (60.8%). The description of the treatments is available in Table 2. The reasons for prescribing these treatments were not explained.

Most of the ET patients received what would be regarded as non-leukemogenic drugs, such as anagrelide (20.9%) or interferon (4.6%). Most of the PV patients were treated with phlebotomy (45.2% plus 6.5% erythropheresis), but a substantial proportion of them also received hydroxycarbamide (25.8%). The use of interferon seemed quite uncommon (9.7%), even for the pegylated formulation (one-third of the interferon-treated population). Interestingly, ruxolitinib (a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor) was prescribed in only one explicit case (three other cases were cited in a phase II trial, but without available data). Surprisingly, 16.1% of the PV patients were treated with melphalan, busulfan, radioactive phosphorus or allogeneic stem cell transplantation: most of these patients were treated in the 1980s and are represented by one cohort of patients.

Transformation and malignancies

In the first-treatment analysis, 64 patients transformed to MF, 31 to AL, and 12 to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; Table 4). The rate of transformation to MF was higher in the 'anagrelide' compared with the 'other CRT' group (1.04 vs. 0.30). Transformation to AL was higher in the 'other CRT' compared with the 'anagrelide' group (0.28 vs. 0.07), and transformation to MDS only occurred in the 'other CRT' group (event rate: 0.12). Similar proportions were seen in the overall treatment analysis (Table 4). For patients who had only ever received one type of CRT, the rate of transformation to MF was still higher in the 'anagrelide' compared with the 'HC' group (0.61 vs. 0.14); the median time to transformation was similar, around 7 years (range: 0.95–20.62). The rate of transformation to AL in the 'anagrelide' group was 0 vs. 0.22 in patients treated with HC alone, while the median time to transformation was 6.48 years from diagnosis (range: 1.21–22.09) for the 'HC' group. High platelet levels at baseline were identified in the multivariate analysis as a risk factor for MF transformation (hazard ratio [HR] 1.18, P = 0.0004); the risk of MF increased for each increased platelet count of 100×10⁹/L.

Treatment recommendations

Figure 1 summarizes our current treatment algorithm in WHO-defined ET, which takes into account the observations from the above-described IWG-MRT and other studies. In this regard, we find it practically useful to consider three layers of classification based on thrombosis history (no thrombosis vs arterial thrombosis vs venous thrombosis), age (< 60 years vs older) and presence or absence of cardiovascular risk factors or JAK2 V617F.

Observation alone is acceptable in asymptomatic young patients without thrombosis history, cardiovascular risk factors or JAK2 V617F. Such patients should avoid aspirin use in the presence of platelet count > 1000 × 10 9 /l (aspirin therapy in such cases might increase bleeding risk). The presence of microvascular symptoms, cardiovascular risk factors or JAK2 V617F in young, otherwise low-risk patients with ET justifies the use of once-daily aspirin therapy; in at least one study, the presence of cardiovascular symptoms or JAK2 V617F was associated with increased risk of venous and arterial thrombosis, respectively. Persistence of microvascular symptoms despite once-daily aspirin dosing or presence of both cardiovascular risk factors and JAK2 V617F is a reasonable rationale to consider using twice-daily aspirin dosing, provided platelet count is < 1000 × 10 9 /l.

Thrombosis history in young patients with ET mandates cytoreductive therapy. Our first-line drug of choice, in this regard, is hydroxyurea and second-line drug of choice pegylated interferon. The goal would be to adequately control myeloproliferation and keep leukocyte and platelet counts in the normal range. In addition, patients with venous thrombosis might require systemic anticoagulation, whereas those with arterial events are treated with once-daily aspirin. The duration of systemic anticoagulation depends on whether or not the venous event was provoked (6 months) or unprovoked (indefinite). 'Provoked' in this instance includes inadequately treated disease. Because cytoreductive therapy ameliorates the increased platelet turnover associated with ET, twice-daily aspirin therapy might not be necessary in this instance, even in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors or JAK2 V617F.

Consensus guidelines have helped to standardize the care of patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, focusing on reducing the risk of thrombosis, mitigating symptoms, and avoiding therapies that may accelerate disease progression. However, many unmet needs still exist ranging from the roll of antiplatelet therapy in ET to medications that reduce disease progression. Retrospective studies suggest an improvement in myelofibrosis-free survival for treatment with interferons; new agents are looking to also enact disease modification.

Therapy for essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) is aimed at reducing thrombotic risk through normalizing blood counts. Mascarenhas et al report on a randomized trial of hydroxyurea (HU) vs pegylated interferon α (PEG) in 168 patients with ET and PV who are at a high risk for vascular complications. They found that there is no significant difference between the 2 agents in CR rates at 12 months or in the rates of thrombotic events and disease progression. In an accompanying Perspective, Jason Gotlib places these results in the context of other studies, emphasizing the place of standard aspirin and phlebotomy, and speculating on the best use of HU, PEG, ruxolitinib, and novel agents in the treatment of ET and PV, while outlining gaps in our understanding that limit the certainty of management decisions.

Introduction

The BCR-ABL1 -negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of hematological malignancies including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF). PV is characterized by excessive production of progenitors and mature cells of the erythroid lineage with increased red cells, white blood cells, and platelets, whereas ET features hyperplasia of megakaryocytic lineage, and MF involves bone marrow fibrosis and granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineage expansion –. There is significant heterogeneity in symptom burden both within and between MPN subtypes, but all are characterized by vascular and hemorrhagic complications, and evolution to myelodysplasia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and/or fibrotic spent phase, with significant impact on patients' quality of life and reduced survival.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network added MPNs to their guidelines in the autumn of 2016, with specific treatment guidelines for PV added in the summer of 2017. In January 2018, the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) published revised management recommendations for MPNs. According to these, current therapies aim to normalize hematocrit by use of phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin, if not contraindicated. Hydroxyurea is used as first-line therapy when cytoreduction is necessary, although toxicity can result in inadequate disease management. Ruxolitinib is second-line therapy for patients who are refractory and/or intolerant to hydroxyurea; other treatments include busulfan, and non-pegylated and pegylated interferon (off-label), but use is limited by side effects and safety concerns. More recently, ropeginterferon α-2b was approved by the European Medicines Agency as first-line therapy for patients with PV without symptomatic splenomegaly when cytoreduction is necessary, having demonstrated non-inferiority to hydroxyurea in a Phase 3 study. Hydroxyurea is also first-line therapy for patients with ET who need cytoreduction, with pegylated interferon and anagrelide used second-line or in selected cases (the very young or, in the case of pegylated interferon, during pregnancy). In MF, the only therapeutic approach to impact disease progression is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, but this is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and although ruxolitinib has been approved in both the US and Europe, the authors of the ELN management recommendations consider its use justified only in specific settings. Novel, targeted therapies are, therefore, needed for MPNs.

### A phase III randomized, multicentre, double blind, active controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of two different anagrelide formulations in patients with essential thrombocythaemia-the TEAM-ET 2. 0 trial [^875011ca]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Anagrelide is an established treatment option for essential thrombocythaemia. A prolonged release formulation was developed with the aim of reducing dosing frequency and improving tolerability, without diminishing efficacy. This multicentre, randomized, double blind, active‐controlled, non‐inferiority trial investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of anagrelide prolonged release (A‐) over a reference product in high‐riskpatients, either anagrelide‐naïve or ‐experienced. In a 6 to 12‐week titration period the individual dose for the consecutive 4‐week maintenance period was identified. The primary endpoint was the mean platelet count during the maintenance period (3 consecutive measurements, day 0, 14, 28). Of 112 included patients 106 were randomized. The mean screening platelet counts were 822 × 10 9 /l (95% confidence interval 707–936 × 10 9 /l) and 797 × 10 9 /l (95%708–883 × 10 9 /l) for A‐and the reference product, respectively. Both treatments effectively reduced platelet counts, to mean 281 × 10 9 /l for A‐(95%254–311) and 305 × 10 9 /l (95%276–337) for the reference product (P < 0.0001, for non‐inferiority). Safety and tolerability were comparable between both drugs. The novel prolonged‐release formulation was equally effective and well tolerated compared to the reference product. A‐provides a more convenient dosing schedule and will offer an alternative to licensed immediate‐release anagrelide formulations.

UCN4: improving the dosing regimens of aspirin in ET

No randomized trials have addressed the safety and efficacy of low-dose-aspirin (LDA) in ET such that, except for high-risk patients –, no definite data are available on its efficacy and safety, either alone or in association with hydroxyurea or anagrelide. The use of LDA in ET is justified based on indirect evidence and favorable results coming from the ECLAP study in PV. However, based on new prognostic scores in ET, observation alone is considered a viable option for "very low-risk" patients (aged < 60 years, without history of thrombosis and/or risk factors, and unmutated JAK2V607F). In absence of contraindications, all other patients are thought to benefit from LDA therapy. However, this indication does not apply to secondary prophylaxis in which LDA is clearly indicated.

Single doses of 70–100 mg nonenteric-coated aspirin are not questioned, since even 75 mg is at least twice as high as the lowest dose necessary and sufficient to fully inhibit platelet COX-1 activity with repeated daily dosing. However, preclinical evidence supports more frequent dosing due to accelerated renewal of platelet COX-1 secondary to the increased platelet production in ET, as indicated by the increased rate of immature platelets and by the measurement of serum TXB2. Measurement of this surrogate biomarker of aspirin efficacy showed that platelets from 80% of aspirin-treated ET patients were inadequately inhibited by the traditional, once-daily, low-dose regimen. Hence, extrapolation to ET patients of the 100-mg once-daily regimen, borrowed from PV and cardiovascular disorders, does not seem to be justified in light of altered aspirin pharmacodynamics in ET.

A twice-daily regimen of 100 mg aspirin successfully improved the inhibition of serum TXB 2 in a small, proof-of-concept study, and this schedule is already advised in high-risk patients. On the other hand, twice-daily dosing may reduce compliance, inhibit prostacyclin (PGI 2) and increase bleeding.

### Molecular basis of the diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^8ec48551]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are challenging the traditional diagnostic classification of these myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs). Clonality analysis using X-chromosome inactivation patterns has revealed apparent heterogeneity among the MPDs. The recently discovered single somatic activating point mutation in the JAK2 gene (JAK2-V617F) is found in the great majority of patients with PV, but also in many patients with phenotypically classified ET and other MPDs. In contrast to the acquired MPDs, mutations of the erythropoietin receptor and thrombopoietin receptor have been identified in familial forms of nonclonal erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively. The mechanisms of major clinical complications of PV and ET remain poorly understood. Quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of red cells and platelets do not provide clear explanations for the thrombotic and bleeding tendency in these MPDs, suggesting the need for entirely new lines of research in this area. Recently reported randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in PV, and an excess rate of arterial thrombosis, major bleeding, and myelofibrotic transformation, but decreased venous thrombosis, in patients with ET treated with anagrelide plus aspirin compared to hydroxyurea plus aspirin.
