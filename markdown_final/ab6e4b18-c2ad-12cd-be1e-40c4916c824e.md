## Question

What to prescribe for the patient having loose stools after distal pancreatectomy and partial gastrectomy. Loperamide isn't working

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to prescribe for persistent loose stools after distal pancreatectomy and partial gastrectomy when loperamide has failed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely etiologies of diarrhea in this postoperative anatomy. Then, I should verify that loperamide was optimized correctly and safely. Next, I will consider second-line antidiarrheals and when to escalate to octreotide. After that, I need to evaluate for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and bile acid diarrhea and outline targeted therapy. Finally, I should confirm supportive measures, monitoring, and when to involve nutrition or surgery, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and likely mechanisms. Distal pancreatectomy reduces pancreatic enzyme output and predisposes to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with steatorrhea, while partial gastrectomy accelerates gastric emptying and can cause dumping physiology with osmotic and secretory diarrhea; both surgeries can alter bile acid handling and promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, all of which can perpetuate diarrhea despite loperamide [^f44820e1] [^3272d3ec].

> Wait, let me verify that loperamide was truly optimized before moving on. The FDA-labeled maximum is 16 mg/day, typically 4 mg initially then 2 mg after each unformed stool, and in short bowel or high-output states, doses up to 32 mg/day have been used off-label with caution, ideally given 30 minutes before meals to maximize effect; I should confirm dose, timing, and duration, and ensure we did not stop prematurely after 48 hours if chronic diarrhea persists [^8a51ed91] [^c3c80314] [^9aa4f697].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check for red flags that would contraindicate loperamide escalation, such as fever, blood in stool, or suspected infectious colitis, and I should confirm that we excluded C. difficile and other infections before intensifying antidiarrheals, because antimotility agents can worsen inflammatory or infectious diarrhea and increase risk of toxic megacolon [^39c39dc6] [^8f9b2e58].

> Next, I should review second-line antidiarrheals. Diphenoxylate-atropine is a reasonable alternative or adjunct when loperamide is insufficient; typical dosing is 5 mg diphenoxylate with 0.05 mg atropine, up to four times daily, with careful attention to anticholinergic effects and the risk of paralytic ileus, especially in older adults or those with autonomic neuropathy [^9168bd1f] [^48fb3865].

> I will now examine when to escalate to octreotide. For refractory secretory or high-output diarrhea, particularly when fluid and electrolyte losses are problematic, octreotide 100–150 mcg subcutaneously every 8 hours is supported for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea and has evidence in dumping syndrome; continuous IV infusion 25–50 mcg/hour is reserved for severe cases with dehydration or inpatient management, and I should confirm that we have addressed reversible causes before committing to long-term somatostatin analogs [^f105574d] [^737f4b85] [^13550f28] [^3272d3ec].

> But wait, what if the diarrhea is steatorrheic or meal-related with urgency and oiliness. I need to check for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and initiate a therapeutic trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, typically starting with 40,000–50,000 units of lipase per meal and titrating to effect; a 10-day trial with dietary counseling is usually sufficient to assess response, and I should confirm that we are not masking another process if symptoms persist despite adequate PERT [^c94b5ef4] [^7935ba0e].

> Let me consider bile acid diarrhea next. After distal pancreatectomy and gastric resection, bile acid malabsorption is plausible; I should trial a bile acid sequestrant such as cholestyramine 4 g once or twice daily, titrating to effect, or consider colesevelam if cholestyramine is not tolerated, and I should remember that on-demand dosing can be reasonable once a response is established [^d56562fa] [^558a4a66] [^8381b7f4].

> I should confirm that we are not missing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Given altered anatomy and possible blind loops, SIBO is a recognized contributor to postoperative diarrhea; if suspected, I should treat with appropriate antibiotics and then consider probiotics or dietary strategies to reduce recurrence, recognizing that evidence quality varies and that recurrence is common [^f44820e1] [^c94b5ef4].

> Next, I should review supportive measures that meaningfully reduce stool output. Small, frequent, low-fat meals with separation of solids and liquids, avoidance of hyperosmolar supplements, and use of soluble fiber can improve consistency; for dumping physiology, acarbose 25–50 mg with meals can blunt late reactive hypoglycemia and reduce osmotic load, and I need to ensure adequate hydration with oral rehydration solutions rather than large volumes of hypotonic fluids [^3272d3ec] [^0e3bea37].

> Hold on, I should verify that we are monitoring the right endpoints. I will track stool frequency and consistency, watch for dehydration and electrolyte derangements, and reassess every 3–5 days after each intervention to avoid changing too many variables at once; if diarrhea remains severe or life-threatening, I should escalate to inpatient care, parenteral support, and early multidisciplinary input from gastroenterology, surgery, and nutrition [^a79fbf76] [^c94b5ef4].

> Let me reconsider the sequence to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm loperamide optimization and exclude infection. Second, add diphenoxylate-atropine if needed. Third, introduce PERT if steatorrhea is present. Fourth, trial a bile acid sequestrant for suspected BAD. Fifth, consider octreotide for refractory secretory or high-output diarrhea. Sixth, evaluate for SIBO and treat if present. Throughout, employ dietary and fluid strategies and monitor closely, adjusting one therapy at a time with adequate intervals to judge response [^c3c80314] [^c94b5ef4] [^f105574d].

For persistent loose stools after distal pancreatectomy and partial gastrectomy when loperamide fails, the next step is to **initiate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT)** [^c94b5ef4] to treat exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which is common after distal pancreatectomy and often causes steatorrhea and diarrhea [^b8b5e089]. If diarrhea persists, **add a bile acid sequestrant** (cholestyramine or colesevelam) [^d56562fa] for bile acid diarrhea, which can occur after gastric surgery [^f44820e1]. For refractory cases, consider octreotide [^f105574d] to reduce secretions and transit [^c3c80314], and use loperamide with diphenoxylate/atropine [^48fb3865] alternately to avoid tachyphylaxis. Always reassess for other causes (SIBO, medications, dietary triggers) and monitor for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance [^c94b5ef4].

---

## Step 1: evaluate and optimize loperamide therapy

Before adding new agents, **confirm loperamide was optimized**: 4 mg initially, then 2 mg after each loose stool, up to 16 mg/day [^8a51ed91]. If not optimized, adjust dosing and reassess; if already optimized and ineffective, proceed to next steps [^9aa4f697].

---

## Step 2: initiate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT)

Distal pancreatectomy often causes exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) [^b8b5e089], leading to steatorrhea and diarrhea. Initiate **PERT** [^c94b5ef4] (e.g. pancrelipase) with meals, starting at 40,000–50,000 units of lipase per meal and titrating to effect. A 10-day trial is usually sufficient to assess response [^c94b5ef4].

---

## Step 3: consider bile acid sequestrants

After gastric surgery, bile acid diarrhea (BAD) is common [^f44820e1]; if diarrhea persists despite PERT, **trial a bile acid sequestrant** such as cholestyramine 4 g once or twice daily [^d56562fa] or colesevelam 625 mg once or twice daily [^notfound]. Titrate to effect and monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.

---

## Step 4: escalate to octreotide for refractory diarrhea

For persistent diarrhea despite PERT and bile acid sequestrants, **octreotide** 100–150 mcg subcutaneously every 8 hours [^f105574d] can reduce secretions and slow transit [^c3c80314]. Reserve for refractory cases due to cost and injection-site reactions.

---

## Step 5: alternate antidiarrheal agents

To avoid tachyphylaxis, **alternate loperamide with diphenoxylate/atropine** [^48fb3865] (5 mg/0.05 mg, up to four times daily). This strategy can improve control in refractory cases.

---

## Step 6: address other potential causes

Persistent diarrhea warrants evaluation for **other causes**:

- **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)**: common after gastric surgery; consider breath testing and treat with antibiotics if positive [^f44820e1].
- **Medications**: review for drugs that cause diarrhea (e.g. metformin, magnesium, antibiotics).
- **Dietary triggers**: lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption, or high FODMAP intake may contribute [^f44820e1].

---

## Step 7: monitor for complications

Chronic diarrhea can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance; **monitor fluid status**, electrolytes, and nutritional parameters regularly [^c94b5ef4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Best Practice Advice 6: Pharmacologic therapy — Antimotility and antisecretory agents are frequently necessary to control stool losses in SBS. Massive enterectomy–related gastric hypersecretion and hypergastrinemia may last 6–12 months postoperatively, and antisecretory medications (proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 receptor antagonists) are beneficial; some specialists have suggested that acid-suppressing agents should be used sparingly beyond 12 months unless there is clear evidence of persistent benefit. Octreotide may reduce secretions and slow transit but has not been shown to improve absorption or reduce the need for PN, may worsen malabsorption, should generally be reserved for large stool losses with problematic fluid and electrolyte management, and should be avoided during the period of intestinal adaptation. Antidiarrheals reduce motility; commonly used agents include loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine, codeine, and tincture of opium, with loperamide preferred because it is not addictive or sedative; use should be guided by objective measurements of stool output, and loperamide and codeine may have a synergistic effect. In SBS without an ileum, high loperamide doses are frequently needed (ie, up to 16 tablets [32 mg]/d), and these agents seem to be most effective when administered about 30 minutes before meals.

For SG-related any-grade diarrhea, we recommend initiating treatment with 4 mg of oral loperamide, followed by 2 mg thereafter with each episode, to a maximum dose of 16 mg/day until resolved. If diarrhea is not resolved after 24 hours or the patient is experiencing 3–4 stools per day when at a near maximum loperamide dose, oral 5 mg diphenoxylate-0.05 mg atropine sulfate should be considered 4 times daily, to a maximum dose of 20 mg diphenoxylate-0.2 mg atropine sulfate per day until control is achieved. Discontinue diphenoxylate-atropine use if clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days of administering the maximum dose. Because the severity of diarrhea associated with SG can vary widely by case, some patients may benefit from alternating loperamide with diphenoxylate-atropine administration. We have used loperamide prophylactically (not routine) and administered loperamide alternating with diphenoxylate-atropine. The PRIMED study included an investigation of the use of prophylactic loperamide with SG therapy, with loperamide given for 3 consecutive days after SG administration (ie, Days 2, 3, and 4 and Days 9, 10, and 11) for the first 2 cycles (with the option to extend to the next cycle based on the physician's discretion). Rates of diarrhea (34%)were lower compared with those reported in the ASCENT (65%)and TROPiCS-02 (62%)studies (Table 1). Constipation was observed in 46% of patients in PRIMED; whereas rates of 37% and 19% were observed in ASCENT and TROPiCS-02, respectively. Octreotide (100–150 μg, may increase to 500–2000 μg intravenous [IV] or SQ 3 times daily; discontinue within 24 hours of resolution to reduce risk of ileus) can also be effective with unusual cases of persisting diarrhea. However, the octreotide injection is painful, and ice on the injection site may be helpful. Additionally, patients should hydrate with oral or IV fluids as needed.

Refractory carcinoid syndrome — nonspecific antidiarrheals may be added to SSAs when diarrhea is the main symptom: Nonspecific antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide or diphenoxylate may be offered in addition to SSAs if the main symptom of refractory carcinoid syndrome is diarrhea, taking into account the risk of adverse events (Evidence quality: Low; Strength of recommendation: Conditional). When considering optimal antidiarrheal use, loperamide is approximately 3 times more potent milligram for milligram than diphenoxylate.

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is seen in over 50% of patients taking alpelisib with reported ranges of 52%–60% in clinical trial data. It is usually mild, but grade 3 or 4 toxicity has been seen in up to 6.7% of patients. Once other causes of diarrhea are excluded (e.g. infection), some general guidelines should be implemented, such as stopping all lactose-containing products, alcohol, laxatives, bulk fiber and stool softeners, as well as high-osmolar food supplements such as Ensure Plus ® (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and Jevity Plus ® (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) (with fiber). Patients should be encouraged to stay hydrated by drinking at least 8–10 large glasses of clear liquids per day. Additionally, eating frequent small meals (e.g. bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast) is strongly recommended.

If diarrhea persists with above measures, patients should be instructed to start oral loperamide [initial administration of 4 mg, then 2 mg every 4 h (maximum of 16 mg/day)] at the first sign of loose stool or symptoms of abdominal pain. Persistent symptoms may require the administration of high-dose loperamide followed by treatment with second-line agents such as opium tincture and octreotide acetate based on severity and duration of diarrhea and related signs/symptoms. Octreotide acetate can be administered subcutaneously 100–150 µg every 8 h, and dosing of opium tincture with 10–15 drops (10 mg/ml) in water every 3–4 h has been shown to be effective in managing cancer treatment-associated diarrhea. Another first-line treatment of diarrhea is diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate. This medication may be used in place of loperamide; however, it is important to note that loperamide and diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate must not be used in conjunction with one another antidirrheal agent due to the risk of developing paralytic ileus. For severe cases of diarrhea, treatment with alpelisib should be interrupted. However, once the diarrhea improves, it can be restarted at a lower dose.

Nonoperative management — Dietary and medical management are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with fecal incontinence (FI), and 22% to 54% of patients with FI report improved symptoms after behavior modification regarding dietary habits and fluid management and changes to medications. In randomized evidence, a randomized controlled trial comparing 39 patients treated with either fiber supplementation or placebo showed that the fiber supplementation group decreased their percentage of incontinent stools to less than half that in the placebo group and had an improvement in stool consistency. A Cochrane review analyzed 16 randomized trials (558 pooled patients) using medications other than fiber and noted that antidiarrheal drugs such as loperamide or diphenoxylate-atropine may decrease episodes of FI in patients with preexisting diarrhea; common medications used in these circumstances include adsorbents (Kaopectate and Pepto Bismol), and a trial of cholestyramine may be reasonable in patients with suspected urgency from bile salt diarrhea after cholecystectomy or ileocolonic resection.

Carcinoid syndrome management in small bowel tumors — initial evaluation rules out other causes of diarrhea, then first-line therapy uses a long-acting somatostatin analog (SSA). For patients with refractory carcinoid syndrome, options include dose escalation or increased injection frequency of the current long-acting SSA; administration of a subcutaneous short-acting SSA (in addition to the long-acting SSA); antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide or diphenoxylate (in addition to the SSA), noting that loperamide is approximately three times more potent milligram for milligram than diphenoxylate; telotristat ethyl (in addition to the SSA); and locoregional therapies, including hepatic resection, or, when surgery of liver hepatic metastases is not feasible, intra-arterial therapies, including TACE, TAE, and Bland embolization. For persistent refractory carcinoid syndrome, proceed to PRRT with continuous SSAs.

### Clinical perspective on management of key adverse events with sacituzumab govitecan [^e527aa4c]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up: The patient was evaluated and underwent laboratory assessment before each SG dose in the infusion center.

Concern at follow-up: The patient noted that her pain improved after cycle 1. She was feeling well except for grade 1 diarrhea with loose watery stools 3–4 times daily that would start 3–4 days after each infusion. She had problems with constipation in the past and had been hesitant to use loperamide.

Treatment plan: C. diff assessment was negative. Blood laboratory assessments were within normal limits. Loperamide was started at 4 mg initially, followed by 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea for a maximum of 16 mg daily. The patient was also given a prescription for 5 mg diphenoxylate-0.05 mg atropine to use up to 4 times a day if loperamide was not effective. She was also encouraged to orally hydrate and notify her oncology team if diarrhea symptoms were not responding to these management strategies.

Follow-up and outcome: After using loperamide as needed for diarrhea, symptoms were controlled. Cycle 2, Day 1 of SG was administered at full dose without delay. A regimen for early loperamide therapy for diarrhea was again reinforced to the patient (as outlined in the Diarrhea subsection) as part of chemotherapy education during cycle 2, Day 1. The patient again experienced diarrhea that was treated immediately with loperamide at home, leading to early control and absence of progression to grade 2 diarrhea. The patient had renewed confidence that early and regular use of loperamide, as needed, was a proactive approach for managing her symptoms.

Key learnings:

Therapy with SG may continue while managing grade 1 diarrhea with diagnostic assessments and supportive measures.
Control of grade 1–2 diarrhea with medication and supportive measures, followed by resumption of the same dose of therapy on subsiding to grade ≤ 1 is prudent.
For grade 3–4 diarrhea, SG should be withheld while managing the toxicity. Then, SG can be resumed with a dose reduction, if necessary, once diarrhea subsides to grade 1 or resolves.
Loperamide can be employed once infectious causes of diarrhea are excluded. If loperamide is not effective, diphenoxylate-atropine may be administered. In severe cases resistant to diphenoxylate-atropine, octreotide can be employed.

### Guidance on the management of diarrhoea during cancer chemotherapy [^79fe0d20]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Diarrhoea induced by chemotherapy in cancer patients is common, causes notable morbidity and mortality, and is managed inconsistently. Previous management guidelines were based on poor evidence and neglect physiological causes of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea. In the absence of level 1 evidence from randomised controlled trials, we developed practical guidance for clinicians based on a literature review by a multidisciplinary team of clinical oncologists, dietitians, gastroenterologists, medical oncologists, nurses, pharmacist, and a surgeon. Education of patients and their carers about the risks associated with, and management of, chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea is the foundation for optimum treatment of toxic effects. Adequate — and, if necessary, repeated — assessment, appropriate use of loperamide, and knowledge of fluid resuscitation requirements of affected patients is the second crucial step. Use of octreotide and seeking specialist advice early for patients who do not respond to treatment will reduce morbidity and mortality. In view of the burden of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea, appropriate multidisciplinary research to assess meaningful endpoints is urgently required.

Overall agreement 40%: A+ 15%, A 25%, A− 20%, D− 20%, D 20%, D+ 0%.
Grade C.

Evidence supporting statements 57 and 58 is scarce, and is mainly derived from a few case reports, including symptoms of dumping syndrome after Nissen fundoplication. In a few case reports, insertion of a gastrostomy tube into the remnant stomach after RYGB reversed neuroglycopenic symptoms. This treatment option can only be considered for severe refractory cases as it is invasive and as symptoms might improve with time (see subsequent section).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 210: fecal incontinence [^e6c44563]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Antimotility agents for fecal incontinence: For fecal incontinence associated with diarrhea or loose stools, constipating medications, such as loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine, and codeine phosphate, may be helpful. A randomized controlled trial of 80 patients comparing loperamide with psyllium found both decreased fecal incontinence episodes, but constipation was more frequent with loperamide (29.2% versus 9.7%, respectively; P = 0.05). In another prospective controlled study of 69 women initiating methylnaltrexone with loperamide and codeine if fecal incontinence persisted, the treatment group had a significantly higher cure rate (46% versus 0%; P < .01). In addition, a randomized crossover trial of 63 patients comparing loperamide with a low-residue diet versus loperamide with a high-fiber diet found similar improvement with a nonsignificant difference between treatment arms. Dosages can start with as little as one half a tablet of loperamide by mouth daily and can be titrated up to 4 mg two to three times daily as needed, with the maximum daily dose 16 mg per day.

### Practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal problems arising as a result of treatment for cancer [^3272d3ec]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Dumping syndrome

When gastric emptying is rapid it leads to 'dumping syndrome', characterised by GI and vasomotor symptoms that occur after meals. This can be soon after meals or delayed for up to several hours. The physiological causes are complex, but include the high osmolarity of small bowel contents and reactive hypoglycaemia. The diagnosis of early dumping is usually made on clinical grounds, although rarely gastric scintigraphy is helpful. Late dumping can be diagnosed by measuring blood glucose when patients are symptomatic. If the presentation is atypical, the rare possibility of an insulinoma should be considered. Initial management should be dietary advice to reduce the volume and osmolarity of food presented to the small intestine and the avoidance of fluids taken with meals. Loperamide, guar gum or pectin to slow gastric emptying may be helpful. For late dumping, acarbose may sometimes help. Octreotide or lanreotide are helpful in the short term. Studies have shown mixed results when these drugs were evaluated longer term. Surgical revision of the roux-en-Y anastomosis is a complex procedure but can be effective in selected cases.

Loperamide for functional gastrointestinal disease in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) — loperamide is reported efficacious for diarrhea in IBS, decreasing stool frequency, increasing water and ion absorption, improving stool consistency and urgency, and may improve anal sphincter tone, but generally does not significantly affect pain; typical dosing is 2 mg after each loose bowel movement (usually < 8 mg per day) or preprandial 2–4 mg in IBS patients with prominent diarrhea after feeding.

Carcinoid syndrome

Symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, and bronchospasm within the clinical spectrum of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) require dedicated therapy. An incompletely appreciated spectrum of peptides and amines is responsible for increased gut motility, vasodilation, and fibrotic complications observed in CS patients. Supportive measures such as avoiding food or stress that evokes complaints and antidiarrheals such as loperamide or codeine phosphate can offer alleviation of symptoms. Chronic diarrhea in CS patients can be multifactorial and include causes such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, bile acid sequestration, bacterial overgrowth, or short bowel, often seen after abdominal surgery. Clinicians should treat these conditions accordingly with either dietary modifications, pancreatic enzymes, antibiotics, or cholestyramine.

Targeted medical treatment has been available for decades since the advent of somatostatin analogues (SSAs). Besides their role in NET diagnostics, SSA-induced SSTR activation inhibits the secretion of a variety of humoral factors by NETs. Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have described that SSAs can induce a symptomatic response for CS in 65% to 74% of patients. This efficacy appears to be equal across all relevant SSA formulations. Biochemical response after SSA use measured by a reduction in urinary 5-HIAA levels is also considerable at 39% to 51%. Long-acting formulations such as octreotide LAR and lanreotide autogel should be commenced once the diagnosis of CS is confirmed. Caution should be applied to patients with nearly obstructed bowel as initiation of the SSA can induce an obstructive ileus. In these cases a trial of short-acting SSAs may be considered. SSAs are generally well tolerated by patients, but adverse effects include a change in bowel movements and stool consistency, nausea, steatorrhea, myalgia, injection reactions, diabetes mellitus, and in the long term cholelithiasis. Most of the adverse effects are low grade and self-limiting, requiring little need for dose reduction in patients. In cases of symptoms refractory to a standard dose, clinicians may consider increasing the SSA dose further. Strategies include reducing the injection interval or increasing the injection dose of long-acting formulations or adding subcutaneous "rescue" octreotide. There is no benefit of switching to the multi-SSTR-targeting pasireotide in CS patients.

No new studies have evaluated the efficacy of loperamide in the management of patients with IBS, and evidence comes from two small, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; there was a lack of beneficial effect on global improvement of symptoms of IBS and urgency, with no improvement in urgency and no data on IBS-QOL or adverse events. Loperamide is FDA-approved for the treatment of diarrhea, and the optimal dose and method of using loperamide is not known and can vary between patients based on symptom patterns.

Commonly occurring conditions during and after cancer therapy: diagnostic and treatment approaches

In patients on restrictive diets, consider daily supplementation with long-term trace elements and multivitamin supplements until dietitian review.
If long-term dietary interventions are recommended, dietetic review should be arranged to ensure nutritional adequacy.
A 10-day trial with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy at adequate dose after education of the patient is usually sufficient to assess efficacy.
If multiple diagnoses have been reached, treatments should usually be introduced one at a time with a documented symptom response before introducing the next treatment.

Pain

Chronic pain after abdominal surgery and/or radiotherapy may be caused by stricture formation, adhesions or fibrosis and the resulting obstruction. However, faecal loading and SIBO are under-appreciated causes.
With new onset or unexplained pain, tumour recurrence should be considered.
Signs of complete intestinal obstruction and severe abdominal pain require emergency surgical assessment (eg, small bowel obstruction, ischaemic bowel).
In general, a multidisciplinary approach is required to manage these patients, including input from gastroenterology, surgery, pain management and nutrition teams.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy

Frequent physiological disorders resulting from cytotoxic chemotherapy include lactose intolerance, SIBO, BAD and PEI.
Investigations to determine the cause for new-onset symptoms during treatment are feasible and beneficial.
In patients developing acute diarrhoea, stool analysis for infection should be performed; however, it is generally safe to start loperamide while awaiting the results. Reassess the patient regularly to exclude the development of toxic dilatation of the colon.
Potentially aggravating oral anticancer drugs in patients with moderate to severe diarrhoea should be temporarily paused until they have been reviewed by an oncologist.
Patients presenting with severe capecitabine/5-fluorouracil (5FU) GI toxicity, require an urgent CT scan to exclude enterocolitis which, if present, requires rapid, intensive intervention.

Small molecules/targeted therapy

PEI is a common cause for GI symptoms in patients treated with sorafenib.
BAD is a common cause for GI symptoms in patients treated with lenalidomide.

Acute radiotherapy effects

Smoking and low body mass index both increase the risk of toxicity and should be addressed if possible before radiotherapy is given.
Dietary counselling and/or protein supplementation may be helpful.
Lactobacilli ± bifidobacteria containing probiotics may reduce acute radiotherapy (RT)-related diarrhoea.
A high-fibre diet may reduce the risk of toxicity during pelvic radiotherapy.

Pelvic floor dysfunction

Evidence for interventions is poor, but usually include bowel habit training, toilet positioning, advice on raising abdominal pressure for evacuation without straining, modifying stool consistency via diet and fluid adjustments or fibre supplements, possibly following a stepwise algorithm. Faecal incontinence may respond to pelvic floor muscle training, urge resistance training or firming the stool if loose — for example, with loperamide, titrated to individual response (figure 3).

On the other hand, constipation can be very problematic and distressing for patients (figure 4), affecting 40–90% with advanced cancer or those taking opioids. Prevention by prophylactic use of laxatives when opioids are prescribed is recommended. There is a growing body of evidence for the use of PAMORAs (peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonists), but conventional laxatives may also be effective for many and are recommended as first line. Prucalopride is sometimes recommended. However, its mode of action is upstream and does not directly affect the mu opioid receptor. Faecal impaction and overflow should be considered as a possible cause of apparent diarrhoea in this group and is usually managed by suppositories or enemas initially.SIBO may contribute to constipation, especially with methane-producing organisms, but data as to its importance are sparse. PEI and BAD may be masked in patients on constipating drugs and occasionally contribute to significant pain in patients with constipation. Transanal irrigation can be effective when other treatments have failed, especially in those with passive incontinence, severe constipation and anterior resection syndrome.

### Control of irinotecan-induced diarrhea by octreotide after loperamide failure [^6a91fd59]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is a well-recognized side effect of chemotherapy, which affects the quality of life and when refractory is potentially life threatening. Irinotecan (CPT-11) is associated with an elevated incidence of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea and subsequent morbidity. Standard antidiarrheal treatment is based on high-dose loperamide, but this agent is associated with a significant failure rate. Octreotide is active against chemotherapy-induced diarrhea caused by fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan, with a distinct mechanism of action. We administered octreotide in a phase I trial in 37 patients who received irinotecan and experienced loperamide-refractory diarrhea, 23 of whom experienced grade III-IV diarrhea and were treated with loperamide. The 13 patients in whom to loperamide failed to control diarrhea received octreotide, with a high response rate (92%). We conclude that octreotide is effective against loperamide-refractory diarrhea resulting from irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

### Practical considerations when providing palliative care to patients with neuroendocrine tumors in the context of routine disease management or hospice care [^b8b5e089]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of diarrhea for palliative care and end-of-life

Determining the underlying cause of diarrhea in patients with NETs is critical because diarrhea can be related to other causes, such as pancreatic insufficiency related to prior pancreatic resection or SSA therapy, effects of bowel resection, bile-acid induced diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal issues. Therefore, it is essential to exclude or treat these causes of diarrhea. In addition, some patients with carcinoid syndrome-associated diarrhea may have symptoms that become refractory to SSA over time. An option in this situation includes adding telotristat ethyl, an oral inhibitor of serotonin synthesis. In the phase III TELESTAR clinical trial, patients with carcinoid syndrome experiencing four or more bowel movements per day (BMs/day) while on SSAs were randomized to receive either telotristat ethyl or placebo. Telotristat ethyl resulted in a 42–44% mean reduction in daily bowel movements compared with placebo. Additional strategies to improve carcinoid syndrome diarrhea have included increasing the dose or frequency of SSAs, addition of short-acting subcutaneous octreotide for breakthrough symptoms, and use of antidiarrheal therapies including loperamide, diphenoxylate-atropine, deodorized tincture of opium, or other nonspecific medications.

Nutrition and metabolism are altered in many patients with GEP-NETs. Among patients with carcinoid syndrome, the risk of malnutrition is due to reduced food intake, food intolerance, malabsorption, and diarrhea. These complications can impact patients' quality of life and functioning. Fat-soluble vitamins and niacin deficiency exist among patients with NET, particularly those on treatment with SSAs. For patients with diarrhea, a low fiber/low residue diet with small, frequent meals is an important management component. Some food, such as amine-rich substances, can trigger carcinoid syndrome and should be avoided. The involvement of a nutritionist to assess individual needs and requirements regarding nutritional supplementation is recommended.

### Pharmacologic management of diarrhea in patients with short bowel syndrome [^a79fbf76]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Diarrhea associated with short bowel syndrome (SBS) can have multiple etiologies, including accelerated intestinal transit, gastric acid hypersecretion, intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and malabsorption of fats and bile salts. As a result, patients may need multiple medications to effectively control fecal output. The armamentarium of antidiarrheal drugs includes antimotility agents, antisecretory drugs, antibiotics and probiotics, bile acid-binding resins, and pancreatic enzymes. An antidiarrheal regimen must be individualized for each patient and should be developed using a methodical, stepwise approach. Treatment should be initiated with a single first-line medication at the low end of its dosing range. Dosage and/or dosing frequency can then be slowly escalated to achieve maximal effect while minimizing adverse events. If diarrhea remains poorly controlled, additional agents can be incorporated sequentially. If modification of the regimen is required, a single medication should be altered or exchanged at a time. After each adjustment of the regimen, sufficient time should be permitted to fully assess response (≥ 3–5 days) before initiating additional changes. SBS-associated malabsorption is a major obstacle to optimization of an antidiarrheal regimen because drug absorption is impaired. Patients may benefit from high dosages and/or frequent dosing intervals, liquid preparations, or nonoral routes of drug delivery. Although the diarrhea associated with SBS can be debilitating, effective pharmaceutical management has the potential to substantially improve health outcomes and quality of life for these patients.

### How to manage a high-output stoma [^0e3bea37]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A high-output stoma (HOS) or fistula is when small bowel output causes water, sodium and often magnesium depletion. This tends to occur when the output is > 1.5–2.0L/24 hours though varies according to the amount of food/drink taken orally. An HOS occurs in up to 31% of small bowel stomas. A high-output enterocutaneous fistula may, if from the proximal small bowel, behave in the same way and its fluid management will be the same as for an HOS. The clinical assessment consists of excluding causes other than a short bowel and treating them (especially partial or intermittent obstruction). A contrast follow through study gives an approximate measurement of residual small intestinal length (if not known from surgery) and may show the quality of the remaining small bowel. If HOS is due to a short bowel, the first step is to rehydrate the patient so stopping severe thirst. When thirst has resolved and renal function returned to normal, oral hypotonic fluid is restricted and a glucose-saline solution is sipped. Medication to slow transit (loperamide often in high dose) or to reduce secretions (omeprazole for gastric acid) may be helpful. Subcutaneous fluid (usually saline with added magnesium) may be given before intravenous fluids though can take 10-12hours to infuse. Generally parenteral support is needed when less than 100cm of functioning jejunum remains. If there is defunctioned bowel in situ, consideration should be given to bringing it back into continuity.

### Loperamide-induced hypopituitarism [^09a8c8d5]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Loperamide, a phenylpiperidine derivative and a potent opioid μ-receptor agonist, is the most commonly used antidiarrhoeal medication in the UK. About 1.79 million prescriptions were issued in 2014and it is also freely available 'over the counter'. Its popularity persists due to a combination of favourable efficacy and a reasonably limited side effect profile; predictable gastrointestinal side effects do occur, but it is widely considered to be a very safe and well-tolerated medication.

Loperamide is directly absorbed into the gut wall, exerting its effect on the myenteric plexus to reduce propulsive activity and increase intestinal transit time. Although gastrointestinal tract absorption is favourable, it is rapidly extracted by hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolism resulting in low levels in the systemic circulation (bioavailability < 2%). While extensively used in acute diarrhoea, a significant proportion of patients with chronic gastrointestinal disease take loperamide on a daily basis, often at relatively high doses. Prior studies have paid scant attention to the potential adverse effects of longer term ingestion.

We report a serious and hitherto undocumented adverse effect of chronic loperamide use following presentation to the endocrine clinic.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Avoid loperamide hydrochloride dosages higher than recommended in adult or pediatric patients 2 years of age and older due to the risk of serious cardiac adverse reactions (see WARNINGS, OVERDOSAGE).

(1 capsule = 2 mg)

Patients should receive appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed.

Acute Diarrhea

Adults and Pediatric Patients 13 Years and Older: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool. The maximum daily dose should is 16 mg (eight capsules). Clinical improvement is usually observed within 48 hours.

Pediatric Patients 2 to 12 Years of Age: In pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age (20 kg or less), the non-prescription liquid formulation (loperamide hydrochloride oral solution, 1 mg/5 mL) should be used; for ages 6 to 12, either loperamide hydrochloride capsules or loperamide hydrochloride oral solution may be used. For pediatric patients 2 to 12 years of age, the following schedule for capsules or liquid will usually fulfill initial dosage requirements:

Recommended First Day Dosage Schedule

Two to five years (13 to 20 kg): 1 mg three times daily (3 mg total daily dosage)

Six to eight years (20 to 30 kg): 2 mg twice daily (4 mg total daily dosage)

Eight to twelve years (greater than 30 kg): 2 mg three times daily (6 mg total daily dosage)

Recommended Subsequent Daily Dosage

Following the first treatment day, it is recommended that subsequent loperamide hydrochloride doses (1 mg/10 kg body weight) be administered only after a loose stool. The total daily dosage should not exceed recommended dosages for the first day.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

- Patients and caregivers should be informed of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection). Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours.

- Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^0ffd5707]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^f44820e1]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Malabsorption is often accompanied by steatorrhoea and the passage of bulky malodorous pale stools. However, milder forms of malabsorption may not result in any reported stool abnormality. Colonic, inflammatory or secretory forms of diarrhoea typically present with liquid loose stools with blood or mucous discharge.

Specific risk factors which increase the likelihood of organic diarrhoea or point to potential lines of investigation should be sought (see box 1). These include:
Family history: particularly of neoplastic, inflammatory bowel or coeliac disease.
Previous surgery: extensive resections of the ileum and right colon lead to diarrhoea due to lack of absorptive surface and hence fat and carbohydrate malabsorption, decreased transit time or changes in the bile acid pool including malabsorption. Bacterial overgrowth can often be a problem in this situation, particularly in bypass operations such as in gastric surgery and jejunoileal bypass procedures for morbid obesity. Shorter resections of the terminal ileum can lead to bile acid diarrhoea, which typically occurs after meals and usually responds to fasting and bile acid sequestrants (see sections 5 and 6). Chronic diarrhoea may also occur in up to 10% patients after cholecystectomy through mechanisms that include increased gut transit, bile acid diarrhoea, and increased enterohepatic cycling of bile acids.
Previous pancreatic disease.
Systemic disease: thyrotoxicosis and hypoparathyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease or systemic sclerosis may predispose to diarrhoea through various mechanisms including endocrine effects, autonomic dysfunction, small bowel bacterial overgrowth or the use of concomitant drug therapy.
Alcohol: diarrhoea is common in alcohol abuse. Mechanisms include direct toxic effect on intestinal epithelium, rapid gut transit, decreased activity of intestinal disaccharidases and decreased pancreatic function.
Diet: excessive intake of caffeine (eg, coffee, energy drinks), milk in patients with lactase deficiency, food additives (eg, sorbitol), fructose and other FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols) should be sought (see section 5.3).
Drugs: up to 4% of cases of chronic diarrhoea may be due to medications (particularly magnesium supplements, antihypertensives (eg, ACE inhibitors) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, newer gliptins (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor), theophyllines, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics and antineoplastic agents).
Recent overseas travel or other potential sources of infectious gastrointestinal pathogens.
Recent antibiotic therapy and Clostridium difficile infection: many different tests are now available for the detection of C. difficile, but most clinical laboratories use a commercial enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxin (details in section 3.3.3).

Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

Table 16 — Post-MBS 0–12 months nutrition suggestions describe symptom-specific actions. For constipation, increase fluids 48–64+ oz/day. For dehydration, encourage patients to drink 48–64+ oz/day of low calorie or sugar-free liquids between meals, and IV hydration with dextrose or other sugar solutions should contain thiamine. For persistent diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may also need to be ruled out if diarrhea persists. For nausea, consume adequate fluids, 48–64 oz/day (no carbonation). For vomiting/regurgitation, return to full liquids or semi-soft foods for 1–2 days.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^02442701]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Medical management of fecal incontinence prioritizes conservative therapy before surgery or devices: all patients must be managed with conservative therapies tailored to symptoms and implemented for an adequate duration, including dietary modification, fiber supplements, fluids, scheduled toileting, a bowel training program, pelvic floor exercises, and medications for diarrhea and constipation. The next step is pelvic floor retraining with biofeedback therapy. For diarrhea, we recommend starting with loperamide (2 mg), generally starting with 1 tablet taken 30 minutes before breakfast and titrated as necessary up to 16 mg/d; fiber supplementation can be used to improve stool consistency and reduced diarrhea-associated FI, and cholestyramine or colesevelam may be helpful. Anticholinergic agents and clonidine are alternative options for patients with diarrhea and FI. For constipation, laxatives and anorectal testing to identify evacuation disorders are recommended, and rectal cleansing with a small enema or tap water reduces the likelihood of stool leakage. Patients who are truly refractory to conservative measures should undergo anorectal testing, starting with anorectal manometry and, if necessary, anorectal imaging, and these patients are eligible for surgical therapy or devices.

### Clinical review: loperamide toxicity [^698ffc4e]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Loperamide is a nonprescription opioid widely used for the treatment of diarrhea. Although it is relatively safe at therapeutic doses, increasing reports describe its misuse and abuse at very high doses either for euphoric effects or to attenuate symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Life-threatening loperamide toxicity can result from the relatively new clinical syndrome of loperamide-induced cardiac toxicity. These patients are often young and may present in cardiac arrest or with unheralded, recurrent syncope in conjunction with ECG abnormalities, including marked QT-interval prolongation, QRS-interval widening, and ventricular dysrhythmias. Features of conventional opioid toxicity may also be present. The mainstays of treatment include advanced cardiac life support and supportive care, although selected patients may be candidates for overdrive pacing, intravenous lipid emulsion, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In patients who survive loperamide toxicity, consideration should be given to the treatment of an underlying opioid use disorder, if present.

Chronic Diarrhea

Adults

The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of loperamide hydrochloride capsules should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules per day). The maximum daily dosage is 16 mg (eight capsules per day). If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. Loperamide hydrochloride capsules administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.

Elderly

No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in elderly subjects. However, there were no major differences reported in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients. No dose adjustment is required for the elderly.

In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Avoid loperamide hydrochloride in elderly patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, Class IA or III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (see WARNINGS).

Renal Impairment

No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since the metabolites and the unchanged drug are mainly excreted in the feces, no dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of loperamide have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Use loperamide hydrochloride with caution in such patients because the systemic exposure may be increased due to reduced metabolism (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Management of irritable bowel syndrome [^de61c7f8]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and is frequently treated by family physicians. Despite patients' worries about the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, it is a benign condition. The diagnosis should be made using standard criteria after red flags that may signify organic disease have been ruled out. An effective physician-patient relationship is vital to successful management. Episodes of diarrhea are best managed with loperamide, while constipation often will respond to fiber supplements. Antispasmodics or anticholinergic agents may help relieve the abdominal pain of irritable bowel syndrome. Refractory cases are often treated with tricyclic antidepressants. Newer agents such as tegaserod and ondansetron target neurotransmitter receptors in the gastrointestinal tract Some forms of psychologic treatment may be helpful, and gastroenterology consultation is occasionally needed to reassure the patient. Comorbid conditions such as depression or anxiety should be investigated and treated.

Adult acute diarrhea — management algorithm begins with passage of ≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 h plus an enteric symptom and then triages by syndrome and severity. For watery diarrhea with mild illness, management is hydration only and patients may use loperamide 4 mg initially to control stooling. For watery illness with no or low-grade fever (≤ 100°F), consider ≤ 48 h of loperamide therapy. For dysenteric diarrhea with no or low-grade fever (≤ 100°F), it specifies microbiologic assessment, then anti-microbial agent directed to cause for all but STEC infection. In severe illness with fever (≥ 101°F) in a single case (not outbreak), listed actions include to consider microbiologic assessment and empiric treatment with Azithromycin 1 g in single dose OR 500 mg once daily for 3 days. Persistent diarrhea (14–30 days) should be worked up by culture and/or culture-independent microbiologic assessment, then treated with an anti-microbial agent directed to cause.

### Neratinib (Nerlynx) [^7e715535]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Antidiarrheal prophylaxis has been shown to lower the incidence and severity of diarrhea. Instruct patients to initiate antidiarrheal prophylaxis with loperamide along with the first dose of NERLYNX and continue during the first 56 days of treatment; after day 56, titrate dose to achieve 1–2 bowel movements per day and not to exceed 16 mg loperamide per day [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Consider adding other agents to loperamide as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Alternatively, a 2-week NERLYNX dose escalation approach prior to initiation of the recommended treatment regimen with NERLYNX can also be considered for diarrhea management [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. For patients who used NERLYNX dose escalation, the median time to first onset of Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea was 45 days (range, 15–132) and the median cumulative duration of Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea was 2.5 days (range, 1–6). Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients who used NERLYNX dose escalation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor patients for diarrhea and treat with additional antidiarrheals as needed. When severe diarrhea with dehydration occurs, administer fluid and electrolytes as needed, interrupt NERLYNX, and reduce subsequent doses [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Perform stool cultures as clinically indicated to exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea or diarrhea of any grade with complicating features (dehydration, fever, neutropenia).

### Clinical guideline: management of gastroparesis [^add6a9e0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is identified in clinical practice through the recognition of the clinical symptoms and documentation of delayed gastric emptying. Symptoms from gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and upper abdominal pain. Management of gastroparesis should include assessment and correction of nutritional state, relief of symptoms, improvement of gastric emptying and, in diabetics, glycemic control. Patient nutritional state should be managed by oral dietary modifications. If oral intake is not adequate, then enteral nutrition via jejunostomy tube needs to be considered. Parenteral nutrition is rarely required when hydration and nutritional state cannot be maintained. Medical treatment entails use of prokinetic and antiemetic therapies. Current approved treatment options, including metoclopramide and gastric electrical stimulation (GES, approved on a humanitarian device exemption), do not adequately address clinical need. Antiemetics have not been specifically tested in gastroparesis, but they may relieve nausea and vomiting. Other medications aimed at symptom relief include unapproved medications or off-label indications, and include domperidone, erythromycin (primarily over a short term), and centrally acting antidepressants used as symptom modulators. GES may relieve symptoms, including weekly vomiting frequency, and the need for nutritional supplementation, based on open-label studies. Second-line approaches include venting gastrostomy or feeding jejunostomy; intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection was not effective in randomized controlled trials. Most of these treatments are based on open-label treatment trials and small numbers. Partial gastrectomy and pyloroplasty should be used rarely, only in carefully selected patients. Attention should be given to the development of new effective therapies for symptomatic control.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients and caregivers should be informed of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of CAMPTOSAR). Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours.
Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of CAMPTOSAR.
Explain the significance of routine blood cell counts. Instruct patients to monitor their temperature frequently and immediately report any occurrence of fever or infection.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy.
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for 6 months after the final dose.
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose of CAMPTOSAR.
Lactation
Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CAMPTOSAR and for at least 7 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].
Infertility
Advise females and males of reproductive potential that CAMPTOSAR may impair fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Patients should be alerted to the possibility of alopecia.

### Recommended guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea [^f3878369]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update and expand on previously published clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea.

Methods

An expert multidisciplinary panel was convened to review the recent literature and discuss recommendations for updating the practice guidelines previously published by this group in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 1998. MEDLINE searches were performed and the relevant literature published since 1998 was reviewed by all panel members. The treatment recommendations and algorithm were revised by panel consensus.

Results

A recent review of early toxic deaths occurring in two National Cancer Institute-sponsored cooperative group trials of irinotecan plus high-dose fluorouracil and leucovorin for advanced colorectal cancer has led to the recognition of a life-threatening gastrointestinal syndrome and highlighted the need for vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for this serious complication. Loperamide remains the standard therapy for uncomplicated cases. However, the revised guidelines reflect the need for recognition of the early warning signs of complicated cases of diarrhea and the need for early and aggressive management, including the addition of antibiotics. Management of radiation-induced diarrhea is similar but may not require hospitalization, and chronic low- to intermediate-grade symptoms can be managed with continued loperamide.

Conclusion

With vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for cancer treatment-induced diarrhea, particularly in patients with early warning signs of severe complications, morbidity and mortality may be reduced.
