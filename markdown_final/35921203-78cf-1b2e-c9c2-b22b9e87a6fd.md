## Question

55 yo F with rheumatoid arthritis on hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate presents with new-onset visual blurring and photopsias (flashing lights) over the past two weeks. Fundoscopic exam shows subtle retinal pigment mottling but no overt swelling or hemorrhages. Her internist considers starting high-dose prednisone (1 mg/kg) for possible optic neuritis—Is this appropriate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high-dose prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) is appropriate for a 55-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis on hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate who presents with new-onset blurred vision and photopsias, with subtle retinal pigment mottling on exam. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the differential diagnosis for these visual symptoms in the context of her medications. Then, I should verify the key distinguishing features between optic neuritis and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Next, I will review evidence-based management for optic neuritis and for hydroxychloroquine toxicity. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline immediate next steps, including what tests to order and when to stop hydroxychloroquine if toxicity is confirmed.

> Let me first confirm the clinical priorities. New-onset blurred vision with photopsias in a patient on hydroxychloroquine raises two leading concerns: demyelinating optic neuritis and hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, and the fundus finding of subtle retinal pigment mottling pushes me toward toxicity rather than optic neuritis, which typically has a normal disc early on, though I should not jump to conclusions without corroborative testing [^1f11160b] [^2b8d007e].

> I will now examine the features that distinguish optic neuritis from hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Optic neuritis usually presents with pain with eye movements, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and central or centrocecal scotoma, with the optic disc often normal initially and swelling only in a subset; by contrast, hydroxychloroquine toxicity presents with photopsias, paracentral scotomas, and subtle RPE changes or mottling that can precede visible bull's-eye maculopathy, and SD-OCT shows parafoveal outer retinal thinning even when the fundus looks near-normal early on [^1f11160b] [^2b8d007e].

> Wait, let me verify the medication risk context. Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is dose- and duration-dependent, with risk rising substantially after 5 years and with doses above 5 mg/kg/day; the FDA label warns that daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg increase retinopathy incidence, and contemporary guidelines cap dosing at 5 mg/kg/day real weight, emphasizing early detection with SD-OCT and 10–2 visual fields because damage is often irreversible once structural loss occurs [^0c883b2a] [^4954dcd5] [^8417946f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about optic neuritis treatment yet. The classic Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial showed that high-dose IV methylprednisolone speeds visual recovery but does not improve long-term visual outcomes, and oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day alone is actually associated with higher recurrence risk; moreover, recent expert reviews question routine high-dose steroids for typical demyelinating optic neuritis, reinforcing that oral prednisone monotherapy at 1 mg/kg/day is not the evidence-based approach for suspected optic neuritis [^7242eed4].

> I should double-check the evidence-based management of suspected hydroxychloroquine toxicity. When toxicity is suspected, the immediate step is to stop hydroxychloroquine and arrange urgent ophthalmology evaluation with SD-OCT, 10–2 visual fields, and often fundus autofluorescence or multifocal ERG to confirm early damage; steroids do not treat hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, and progression can continue for years after drug cessation, so early recognition and discontinuation are critical to limit irreversible vision loss [^076a47ee] [^9175712b] [^2641a76c].

> But wait, what if this is a mimic or a mixed process? Methotrexate can rarely cause optic neuropathy, though that is uncommon and typically in the setting of high-dose regimens; given the absence of disc edema and the presence of RPE mottling, methotrexate optic neuropathy is less likely here than hydroxychloroquine toxicity, yet I should keep a broad differential and let imaging clarify the etiology rather than empirically starting high-dose steroids that won't reverse HCQ damage [^4e312b3b].

> Let me synthesize. Starting high-dose prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) for possible optic neuritis in this scenario is not appropriate because the clinical picture and exam favor hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, and steroids are neither indicated nor effective for HCQ toxicity; moreover, oral prednisone monotherapy is not the evidence-based therapy for typical optic neuritis and carries recurrence risk, so empiric steroids here would expose the patient to harm without benefit [^7242eed4] [^076a47ee].

> I need to ensure the immediate next steps are explicit. Stop hydroxychloroquine now, obtain urgent ophthalmology input within 24–48 hours with SD-OCT, 10–2 visual fields, and consider FAF or mfERG if structural and functional tests are discordant; document a baseline before any steroid consideration, and only revisit steroids if a competing diagnosis like optic neuritis is confirmed and neuro-ophthalmology advises IV methylprednisolone rather than oral prednisone monotherapy [^076a47ee] [^1f11160b].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis with appropriate imaging before treating. High-dose prednisone is inappropriate here because the presentation is most consistent with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, for which the management is prompt drug cessation and ophthalmic surveillance, not systemic corticosteroids; steroids should be reserved for confirmed optic neuritis managed with IV methylprednisolone per evidence-based protocols, not oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day [^076a47ee] [^7242eed4].

---

High-dose prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) is **not indicated** for this patient. The presentation — new-onset blurred vision and photopsias with subtle retinal pigment mottling — is classic for **early hydroxychloroquine retinopathy**, not optic neuritis. Steroids do not reverse HCQ toxicity and may delay definitive management; the correct action is to **stop HCQ immediately** and arrange urgent ophthalmology with SD-OCT, 10–2 visual fields, and mfERG. If optic neuritis is suspected, use IV methylprednisolone per protocol, but oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day is ineffective and contraindicated for typical demyelinating optic neuritis.

## Differential diagnosis: hydroxychloroquine retinopathy vs. optic neuritis

Key features distinguishing **hydroxychloroquine retinopathy** from **optic neuritis**:

| **Feature** | **Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy** | **Optic neuritis** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptoms | - Blurred vision <br/> - Photopsias <br/> - Color desaturation <br/> - Central/paracentral scotomas | - Pain with eye movements <br/> - Sudden visual loss <br/> - Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) <br/> - Retrobulbar pain |
| Fundus exam | - Subtle RPE mottling <br/> - Bull's-eye maculopathy (late) <br/> - Normal optic disc early | - Normal or mildly hyperemic disc <br/> - Papillitis (rare) <br/> - No RPE mottling |
| Pathophysiology | - HCQ accumulates in RPE <br/> - Causes photoreceptor damage <br/> - Irreversible | - Demyelination of optic nerve <br/> - Often reversible with steroids |
| Management | - Stop HCQ <br/> - No role for steroids | - High-dose IV methylprednisolone <br/> - Oral prednisone alone is contraindicated |

---

## Evidence against high-dose oral prednisone for optic neuritis

The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) showed that **IV methylprednisolone** hastens recovery but does not improve long-term outcomes, whereas **oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day alone** increases relapse risk and is not recommended for typical demyelinating optic neuritis.

---

## Recommended management for suspected hydroxychloroquine retinopathy

- **Immediate cessation**: Stop HCQ now.
- **Urgent ophthalmology**: Arrange SD-OCT, 10–2 visual fields, and mfERG within 1–2 weeks.
- **No steroids**: Steroids do not reverse HCQ toxicity and may obscure the diagnosis.
- **Risk assessment**: Review dose, duration, renal function, and other risk factors [^33018723].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

High-dose oral prednisone is **inappropriate** here. The findings point to **early hydroxychloroquine retinopathy**, for which the standard of care is to stop HCQ and obtain urgent ophthalmic testing. If optic neuritis is suspected, use IV methylprednisolone per protocol; oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day is ineffective and contraindicated for typical demyelinating optic neuritis.

Regarding medical management for immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, more specifically with respect to management of rheumatological toxicity, ESMO 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate prednisone 10-20 mg/day in patients with grade ≥ 2 immune-related-inflammatory arthritis and immune-related polymyalgia rheumatica, and then progressively taper following improvement. Consider administering a higher dosage (0.5 mg/kg) if there is no improvement, as well as conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) or biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (anti-IL-6 receptor agents, TNF-α inhibitors) for severe or persistent symptoms.

Treatment

Based on current understanding of disease pathogenesis, schematically summarized in Figure 8, two components play an important role in the onset of GCA: 1) a systemic extravascular inflammatory syndrome mainly sustained by the IL-6/IL-17 axis; 2) vascular damage with breaching of the artery wall, followed by ischemia largely conditioned by the IL-12/IFN-γ axis.These mechanisms have remarkable therapeutic implications, as the extravascular component is promptly responsive to GCs whereas the vascular component responds poorly or not at all, thus accounting for potential relapses characterized by visual loss and inflammatory lesions in patients treated with GCs for months, and especially during drug tapering.

The worldwide standard-of-care for patients with GCA and/or PMR is GCs, which were in fact used to treat all of the patients in our study. However, since the cohort was collected over a time frame of 12 years, the initial optimal dose was not the same for all patients, including those with ophthalmic manifestations. No patient was given intravenous pulse methylprednisolone, whose better efficacy compared to oral therapy has not been unequivocally demonstrated.However, in patients with acute visual loss in one eye and signs of ischemia in the other, neuro-ophthalmologists usually start treatment with a 3-day course of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (500–1000 mg daily!) that is then switched to 100–120 mg/day oral prednisone.

In our experience, 15 patients with clinical and laboratory features of highly active disease were treated with 1 mg GCs/kg/day, whereas in 27 patients the fixed starting dose of GCs was 50 mg/day. The 11 patients in whom the diagnosis was initially uncertain were treated with 0.5 mg GCs/kg/day, but the dose was increased to 1 mg/kg/day 2–3 weeks later, when their TAB results confirmed the diagnosis. Finally, three patients with combined GCA and PMR but without ocular involvement were initially incorrectly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, for which they were treated with 25 mg methotrexate (MTX)/week plus 200 mg hydroxychloroquine/day for 3 weeks. When these patients were determined to be TAB-positive, the hydroxychloroquine was discontinued and 50 mg GCs/day was added to the MTX regimen.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)—antimalarial therapy and ophthalmic monitoring: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, “We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C).” Dosing guidance notes, “A starting dose of up to 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight (up to 400 mg/d) followed by 4-5 mg/kg/d for maintenance is recommended. We recommend a maximum dose of 5 mg/kg/d based on risk of toxicity at higher doses.” Ocular safety guidance specifies, “Retinal toxicity is low at 5 and 10 years (1% and 2%, respectively) but increases over time. KDIGO recommends baseline and annual retinal examinations,” and, “Yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in high-risk patients (ie, patients with concomitant tamoxifen use, daily doses > 5mg/kg/d, chloroquine use, or eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) and after 5 years of therapy in low-risk patients.”

### Are the current recommendations for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine screening appropriate? [^cd125952]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine are frequently used to treat rheumatic diseases. Ocular toxicity, although infrequent, is one of the potential side effects of antimalarial therapies. Current recommendations are unifocal in being developed by only ophthalmologists who do not treat patients for their rheumatic diseases. The data used to create the recommendations are meager and retrospective. Comanagement of patients with rheumatic disease who are exposed to antimalarial therapies requires a greater interaction between ophthalmologists and rheumatologists.

In summary, this study adds to the well-known ocular side effects of medications such as steroids, NSAIDS and hydroxychloroquine. It also calls for close collaboration between rheumatologists and ophthalmologists so that they can remain vigilant of medication-induced ocular side effects. Through early recognition and intervention, healthcare providers can address potentially serious and devastating effects to their patient’s vision while reaping the benefits of anti-rheumatic medications.

Four major medical societies involved with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy concur on the need for common principles and cooperation to minimize the risk of ocular toxicity. At a daily dosage of ≤5 mg/kg/day actual body weight, the risk of retinal toxicity from HCQ is <2% for usage up to 10 years. Widespread adoption of more sensitive testing techniques, such as optical coherence tomography and automated visual fields, by eye care providers will allow the detection of early toxicity and thus preserve the patient's visual function. Baseline testing is advised to rule out confounding disease when a patient is started on HCQ. Annual screening with sensitive tests should begin no more than 5 years after treatment initiation. Providers should be sensitive to the medical value of HCQ, and not stop the drug for uncertain indications. It is important to note that effective communication among prescribing physicians, patients, and eye care providers will optimize the utility and safety of HCQ.

### Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy-implications of research advances for rheumatology care [^f93ccc47]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in therapy for rheumatic diseases, hydroxychloroquine remains almost universally recommended for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and is often used in the management of other rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the major dose-limiting toxicity of hydroxychloroquine is retinopathy that can lead to loss of vision. New highly sensitive screening methods can identify early stages of retinopathy, and studies that include these modalities have indicated a substantially higher prevalence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy than was previously recognized, resulting in revisions to ophthalmology guidelines and the recommendation of a low dose of hydroxychloroquine for many patients. However, the efficacy of low-dose hydroxychloroquine for treating SLE and other rheumatic diseases is unknown. Further studies are required to establish the effectiveness and retinal safety of the latest hydroxychloroquine treatment recommendations.

### Special report: recommendations on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2026 revision) [^a1fb9f56]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy—treatment continuation decisions emphasize that patients will choose to stop these drugs to eliminate any further risk to their vision, especially those with disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis for which other effective medications are available, whereas patients with severe systemic diseases, such as active lupus erythematosus, may not have good therapeutic alternatives and may choose (in consultation with their medical caregivers) to continue HCQ as long as possible. These choices have become more difficult with increasing ability to detect minimal or “pre-clinical” HCQ toxicity, and some of these patients may wish to continue HCQ with cautious observation, perhaps at a lower daily dose, until signs of retinopathy are more definitive and or nearer to a point that would signal visual risk. The ultimate decision should include the patient and the prescribing physician, rather than the ophthalmologist alone.

### Risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and its subtypes (...) [^33018723]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine retinal toxic effects are characterized by thinning of the outer retina and eventual damage of the retina pigment epithelium and can lead to loss of vision in advanced stages. 4 With typical dose ranges used in the treatment of rheumatic and dermatologic conditions, the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is rare within the first 5 years of use, but the overall risk of retinopathy increases to 8. 6% after 15 years of use.
5. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study to assess risk factors for incident hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and its subtypes. Patients were followed up from hydroxychloroquine initiation until the date of their last hydroxychloroquine retinopathy screening study. Because recommended retinopathy screening begins at 5 years of use, this was the baseline time point for the risk factors analyses.

We assessed the outcome of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy with masked readings of spectral domain–optical coherence tomography scans and adjudication by 2 expert ophthalmologists, as previously described. 5 We considered the dates of earliest abnormal scans as the dates of retinopathy onset. In this cohort study of long-term hydroxychloroquine users with rheumatic and dermatologic conditions, we found that increasing age, female sex, CKD stage 3 or greater, and tamoxifen use were risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy, in addition to the established risk factors of higher weight-based daily hydroxychloroquine dose and duration of use. The pericentral retinopathy pattern was observed more frequently among both Asian and Black patients than non-Hispanic White patients. The association of hydroxychloroquine dose and duration of use with the risk of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy has been reported by prior observational studies.

These factors should influence hydroxychloroquine dosing and monitoring for this complication. Asian and Black patients were observed to have a higher incidence of the pericentral retinopathy pattern. Because recognition of the pericentral pattern requires wider examination of the fundus than standard optical coherence tomography recordings or central 10-2 visual fields provide, specialists who interpret hydroxychloroquine retinopathy screening studies must be aware of this pattern to ensure timely detection. Personalized evaluation of these risk factors for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy should guide the optimal use of this medication.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^b42efe79]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Revisions of the guidelines made in 2011 accounted for the above findings of cumulative dose-dependent risk and advances in available ophthalmological screening modalities: multifocal electroretinogram, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundus autofluorescence. New recommendations encouraged addition of at least one of the above to supplement routine screening with 10–2 automated fields and capping of daily dose at 400 mg or 6.5 mg/kg ideal body weight. They also cautioned against over-reliance on funduscopic examination due to the late-stage nature of visible bull’s eye maculopathy.In 2014, a large retrospective case–control study of 2361 patients on long-term HCQ reported higher prevalence of retinopathy than previously recognised: 7.5% overall and approaching 20% in those receiving longer term (>20 years) therapy based on visual field or OCT.This landmark study played a role in prompting the 2016 guideline revision, which recommended a maximum daily HCQ dose of 5.0 mg/kg actual body weight, with citation of risk factors including high/excess dose, longer duration of use, and concomitant renal disease or tamoxifen use. Furthermore, updated guidelines emphasised baseline fundus examination, annual screening after 5 years of treatment using automated visual fields and SD-OCT, and additional consideration of patient ethnicity and medical history.

Discussion

This is the first study evaluating rheumatologists’ familiarity with the updated AAO guidelines. These data show that rheumatologists are familiar with weight-based dosing recommendations and risk factors outlined in the 2016 AAO guidelines. However, ubiquitous adoption of strict weight-adjusted dosing regimens is hindered by multiple factors, including market availability, patient compliance and some degree of scepticism about supporting literature. Additionally, there were inconsistencies in identifying the clinical risk factors associated with retinal toxicity and the suggested screening methodology.

Our data suggest that blindness from retinal toxicity associated with HCQ use is rare. The results of the survey estimate that blindness occurs in less than 0.1% of patients and retinal toxicity occurs in approximately 1% of patients. These data are consistent with previously published literature suggesting that retinal toxicity occurs in 1% of patients.While larger studies on the outcome of HCQ-related blindness in SLE are needed, the low prevalence of this complication should be considered as rheumatologists and ophthalmologists monitor and counsel patients on the risk of retinal toxicity.

The AAO recommendations on screening for HCQ and CQ retinopathy were initially published in 2002 but would be revised multiple times in the following decades to account for new findings in the literature. Shortly afterwards, a prospective cohort study of 526 patients from Greece treated with HCQ for rheumatoid arthritis or SLE described a 0.5% prevalence of related retinopathy among those receiving recommended dosages (≤6.5 mg/kg/day) for at least 6 years. Ophthalmological evaluation entailed best-corrected visual acuity, colour vision testing, static and central visual field testing, funduscopy, electroretinography, and fluorescein angiography when indicated.In 2010, another group reported an incidence rate of 0.65% for definite or probable retinopathy among 3995 patients receiving HCQ for rheumatoid arthritis or SLE. Diagnosis was based on the presence of bull’s eye maculopathy on funduscopy or suspicious aberration on visual field examination. While <0.3% exhibited such signs within the first 5 years of treatment, point estimates of risk at later intervals were approximately 2% at 10–15 years of usage and 3.1% at 20 years.

Hydroxychloroquine in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)/lupus nephritis (LN)—implementation, dosing, monitoring, and adjunctive-therapy practice point are detailed. Because of hemolysis risk in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, measurement of G6PD levels is preferred in men before starting hydroxychloroquine, and all patients should have a baseline retinal examination with annual eye testing, especially after 5 years of use; clinicians should be aware antimalarials may be cardiotoxic. The dosing of hydroxychloroquine is 6.5 mg/kg ideal weight or 400 mg/d and, during maintenance, should be lowered to 4 to 5 mg/kg/d. Data from multiple observational cohorts show reduced flare and organ damage accrual and a relatively low rate of drug-related adverse effects, including ocular toxicity, providing the basis for recommending its use as part of general management in SLE. Practice Point 10.2.1.1 states adjunctive therapies to manage LN and attenuate complications of the disease or its treatments should be considered for all patients.

### Hydroxychloroquine-related retinal toxicity [^79c4c912]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

HCQ is widely used for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, particularly lupus and RA. It is generally well tolerated, but retinopathy is a concern. Retinopathy is rare, but is sight threatening, generally irreversible and may progress even after cessation of therapy. Damage may be subclinical. Although a number of risk factors have been proposed (such as duration of therapy and cumulative dose), the many exceptions (e.g. retinopathy on low-dose HCQ, or no retinopathy after a very large cumulative dose of HCQ) highlight our limited understanding of the disease process. Novel technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) may provide the earliest structural and functional evidence of toxicity in these stages. Along with the well-established technique of central visual field testing (10-2 visual fields), these modalities are increasingly being used as part of screening programmes. The ideal single test with high sensitivity and high specificity for HCQ retinopathy has still not been achieved. Screening for HCQ retinopathy remains an area of considerable debate, including issues of when, who and how to screen. Commonly accepted risk factors include receiving >6.5 mg/kg/day or a cumulative dose of >1000 g of HCQ, being on treatment for >5 years, having renal or liver dysfunction, having pre-existing retinopathy and being elderly. HCQ continues to be a valuable drug in treating rheumatic disease, but clinicians need to be aware of the associated risks and to have arrangements in place that would enable early detection of toxicity.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically with respect to monitoring of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine treatment, RCOphth 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain automated visual field testing using either a 10-2 or 30-2 protocol, depending on the location of the structural abnormality, in patients with abnormalities on either spectral domain optical coherence tomography or fundus autofluorescence imaging should undergo. Consider obtaining visual field testing is likely at a separate visit if dilating eye drops are used for imaging, or in the setting of virtual clinics when images are reviewed after the patient visit.

### Early onset monocular hydroxychloroquine maculopathy in a systemic lupus erythematosus patient with history of central retinal artery occlusion: a case report [^d0a8f97c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

HCQ is originally an antimalarial drug but was quickly noted for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects and became a cornerstone drug in the armamentarium of rheumatologists in diseases like SLE and rheumatoid arthritis. However, it has some adverse events including maculopathy. The incidence of HCQ maculopathy was the subject of various retrospective studies and is generally estimated to be < 1% at 5 years, < 2% at 10 years and as high as 20% at 20 years. The higher reported incidence in more recent studies maybe due to more sensitive screening tools which include spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), visual field (VF), multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), fundus autofluorescence (FAF). Among these screening tools, OCT and FAF detect structural changes which tend to occur later in the course of toxicity and are usually irreversible. While VF and mfERG are considered more sensitive and detect much earlier functional changes that precede irreversible structural damage. Various mechanisms have been proposed for HCQ maculopathy, the most notable of which is the accumulation of HCQ in the melanin-laden RPE leading to RPE dysfunction in the course of years with the end result of RPE and subsequent photoreceptor loss. These advanced RPE changes are visible clinically through fundus examination culminating in its advanced forms as bull's eye maculopathy. As we mentioned earlier, the incidence of HCQ maculopathy is generally low, but the fact that not all patients develop maculopathy despite similar cumulative weight-adjusted drug dose raised the interest in determining risk factors for HCQ maculopathy. Most important factors include: body weight especially real body weight, daily dose, duration, systemic diseases mainly hepatic and renal impairment and retinal diseases. The latest AAO guidelines concerning the screening for HCQ maculopathy decreased the safe dose from 6.5 mg/Kg/day to 5 mg/Kg/day based on real body weight. The AAO also recommended baseline ophthalmological assessment prior to commencing HCQ then yearly from the fifth year onwards. The guidelines recommend more frequent screening visits for patients at higher risk or who start to develop signs of toxicity. The AAO guidelines stated retinal diseases as a risk factor for HCQ maculopathy acknowledging nonetheless that no specific evidence exists to support this recommendation. This case study is, as far as we know, the first to report an association between CRAO and early onset HCQ maculopathy. This may warrant closer screening of patients with retinal vascular occlusions in the course of HCQ treatment. Furthermore, retinal vascular occlusive events have a much higher incidence in various diseases that are frequently prescribed HCQ e.g. SLE which makes vigilance for retinal vascular occlusions in the context of HCQ treatment even more important.

Familiarity with AAO guidelines

Of the rheumatologists, 57 (89.1%) responded that they were aware of the 2016 AAO guidelines regarding HCQ use (table 5). The rheumatologists identified limited dosing options (35 rheumatologists, 54.7%), evidence not supporting the guidelines (37 rheumatologists, 57.8%), low patient adherence to HCQ (28 rheumatologists, 43.8%) and other issues (8 rheumatologists, 12.5%) as the foremost concerns with the AAO 2016 revised guidelines. There were 479 cases of HCQ retinal toxicity (1.05%) and 9 cases of HCQ-associated blindness (1.8 per 10 000 patients) reported.

Results

Traditional DMARDs

DMARDs are commonly used as part of the initial medications for rheumatic diseases. Some of the medications in this group include azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, ciclosporin and cyclophosphamide.

Azathioprine

Azathioprine is the S -imidazolyl derivative of 6-mercaptopurine. It is an analogue of purine, which acts purine metabolism and nucleic acid synthesis to inhibit. Azathioprine is used in both antineoplastic and immunosuppressive processes due to its cytotoxic effects, known reduction of antibody production, decrease in B-cell production and decrease in T-cell-mediated responses.Like other immunosuppressants, azathioprine can lower immune response and there have been reports of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis and toxoplasmosis reactivation associated with the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

Methotrexate

Methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, disrupting the synthesis of purine and thymidylic acid. The result is reduced cellular proliferation, especially on highly proliferative cells and tissues. In a group of 13 patients receiving intermittent high-dose methotrexate (30–250 mg/kg), there were reported symptoms of generalised pruritus, burning, irritation and blurred vision.Generalised eye symptoms such as conjunctivitis, dry eyes and blepharitis were also noted in patients who received methotrexate as part of their chemotherapy regimen for postmolar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.There is also a case report of internuclear ophthalmoplegia in a 26-year-old man after receiving intrathecal methotrexate for lymphoma.Four case reports in 1992, 2002, 2005 and 2006 described optic disc swelling and visual field defects suspected to be optic neuropathy from methotrexate use.There is one case report of intraocular lymphoma after 9 months of treatment for temporal arteritis with prednisone and methotrexate,and another case of presumed methotrexate-induced mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma in 78-year-old female patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate for >8 years.However, a large observational study following 19 591 patients over 89 710 person-years found no significant increased risk of lymphoma with methotrexate among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.There are case reports of retinal cotton wool spots after either intravitreal or systemic methotrexate.Case reports of corneal epitheliopathy were also noted after intravitreal injection of methotrexate for intraocular lymphoma.

### Hydroxychloroquine: balancing the need to maintain therapeutic levels with ocular safety: an update [^bd32361c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Antimalarial drugs including chloroquine, its less toxic quinolone-derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and quinacrine have become cornerstones in the treatment of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and Sjogren syndrome; cutaneous disorders, antiphospholipid syndrome, and have recently been employed at higher dioses in oncology. Benefits include anti-inflammatory effects, protection against thrombosis, and improved control of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. In general, both the therapeutic advantages and the toxic effects of the drugs correlate with the dose and the duration of therapy. Here we summarize the current literature regarding the administration and the safety profile of HCQ in management of rheumatologic disease and focus on the most recent revised American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines for prevention and detection of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy to help guide therapeutic decision-making for patients.

Recent Findings

The risk of antimalarial-induced retinal toxicity is better predicted by calculating the daily dosage based on 5mg/kg total body weight rather than 6.5mg/kg lean body weight and reducing dosage in patients with risk factors such as renal failure. The risk of retinal toxicity after 5 years is substantially increased even when these guidelines are followed; hence dose reduction is appropriate with long-term use. Newer techniques provide improved detection of early signs of retinal damage. These advances are reflected in the revised AAO guidelines 2016, which are in part based on the retrospective study by Melles and Marmor of HCQ toxicity.

Summary

The most important changes in practice guidelines include dose calculation based on total body weight, dose reduction after long-term use, and intensified screening with techniques including optical coherence tomography (OCT) after 5 years.

### Progression of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (...) [^9175712b]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Visual acuity and visual fields showed no consistent change. Fundus autofluorescence showed little or no change except in severe cases in which the bull’s-eye damage expanded progressively. Optical coherence tomography cross sections showed little visible change in early and moderate cases but progressive foveal thinning and loss of ellipsoid zone in severe cases, which was confirmed by quantitative measurements. Patients with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy involving the retinal pigment epithelium demonstrated progressive damage on optical coherence tomography for at least 3 years after the drug was discontinued, including loss of foveal thickness and cone structure. Cases recognized before retinal pigment epithelium damage retained foveal architecture with little retinal thinning.

Early recognition of hydroxychloroquine toxic effects before any fundus changes are visible, using visual fields and optical coherence tomography, will greatly minimize late progression and the risk of visual loss. The moderate cases were at the cusp between minimal and severe damage and showed variable degrees of progression. The M2 case showed a trace of parafoveal hyperfluorescence at diagnosis that expanded to a distinct hyperfluorescent ring. The M3 case showed some subtle and stable RPE abnormalities in the left eye, but the right eye began with a small region of RPE loss that expanded over time. Foveal thickness was stable for some early cases and decreased slightly in others. There was definite foveal thinning in moderate cases that continued for 3 years. Severe cases showed the most prominent foveal thinning.

Parafoveal thickness similarly demonstrated minimal change in early cases but definite loss in moderate cases. We did not make similar observations, although we hope that finding can be verified. Our data indicated progressive loss of thickness in the early and moderate cases and a suggestion of improvement in the EZ only after approximately 2 years. However, there was fluctuation in interdigitation zone visibility, and we are wary of drawing conclusions from subtle SD-OCT changes because of variations in foveal localization and image brightness. Some restoration of the EZ line can occur in other retinal disorders, 14, 15 but more hydroxychloroquine cases need to be monitored with repetitive studies to verify the potential for recovery.

### A critical review of the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on the eye [^f19d0be9]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have been used for more than 50 years to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other rheumatic diseases. In general, these drugs are well tolerated and rarely need to be discontinued because of an adverse systemic reaction. However, both medications can be irreversibly toxic to the retina. A new study indicates that toxicity is not as rare as once believed, but depends critically on daily dosage and duration of use, as well as other risk factors. With attention to dosage and other factors, and with proper screening for early signs of toxicity, HCQ can be prescribed with relative safety even over long periods of time.

Figure 1 
During etanercept therapy in patient 1 with rheumatoid arthritis, slit-lamp examination reveals scleral hyperaemia (A). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) reveals no evidence of macular oedema (B). Four months after switching to infliximab, the anterior scleritis improved (C); however, macular oedema occurred (D). After switching to tocilizumab, both scleritis and macular oedema were completely resolved (E, F).

Patient 2. A 50-year-old woman with RA presented with unilateral anterior and posterior scleritis (figure 2A, B). Her visual acuity was 0.8 in the left eye with normal intraocular pressure. Posterior scleritis was improved with prednisolone, cyclosporine and methotrexate (MTX); however, anterior scleritis was resistant to these treatments. Therefore, infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) were administered every 8 weeks. A good response to anterior scleritis was observed. However, 5 months after starting infliximab, while anterior scleritis remained asymptomatic (figure 2C), posterior scleritis was exacerbated with severe intraocular inflammation and dense vitritis. Her visual acuity decreased to 0.02. Optical coherence tomography images could not be obtained due to the dense vitritis, and B-mode ultrasonography revealed serous retinal detachment (figure 2D). Infliximab was discontinued. The prednisolone dose was increased up to 40 mg, and she restarted cyclosporine therapy. To date, no flare-up of anterior and posterior scleritis has been noted for 12 months (figure 2E, F).

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^50856441]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Retinal toxicity and blindness are the most concerning side effects of HCQ. HCQ toxicity is dependent on daily dose, duration of use and total consumption.The exact pathophysiology of retinal toxicity attributed to HCQ is speculated but remains unclear. Binding of the agent to melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) may concentrate the drug in this region, but it has also been suggested that toxicity originates in the photoreceptor layer with secondary RPE damage. In either case, impairment of lysosomal function and autophagy contributes to RPE degeneration and photoreceptor loss.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) has provided formal recommendations on screening for chloroquine (CQ) and HCQ retinopathy, the most recent iteration of which was released in 2016.These guidelines provide a framework for ophthalmologists and rheumatologists by reviewing patient risk factors, predictors of toxicity, dosage recommendations, preferred screening methodology and management following diagnosis. These guidelines recommend a weight-based dosing (≤5 mg/kg real weight), but also state that although the risk of HCQ toxicity ‘is smaller with low doses, it is not clear that there is any truly ‘safe’ dosage for long durations of use’. In making these guidelines, the risk assessments were based on outcomes of characteristic visual field pattern defects combined with retinal findings on optical coherence tomography (OCT).It is unclear whether rheumatologists are familiar and compliant with the 2016 AAO guidelines and the risk factors associated with blindness, including duration of use, medical history of renal or macular disease, and tamoxifen use.

Previous studies have estimated the frequency of HCQ retinal toxicity between 1.0% and 7.5%.Additionally, the proportion of patients with retinal toxicity is under 1% for the first 5 years, increases to 2% after 10 years, and increases to about 20% after 20 years of exposure. For patients taking ≥5 mg/kg dose, the risk of retinal toxicity is two to three times higher for the same time frame increments.Additionally, higher HCQ blood levels are associated with increased risk of HCQ retinopathy.

While HCQ-related blindness is uncommon, the potential for these harmful side effects raises concern among patients, rheumatologists and ophthalmologists. Whether retinal toxicity measured by OCT has the same ominous prognosis as decreased visual fields resulting in long-term damage and possible blindness remains to be determined.There are limited data on the actual risk and prevalence of HCQ-induced blindness in patients with SLE.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common vasculitis in adults and blindness is a common complication if left untreated. Oral glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment and if started promptly, loss of vision can usually be prevented. We present the case of a 77-year-old man who developed irreversible bilateral blindness after a confirmed diagnosis of GCA and oral steroid treatment. The roles of diagnostic delay, steroid dosing, significance of visual symptoms at diagnosis and after commencing oral glucocorticoids, and interpretation of ophthalmological signs are reviewed.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.

2.2 Dosage for Malaria in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.

Prophylaxis

Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:

Adult patients: 400 mg once a week
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week

Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:

Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg).
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg).

For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8- aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)] .

2.3 Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults

The recommended dosage is:

Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.

Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.

2.4 Dosage for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Adults

The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.

For G2 anterior uveitis with 1+ or 2+ cells, Hold ICPI temporarily until after ophthalmology consult and obtain Urgent ophthalmology referral; start Topical corticosteroids (eg, 1% prednisolone acetate suspension), cycloplegic agents (eg, atropine), and systemic corticosteroids; May resume ICPI treatment once off systemic steroids if patient has only ocular irAE, once corticosteroids are reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone equivalent; Continued topical or ocular steroids are permitted when resuming therapy to manage and minimize local toxicity; and Retreat after return to ≤ G1. For G3 anterior uveitis with 3+ or greater cells; intermediate posterior or pan-uveitis, Permanently discontinue ICPI with Urgent ophthalmology referral and Systemic corticosteroids and intravitreal or periocular/ or topical corticosteroids; Methotrexate may be used in patients who respond poorly to systemic corticosteroids or those with severe sight-threatening inflammation. For G4, defined as Best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the affected eye, Permanently discontinue ICPI, obtain Emergent ophthalmology referral, and give Systemic corticosteroids—prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/d or methylprednisolone 0.8-1.6 mg/kg/d and intravitreal or periocular or topical corticosteroids per ophthalmologist opinion. Additional considerations: Consider use of infliximab, other TNFα blockers, or IVIG in cases that are severe and refractory to standard treatment.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and care of living kidney donors [^bdd456c9]. Transplantation (2017). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis (LN) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)—antimalarial therapy is directed as follows: Recommendation 10.2.1.1 states, “We recommend that patients with SLE, including those with lupus nephritis (LN), be treated with hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent antimalarial unless contraindicated (1C).” Hydroxychloroquine use in pregnancy “has been associated with a decrease in lupus activity and a satisfactory safety profile in both the mother and the fetus.” Evidence from a 24‑week RCT reported a higher incidence of SLE flares after stopping hydroxychloroquine, with “a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.50 (95% CI: 1.08–5.58),” and “Two observational studies reported an association between hydroxychloroquine treatment and reduced mortality in patients with LN, but the certainty of evidence for this outcome is very low.” Safety screening notes that “Assessment of G6PD levels should be performed in men, especially those of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern origin, before starting hydroxychloroquine.” For ocular monitoring, guidelines “do not recommend baseline examination prior to initiating treatment,” and “yearly monitoring should begin after 1 year of therapy in patients with additional risk factors (concomitant tamoxifen use; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2; dose of hydroxychloroquine >5 mg/kg/d; use of chloroquine) or after 5 years of therapy otherwise.” Retinopathy risk is quantified as “affecting 0.5% after 6 years of treatment, increasing to 7.5% in long-term users in general, and could be >20% when treatment duration is over 20 years.” Dosing guidance states, “The recommended starting dose of hydroxychloroquine is around 5 mg/kg/d (≤2.3 mg/kg/d for chloroquine). Doses of 2–3 mg/kg/d may not achieve adequate blood levels,” and “a blood hydroxychloroquine level above 0.6 mg/l may be associated with a lower risk of LN flare.” Renal adjustment is specified: “In patients with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the dose of hydroxychloroquine should be reduced by ≥25%.” Resource considerations note that hydroxychloroquine “can be an expensive drug in some countries,” and in low‑resource settings chloroquine may be considered, “but the increased risk of toxicity of the latter should be noted.”

### Retinal toxicity in a multinational inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus on hydroxychloroquine [^09c89f52]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a mainstay in SLE treatment. However, long-term HCQ use may induce retinal toxicity, a serious event that potentially leads to blindness.Retinal damage is of major concern for physicians and patients since there is no specific treatment (other than discontinuing the drug) and serious vision loss can ensue.

Recommendations of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) were revised in 2016 so that the current recommended maximum daily dose is 5 mg/kg (based on actual body weight).Potential risk factors for HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) retinopathy, including high daily dosage, cumulative HCQ and reduced renal function have been studied only in patients with prevalent SLE.Some have misgivings that AAO guidelines are based on suboptimal evidence.

We aimed to evaluate the temporal relationship between HCQ use and retinal toxicity in an incident SLE cohort. We also investigated demographic and clinical characteristics associated with HCQ-induced retinal toxicity.

### Accidental hydroxychloroquine overdose resulting in neurotoxic vestibulopathy [^fa8db29d]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine is an oral antimalarial medication commonly used off-label for a variety of rheumatological conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome and dermatomyositis. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman who presented with acute onset headache, bilateral tinnitus, and left-sided facial numbness and tingling in the setting of accidentally overdosing on hydroxychloroquine. By the next morning, the patient began to experience worsening in the tingling sensation and it eventually spread to her left arm, thigh and distal extremities. The patient also complained of new onset blurring of her peripheral vision and feeling 'off balance.' Despite a complete neurological and ophthalmological work-up with unremarkable imaging and blood work, the patient has had no improvement in her tinnitus, left-sided paresthesias, visual disturbance or ataxia. This is a unique case of hydroxychloroquine overdose resulting in permanent neurotoxic vestibulopathy.

Discussion and conclusion

HCQ has become a mainstay in the management of myriad autoimmune diseases. It proved effective in decreasing morbidity and mortality in various autoimmune conditions e.g. SLE with a relatively safer profile compared to other options like long term systemic steroids and immunosuppressants. However, it doesn't come without adverse effects. One of the well-established complications of HCQ treatment is retinal toxicity namely HCQ maculopathy. With the increasing awareness of the condition together with the advent of more sensitive diagnostic tools e.g. mfERG, VF, FAF, SD-OCT; we are able to detect HCQ maculopathy much earlier which is crucial for the long term visual prognosis since late HCQ-induced damage tends to be irreversible and sometimes even progressive despite drug discontinuation. Multiple retrospective studies investigated the incidence of HCQ maculopathy with varying results but it is generally reported to be < 1% at 5 years, < 2% at 10 years, < 20% at 20 years highlighting the duration of treatment as an important risk factor. These studies associated maculopathy to body weight and adjusted body weight taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of HCQ. Also the daily dose and duration were among the important factors since they are direct contributors to drug accumulation which has been hypothesized to be at the core of HCQ maculopathy pathogenesis where HCQ accumulation in the melanin-laden RPE causes RPE dysfunction and trophic changes with consequent photoreceptor loss. Other factors that might contribute to a higher incidence of HCQ maculopathy include systemic diseases e.g. renal and hepatic impairment and retinal diseases. Based on results from retrospective studies, the AAO formulated guidelines for HCQ retinal toxicity screening where it accounted for the various reported risk factors. The latest recommended daily dose according to the AAO is 5 mg/Kg/day which adjusts for factors of body weight and daily dose. The guidelines also recommended baseline ophthalmological assessment prior to commencing HCQ and yearly thereafter starting from the fifth year of treatment which acknowledges the cumulative nature of HCQ maculopathy pathogenesis as well as the reported incidence which is as low as 1% at 5 years. However, more frequent follow-ups are required for patients with systemic diseases e.g. renal or hepatic impairment as well as retinal diseases. When it comes to retinal diseases as a risk factor for HCQ maculopathy, the AAO 2016 revised guidelines state that there is no specific evidence to confirm such a risk and that such a recommendation concerning retinal diseases is based on the rationale of not adding a retinotoxic medication to an already compromised retina. The lack of specific evidence concerning retinal diseases as risk factors for HCQ maculopathy thus constitutes a gap in our knowledge and therefore deprives our clinical practice concerning HCQ and retinal diseases from evidence-based robustness. This case study addresses this lack of specific evidence by reporting a direct association between a specific retinal disease namely CRAO and early onset HCQ maculopathy where bull's eye maculopathy developed monocularly after only 16 months of treatment in the eye with CRAO. Various cases of HCQ maculopathy in SLE patients have been reported but they were all bilateral and occurred after at least 6 years of HCQ treatment.We assume that the early onset unilateral HCQ maculopathy may be related to the central retinal artery occlusion that affected the same eye prior to commencing HCQ. We theorize that the early development of outer retinal defects with RPE and photoreceptor loss may be due to a decrease in Muller-cell derived neurotrophic signals to photoreceptors secondary to Muller cell loss and dysfunction following CRAO. It is reported in literature that neurotrophic factors like brain derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor(CNTF) and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor(GDNF) decreased the rate of photoreceptor loss in some models of retinal degenerations and phototoxicity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the decrease in such glia-dependent neurotrophic factors following CRAO may predispose the retina to HCQ toxicity with rapid loss of photoreceptors leading to the early onset monocular presentation in our case. However, further research is needed to validate such theory. While a single case report is not enough evidence to establish a definitive association, it helps nonetheless guide future large-scale studies towards specific retinal diseases as suspects of increasing risk of HCQ maculopathy. It also conveys a message to clinicians about the need for close and meticulous screening and follow-up of patients with retinal occlusive vasculopathies on HCQ treatment.

METHODS

Study populations

The BeSt study

The BeSt study (BehandelStrategieën, Treatment Strategies, Trial registry ISRCTN32675862) is a multicentre, assessor-blinded randomised trial in DMARD-naïve RA patients (ACR 1987 classification criteria) with symptom duration ≤2 years. Patients were randomised to four treatment strategies: (1) sequential DMARD monotherapy, or (2) step-up combination therapy, both arms starting with methotrexate, or (3) initial combination therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine and high dose prednisone or with (4) methotrexate and infliximab. During 10 years’ follow-up, based on three monthly assessments, treatment was intensified as long as Disease Activity Score (DAS) was >2.4, but if DAS was ≤2.4 for ≥6 consecutive months, medication was tapered and, from t=2.5 years, if DAS remained below 1.6, eventually stopped.

The IMPROVED study

The IMPROVED study (Trial registry ISRCTN11916566) is a multicentre, two-step randomised, assessor-blinded, clinical trial in DMARD-naïve early RA (2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, symptom duration ≤2 years) and undifferentiated arthritis (UA) patients, with 5 years’ follow-up. Patients with UA were not included in the current analysis. All patients were treated with methotrexate and prednisone for 4 months. Patients not in remission (DAS<1.6) after 4 months were randomised to two groups: (1) combination therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and prednisone and (2) combination therapy with methotrexate and adalimumab. Based on four monthly assessments, treatment was intensified if DAS was ≥1.6, but tapered and stopped if DAS remained <1.6.

The study protocols of both trials were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of each participating centre and all patients signed informed consent. A full description of BeSt and IMPROVED including a description of the trial protocol was previously published.

Patient and public involvement

Patient and public were not involved in design, conduct, reporting or dissemination of the research, initiation of both studies being at the time where this was not common practice.

### Case for a new corticosteroid treatment trial in optic neuritis: review of updated evidence [^7242eed4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Given these limitations, h it is not surprising that more recent non-inferiority trials have refuted the finding that intravenous corticosteroid treatment is superior to oral administration.

The ONTT leaves unanswered at least two vital questions. If steroids are given within some ‘critical window’ of symptom onset, are they efficacious, in certain types of ON, or even in patients with demyelinating ON? Also if patients with ON of uncertain aetiology at presentation are given steroids promptly (eg, within 48 hours), can blindness be averted? Persisting uncertainty from this landmark trial has resulted in controversy and ongoing practice variation internationally, and the stakes are high. In this opinion piece, a case is made on the need for a new corticosteroid versus placebo treatment trial in ON.

### Hydroxychloroquine retinopathy: an emerging problem [^8ff02a1b]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

PurposeThe aim of this case series is to raise awareness of the emerging issue of serious retinal damage caused by the prolonged use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the importance of adequate and appropriate monitoring of visual function during treatment.Patient and methodsThis is a small retrospective case series of 3 patients on long-term HCQ who developed serious symptomatic retinal toxicity confirmed on imaging and functional testing.ResultsAll 3 patients were treated with HCQ for over 15 years; two for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and the third for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). All 3 patients had macular involvement varying in severity confirmed with characteristic features on imaging and functional testing (Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Autofluorescence (AF) and Humphrey 10-2 visual fields).ConclusionHCQ is widely used to treat autoimmune conditions with a proven survival benefit in patients with SLE. However, long-term use can be associated with irreversible retinal toxicity. These cases highlight that HCQ, like chloroquine, can also cause visual loss in susceptible individuals. Early detection of presymptomatic retinal changes by the introduction of appropriate screening and monitoring is mandatory to limit the extent of irreversible visual loss due to HCQ retinal toxicity.

### Progression of hydroxychloroquine toxic effects after drug therapy cessation: new evidence from multimodal (...) [^2641a76c]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Outer retinal atrophy is seen on the initial scan and at final follow-up at 37 months. Note exuberant pigmentary migration into the outer nuclear and outer plexiform layers at follow-up. There is progressive atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium as indicated by increased choroidal illumination. Mild stippled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence outside the foveal ring of hypoautofluorescence is seen on initial FAF. The stippling becomes more apparent at follow-up FAF 6 months later. This unimpressive stippling on FAF is associated with atrophy of the external limiting membrane, photoreceptor layer, and outer nuclear layer with retinal pigment epithelium damage on SD-OCT. Seven patients with a mean age of 55. 9 years developed retinal toxic effects after using hydroxychloroquine for a mean of
10. 4 years.

Fundus examination revealed macular pigmentary changes in all 7 patients, corresponding to abnormal fundus autofluorescence. Clinical diagnosis was made based on identification of macular RPE changes, typically in a concentric fashion around the fovea in conjunction with patient symptoms of photopsias, nyctalopia, and decreased vision. The visual acuity status in patient 3 at the time of diagnosis was complicated by history of perioperative ischemic optic neuropathy. Toxic effects were suspected based on findings from clinical examinations, which revealed suspicious features, including RPE mottling around the fovea to a small arc of pigmentation or a complete ring around the fovea. These clinical examination findings were confirmed with other screening modalities mentioned below. We suggest that early detection and discontinuation of the drug therapy may be associated with relative sparing of the retina.

Consequently, we recommend following up patients with serial examinations of retinal thickness on SD-OCT and stress the importance of clinically correlating these findings with early signs of toxic effects seen on examination. Our volumetric analysis only included total macular volume and did not include any subfield thickness analysis, which may be of future research interest.

How to treat attacks?

Without treatment, the outcome of NMOSD attacks is often poor, with full recovery observed in only a minority of patients. However, recovery can be improved by prompt initiation of therapy in acute attacks and early escalation. Factors such as pre-existing disability, type and severity of an attack, age, and, most importantly, time interval to treatment initiation also contribute to recovery.

The standard of care for acute attacks in both AQP4-IgG-positive and double-negative NMOSD are high-dose glucocorticoids and apheresis therapy. Methylprednisolone (MP) should be usually administered intravenously (i. v.) at a dose of 1000 mg per day for 3–5 days, followed by an oral MP taper (starting with either 1 mg/kg/day or 20–30 mg/day and then tapered to 10–15 mg/day within 2–3 weeks) in combination with proton pump inhibition and thrombosis prophylaxis. Low-dose oral glucocorticoids for up to 3–6 months are also considered beneficial for preventing subsequent early attacks, although there is a lack of prospective studies. The duration of low-dose add-on glucocorticoid treatment depends on the AQP4-IgG serostatus, disease activity, mode of action, and the expected time to the attack-preventive effect of the subsequent immunotherapy.

### Hydroxychloroquine sulfate [^0c883b2a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.

2.2 Dosage for Malaria in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.

Prophylaxis

Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:

Adult patients: 400 mg once a week
Pediatric patients ≥ 31kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week

Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria 

The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:

Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg).
Pediatric patients ≥ 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg).

For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8‑-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)] .

2.3 Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults

The recommended dosage is:

Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .
Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.

Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.

2.4 Dosage for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Adults

The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.

Inflammatory arthritis (IA) in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)—grade-based management is as follows: For all grades, clinicians should follow reports of new joint pain to determine if IA is present. For G1, continue ICI and initiate analgesia with acetaminophen and/or NSAIDs. For G2, consider holding ICI; if inadequately controlled, initiate prednisone 10-20 mg/d or equivalent; if improvement, slow taper according to response during the next 4-6 weeks; if no improvement after initial 4 weeks treat as G3; if unable to lower corticosteroid dose to below 10 mg/d after 6-8 weeks, consider DMARD; consider intra-articular steroid injections for large joints; and refer to rheumatology. For G3-4, hold ICI temporarily and may resume in consultation with rheumatology, if recover to ≤ G1; initiate oral prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg; if failure of improvement after 2 weeks or worsening in meantime, consider synthetic or biologic DMARD (synthetic options include methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine alone or in combination); consider anticytokine therapy such as TNF or IL-6 antagonists, noting IL6 inhibition can cause intestinal perforation and should not be used in patients with concomitant immune-related colitis; and refer to rheumatology.

### Comparison of screening procedures in hydroxychloroquine toxicity (...) [^2b8d007e]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Figure 1. Fundus photographs of the right macula of all the patients, arranged as in Table
3. Patients with early and moderate toxicity had normal examination findings, whereas those with severe toxicity showed bull’s-eye retinal pigment epithelium atrophy. Figure 4. Horizontal spectral domain optical coherence tomography cross-section scans from the left eye of all the patients, arranged as in Table
3. At the right side of each scan are SD-OCT subfield thickness plots, which show significant parafoveal loss in every patient. The cross-sections show subtle changes in patients with early toxicity, prominent parafoveal photoreceptor loss in those with moderate toxicity, and widespread retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor damage in patients with severe toxicity. The SD-OCT subfield thickness plots showed a ring of parafoveal thinning in all the patients.

The SD-OCT cross-sections showed parafoveal loss of the inner segment–outer segment and cone outer segment tip lines at early stages of toxicity, progressing to parafoveal thinning of the outer nuclear layer and eventually to retinal pigment epithelium damage. There was a ring of autofluorescence in most patients. Figure 5 shows magnified views of 4 scans to illustrate early changes as this toxicity develops. Much of the literature on macular disease stresses damage to the inner segment–outer segment line as a critical early sign of photoreceptor damage and dysfunction, and this line disappeared where there was distinct thinning of the photoreceptor layers. Underlying maculopathy could also affect the SD-OCT, although none of the patients with early or moderate toxicity in this study showed pathologic findings beyond some focal drusenoid changes seen on SD-OCT.

The early thinning we observed by SD-OCT may include damage to inner retinal layers as proposed by Pasadhika and Fishman, 19 but as the toxicity evolves, one sees progressive loss of the parafoveal photoreceptor layers, whereas the inner retina stays relatively intact. However, many cases of late progression in the literature were already severe, with visible retinopathy. If hydroxychloroquine toxicity can be detected early by the criteria in this article, when anatomic photoreceptor damage is subtle, there may be few cells injured beyond repair or survival and, hopefully, less risk of progression.

### Evaluation of ganglion cell complex in patients taking hydroxychloroquine [^7c66e9d5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline derivative widely prescribed for treating several rheumatologic and dermatologic disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Retinal toxicity is the major and potentially most serious irreversible side effect of this treatment, manifesting as bull’s eye maculopathy, irreversible loss of visual acuity, color vision defects, and central scotoma. The overall prevalence of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy is 7.5%,which varied with daily consumption (odds ratio, 5.67; 95% CI, 4.14–7.79 for > 5.0 mg/kg) and with duration of use (odds ratio, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.20–4.70 for > 10 years), indicating the strong dose- and duration-dependent associations.

The ganglion cell complex consists of three layers of retina: the nerve fiber layer (NFL), the ganglion cell layer (GCL), and the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (Fig. 1). As a type of 2nd order neuron, GCC plays a vital role in visual processing. It is usually a single layer in the peripheral retina; within the macula, it is multilayered and has the highest concentration of ganglion cells. In the initial stages of toxicity, changes are seen in retinal ganglion cells in the form of membranous cytoplasmic bodies followed by cellular degeneration. In this stage, the toxicity is difficult to diagnose, as fundus examination may appear normal. At later stages, it leads to the degeneration of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium degeneration by binding to melanin resulting in functional loss in the visual field, decreased visual acuity, and impairment of color vision. Since the structural and functional damage at later stages is irreversible, an early screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy becomes crucial. Also, baseline screening is recommended before starting HCQ treatment to rule out pre-existing maculopathy. OCT is a non-invasive retinal imaging technique that produces cross-sectional images of different layers of the retina and used for quantitative analysis of retinal morphology (Fig. 1). The ability of OCT to visualize the retinal tissue with ultra-high clarity in a fraction of seconds and have ushered in a new era of retinal pathology documentation and diagnostic imaging.

### Special report: recommendations on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy (2026 revision) [^e0bfbe60]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Screening for toxicity—rationale in hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy emphasizes that HCQ retinopathy is generally not reversible except possibly at the very earliest stages of toxicity, and that cellular damage can progress seriously if HCQ is not stopped before damage becomes severe. Screening is also important to recognize retinal changes while they are sufficiently early and mild so patients can consider options to extend their use of an important drug while minimizing further damage and potential visual loss. HCQ is described as a very effective therapeutic agent, especially for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

### A multidisciplinary collaborative approach to retinal toxic effects screening for dermatology patients taking antimalarials [^db427e87]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the roles of antimalarial therapy prescribers and eye care specialists in regard to antimalarial dosing, screening for retinal toxic effects, and antimalarial treatment cessation?

Bottom Line

Antimalarial prescribers should prescribe antimalarial dosages at 5 mg/kg/d or less of actual body weight. A baseline retinal examination with optical coherence tomography should be performed within 6 months of starting antimalarial therapy to rule out confounding disease. Patients at low risk for retinopathy do not require annual screening until 5 years of antimalarial use. Eye care clinicians should not stop treatment with antimalarials because of equivocal findings, as retinopathy occurs slowly, and therefore there is time for repeated testing. Antimalarial treatment cessation should be a collaborative decision that involves the patient, the prescriber, and the eye care clinician and that focuses on patient values, the severity of the underlying disease, and the estimated risk of visual loss if treatment with the drug is continued.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^5e098296]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinal toxicity is an ongoing concern for rheumatologists. The revised 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines created controversy regarding the correct dosing and evaluation of HCQ toxicity. The current study was initiated to further understand rheumatologists’ practices regarding HCQ.

Methods

A questionnaire-based survey was distributed electronically to rheumatologists. We collected information on HCQ dosing, clinical decision-making processes, familiarity with the AAO 2016 guidelines, and perceived disparities between the AAO 2016 guidelines and rheumatological clinical practice.

Results

78 rheumatologists completed the survey (49% from USA, 90% academic practices, 82% self-identified as lupus experts). Only lupus expert (n=64) data were included in subsequent analysis. The mean cohort size was 747 (50–6571), a total cohort 45 612 patients. HCQ was prescribed to >75% of patients with SLE by 81.3% of SLE experts, with routine counselling about ophthalmic risks. The typical dose of HCQ used was 200–400 mg/day. 17% of rheumatologists use doses up to 600 mg/day, while 6.2% use up to 6.5 mg/kg/day. HCQ adherence is routinely assessed. 479 cases of HCQ retinal toxicity (1.05%) and 9 cases of HCQ-associated blindness (1.8 per 10 000 patients) were reported. 89.1% of respondents reported familiarity with the AAO guidelines. Those aware of the guidelines cited limited dosing options (54.7%), lack of supporting evidence (57.8%) and low patient adherence (43.8%) as obstacles to greater implementation of the guidelines.

Conclusion

These data suggest that HCQ toxicity and blindness are rare in patients with SLE. Rheumatologists treating patients with SLE are aware of the guidelines and appreciate the importance of partnering with ophthalmologists in preventing retinal toxicity.

### Toxic retinopathy with hydroxychloroquine therapy (...) [^1f11160b]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical images: fundus photography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and 10-2 white target visual fields. Levels of retinal toxicity: A, Normal fundus. B, Mild retinal toxicity, with distinctive parafoveal thinning of the outer retina and fragments of a ring scotoma. C, Moderate retinal toxicity, with marked outer retinal thinning on both sides of the fovea and a prominent ring scotoma. D, Severe retinal toxicity, with bull’s eye maculopathy on the fundus image, disruption of the retinal pigment epithelium on spectral-domain OCT, and severe visual field defects. Because we are reporting only on aggregate data obtained by medical record reviews, informed consent from individual patients was not deemed necessary by the institutional review board.

Retinal toxicity was judged by characteristic damage on visual field testing or SD-OCT and was confirmed to be unequivocal by both of us. For visual field testing, toxicity meant partial or full ring scotomas mainly involving the parafoveal region. 10, 11 For SD-OCT, this meant predominantly parafoveal thinning of the outer retina and loss of photoreceptor outer segment marker lines. 5, 12, 13. Table 1 lists the clinical characteristics of our patient population. Of 2361 patients who had taken hydroxychloroquine continuously for at least 5 years and who had 10-2 visual fields or SD-OCT, 177 showed clear signs of retinal toxicity. None of the primary medical indications for hydroxychloroquine therapy were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of retinal toxicity.

Screening requires the use of tests, such as 10-2 visual fields and SD-OCT, to demonstrate early retinal damage. We have shown that 10-2 visual fields are sometimes more sensitive than SD-OCT in revealing retinal toxicity. 24 However, SD-OCT is more specific and objective, and we suggest the use of both tests when available. With effective screening, retinal toxicity can be recognized at an early stage when patients are typically asymptomatic and disease is unlikely to progress. 25.

### Rheumatologists' perspective on hydroxychloroquine guidelines [^0f2055f7]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Several recent studies aimed to investigate temporal shifts in HCQ dosing in the context of revised guidelines, producing rather mixed results. One group reviewed prescription patterns in a large health network from 2007 to 2016 and reported reduced dosing over time with a marked decrease in percentage of patients receiving at least 400 mg HCQ daily in light of the 2011 guideline revisions.On the other hand, a retrospective review of electronic medical records of another health system documented that approximately 50% and 47% of patients seen from 2009 to 2016 were placed on excess initial doses according to the 2011 and 2016 guidelines, respectively. Of the patients, 56% were currently on excess maintenance doses per the 2016 guidelines. The authors concluded that the 2011 revisions had little impact on clinical practice and similarly tempered expectations for that of subsequent revisions.

Studies have found that concern for adverse effects is a significant cause of non-adherence to medication in patients with SLE.Fear over HCQ toxicity has been a limiting factor in prescribing HCQ for both patients and rheumatologists. There is a lack of data regarding non-reversible HCQ retinopathy/retinal blindness from HCQ use. The current AAO recommendations do not alleviate these fears. The lower dosing suggested by the new guidelines does not consider the limited therapeutic options for the treatment of SLE or the risk/benefit profile of HCQ compared with that of immunosuppressive medications. While rheumatologists understand the 2016 AAO recommendations, the results of the survey expressed appropriate concern that the guidelines lack sufficient evidence to support the change in practice that has ensued. The 2016 AAO guidelines and screening recommendations may be a step forward towards improving patient safety, but not necessarily improved outcomes in SLE. Technological advancements should continue to shape opinions on prevalence of retinopathy and suggest solutions for diagnosis and management. In any case, there is certainly a need for continued multidisciplinary collaboration between clinicians using HCQ to treat debilitating illnesses and ophthalmologists seeking to avoid potentially devastating consequences of overuse.

### How far should I manage acute optic neuritis as an ophthalmologist? A United Kingdom perspective [^32df26a8]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known before:

The 1992 Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial provided evidence that corticosteroid therapy has no clear role (based on visual acuity outcome alone) in the management of a first episode of acute optic neuritis (ON), typical of demyelination associated with Multiple Sclerosis. However, it left many questions critical to the acute management of ON more generally, and especially ON not associated with MS, unaddressed.
For many ophthalmologists, especially those working without rapid access to neuro-ophthalmic support, making a call about whether and when to start high dose corticosteroid therapy, and how to investigate and manage patients with ON, may feel challenging.

What this article adds:

In this article, we summarise the latest evidence and provide our neuro-ophthalmic perspective. We share practical and pragmatic tips on how we approach the acute investigation and management of ON in our centres in the UK.
We highlight our opinion that, ‘ Time is Vision,’ and share clinical examples which illustrate how safe and rapid control of inflammation with urgent high dose corticosteroid, even inflammation associated with infection, can support preservation of ON axons and good visual outcomes for patients otherwise at risk of rapid and irreversible vision loss.

### Retinal toxicity in a multinational inception cohort of patients with systemic lupus on hydroxychloroquine [^ef37d5f1]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The current AAO (2016)and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (2019)recommendations caution against exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual body weight) of HCQ per day. Both guidelines base their recommendations mainly on a single study conducted in the USA in 2014.This study (which only included patients taking HCQ for >5 years) observed that patients using 4–5 mg/kg HCQ had <2% risk of retinopathy within the first 10 years of use, while patients exceeding 5 mg/kg had approximately a 10% risk in the same period. In our study, patients had less than 1% risk in the first decade of use. After 10 years, we observed a non-significant trend for higher risk, particularly among patients with a mean daily dose >5 mg/kg (but the 95% CIs around our estimates were very wide, table 2).

Recommendations from ophthalmology and rheumatology associations include good practices on screening for retinal toxicity, such as annual ophthalmology examination particularly in patients with >5 years of use and/or other risk factors (dose >5 mg/kg/day, renal impairment and other factors).Interestingly, three of our patients with retinal toxicity did not have any of these risk factors.

Our univariate analysis suggests that older age at SLE diagnosis may be associated with higher risk of retinopathy. Age was not included as a major risk factor in the 2016 AAO guidelines,but more recent studies also found older age to be a predictor in unadjusted analyses.The loss of retinal neurons with older age may set the stage for the clinical development of antimalarial retinal toxicity.However, the effect observed could be due to confounders. Older patients may be more adherent to drugs (higher exposure) and to ophthalmology monitoring (higher chances of event detection). Older patients may also have additional ocular (including retinal) pathology, and in some cases, this could potentially alter the likelihood of being diagnosed (correctly or incorrectly) with retinal toxicity. Given that there is no easily available replacement for HCQ in SLE, it is important to highlight the importance of collaborating closely with ophthalmology in the setting of retinal changes, particularly when there is some doubt as to the aetiology.

### Cooperation with rheumatologists on intensive systemic treatment for psoriatic arthritis-related panuveitis with retinal vasculitis: a case report [^dc459724]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 47-year-old woman was referred to our clinic by the local medical doctor because of recalcitrant recurrent anterior uveitis in her right eye for one month. She had suffered from similar complaints on and off in both eyes alternatively for about 10 years. Iritis was diagnosed then. Her condition usually improved after topical treatment. However, in this time attack, the symptoms were much more severe than before and her vision got worse even by the aggressive topical steroid. Her past medical history includes psoriatic arthritis with positive human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27), Sjogren’s syndrome, and hypothyroidism. Her psoriatic arthritis was newly diagnosed six months before the referral with the initial presentation of iritis and right buttock pain. Medication for her psoriatic arthritis was slowly titrated to cyclosporine 100 mg/day (about 1.72 mg/kg/day; her body weight was 58 kg) due to poor control under either leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine. The latest inflammatory marker of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 42 mm/hr (normal range < 15 mm/hr in females, the patient’s baseline when diagnosed as PsA: 38 mm/hr), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was 6.74 mg/L. Those were examined seven weeks before this time event.

### Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: multifocal electroretinogram and laser flare-cell photometry study [^e1a2c888]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we believe that mfERG is a very sensitive test in detecting early retinal dysfunction caused by HCQ toxicity in patients with no ophthalmologic symptoms and normal fundus appearance, visual acuity, and 10-2 pattern automated visual field analysis.

In agreement with AAO recommendations, we suggest that mfERG should be used instead of automated visual field analysis as objective functional test for the screening of patients treated with HCQ.

Future studies on HCQ retinal toxicity with mfERG should be directed at the determination of the earliest point at which mfERG can detect retinopathy. Another interesting future evaluation could be to use laser flare-cell photometry to better understand the importance of vascular permeability deterioration and BRB integrity breakdown in the development of toxic damage.
