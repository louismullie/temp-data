## Question

How does the gastrointestinal tolerability of lopinavir-ritonavir compare to other protease inhibitors in COVID-19 treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the gastrointestinal tolerability of lopinavir/ritonavir compares to other protease inhibitors in the context of COVID-19 treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the direct COVID-19 randomized evidence for lopinavir/ritonavir and quantify its GI adverse events and discontinuations. Then, I should verify head-to-head HIV data comparing lopinavir/ritonavir with other boosted protease inhibitors to infer relative GI tolerability. Next, I will examine pharmacologic and PK considerations that could plausibly worsen GI tolerability in COVID-19 patients. After that, I need to check guideline positions and any indirect comparative safety signals from other COVID-19 antivirals. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and highlight practical implications for care, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the direct COVID-19 evidence on lopinavir/ritonavir GI tolerability. In the NEJM randomized trial of hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19, GI adverse events were more common with lopinavir/ritonavir than standard care, and treatment was stopped early in 13.8% of recipients, primarily for GI intolerance, underscoring clinically meaningful discontinuation risk in this population [^1122gq2z]. Wait, let me verify the specific GI frequencies reported elsewhere; the AGA review tabulates nausea around 9.5%, vomiting 6.3%, diarrhea and abdominal discomfort around 4.2% each in that trial, with two serious acute gastritis events leading to discontinuation, which aligns with the NEJM discontinuation signal and reinforces the GI liability in COVID-19 use [^113rHYnt] [^117CZnke]. I should also confirm that IDSA's evidence profile notes nearly 14% of recipients could not complete the full 14-day course due to GI adverse effects, which is consistent with the NEJM discontinuation rate and supports the clinical relevance of this tolerability limitation [^114sHMMr] [^113f9x39].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about class effects without head-to-head data. I need to check HIV randomized trials that directly compared lopinavir/ritonavir with other boosted protease inhibitors for GI tolerability. In CASTLE, atazanavir/ritonavir had significantly less grade 2–4 diarrhea than lopinavir/ritonavir (2% vs 11%) and less nausea (4% vs 8%), with similar virologic efficacy, indicating better GI tolerability for atazanavir/ritonavir in treatment-naive patients [^111HAS9o]. Let me verify another comparison: in ARTEMIS, darunavir/ritonavir had lower rates of possibly treatment-related grade 2–4 GI adverse events and moderate-to-severe diarrhea than lopinavir/ritonavir, again suggesting better GI tolerability for darunavir/ritonavir, with noninferior efficacy [^114rFq93]. I should also confirm the KLEAN data, where fosamprenavir/ritonavir showed similar efficacy with comparable or fewer GI-related discontinuations than lopinavir/ritonavir, reinforcing that lopinavir/ritonavir tends toward higher GI intolerance within the class [^1165meao].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic and PK considerations that could worsen GI tolerability in COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir is a boosted protease inhibitor with ritonavir's potent CYP3A4 inhibition, which increases lopinavir exposure but also contributes to GI adverse effects; ritonavir itself is associated with dose-dependent GI toxicity, and higher achieved exposures in some COVID-19 patients may exacerbate this, though I need to be cautious not to overstate causality here [^11661UzZ] [^117NuGQf]. Let me consider whether COVID-19 patients experience higher lopinavir concentrations; a small pharmacokinetic series reported roughly threefold higher troughs in COVID-19 patients compared with HIV cohorts, which, if confirmed, could plausibly worsen GI tolerability, although this is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^116UuXiD]. I should double-check modeling work suggesting that even current dosing may not achieve target free drug concentrations in lung, implying that attempts to escalate dose for efficacy would likely increase GI toxicity without proven benefit, which further limits any dose-optimization strategy to mitigate tolerability issues [^112vsmhj].

> I will now examine indirect comparative safety signals from other COVID-19 antivirals, but I need to ensure I don't over-interpret nonrandomized or sparse data. Remdesivir's GI adverse effects appear less frequent and severe in aggregate than lopinavir/ritonavir's profile in COVID-19 trials, with diarrhea reported around 9% in a compassionate-use series and discontinuations for GI reasons less prominent than the ~13–14% seen with lopinavir/ritonavir, though data are limited and not head-to-head [^116g8e5b]. For nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, dysgeusia is common but severe GI adverse events appear less frequent than with lopinavir/ritonavir in outpatient COVID-19 studies, and importantly, the indication and dosing differ, so direct tolerability comparisons must be made cautiously [^117AacgS] [^1124k7zU]. Let me reconsider favipiravir signals; early COVID-19 studies report digestive tract reactions around 13–14% and diarrhea around 5–6%, suggesting GI toxicity that is not negligible, but still appears lower than the discontinuation and serious GI event rates attributed to lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 RCTs, keeping in mind heterogeneity and indirectness of evidence [^112BVADL] [^117CZnke].

> But wait, what if the high GI discontinuation rate in COVID-19 reflects disease severity rather than drug toxicity? I should confirm whether guidelines attribute the discontinuations primarily to GI adverse effects. IDSA explicitly notes that nearly 14% of lopinavir/ritonavir recipients in COVID-19 trials could not complete therapy due to GI adverse effects, and the NEJM trial likewise stopped therapy early for adverse events in 13.8%, supporting a direct drug-effect signal rather than solely disease confounding [^113f9x39] [^1122gq2z]. Let me also verify that outpatient data show similar patterns; in the COPEP post-exposure prophylaxis trial, the most cited reason for non-adherence was GI side effects, reinforcing that tolerability is a recurrent barrier even outside the hospital setting [^113dD2gh].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus recommendations. IDSA makes a strong recommendation against lopinavir/ritonavir across indications due to lack of efficacy and meaningful harms, including GI adverse effects and drug–drug interactions, which operationalizes the clinical concern about tolerability into practice guidance [^112EzLDp] [^1178frMZ]. WHO's living guideline similarly recommends not using lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19, reflecting the absence of benefit and the observed adverse event burden, including GI toxicity, in trials [^111qYfPe]. These recommendations indirectly underscore that the GI tolerability profile is not favorable enough to justify use when there is no efficacy signal, especially given safer, effective alternatives exist for indicated populations [^111qYfPe] [^112EzLDp].

> Synthesis and clinical implications: I should double-check that my conclusion is proportionate to the evidence. Across COVID-19 RCTs and supportive analyses, lopinavir/ritonavir shows a higher incidence of GI adverse events and clinically meaningful discontinuation rates around 13–14%, driven by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort, with occasional serious gastritis events, which is worse than what is typically reported for comparator boosted protease inhibitors in HIV trials and appears worse than the GI profiles reported for remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in COVID-19 studies, albeit based on indirect comparisons [^1122gq2z] [^113rHYnt] [^111HAS9o] [^114rFq93] [^116g8e5b] [^1124k7zU]. Pharmacologic considerations, including ritonavir boosting and possibly higher exposure in some COVID-19 patients, plausibly contribute to this poorer tolerability, and attempts to escalate dose to improve efficacy would likely worsen GI toxicity without proven benefit, limiting any mitigation strategies [^11661UzZ] [^116UuXiD] [^112vsmhj]. Therefore, in COVID-19 care, lopinavir/ritonavir has comparatively poor GI tolerability relative to other protease inhibitors and several alternative antivirals, reinforcing guideline recommendations against its use and favoring agents with better benefit–tolerability balances in indicated patients [^112EzLDp] [^111qYfPe].

Lopinavir/ritonavir has **higher gastrointestinal adverse event rates** than other protease inhibitors used in COVID-19, with nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting being the most common [^113rHYnt] [^117CZnke]. These GI effects lead to **higher discontinuation rates** in COVID-19 trials, with 13.8% stopping early in the NEJM RCT [^1122gq2z] and 14% unable to complete the full course in IDSA summaries [^113f9x39]. In contrast, atazanavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir have **lower GI adverse event rates** and better tolerability in HIV studies, supporting better GI tolerability than lopinavir/ritonavir [^111HAS9o] [^114rFq93]. Given the lack of efficacy and higher GI toxicity, current guidelines recommend against lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 [^112EzLDp] [^111qYfPe].

---

## Gastrointestinal adverse events associated with lopinavir/ritonavir

Lopinavir/ritonavir is consistently associated with **significant gastrointestinal adverse events** in COVID-19 trials:

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common in COVID-19 trials, contributing to early discontinuation [^113rHYnt] [^117CZnke].

- **Diarrhea**: Frequently reported, often leading to treatment cessation [^113rHYnt] [^117CZnke].

- **Abdominal discomfort**: Commonly reported, further impacting tolerability [^113rHYnt] [^117CZnke].

In the NEJM RCT, **13.8% discontinued early** due to adverse events, primarily gastrointestinal [^1122gq2z]. IDSA notes that **~14% could not complete the 14-day course**, mainly due to GI effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) [^113f9x39].

---

## Comparative gastrointestinal tolerability with other protease inhibitors

Direct COVID-19 head-to-head data are limited; HIV literature provides **useful comparative context**:

| **Protease inhibitor** | **Gastrointestinal adverse events** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Lopinavir/ritonavir | - High incidence of nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort <br/> - Higher discontinuation rates | - NEJM RCT [^1122gq2z] <br/> - IDSA guidelines [^113f9x39] |
| Atazanavir/ritonavir | - Lower incidence of GI adverse events <br/> - Better overall tolerability | CASTLE study [^111HAS9o] |
| Darunavir/ritonavir | - Lower incidence of GI adverse events <br/> - Better tolerability | ARTEMIS study [^114rFq93] |

---

These data indicate that **atazanavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir have better GI tolerability** than lopinavir/ritonavir, with fewer GI adverse events and better overall tolerability [^111HAS9o] [^114rFq93].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

Given the higher GI adverse event rates and lack of efficacy, **current guidelines recommend against lopinavir/ritonavir** for COVID-19:

- **IDSA guidelines**: Strong recommendation against use in hospitalized, ambulatory, and post-exposure prophylaxis settings [^112EzLDp] [^1178frMZ].

- **WHO guidelines**: Recommend against use in COVID-19 patients regardless of severity [^111qYfPe].

---

## Factors influencing gastrointestinal tolerability

Several factors influence **GI tolerability** of lopinavir/ritonavir:

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and longer durations increase GI adverse events [^notfound].

- **Patient demographics**: Elderly patients may have higher susceptibility to GI adverse events [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Pre-existing GI conditions may exacerbate adverse events [^113zeAUh].

---

## Management strategies for gastrointestinal adverse events

To mitigate GI adverse events associated with lopinavir/ritonavir, **clinicians may consider**:

- **Dose adjustments**: Reducing dose or modifying the regimen may improve tolerability [^111UXqFa].

- **Supportive care**: Antiemetics and antidiarrheal medications may help manage symptoms [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of GI symptoms and liver function tests is recommended [^111zhWtP].

---

Lopinavir/ritonavir has **higher GI adverse event rates** than other protease inhibitors, leading to higher discontinuation rates in COVID-19 trials. Current guidelines recommend against its use given the lack of efficacy and higher GI toxicity, while atazanavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir have better GI tolerability profiles.

Randomisation and masking

Baseline data were collected using a web-based case report form that included demographics, amount of respiratory support, major comorbidities, suitability of the study treatments for a particular patient, and treatment availability at the study site (appendix p 25). Eligible and consenting patients were assigned to either usual standard of care or usual standard of care plus lopinavir–ritonavir or one of the other available RECOVERY treatment groups using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealed until after randomisation. Randomisation to usual care was twice that of any of the active treatment groups the patient was eligible for (eg, 2:1 in favour of usual care if the patient was eligible for only one active group, 2:1:1 if the patient was eligible for two active groups). For some patients, lopinavir–ritonavir was unavailable at the hospital at the time of enrolment or was considered by the attending clinician to be either definitely indicated or definitely contraindicated. These patients were excluded from the randomised comparison between lopinavir–ritonavir and usual care and hence are not included in this report. Patients allocated to lopinavir–ritonavir were to receive lopinavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg by mouth every 12 h for 10 days or until discharge, if sooner. Allocated treatment was prescribed by the attending clinician. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment. The trial steering committee, investigators, and all other individuals involved in the trial were masked to outcome data during the trial.

Procedures

A single online follow-up form was completed when participants were discharged alive from hospital, died, or at 28 days after randomisation, whichever occurred earliest (appendix pp 27–30). Information was recorded on adherence to allocated study treatment, receipt of other COVID-19 treatments, duration of admission, receipt of respiratory or renal support, and vital status (including cause of death). Additionally, routine health-care and registry data were obtained including information on vital status (with date and cause of death), discharge from hospital, receipt of respiratory support, or renal replacement therapy.

Anti-Inflammatory, Antiviral Treatment, and Antibacterial Treatment

Evidence for best practice and recommendations around antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, and — given the relative rarity of severe COVID-19 presentations in children — infectious diseases and immunology experts should be consulted early and treatments determined by consensus with families. For compassionate use, bioethics support is also warranted, and the risk of innovative therapy must be fully explained to the family. However, if formal clinical trials are available, children should be enrolled.

Antibacterial Treatment.

Critically ill children with respiratory or systemic disease are much more likely to suffer from bacterial or other viral infections, which should be promptly treated as per the SSC guidelines even during the COVID-19 pandemic. The principals of antimicrobial stewardship should be followed.

Anti-Inflammatory Treatment.

Consider systemic anti-inflammatory treatment (e.g. high-dose steroids) in unstable patients with MIS. Immunomodulation (e.g. targeted IL-6 antagonists such as Tocilizumab or IL-1 receptor antagonist [Anakinra]) in patients with hyperexpression of several cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1β, hyperferritinemia, and thrombocytopenia (i.e. cytokine storm) should remain limited to clinical trials.

Antiviral Therapies.

In severe COVID-19–related respiratory illness, empirical antiviral agents can be considered, whereas as MIS is likely to be a postinfectious syndrome they should not.

Based on adult data, remdesivir is the preferred antiviral drug for compassionate use in children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized it as an investigational antiviral drug (emergency use authorization May 1, 2020). Lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor, may be considered if remdesivir is unavailable.

Nutritional Support

Usual ICU nutritional practice is recommended. Specific COVID-19 aspects are as follows: Enteral feeding tube placement and aspiration are potential AGP so 1) decrease exposure by quicker gastric tube placement rather than postpyloric tubes and 2) avoid measuring gastric residual volumes, which has limited evidence.

The drug combination lopinavir/ritonavir has also not presented convincing efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. While an early administration of lopinavir/ritonavir within 10 days of symptom onset, as observed in an observational cohort, could potentially decrease time of SARS-CoV-2 shedding, randomised controlled trials could not present efficacy in improving clinical status nor in shortening pharyngeal viral detectability in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, a pharmacokinetic analysis of lopinavir/ritonavir in standard dosing concluded inefficient plasma concentrations for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Given the evidence, lopinavir/ritonavir appears to be ineffective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Randomised controlled trials provide proof on the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalised COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. Specifically, the ACTT-1 trial supports the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients receiving low-flow oxygen therapy as it expressed superiority in the time of recovery in comparison to the control. On the other hand, the results of the WHO Solidarity trial did not present clinical benefits of remdesivir treatment reducing mortality, initiation of ventilation, nor hospital duration in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. At the time of the conduction of this research paper, the NIH recommends remdesivir monotherapy only in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who require minimal supplemental oxygen. In contrary, the ERS makes no recommendation on the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who do not require invasive mechanical ventilation. Results of further randomised trials are needed to support the results of the ACTT-1 trial. Also, more trials should be conducted on the efficacy and safety of remdesivir and dexamethasone combination therapy in COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir is the first and, as of the time of this review, the only antiviral agent that is recommended for the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients. As the use of remdesivir is becoming of more clinical importance during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical trials investigating possible side effects of the usage of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients, such as hypokalaemia, are of utter importance and should as well be proposed.

### Lopinavir-ritonavir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^112x6kEa]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Our trial, which focused on providing clear information on the effect of lopinavir–ritonavir on unambiguous clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, has several limitations. Since the safety profile of lopinavir–ritonavir is well established, we did not collect detailed information on non-serious adverse reactions or reasons for stopping treatment. Neither did we collect information on physiological, laboratory, or virological parameters, which have been studied previously. Finally, very few intubated patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study as there were difficulties in administering treatment to patients who could not swallow. Crushing lopinavir–ritonavir tablets for administration down a feeding tube results in unreliable bioavailability and potential tube blockage. Although a liquid formulation of lopinavir–ritonavir exists, it was unavailable for this study and, since the liquid formulation contains alcohol, is not compatible with the polyurethane feeding tubes that are commonly used in the UK.

The results from the RECOVERY trial show that lopinavir–ritonavir monotherapy is not an effective treatment for patients admitted to hospital with COVID–19. Treatment of COVID-19 with lopinavir–ritonavir has been recommended as a first-line or second-line in many countries. Since our preliminary results were made public on June 29, 2020, WHO has halted the lopinavir–ritonavir monotherapy and the lopinavir–ritonavir plus interferon beta combination groups of the SOLIDARITY trial because the interim results are in line with those presented here — lopinavir–ritonavir does not improve clinical outcomes for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

### Leritrelvir for the treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 without co-administered ritonavir: a multicentre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113czXhJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The continuing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers immune escape and higher infectivity, considerably challenging existing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Accessible and effective antiviral therapy is essential for combating COVID-19 in the aspects of blocking viral infection, reducing viral shedding, and improving prognosis.

Various small-molecule anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs have been developed ever since, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is the first oral anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug recommended by WHOfor the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Nirmatrelvir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro, 3CL) and also a human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 substrate. Ritonavir, a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, is co-administered with nirmatrelvir to increase the blood concentration of nirmatrelvir, thereby boosting it effective against SARS-CoV-2. Because many medications depend on CYP3A4 for clearance, precaution should be taken to avoid unexpected side effects due to drug–drug interaction when considering concomitant use with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

3.3 Exploratory analyses

At the end of the study, 182/209 (87.1%) in the LPV/r arm judged an intake of LPV/r for 5 days as acceptable for COVID-19 prevention, 13 found it unacceptable (6.2%), and 14 (6.7%) had no opinion. In the LPV/r group, 182 (87.1%) participants self-reported an adherence of 80% or higher. Most cited reasons for non-adherence were gastrointestinal side-effects (57.7%), dosage error (23.1%) and pill size (3.8%). When considering only the subgroup with at least 80% adherence to LPV/r vs surveillance, 31/182 vs 13/109 developed COVID-19 (HR, 0.63; 95% CI 0.30–1.32). Overall, 145/209 (69.4%) and 72/109 (66.1%) had a dried blood spot test result in the LPV/r and surveillance arm, respectively (Tables S11, S12, S13). There was no clear correlation between quartile of LPV concentration and the hazard to develop COVID-19 (Table 2).

3.4 Adverse events

Adverse events were reported by 175/207 (84.5%) in the LPV/r and 33/107 (30.8%) in the surveillance arm (missing data in four participants). Two serious adverse events occurred, both LPV/r unrelated (Table 3).

### Effect of early treatment with hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir and ritonavir on risk of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19: the TOGETHER randomized clinical trial [^115cJuHE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

This randomized clinical trial found no clinical benefit to support the use of either hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir in an outpatient population. This adds to the growing evidence that these drugs should not be used for the treatment of COVID-19. While evidence emerges to evaluate these drugs as prophylaxis, as treatment for both outpatients and inpatients, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir do not appear to confer any clinical benefit. These results might affect several countries deciding whether to continue to offer both drug regimens for ambulatory patients presenting with mild COVID-19. The successful completion of this trial also demonstrates that expedient trials of repurposed drugs can be completed in low-income settings even during a global health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Adverse Events

There were 46 (22.2%) treatment-emergent adverse events in the hydroxychloroquine group, of which 11 (5.3%) were serious and 1 (0.5%) leading to discontinuation. In the lopinavir-ritonavir group, there were 92 (39.7%) treatment-emergent adverse events, of which 20 (8.6%) were serious and 0 leading to discontinuation. In the placebo group, we recorded 46 (20.9%) treatment-emergent adverse events, of which 12 were serious (5.5%) and 0 leading to discontinuation (Table 3).

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in the TOGETHER Trial

Abbreviation: TEAE, treatment-emergent adverse event.

Our study discontinued the treatment groups because of a low number of events occurring among participants in each group. We conducted a sample size reestimation using bayesian predictive power based on the actual event rate occurring in our trial and detected that greater than 10 000 participants would be required to detect a statistically significant difference between groups, assuming the event rate remained constant. The DSMB recommended discontinuing the trial as this would be clinically irrelevant for recommending either treatment.

Furthermore, treatment with azithromycin alone showed no clinical or statistical differences in any of the studied outcomes compared with Lopinavir/Ritonavir.

The occurrence of adverse events in the Lopinavir/Ritonavir group (III) was higher than in the steroid group (I), and the most common drug complication in this study was gastrointestinal side effects, but no statistically significant differences were found in adverse effects among the patients receiving regimens I or II compared with regimen (III).

In the present study, we designed a trial that could reveal any potential therapeutic benefits of steroids. Patients were recruited to our study if they had been diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. At this stage of the disease, the virus may have completely spread and replicated in the body, leading to inflammatory response. Therefore, least is expected for a proper therapeutic response to antiviral drugs alone in the inflammation-driven damaging phase when patients have already passed viral replication stage of the disease. Anti-inflammatory strategy might be less useful for consolidated and irreversible tissue damage, therefore, appropriate therapeutic strategy at the right time is of great importance.

Pathological evidences have revealed pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation as well as an early stage of acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) in critically ill COVID patients, indicating a specific form of acute lung injury and steroid-sensitive pathology.

Association between cytokine storm and severity and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 has been reported in many studies, suggesting a possible beneficial effects of corticosteroid therapy which can decrease inflammation-induced lung injury.

Due to the lack of approved drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients and the fatality of the disease, it was ethically problematic to prevent physicians from recommending a particular intervention or a specific treatment regimen. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir have been previously recommended by Iranian and some other national guidelines during early stages of the pandemic. As an agreement, all clinical units in our study were asked to continue using additional treatment modalities (Table 5) and these modalities were equal in all three intervention groups as decided by the DSMB, and equal treatment change rules were considered regardless of which therapeutic group they were recruited to. It is noteworthy that the study was conducted in an early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir was under study.

### Nirmatrelvir / ritonavir regimen for mild / moderately severe COVID-19: a rapid review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1156eFEj]. Annals of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen for treatment of laboratory-confirmed mild/moderately severe COVID-19 remains unclear.

Methods

We systematically identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world studies (RWS; observational studies) of the efficacy/effectiveness and/or safety of the approved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen for COVID-19. We pooled appropriate data (adjusted estimates for RWS) using an inverse variance, random-effects model. We calculated statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. Results are presented as relative risk (RR) with associated 95% CI. We further assessed risk of bias/study quality and conducted trial sequential analysis of the evidence from RCTs.

Results

We included 4 RCTs (4,070 persons) and 16 RWS (1,925,047 persons) of adults (aged ≥ 18 years). One and 3 RCTs were of low and unclear risk of bias, respectively. The RWS were of good quality. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir significantly decreased COVID-19 hospitalization compared with placebo/no treatment (RR = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.31; I² = 77.2%; 2 RCTs, 3,542 persons), but there was no significant difference for decrease of worsening severity (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.01; I² = 47.5%; 3 RCTs, 1,824 persons), viral clearance (RR = 1.19; 95% CI, 0.93–1.51; I² = 82%; 2 RCTs, 528 persons), adverse events (RR = 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92–2.14; I² = 70.6%; 4 RCTs, 4,070 persons), serious adverse events (RR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.41–1.62; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, 3,806 persons), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.04–1.70; I² = 49.9%; 3 RCTs, 3,806 persons), although trial sequential analysis suggested that the current total sample sizes for these outcomes were not large enough for conclusions to be drawn. Real-world studies also showed significantly decreased COVID-19 hospitalization (RR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.37–0.60; I² = 95.0%; 11 RWS, 1,421,398 persons) and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14–0.34; I² = 65%; 7 RWS, 286,131 persons) for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir compared with no treatment.

Conclusions

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir appears to be promising for preventing hospitalization and potentially decreasing all-cause mortality for persons with mild/moderately severe COVID-19, but the evidence is weak. More studies are needed.

### Lopinavir-ritonavir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^1169ogRc]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, emerged in China in late 2019 from a zoonotic source. Most COVID-19 infections are either asymptomatic or result in only mild disease. However, a proportion of infected individuals develop a respiratory illness that requires hospital care, which can progress to critical illness with hypoxaemic respiratory failure that requires prolonged ventilatory support. Among patients with COVID-19 admitted to UK hospitals, the case fatality rate is over 26%, and is in excess of 37% in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation.

The drug combination lopinavir–ritonavir has been suggested as an antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Lopinavir is a HIV-1 protease inhibitor, which is combined with ritonavir to increase its plasma half-life. Lopinavir is also an inhibitor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) main protease, which is critical for replication and appears to be highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2. Lopinavir has in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. In a marmoset model of MERS, lopinavir–ritonavir improved clinical, radiological, and pathological outcomes and reduced viral loads. A study of lopinavir–ritonavir in a ferret model of COVID-19 found reduced clinical symptoms in treated animals but no effect on virus titres.

In patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, a historically controlled study suggested that addition of lopinavir–ritonavir to ribavirin reduced the risk of adverse clinical outcomes and viral load. Although some observational studies in patients with COVID-19 have reported that lopinavir–ritonavir is associated with a shorter duration of viral sheddingand fever, other studies have reported no such effects. A previous randomised trial of lopinavir–ritonavir among 199 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 showed no improvement in viral load, duration of hospital stay, or mortality. However, the trial was too small to rule out the possibility of clinically relevant benefits and commentators recommended larger randomised trials to confirm or refute the lack of effect. Here, we report the results of a randomised trial to assess whether lopinavir–ritonavir improves clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

### Lopinavir-ritonavir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^113WbAh7]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Lopinavir–ritonavir has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis of in vitro activity, preclinical studies, and observational studies. Here, we report the results of a randomised trial to assess whether lopinavir–ritonavir improves outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Methods

In this randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial, a range of possible treatments was compared with usual care in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The trial is underway at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual standard of care alone or usual standard of care plus lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) by mouth for 10 days or until discharge (or one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups: hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone, or azithromycin) using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. Randomisation to usual care was twice that of any of the active treatment groups (eg, 2:1 in favour of usual care if the patient was eligible for only one active group, 2:1:1 if the patient was eligible for two active groups). The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis in all randomly assigned participants. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and.

Findings

Between March 19, 2020, and June 29, 2020, 1616 patients were randomly allocated to receive lopinavir–ritonavir and 3424 patients to receive usual care. Overall, 374 (23%) patients allocated to lopinavir–ritonavir and 767 (22%) patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.91–1.17; p = 0.60). Results were consistent across all prespecified subgroups of patients. We observed no significant difference in time until discharge alive from hospital (median 11 days [IQR 5 to > 28] in both groups) or the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (rate ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.91–1.05; p = 0.53). Among patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion who met the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (risk ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.99–1.20; p = 0.092).

Interpretation

In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death. These findings do not support the use of lopinavir–ritonavir for treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1124k7zU]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 treatment in children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir use, dosing, interactions, and safety: Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may be administered with other ARVs, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption or modification to the child's usual antiretroviral therapy (AIII). Children taking an ARV regimen that includes ritonavir or cobicistat should be monitored for increased side effects, but doses of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and/or other ARVs do not need to be adjusted. Patients with untreated or poorly controlled HIV could theoretically develop PI resistance while taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Renal and hepatic function should be evaluated prior to initiating ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and doses should be adjusted if needed. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset (BII*) and administered orally twice daily for 5 days. Patients should be advised that a small proportion experience rebound 2 to 8 days after taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and the potential for viral rebound should not dissuade providers from offering it to patients at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 who could potentially benefit (AIII). Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir has potential for drug–drug interactions due to being both a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor and a CYP3A substrate; providers should consult the FDA Paxlovid Emergency Use Authorization Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, the Infectious Diseases Society of America resource, and/or the University of Liverpool COVID-19 Drug–Drug Interaction website for guidance. Other potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), altered taste, and increased blood pressure.

Antiviral Therapy

Lopinavir, a protease inhibitor, is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and was therefore combined with ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, to enhance its efficacy. Lopinavir/ritonavir has strong drug interactions with AADs (Figure 2). Lopinavir is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the gastrointestinal tract, with minimal renal excretion but significant nephrotoxicity (Table). Ritonavir is also a strong P‐glycoprotein inhibitor and may potentially interact with anticoagulants 24 (Figure 4).

Nucleotide analogs that inhibit RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, such as remdesivir (adenosine analog), ribavirin (guanosine analog), and favipiravir (purine analog), are being studied in COVID‐19 patients. Remdesivir is mainly metabolized by hydrolase and partially metabolized by CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Remdesivir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro, but no clinically significant drug interaction is documented, likely because of its rapid clearance 25 (Table). Ribavirin is metabolized by non–organ‐specific phosphorylation and renally excreted without CYP metabolism. 4, 26 Ribavirin does not have documented interaction with AAD but elevates international normalized ratio when used with warfarin by unclear mechanisms. 4, 27 Favipiravir was approved for influenza treatment in Japan. It is metabolized by oxidase and excreted in the urine. 28 Cardiovascular adverse effects are not yet established. 4

Umifenovir inhibits membrane fusion of viral envelope targeting the S‐protein/angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 interaction. It is approved in China and Russia. It is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and excreted by gastrointestinal tract. 29 There is no documented evidence of drug interaction between AAD and umifenovir. However, given its CYP3A4 substrate, plasma concentration of umifenovir may be increased with amiodarone, diltiazem, and verapamil (Table).

Interferon is a cytokine that has antiviral activity by interfering with viral replication and promoting activation of the adaptive immune system. Interferons undergo proteolytic degradation by lysosomal enzymes and are excreted in urine. 30 The cardiovascular adverse effects include nonspecific arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and hypotension. Their interaction with AADs is unknown. 4

### Safety and effectiveness concerns of lopinavir / ritonavir in COVID-19 affected patients: a retrospective series [^116UuXiD]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Originally developed for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the antiviral combination lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is being repurposed for treating the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) despite minimal experience in this markedly different population and an in-vitro derived EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 several hundred-fold greater than for HIV. We present a case series including a case of severe hyponatremia and a 32-fold overdose raising safety and effectiveness concerns in COVID-19 patients.

Methods

We measured LPV trough concentrations in 12 patients and reviewed their clinical charts for side effects known to occur in HIV patients.

Findings

Compared to established LPV trough concentrations in HIV patients, concentrations in COVID-19 patients were 3-fold greater (19.37 ± 10.12mcg/mL versus 6.25mcg/mL). In addition, cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds were exceeded in 12/12 and 11/12 patients respectively. No patients achieved the presumed therapeutic concentration. Side effects included gastrointestinal symptoms (5/12), electrolyte imbalances (4/12), liver enzyme disturbances (5/12) and triglyceride elevations (2/12).

Conclusion

No patients reached presumed therapeutic LPV concentrations despite experiencing side effects and exceeding cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds. This raises concerns for the safety and effectiveness of LPV/r. Clinicians should consider closely monitoring for side effects and not necessarily attribute them to COVID-19.

### A trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 [^1122gq2z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (SaO₂) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.

Results

A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.

Conclusions

In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus placebo-ritonavir in individuals with long COVID in the USA (PAX LC): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2, decentralised trial [^117AacgS]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

The substantial burden of post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID) underscores the need for effective pharmacological interventions. Given that viral persistence has been hypothesised as a potential cause of long COVID, antiviral therapy might offer a promising approach to alleviating long COVID symptoms. We therefore investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for treating long COVID.

Methods

In this phase 2, decentralised, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, adults (aged ≥ 18 years) from the 48 states across the contiguous USA, with previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and long COVID symptoms starting within 4 weeks of initial infection and persisting for at least 12 weeks, were eligible for inclusion. Key exclusion criteria were use of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within the previous 2 months, CYP3A4-dependent medications, or strong CYP3A4 inducers; acute medical illness such as SARS-CoV-2 infection within the past 2 weeks; active liver disease; renal impairment; and immunocompromise. Using software for 1:1 stratified block random assignment, participants were randomly allocated to receive either two tablets of nirmatrelvir (150 mg each) and one tablet of ritonavir (100 mg), or placebo and one tablet of ritonavir (100 mg), orally administered twice daily for 15 days, stratified by age, sex at birth, and COVID-19 vaccination status. Participants, clinicians, and the study team were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Physical Health Summary Score (PHSS) from baseline to day 28, analysed by intention to treat. Safety endpoints were reported from baseline to week 6 in all participants who were exposed to the study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05668091) and is now closed to new participants.

Findings

Between April 14, 2023, and Feb 26, 2024, 119 participants were screened. 100 were enrolled (66 [66%] female participants and 34 [34%] male participants), with 49 assigned to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 51 to the placebo-ritonavir group (intention-to-treat population). Three participants in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and two in the placebo-ritonavir group withdrew before starting treatment and were excluded from the safety population. The mean PROMIS-29 PHSS at baseline was 39.6 (95% CI 37.4 to 41.9) in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 36.3 (34.4 to 38.2) in the placebo-ritonavir group. The adjusted change from baseline to day 28 was 0.45 (-0.93 to 1.83) in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 1.01 (-0.30 to 2.31) in the placebo-ritonavir group (adjusted mean difference -0.55 [95% CI -2.32 to 1.21; p = 0.54]). No deaths or serious adverse events were recorded between baseline and week 6. Study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in more participants in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group (35 [76%] of 46) compared with the placebo-ritonavir group (27 [55%] of 49), mostly driven by dysgeusia. Early treatment termination due to an adverse event occurred in two participants in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and one in the placebo-ritonavir group.

Interpretation

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir administered for 15 days did not significantly improve health outcomes in participants with long COVID compared with placebo-ritonavir at day 28. However, the study showed the feasibility of large-scale, decentralised trials in long COVID.

### Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors versus ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus raltegravir for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults with virological failure of a standard first-line ART regimen (SECOND-LINE): a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority study [^113hn1fz]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists about the best treatment for people with HIV-1 who have virological failure with first-line combination antiretroviral therapy of a non-nucleoside analogue (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside or nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTI). We compared a second-line regimen combining two new classes of drug with a WHO-recommended regimen.

Methods

We did this 96-week, phase 3b/4, randomised, open-label non-inferiority trial at 37 sites worldwide. Adults with HIV-1 who had confirmed virological failure (plasma viral load > 500 copies per mL) after 24 weeks or more of first-line treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus two or three NtRTIs (control group) or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir plus raltegravir (raltegravir group). The randomisation sequence was computer generated with block randomisation (block size four). Neither participants nor investigators were masked to allocation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma viral load less than 200 copies per mL at 48 weeks in the modified intention-to-treat population, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00931463.

Findings

We enrolled 558 patients, of whom 541 (271 in the control group, 270 in the raltegravir group) were included in the primary analysis. At 48 weeks, 219 (81%) patients in the control group compared with 223 (83%) in the raltegravir group met the primary endpoint (difference 1.8%, 95% CI -4.7 to 8.3), fulfilling the criterion for non-inferiority. 993 adverse events occurred in 271 participants in the control group versus 895 in 270 participants in the raltegravir group, the most common being gastrointestinal.

Interpretation

The raltegravir regimen was no less efficacious than the standard of care and was safe and well tolerated. This simple NtRTI-free treatment strategy might extend the successful public health approach to management of HIV by providing simple, easy to administer, effective, safe, and tolerable second-line combination antiretroviral therapy.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling to predict the clinical efficacy of the coadministration of lopinavir and ritonavir against SARS-CoV-2 [^112vsmhj]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Lopinavir/ritonavir, originally developed for treating HIV, is currently undergoing clinical studies for treating the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although recent reports suggest that lopinavir exhibits in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, it is a highly protein-bound drug and it remains unknown if it reaches adequate in vivo unbound (free) concentrations in lung tissue. We built a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of lopinavir/ritonavir in white and Chinese populations. Our aim was to perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic correlations by comparing simulated free plasma and lung concentration values achieved using different dosing regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir with unbound half-maximal effective concentration (EC₅₀, unbound) and unbound effective concentration 90% values of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-2. The model was validated against multiple observed clinical datasets for single and repeated dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir. Predicted pharmacokinetic parameters, such as the maximum plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time profile, oral clearance, half-life, and minimum plasma concentration at steady-state were within two-fold of clinical values for both populations. Using the current lopinavir/ritonavir regimen of 400/100 mg twice daily, lopinavir does not achieve sufficient free lung concentrations for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Although the Chinese population reaches greater plasma and lung concentrations as compared with whites, our simulations suggest that a significant dose increase from the current clinically used dosing regimen is necessary to reach the EC₅₀, unbound value for both populations. Based on safety data, higher doses would likely lead to QT prolongation and gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), thus, any dose adjustment must be carefully weighed alongside these safety concerns.

### Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 virus: a narrative review and bibliometric analysis [^116yAP24]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 epidemic has become a major international health emergency. Millions of people have died as a result of this phenomenon since it began. Has there been any successful pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 since the initial report on the virus? How many searches are undertaken to address the impact of the infection? What is the number of drugs that have undergone investigation? What are the mechanisms of action and adverse effects associated with the investigated pharmaceuticals used to treat COVID-19? Has the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved any medication to treat COVID-19? To date, our understanding is based on a restricted corpus of published investigations into the treatment of COVID-19. It is important to note that no single study comprehensively encompasses all pharmacological interventions for COVID-19. This paper provides an introductory summary of a bibliometric analysis conducted on the data about COVID-19, sourced explicitly from two platforms, namely PubMed and ScienceDirect. The analysis encompasses the period spanning from 2019 to 2022. Furthermore, this study examines the published literature about the pharmacological interventions for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), explicitly focusing on the safety and effectiveness of different medications such as Remdesivir (marketed as Veklury®), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (commercially known as Kaletra® or Aluvia®), Ribavirin, Favipiravir (marketed as Avigan®), Ivermectin, Casirivimab and Imdevimab (branded as Ronapreve®), Sotrovimab (marketed as Xevudy®), Anakinra, Molnupiravir, Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (marketed as Paxlovid®), and Galidesivir. Findings indicate that while Remdesivir and Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir show significant efficacy in reducing hospitalization and severe outcomes, drugs like Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Ivermectin have inconsistent results. Our insights suggest a multifaceted approach incorporating these therapies can significantly improve patient outcomes. Repurposing drugs has been critical in rapidly responding to COVID-19, allowing existing medications to be used in new ways to combat the virus. Combination therapies and further research are essential to optimize treatment strategies.

### Early administration of lopinavir / ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine does not alter the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a retrospective cohort study [^1122ttwB]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

As it has been shown that lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have in vitro activity against coronaviruses, they were used to treat COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Lombardy, Italy. To compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ within 5 days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). This was a retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started LPV/r+HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020. The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic models. The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Gray's test P = 0.213). After adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables, there was no significant association between the timing of the start of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ET vs DT = 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.50–4.19). Eight percent of the patients discontinued the treatment becausebecause of severe gastrointestinal disorders attributable to LPV/r. The timing of the start of LPV/r+HCQ treatment does not seem to affect the clinical course of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Together with the severe adverse events attributable to LPV/r, this raises concerns about the benefit of using this combination to treat COVID-19.

Complications and treatment

As shown in table 3, 5 (6.76%), 13 (17.57%) and 1 (1.35%) patient with COVID-19 with GI symptoms had complications of ARDS, liver injury and shock, respectively, where the former two were significantly higher than their counterparts of 2.08% and 8.84% in patients with COVID-19 without GI symptoms, respectively (p = 0.034; p = 0.035). All 74 patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms were treated in isolation with supportive and empiric medication, while 66 (89.19%) patients received antiviral treatment, including interferon-α sprays, arbidol hydrochloride capsules (two tablets three times daily), lopinavir and ritonavir two tablets (500 mg) twice daily, via the oral route. Furthermore, the average time from illness onset to antiviral therapy was 5.56 ± 4.09 days. Compared with Wuhan data, we had lower rates of glucocorticoid and antibiotic use, 14.86% and 41.89%, respectively. No patients received continuous blood purification due to renal failure, and no patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Until now, only one patient has died. Five (6.76%) patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms were treated with mechanical ventilation and transferred to the ICU, which was a significantly higher rate than that of 2.08% in the patients with COVID-19 without GI symptoms (p = 0.034).

Diarrhoea

In our meta-analysis, five studies met the inclusion criteria to measure the incidence of diarrhoea in patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19 infection. In our analysis of 1517 patients, we found that patients were more likely to have diarrhoea in the severe COVID-19 group when compared with its non-severe disease counterpart. This result was however not statistically significant, suggesting the need for more studies on the same to establish a true association.

Diarrhoea appeared to be the most common GI complaint in our review on patients with COVID-19, with its incidence ranging from 3% to 34%. One hundred and ninety-four out of 2477 patients (7.8%) reported diarrhoea from all 19 studies combined. Pan et al and Xiao et al recorded it to be present in 34% and 35% out of the study samples of 105 and 73 patients, respectively. These studies may suggest that COVID-19 can masquerade as viral gastroenteritis leading to possible delayed and missed diagnosis.

In their case series of five patients who travelled from Wuhan, Chan et al found two patients to have had diarrhoea with fever as the sole presentation, prior to the onset of respiratory complaints. Diarrhoea can thus serve as an early manifestation of certain COVID-19 infections which may be implemented as a sign of early quarantine.

It is also imperative that secondary causes of diarrhoea be ruled out, such as medications in patients with COVID-19 like hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, which may serve as confounders. Hu et al found two out of their 24 'asymptomatic' patients developing diarrhoea in the setting of being recently started on lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat.

M06–802 was a randomized open-label study comparing the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of once daily and twice daily dosing of lopinavir and ritonavir tablets in 599 subjects with detectable viral loads while receiving their current antiviral therapy. Of the enrolled subjects, 55% on both treatment arms had not been previously treated with a protease inhibitor and 81 to 88% had received prior NNRTIs as part of their anti-HIV treatment regimen. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir and ritonavir 800/200 mg once daily (n = 300) or lopinavir and ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (n = 299). Patients were administered at least two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors selected by the investigator. Mean age of patients enrolled was 41 years (range: 21 to 73); 51% were Caucasian, and 66% were male. Mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 254 cells/mm3(range: 4 to 952 cells/mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log10copies/mL (range: 1.7 to 6.6 log10copies/mL).

Treatment response and outcomes of randomized treatment through Week 48 are presented in Table 25.

Through 48 weeks of treatment, the mean change from baseline for CD4+ cell count was 135 cells/mm3for the once daily group and 122 cells/mm3for the twice daily group.

Management of GI symptoms and abnormal liver function tests in patients with COVID-19

At present, there is no specific drug for COVID19, and there is little literature on the treatment of GI symptoms. Certain drugs used in the early phase to treat COVID-19, including Lopinavir-Ritonavir, were associated with liver dysfunction. A recent randomised trial of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in hospitalised adults with severe COVID-19 showed benefit beyond standard care.COVID-19 patients with diarrhoea were mostly treated with montmorillonite powder or probiotics. Berberine and some other traditional Chinese medicine have been suggested in China for diagnosis and treatment of general COVID-19, but this might need further clinical trials. Broad spectrum antibiotics are best avoided for the treatment of COVID-19, as these might cause antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. In the study of 1099 patients with COVID-19, 57.5% received intravenous antibiotics, which was significantly lower than during SARS, whereas only 3.7% of these patients had diarrhoea. – Generally, the diarrhoea improved rapidly. Most of the patients who had severe and stubborn diarrhoea had received anti-virals such as oseltamivir and abidol. Intestinal microbiota play an important role in maintaining human health. The metabolites of intestinal flora can also be useful for the treatment of virus by the interferon pathway. Therefore, it is recommended to use probiotics to maintain the intestinal micro-ecological balance and prevent bacterial secondary infection in the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan, though further evidence is necessary.

Chao et al. reported that liver injury in mild cases of COVID-19 was often transient and can recover without any special treatment. When it comes to severe liver injury, liver protective drugs were usually given to such patients, but unfortunately the specific medications for liver protection were not described in that study.

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: a literature review [^116Fcc7p]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

For the treatment of COVID-19, the NIH recommends against the use of lopinavir/ritonavir and other HIV protease inhibitors in hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients according to the guideline update from February 2021. The ERS supports this viewpoint and does not recommend lopinavir/ritonavir for hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a pharmacokinetic investigation in which eight COVID-19 patients received lopinavir/ritonavir in a dosage of 400 mg/100 mg orally two times per day for 3 to 10 days, concluded that, although plasma concentration of the drug in these patients were higher in comparison to HIV patients, the drug combination in this dosage could not reach plasma concentrations enough to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Also, in a recent scientific article, published in June 2020, researchers state that lopinavir and ritonavir had no effect on the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2's main protease, or 3CLpro. Therefore, lopinavir/ritonavir is not a good candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.

Remdesivir

Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue that has action against a broad spectrum of viruses. It is specifically known from clinical trials for the treatment of Ebola. By competing with adenosine triphosphate, remdesivir inhibits RdRp and halts viral replication. This pharmacological agent has proven to have efficacy in vitro and in animal studies with nonhuman primates against MERS-CoV. Remdesivir has also shown to have activity against other previous coronaviruses, including human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, and zoonotic "pre-pandemic" coronaviruses, including bat CoVs. In vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 at post-entry stages in Vero E6 cells has been stated. Furthermore, antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2-infected human nasal and bronchial airway epithelial cells has been proven. These findings make remdesivir a promising agent in the fight against COVID-19.

### Triple combination of interferon β-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19: an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial [^111jRvHb]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We assessed the efficacy and safety of combined interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19.

Methods

This was a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group). The primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR, and was done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688.

Findings

Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 127 patients were recruited; 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 were assigned to the control group. The median number of days from symptom onset to start of study treatment was 5 days (IQR 3–7). The combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days [IQR 5–11]) than the control group (12 days [8–15]; hazard ratio 4.37 [95% CI 1.86–10.24], p = 0.0010). Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups. One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir-ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis. No patients died during the study.

Interpretation

Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted.

### Leritrelvir for the treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 without co-administered ritonavir: a multicentre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^113Mzudd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Leritrelvir is a novel α-ketoamide based peptidomimetic inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. A preclinical study has demonstrated leritrelvir poses similar antiviral activities towards different SARS-CoV-2 variants compared with nirmatrelvir. A phase 2 clinical trial has shown a comparable antiviral efficacy and safety between leritrelvir with and without ritonavir co-administration. This trial aims to test efficacy and safety of leritrelvir monotherapy in adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Methods

This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 trial at 29 clinical sites in China. Enrolled patients were from 18 to 75 years old, diagnosed with mild or moderate COVID-19 and not requiring hospitalization. Patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (NAT) and at least one of the COVID-19 symptoms within 48 h before randomization, and the interval between the first positive SARS-CoV-2 NAT and randomization was ≤ 120 h (5 days). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 5-day course of either oral leritrelvir 400 mg TID or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from the first dose to sustained clinical recovery of all 11 symptoms (stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath or dyspnea, cough, muscle or body aches, headache, chills, fever ≥ 37 °C, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). The safety endpoint was the incidence of adverse events (AE). Primary and safety analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05620160.

Findings

Between Nov 12 and Dec 30, 2022 when the zero COVID policy was abolished nationwide, a total of 1359 patients underwent randomization, 680 were assigned to leritrelvir group and 679 to placebo group. The median time to sustained clinical recovery in leritrelvir group was significantly shorter (251.02 h [IQR 188.95–428.68 h]) than that of Placebo (271.33 h [IQR 219.00–529.63 h], P = 0.0022, hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.35). Further analysis of subgroups for the median time to sustained clinical recovery revealed that (1) subgroup with positive viral nucleic acid tested ≤ 72 h had a 33.9 h difference in leritrelvir group than that of placebo; (2) the subgroup with baseline viral load > 8 log 10 Copies/mL in leritrelvir group had 51.3 h difference than that of placebo. Leritrelvir reduced viral load by 0.82 log10 on day 4 compared to placebo. No participants in either group progressed to severe COVID-19 by day 29. Adverse events were reported in two groups: leritrelvir 315 (46.46%) compared with placebo 292 (43.52%). Treatment-relevant AEs were similar 218 (32.15%) in the leritrelvir group and 186 (27.72%) in placebo. Two cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were reported in placebo group, and one case in leritrelvir group, none of them were considered by the investigators to be leritrelvir related. The most frequently reported AEs (occurring in ≥ 5% of participants in at least one group) were laboratory finding: hypertriglyceridemia (leritrelvir 79 [11.7%] vs. placebo 70 [10.4%]) and hyperlipidemia (60 [8.8%] vs. 52 [7.7%]); all of them were nonserious.

Interpretation

Leritrelvir monotherapy has good efficacy for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and without serious safety concerns.

We performed study selection in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Lefebvre 2022). Three review authors (SR, RK, and SW) independently screened titles and abstracts of identified records. We retrieved full‐text articles and independently assessed eligibility of the remaining records against the predefined eligibility criteria. We resolved discrepancies through discussion between the review authors. We included studies irrespective of whether measured outcome data were reported in a 'usable' way. We collated multiple reports of the same study, so that the study, rather than the report, was the unit of interest in the review.

Harms — nirmatrelvir/ritonavir emphasize safety signals and interactions: Limited evidence from hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir suggest increased serious adverse events and adverse events (RR 1.20; 95% CI: 0.38, 3.84; low CoE and RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.65, 3.04; low CoE). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were not reported in the FDA EUA. Given co-formulation with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic booster, there is potential for significant drug interactions. Contraindications exist between agents that can have their levels increased or decreased by nirmatrelvir and/or ritonavir and agents that can increase the metabolism of the components of nirmatrelvir and/or ritonavir, resulting in a loss of virologic response and possible resistance. These drug interactions can result in treatment failure or serious adverse events.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily darunavir / ritonavir versus lopinavir / ritonavir in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected patients at week 48 [^114rFq93]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The present primary analysis of AntiRetroviral Therapy with TMC114 ExaMined In naive Subjects (ARTEMIS) compares the efficacy and safety of once-daily darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) with that of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in treatment-naive patients.

Methods

Patients with HIV-1 RNA at least 5000 copies/ml were stratified by HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count in a phase III, open-label trial, and randomized to receive DRV/r 800/100 mg qd or LPV/r 800/200 mg total daily dose (bid or qd) plus fixed-dose tenofovir and emtricitabine for 192 weeks. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of DRV/r as compared with LPV/r in HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml per-protocol time-to-loss of virologic response at 48 weeks.

Results

Six hundred and eighty-nine patients were randomized and treated; mean baseline HIV-1 RNA: 4.85 log10 copies/ml and median CD4 count: 225 cells/microl. At 48 weeks, 84% of DRV/r and 78% of LPV/r patients achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml (estimated difference = 5.6 [95% confidence interval -0.1–11]%), demonstrating non-inferiority of DRV/r as compared with LPV/r (P < 0.001; per-protocol time-to-loss of virologic response). Patients with HIV-1 RNA at least 100 000 copies/ml had a significantly higher response rate with DRV/r (79%) versus LPV/r (67%; P < 0.05). Median CD4 cell count increases (non-completer = failure; cells/mul) were 137 for DRV/r and 141 for LPV/r. DRV/r had a lower incidence of possibly treatment-related grade 2–4 gastrointestinal-related adverse events (7 versus 14%) and treatment-related moderate-to-severe diarrhea (4 versus 10%) than LPV/r. Adverse events leading to discontinuation were DRV/r: 3% and LPV/r: 7%.

Conclusion

DRV/r 800/100 mg qd was non-inferior to LPV/r 800/200 mg at 48 weeks, with a more favorable safety profile. Significantly higher response rates were observed with DRV/r in patients with HIV-1 RNA at least 100 000 copies/ml. DRV/r 800/100 mg offers a new effective and well tolerated once-daily, first-line treatment option for treatment-naive patients.

COVID-19 and MERS lopinavir/ritonavir — earlier reports note that during the MERS outbreak, case reports cited efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon in the management of MERS patients, and during the early phase of COVID-19, a triple combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin shortened the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in an open-label, randomized, phase II trial.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed from inception up to July 23, 2020, for clinical trials published in English evaluating the effect of lopinavir–ritonavir among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 using the search terms ("COVID-19"[All Fields] OR "2019-nCoV"[All Fields]) OR "SARS-CoV-2"[All Fields]) AND ("lopinavir"[All Fields] OR "ritonavir"[All Fields]) (filters: Clinical Trial, Randomized Controlled Trial). We identified only one randomised clinical trial that compared lopinavir–ritonavir with usual care in patients with COVID-19. This trial assigned 99 patients who had been admitted to hospital with COVID-19 to a lopinavir–ritonavir group (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) and 100 patients to a standard-care group, and found no difference in viral clearance, time to clinical improvement, or 28-day mortality between the two groups. However, the trial was underpowered to exclude clinically relevant treatment effects.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, the randomised evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is the first large-scale randomised clinical trial to report the effects of lopinavir–ritonavir in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. We found no significant difference between the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the usual care group in terms of 28-day mortality, the probability of discharge alive within 28 days, or, among patients who were not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, the probability of progressing to the composite outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. We saw no evidence of benefit of lopinavir–ritonavir in any patient subgroup.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our finding of no clinical benefit from lopinavir–ritonavir treatment compared with standard care supports earlier findings from a smaller clinical trial. Many clinical care guidelines have recommended lopinavir–ritonavir for treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. These guidelines should be updated.

Objectives

We evaluated the clinical, virological and safety outcomes of lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-interferon (IFN)-β-1a, hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir in comparison to standard of care (control) in coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) inpatients requiring oxygen and/or ventilatory support.

Methods

We conducted a phase III multicentre, open-label, randomized 1:1:1:1:1, adaptive, controlled trial (DisCoVeRy), an add-on to the Solidarity trial (NCT04315948, EudraCT2020–000936–23). The primary outcome was the clinical status at day 15, measured by the WHO seven-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included quantification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory specimens and pharmacokinetic and safety analyses. We report the results for the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms and for the hydroxychloroquine arm, trials of which were stopped prematurely.

Results

The intention-to-treat population included 583 participants-lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 145), lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-β-1a (n = 145), hydroxychloroquine (n = 145), control (n = 148)-among whom 418 (71.7%) were male, the median age was 63 years (IQR 54–71), and 211 (36.2%) had a severe disease. The day-15 clinical status was not improved with the investigational treatments: lopinavir/ritonavir versus control, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.83, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55–1.26, p 0.39), lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-β-1a versus control, aOR 0.69 (95%CI 0.45–1.04, p 0.08), and hydroxychloroquine versus control, aOR 0.93 (95%CI 0.62–1.41, p 0.75). No significant effect of investigational treatment was observed on SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir were higher than those expected, while those of hydroxychloroquine were those expected with the dosing regimen. The occurrence of serious adverse events was significantly higher in participants allocated to the lopinavir/ritonavir-containing arms.

Conclusion

In adults hospitalized for COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir-IFN-β-1a and hydroxychloroquine improved neither the clinical status at day 15 nor SARS-CoV-2 clearance in respiratory tract specimens.

Study Overview PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine if treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir will decrease progression of symptoms compared to control/placebo. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if treatment improves time to symptom resolution. II. Determine the time to symptom progression. III. Determine time to improvement of participants as defined by complete resolution of symptoms. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. GROUP I: Patients receive lopinavir/ritonavir orally twice daily for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 3 times a week until symptoms resolve plus 2 additional weeks thereafter, for up to 3 months, whichever occurs first.

### A review of low-dose ritonavir in protease inhibitor combination therapy [^114fNDbC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors center around the microsomal enzyme cytochrome P-450 3A4. As a potent inhibitor of this enzyme, ritonavir can increase the bioavailability and half-life of coadministered protease inhibitors. Evidence suggests that increased exposure to protease inhibitors is clinically relevant. Antiretroviral treatment with low-dose ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, indinavir, and saquinavir has durable virological activity and shows impressive immune reconstitution. Although tolerable in most cases, gastrointestinal side effects, hepatotoxicity, and blood lipid abnormalities remain relevant issues. Additional study will elucidate the advantages and disadvantages of twice-daily, low-dose ritonavir-boosted regimens and determine whether once-daily regimens based on this principle will have a lasting role in clinical practice.

### Effect of early treatment with hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir and ritonavir on risk of hospitalization among patients with COVID-19: the TOGETHER randomized clinical trial [^1176Ld4u]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

We chose to evaluate hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir because of the early and widescale interest in their treatment effects and their off-label use early on in the pandemic. Much has been written about the roles of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 and the scientific debate and political support that hydroxychloroquine, in particular, received. During the conduct of our trial, data emerged on the role of both hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir among hospitalized patients via the RECOVERY trial. For both drugs, it became clear that they did not play a role in patients with advanced disease who were hospitalized. Similarly, there has been no demonstrated efficacy shown for hydroxychloroquine in outpatient populations. There had been, however, equipoise as to whether these drugs would play a role in prophylaxis and early treatment of COVID-19 infection. Our study, among the largest trial of these drugs in early treatment, suggests that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir do not have a role in early treatment of COVID-19.

Moreover, the duration of the surgical procedure and general anaesthesia can increase the risk of postoperative infections.

Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not available.

In this lack, in the early phase of the pandemic, many centres decided to use empirical antiviral therapy with darunavir or lopinavir in combination with ritonavir and oseltamivir and hydroxychloroquine on the basis of early promising results in terms of survival in critical COVID-19 patients reported in several studies.

In an open-label clinical study that showed some limitations in the methodology, Gautret et al. reported a significant decrease in viral load among patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with hydroxychloroquine when compared with control patients. In addition, they describe a synergistic effect in a subset of patients who received hydroxychloroquine with adjunctive azithromycin.

Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a large volume of distribution; it is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary bacterial infections. In addition it has shown to be active in vitro against Zika and Ebola viruses and to prevent severe respiratory tract co-infections when administered to patients suffering viral infection. It demonstrated also to have an anti-inflammatory activity that could mitigate the "cytokine storm" and organ damage in COVID-19 patients. In the early phase of this pandemic, lopinavir/ritonavir were administered in severe coronavirus disease cases, in association with other medical treatment. Cao et al. conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving 199 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrated that treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir is not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement. Instead, adverse effects observed include gastrointestinal distress such as nausea, diarrhoea and hepatotoxicity. Moreover, particular attention needs to be focused on pharmacokinetics interactions involving inhibition of CYP3A4 and some transporters, inducted by antiviral treatments.

### Long-term safety and durable antiretroviral activity of lopinavir / ritonavir in treatment-naive patients: 4 year follow-up study [^115yRTVh]. AIDS (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Combination antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) has been highly effective in clinical trials. Results of long-term therapy with LPV/r-based regimens have not been previously reported. This study describes the 4-year (204-week) safety and antiretroviral activity of LPV/r-based treatment in antiretroviral-naive individuals.

Design

Long-term, open-label follow-up of a phase II, prospective, randomized, multicenter trial.

Methods

A group of 100 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients were randomized to one of three blinded doses of LPV/r [200/100 mg (n = 16), 400/100 mg (n = 51), or 400/200 mg (n = 33)] with stavudine 40 mg and lamivudine 150 mg every 12 hours. After 48 weeks, LPV/r was dosed open-label at 400/100 mg every 12 hours with stavudine and lamivudine.

Results

Mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count were 4.9 log10 copies/ml and 338 x 10 cells/l, respectively. At week 204, 72 patients remained on study, 70 of whom had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml (70% by intent-to-treat analysis). Twenty-eight patients discontinued therapy prior to week 204 because of adverse events (n = 10), lost to follow-up (n = 9), or other reasons (n = 9). Of 15 patients who met protocol-defined criteria for virologic failure, seven remained on the study regimen and their HIV-1 RNA was re-suppressed to < 50 copies/ml at week 204. Genotypic analysis of rebound viral isolates was available from 10 patients, including all eight patients who discontinued the study prematurely. No isolate demonstrated primary or active site mutations in protease. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms and lipid elevations.

Conclusions

LPV/r-based therapy provides durable antiretroviral response and is generally well tolerated through 204 weeks of therapy.

Liver abnormalities of COVID-19 patients may be due to liver cell dysfunction like the preexisting viral hepatitis described above or other causes such as drug toxicity and systemic inflammation. The receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been found to be highly expressed both in GI epithelial cells and liver, suggesting a direct damage potential of SARS-CoV-2 on livers. Almost the entire GI tract, including stomach, duodenum, small intestine and rectal epithelial cells were found to have viral nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 protein expression. Especially in the proximal and distal enterocytes, ACE2 receptors are remarkably highly expressed. However, currently, there is no data describing the impact of preexisting viral hepatitis on COVID-19. Also, the mutual effect between COVID-19 and viral hepatitis deserves more attention and further investigation. On the other hand, a variety of drugs have been used in the treatment of COVID-19, including antipyretic and analgesic drugs to relieve fever symptoms, antiviral drugs such as abidol, oseltamivir, readcivir and lopinavir, as well as glucocorticoids, antibiotics, proprietary Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. All of these might increase the risk of drug-induced liver injury. – Additionally, a report from Singapore found that three out of five patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed abnormal liver function. Moreover, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by pneumonia may also aggravate liver injury. According to the results of pathological anatomy of the first case of COVID-19, the liver tissue of patients with COVID-19 showed mild active inflammatory lesions in the hepatic lobular portal area, which may lead to liver injury.

Antiviral therapy

▪ Remdesivir (clinical trial)

Despite several randomized trials being underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different antiviral agents, data supporting the use of any anti-viral agents in COVID-19 have been mostly extrapolated from case series or in vitro experiments. The multidisciplinary team of the COVID-19 HDU discussed the pro and cons and the evidence of introducing an antiviral drug in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure, and initially decided to consider the use of hydroxychloroquine for all patients in absence of contraindications. In vitro, hydroxychloroquine hampers low pH-dependant steps of viral replication resulting in antiviral activity. Retrospective and open-label non-randomized clinical trial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 showed that hydroxychloroquine was associated with decreased mortality and viral load reduction. Before starting hydroxychloroquine treatment, an electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed given the risk of QT prolongation and interactions with other drugs was checked. EKG was usually repeated every 48 h to assess the risk of QTc prolongation. Indeed, studies have highlighted the potential for toxicity of hydroxychloroquine, particularly QTc prolongation and risk of arrhythmias. However, accumulating data from trials and observational studies suggested that hydroxychloroquine do not provide a clinical benefit regards of mortality or leght of hospital stay for patients with COVID-19. According to this data the multidisciplinary team decided to not routinely use hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients. After multidisciplinary discussion, the COVID-19 team decided again the use of lopinavir/ritonavir according to evidence showing no benefit of this treatment beyond standard of care. Furthermore, lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with gastrointestinal adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment in 14% of the patients within a clinical trial. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral with potent in vitro activity against a range of RNA viruses, has shown in vivo activity against related coronavirus MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 animal models. Furthermore, preliminary data from randomized trials suggest clinical benefit of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In the COVID-19 HDU, remdesivir is used within a clinical trial programme.

The COALITION II Trial was a randomized comparison of azithromycin in addition to standard care versus standard care alone among 447 hospitalized patients in Brazil with suspected COVID-19. Standard care included hydroxychloroquine in both arms, and patients required at least 4 L/minute of oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation. In the modified intention to treat population of 397 patients with confirmed COVID-19, there was no difference in the primary outcome of clinical status at day 15, as assessed by a blinded independent adjudication committee on a six-point ordinal scale. There was also no increase in the incidence of QT prolongation in azithromycin arm when compared with the control arm.

There are also multiple trials studying the role of hydroxychloroquine in the prophylaxis of COVID-19. – Two randomized controlled trials did not show any benefit to pre- or postexposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine. Thus, we do not recommend hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin for this purpose at this time.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

We recommend against the use of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, regardless of availability or cost for LMICs.

Recommendation for LMICs.

We recommend against using hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin in treating COVID-19 (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence).

3. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, should lopinavir–ritonavir be given?

Rationale.

Numerous antimicrobial drugs are being evaluated for management of COVID-19 patients, including lopinavir–ritonavir.

Recommendations from other guidelines.

WHO COVID-19 Guidelines: We recommend that antivirals including lopinavir/ritonavir not be administered as treatment or prophylaxis for COVID-19, outside of the context of clinical trials.

NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines: The COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends against using lopinavir/ritonavir (AI) or other HIV protease inhibitors (AIII) for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial.

Surviving Sepsis COVID Guidelines: In critically ill adults with COVID-19, we suggest against the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir (weak suggestion).

### Once-daily atazanavir / ritonavir versus twice-daily lopinavir / ritonavir, each in combination with tenofovir and emtricitabine, for management of antiretroviral-naive HIV-1-infected patients: 48 week efficacy and safety results of the CASTLE study [^111HAS9o]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Atazanavir/ritonavir is as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir, with a more favourable lipid profile and less gastrointestinal toxicity, in treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients. We compared these two combinations directly in treatment-naive patients.

Methods

In this open-label, international non-inferiority study, 883 antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected patients were randomly assigned to receive atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily (n = 440) or lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (n = 443), in combination with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine 300/200 mg once daily. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated centralised randomisation schedule and was stratified by baseline levels of HIV RNA (viral load) and geographic region. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with viral load less than 50 copies per mL at week 48. The main efficacy analysis was done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00272779.

Findings

At week 48, 343 (78%) of 440 patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir and 338 (76%) of 443 patients receiving lopinavir/ritonavir had achieved a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL (difference 1.7%, 95% CI -3.8 to 7.1). Mean increases from baseline in CD4 cell count were similar (203 cells per muL in the atazanavir/ritonavir group vs 219 cells per muL in the lopinavir/ritonavir group). 25 (6%) patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir group and 26 (6%) in the lopinavir/ritonavir group were virological failures by week 48. Only two patients, both in the atazanavir/ritonavir group, had non-polymorphic protease inhibitor resistance mutations emerge on treatment, which conferred phenotypic resistance to atazanavir in one patient. Serious adverse events were noted in 51 (12%) of 441 patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir group and in 42 (10%) of 437 patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group. Fewer patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir group than in the lopinavir/ritonavir group experienced grade 2–4 treatment-related diarrhoea (10 [2%] vs 50 [11%]) and nausea (17 [4%] vs 33 [8%]). Grade 2–4 jaundice was seen in 16 (4%) of 441 patients in the atazanavir/ritonavir group versus none of 437 patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group; grade 3–4 increases in total bilirubin were seen in 146 (34%) of 435 patients on atazanavir/ritonavir and in one (< 1%) of 431 patients on lopinavir/ritonavir.

Interpretation

In treatment-naive patients, atazanavir/ritonavir once-daily demonstrated similar antiviral efficacy to lopinavir/ritonavir twice-daily, with less gastrointestinal toxicity but with a higher rate of hyperbilirubinaemia.

Question

Does hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir, administered as a 9-day course, prevent COVID-19–associated hospitalization in patients with COVID-19?

Findings

In this trial that included 685 patients, rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir were not significantly different compared with those who received placebo.

Meaning

These findings may inform COVID-19 treatment guidelines for outpatients with COVID-19 and demonstrate that large-scale outpatient clinical trials of repurposed drugs can be successfully completed in low-income settings during the pandemic.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — lopinavir/ritonavir background and pharmacology: Lopinavir/ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that was U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of HIV in September 2000, and ritonavir is added as a pharmacokinetic enhancer due to its strong inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4, a metabolic pathway for lopinavir metabolism. Lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV replication.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — harms with lopinavir/ritonavir in prophylaxis and ambulatory treatment: Prophylactic treatment of persons exposed to SARS-CoV-2 with lopinavir/ritonavir compared to placebo increases the risk of adverse events (RR: 2.74; 95% CI: 2.05, 3.66; moderate CoE), and treatment of COVID-19 in ambulatory persons rather than placebo may increase the risk of serious adverse events (RR: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.79, 3.16; moderate CoE). In RECOVERY, 1/1588 serious adverse event was reported due to treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, and nearly 14% of recipients in Cao 2020 were unable to complete the full 14-day course due primarily to gastrointestinal adverse events including anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea; two serious adverse events were both acute gastritis, and two recipients had self-limited skin eruptions. The most common adverse events were nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, lack of appetite, itching and bloating. Such side effects, including the risks of hepatic injury, pancreatitis, more severe cutaneous eruptions, and QT prolongation, and the potential for multiple drug interactions due to CYP3A inhibition, are well documented with this drug combination, and the observed side effect profile raises concerns about the use of higher or more prolonged lopinavir/ritonavir dose regimens in efforts to improve outcomes.

### Post-exposure lopinavir-ritonavir prophylaxis versus surveillance for individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2: the COPEP pragmatic open-label, cluster randomized trial [^111ZmpMb]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, no direct antiviral treatment is effective as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) was repurposed as a potential PEP agent against COVID-19.

Methods

We conducted a pragmatic open-label, parallel, cluster-randomised superiority trial in four sites in Switzerland and Brazil between March 2020 to March 2021. Clusters were randomised to receive LPV/r PEP (400/100 mg) twice daily for 5 days or no PEP (surveillance). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as a close contact of > 15 minutes in < 2 metres distance or having shared a closed space for ≥ 2 hours with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome is the occurrence of COVID-19 defined by a SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/or a seroconversion) and ≥ 1 compatible symptom within 21 days post-enrolment. ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT04364022); Swiss National Clinical Trial Portal: SNCTP 000003732.

Findings

Of 318 participants, 157 (49.4%) were women; median age was 39 (interquartile range, 28–50) years. A total of 209 (179 clusters) participants were randomised to LPV/r PEP and 109 (95 clusters) to surveillance. Baseline characteristics were similar, with the exception of baseline SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, which was 3-fold more frequent in the LPV/r arm (34/209 [16.3%] vs 6/109 [5.5%], respectively). During 21-day follow-up, 48/318 (15.1%) participants developed COVID-19: 35/209 (16.7%) in the LPV/r group and 13/109 (11.9%) in the surveillance group (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.44; 95% CI, 0.76–2.73). In the primary endpoint analysis, which was adjuted for baseline imbalance, the hazard ratio for developing COVID-19 in the LPV/r group vs surveillance was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.29–1.26; p = 0.18).

Interpretation

The role of LPV/r as PEP for COVID-19 remains unanswered. Although LPV/r over 5 days did not significantly reduce the incidence of COVID-19 in exposed individuals, we observed a change in the directionality of the effect in favour of LPV/r after adjusting for baseline imbalance. LPV/r for this indication merits further testing against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials.

### Innovative randomized phase I study and dosing regimen selection to accelerate and inform pivotal COVID-19 trial of nirmatrelvir [^115fsGc2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The effect of food after oral administration of a nirmatrelvir suspension, when enhanced with ritonavir, was minimal. Given the intended use of co‐administration of nirmatrelvir with ritonavir, nirmatrelvir is being dosed without regard to food.

Population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations enabled selection of the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose and dosing regimen for phase II/III (300/100 mg b.i.d.), predicted to achieve efficacious concentrations continuously in ≥ 90% of dosed participants. This target, which was successfully implemented for the first time for SARS‐CoV‐2 in the current study, was selected based on the literature, where exposure in multiples of EC₉₀ for oral protease and non‐nucleoside protease inhibitors correlates with clinical potency. This was also supported by efficacy studies in preclinical species infected with SARS‐CoV‐2, and projected to translate to human antiviral effect and relative risk reduction benefits when applied in the QSP modeling. In fact, QSP modeling predicted that 5 days of dosing of oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300/100 mg b.i.d. would demonstrate meaningful antiviral effect, supporting this duration for phase II/III trials. Dosing for > 5 days in symptomatic patients was predicted to have no additional benefit. The physiological rationale for this observation is that after 5 days of dosing (~ 9 days after symptom onset and about 2 weeks after infection,) viral dynamics may be almost entirely driven by viral clearance rates, and not by viral replication.

Limitations of the study include that only a small number of participants were enrolled to provide an initial evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy participants. This study offered an initial assessment of the safety and tolerability profile of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and provided the basis for robust dose selection; however, larger trials across various patient populations were needed to confirm nirmatrelvir/ritonavir safety and evaluate efficacy. Such large studies in patients with COVID‐19 (EPIC‐HR, in Standard Risk Patients (EPIC‐SR), and Post‐Exposure Prophylaxis (EPIC‐PEP)) along with clinical pharmacology studies (e.g. in participants with renal or hepatic impairment), are either completed or ongoing. Study participants were also of limited ethnic diversity. However, a small number of Japanese participants were included, and no meaningful differences in safety and pharmacokinetic results were identified between Japanese and non‐Japanese participants.

Search strategy and MeSH terms.

PubMed was searched for following terms or its equivalents through November 12, 2020: "lopinavir-ritonavir AND COVID-19", "lopinavir-ritonavir AND COVID-19 AND LMICs". This search yielded 420 results; 16 were clinical trials and/or randomized clinical trials; 24 were meta-analyses, reviews, and/or systematic reviews; 148 were from LMICs.

Evidence.

Multiple agents have been identified with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, although evidence is limited in the clinical efficacy of these repurposed agents, particularly in the critically ill population. Lopinavir–ritonavir was shown to be ineffective in a moderate-sized randomized controlled trial. A small 2:1 open-label randomized controlled study of triple therapy (lopinavir–ritonavir, interferon-beta, and ribavirin) compared with lopinavir–ritonavir alone demonstrated decreased viral shedding in the triple therapy arm. Furthermore, the WHO SOLIDARITY trial did not show any mortality benefit to using lopinavir/ritonavir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial, an adaptive multicenter randomized controlled trial evaluating multiple potential treatments for COVID-19 discussed earlier, suspended the lopinavir–ritonavir arm of the study because of a lack of efficacy. They reported no difference in mortality, risk of progression to mechanical ventilation, or duration of hospitalization among 1,596 patients on lopinavir–ritonavir versus 3,376 patients on usual care alone. In some cases, significant bradycardia with atrioventricular block has been reported in older critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Therefore, routine use of lopinavir–ritonavir in the treatment of COVID-19 is not recommended.

Availability, feasibility, affordability, and safety.

We do not recommend lopinavir–ritonavir, regardless of availability or cost for LMICs.

Recommendation for LMICs.

We recommend against using lopinavir–ritonavir in treating COVID-19 (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence).

4. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, should broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy be given empirically for potential coinfections?

Rationale.

Among patients with COVID-19 infection, coinfections due to bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic pathogens may necessitate appropriate antimicrobial treatments for potential coinfection.

### The KLEAN study of fosamprenavir-ritonavir versus lopinavir-ritonavir, each in combination with abacavir-lamivudine, for initial treatment of HIV infection over 48 weeks: a randomised non-inferiority trial [^1165meao]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lopinavir-ritonavir is a preferred protease inhibitor co-formulation for initial HIV-1 treatment. Fosamprenavir-ritonavir has shown similar efficacy and safety to lopinavir-ritonavir when each is combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. We compared the two treatments directly in antiretroviral-naive patients.

Methods

This open-label, non-inferiority study included 878 antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected patients randomised to receive either fosamprenavir-ritonavir 700 mg/100 mg twice daily or lopinavir-ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily, each with the co-formulation of abacavir-lamivudine 600 mg/300 mg once daily. Primary endpoints were proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL at week 48 and treatment discontinuations because of an adverse event. The intent-to-treat analysis included all patients exposed to at least one dose of randomised study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00085943.

Findings

At week 48, non-inferiority of fosamprenavir-ritonavir to lopinavir-ritonavir (95% CI around the treatment difference -4.84 to 7.05) was shown, with 315 of 434 (73%) patients in the fosamprenavir-ritonavir group and 317 of 444 (71%) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group achieving HIV-1 RNA less than 400 copies per mL. Treatment discontinuations due to an adverse event were few and occurred with similar frequency in the two treatment groups (fosamprenavir-ritonavir 53, 12%; lopinavir-ritonavir 43, 10%). Diarrhoea, nausea, and abacavir hypersensitivity were the most frequent drug-related grade 2–4 adverse events. Treatment-emergent drug resistance was rare; no patient had virus that developed reduced susceptibility to fosamprenavir-ritonavir or lopinavir-ritonavir.

Interpretation

Fosamprenavir-ritonavir twice daily in treatment-naive patients provides similar antiviral efficacy, safety, tolerability, and emergence of resistance as lopinavir-ritonavir, each in combination with abacavir-lamivudine.

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: a literature review [^116ahjg2]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Lopinavir/ritonavir

Lopinavir and ritonavir are antiretroviral agents that inhibit viral proteases. Lopinavir is used in combination with ritonavir to enhance its effect in the treatment for HIV. Lopinavir/ritonavir had previously shown to have activity against SARS-CoV in vitro. A consecutive retrospective matched cohort study concluded that lopinavir/ritonavir in addition to standard treatment had improved the clinical outcomes of SARS patients. In the fight against SARS-CoV-2, this drug combination has demonstrated efficacy against its 3CLpro on molecular level. These findings spark hope in the treatment of COVID-19 and led to in vivo studies of lopinavir/ritonavir against this disease.

An open-label, randomised, controlled trial in China, named LOTUS, assessed the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir in SARS-CoV2-infected, hospitalised, seriously ill patients. Eligible participants were those with positive reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2, imaging-confirmed pneumonia, and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94% or less. Of 199 enrolled participants, 99 were grouped to receive lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg and 100 mg two times a day for 14 days, and 100 participants received standard care. Five patients of the lopinavir/ritonavir group did not receive doses due to early death and the refusal of physicians. In median time, participants were randomised after 13 days from the onset of symptoms. The participants were evaluated for clinical improvement, viral load, adverse events, and mortality. The median time to clinical improvement was 15 days in the lopinavir/ritonavir group and 16 days in the control group. Also, the mortality after 28 days and the nasopharyngeal viral load did not differ significantly between the groups with 19.2% in the lopinavir/ritonavir in comparison to 25% in the standard of care group. The lopinavir/ritonavir group had more commonly adverse events, being mostly gastrointestinal complaints. Serious adverse events, including ARDS, acute kidney injury, and secondary infections, were more common in the standard care group than in the treatment group with 32.3% versus 20% of occurrence, respectively. All in all, the study did not conclude a significant benefit of lopinavir/ritonavir in comparison to standard care in clinical improvement, mortality, and decreasing viral load in the treatment of seriously ill COVID-19 patients (Table 2). However, since the median time for randomisation was relatively long for usual antiviral treatment and the participants had more severe disease, the study cannot exclude the efficacy of this drug combination in earlier administration and in milder diseased patients. Also, as the pandemic is having a vast impact on the hospital burden around the world, a hospital-stay shortened by 1 day could still have benefits.

### Lopinavir and ritonavir [^1117QEqH]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

A prospective multicenter, open-label trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile, tolerability, safety and efficacy of high-dose lopinavir and ritonavir with or without concurrent NNRTI therapy (Group 1: 400/100 mg/m2twice daily + ≥ 2 NRTIs; Group 2: 480/120 mg/m2twice daily + ≥ 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI) in 26 children and adolescents ≥ 2 years to < 18 years of age who had failed prior therapy. Patients also had saquinavir mesylate added to their regimen. This strategy was intended to assess whether higher than approved doses of lopinavir and ritonavir could overcome protease inhibitor cross-resistance. High doses of lopinavir and ritonavir exhibited a safety profile similar to those observed in previous trials; changes in HIV-1 RNA were less than anticipated; three patients had HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 48. CD4+ cell count increases were noted in the eight patients who remained on treatment for 48 weeks [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

A prospective multicenter, randomized, open-label study evaluated the efficacy and safety of twice-daily versus once-daily dosing of lopinavir and ritonavir tablets dosed by weight as part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected children (n = 173). Children were eligible when they were aged < 18 years, ≥ 15 kg in weight, receiving cART that included lopinavir and ritonavir, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) < 50 copies/mL for at least 24 weeks and able to swallow tablets. At week 24, efficacy (defined as the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) was significantly higher in subjects receiving twice daily dosing compared to subjects receiving once daily dosing. The safety profile was similar between the two treatment arms although there was a greater incidence of diarrhea in the once daily treated subjects.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of lopinavir and ritonavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, appropriate caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of lopinavir and ritonavir in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Through 48 weeks of therapy, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count was 111 cells/mm3for the lopinavir and ritonavir arm and 112 cells/mm3for the investigator-selected protease inhibitor(s) arm.

Study 802: Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets 800/200 mg Once Daily Versus 400/100 mg Twice Daily when Co-­administered with Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors in Antiretroviral-Experienced, HIV-1 Infected Subjects

M06–802 was a randomized open-label study comparing the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of once daily and twice daily dosing of lopinavir and ritonavir tablets in 599 subjects with detectable viral loads while receiving their current antiviral therapy. Of the enrolled subjects, 55% on both treatment arms had not been previously treated with a protease inhibitor and 81–88% had received prior NNRTIs as part of their anti-HIV treatment regimen. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir and ritonavir 800/200 mg once daily (n = 300) or lopinavir and ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily (n = 299). Patients were administered at least two nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors selected by the investigator. Mean age of patients enrolled was 41 years (range: 21 to 73); 51% were Caucasian, and 66% were male. Mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 254 cells/mm3(range: 4 to 952 cells/mm3) and mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log10copies/mL (range: 1.7 to 6.6 log10copies/mL).

Treatment response and outcomes of randomized treatment through Week 48 are presented in Table 25.

Through 48 weeks of treatment, the mean change from baseline for CD4 + cell count was 135 cells/mm3for the once daily group and 122 cells/mm3for the twice daily group.
