## Question

Is myelodysplastic syndrome considered a malignancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is considered a malignancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitional criteria for "malignancy" in hematology. Then, I should verify how contemporary classification systems label MDS. Next, I will examine the biologic hallmarks (clonality, somatic mutations), followed by clinical behavior (progression, mortality). After that, I need to review treatment paradigms that imply malignant disease. Finally, I will reconcile historical versus current terminology and synthesize an answer anchored to WHO and major society guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual frame: in hematologic practice, malignancy implies a clonal process with somatic driver mutations, dysregulated differentiation, a propensity for progression, organ dysfunction, and disease-related mortality; I need to ensure MDS fits these features by checking clonality and oncogenic mutation prevalence in MDS, which are well described across myeloid neoplasms.

> Next, I should review the authoritative classifications to see how they name the disease category; the 5th edition WHO explicitly renames the category to "Myelodysplastic Neoplasms", and multiple contemporary reviews and guidelines describe MDS as a clonal myeloid neoplasm, which in hematology denotes a malignant disease group rather than a benign process [^111YCUEB] [^1133rebm] [^113oJGK9] [^114BmVBz].

> Wait, let me verify the biologic hallmarks more directly: MDS arises from clonal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with recurrent somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators, splicing factors, transcription and DNA repair pathways; moreover, approximately 90% of patients harbor known or suspected oncogenic mutations, consistent with malignant clonal evolution [^115aS5gJ] [^1136bWdN] [^111u2TVq].

> I will now examine clinical behavior; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I confirm transformation risk and mortality drivers: MDS shows variable but real risk of evolution to AML and significant disease-related mortality from bone marrow failure — features characteristic of malignancy despite heterogeneity in pace and phenotype [^113oJGK9] [^115F1HQM] [^113e8QLp].

> Next, I should review therapeutic paradigms; I need to check whether the management mirrors that of cancers: higher-risk MDS commonly receives AML-like chemotherapy (often as a bridge) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with curative intent, and risk-adapted algorithms (IPSS-R/IPSS-M) are standard oncology tools — collectively aligning MDS care with malignant hematologic practice [^111LK2Kw] [^114DLsJs] [^117ErL3v] [^113TKR7c] [^11154uoB].

> But wait, what about the older terminology using "syndrome" or "disorder" — does that conflict with calling it malignant? At first glance, "syndrome" could be misread as non-malignant; hold on, I should verify the historical context: earlier literature sometimes emphasized cytopenic syndromes, yet even then MDS was described as a clonal hematopoietic stem cell malignancy, and the WHO 2022 update formalized the "neoplasm" nomenclature to reflect the accumulated molecular evidence, resolving the semantic ambiguity [^115tKvuF] [^117Ci2zo] [^111YCUEB].

> I should also confirm special populations and edge cases; pediatric MDS and very indolent lower-risk adult MDS can behave more slowly, which might tempt one to label them "premalignant", but classification and guideline usage still place them within myeloid neoplasms, and expert guidance continues to apply malignant-disease frameworks to diagnosis, prognostication, and referral, including attention to germline predisposition [^1159AByX] [^114pvvkG].

> Final check and synthesis: across classification, biology, clinical behavior, and treatment, MDS fulfills malignancy criteria and is explicitly categorized as a myeloid neoplasm by WHO and major societies; therefore, I can conclude with confidence that MDS is considered a malignancy, acknowledging that historical terminology sometimes obscured this point but is now reconciled by modern frameworks [^111YCUEB] [^113oJGK9] [^1133rebm].

Yes, MDS is considered a **malignancy** [^1133rebm]. It is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder classified as a **myeloid neoplasm** by WHO and ICC [^113k1gbb] [^112uNk1f], with a risk of progression to AML [^111u2TVq]. MDS is managed with risk-adapted therapy [^111u2TVq] [^1133rebm], including hypomethylating agents [^11154uoB] and allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^114DLsJs], reflecting its malignant nature.

---

## Classification and definition

- **Clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder**: MDS arises from clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells with somatic mutations [^113oJGK9] [^115aS5gJ].

- **Myeloid neoplasm**: WHO and ICC classify MDS as a myeloid neoplasm, emphasizing its malignant potential [^113k1gbb] [^114pvvkG].

- **Ineffective hematopoiesis**: Characterized by dysplasia, cytopenias, and risk of progression to AML [^111YSJZf] [^113oJGK9].

---

## Molecular and genetic evidence

- **Somatic mutations**: Recurrent mutations in genes such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, EZH2, TP53, and others are common in MDS [^115aS5gJ] [^113oJGK9].

- **Clonal hematopoiesis**: MDS is driven by clonal expansion of mutated hematopoietic stem cells, a hallmark of malignancy [^1136bWdN].

- **Genomic instability**: Chromosomal abnormalities and complex karyotypes are frequent, further supporting its malignant nature [^113TKR7c].

---

## Clinical behavior and progression

- **Risk of progression to AML**: MDS has a well-documented risk of progression to AML, a definitive hematologic malignancy [^1133rebm].

- **Variable clinical course**: MDS ranges from indolent forms to aggressive subtypes with rapid progression, similar to other malignancies [^114BmVBz].

- **Prognostic scoring systems**: IPSS-R [^113TKR7c] and IPSS-M [^114BmVBz] are used to stratify patients based on risk of progression and survival, reflecting its malignant potential [^111u2TVq].

---

## Treatment implications

Treatment strategies are **risk-adapted** [^1133rebm] and include supportive care, hypomethylating agents, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^111u2TVq]. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the **only curative treatment** [^114DLsJs], and hypomethylating agents are standard for higher-risk MDS [^11154uoB].

---

## Comparison with other hematologic malignancies

| **Feature** | **MDS** | **AML** | **CML** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clonal disorder | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Somatic mutations | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Risk of progression | Yes (to AML) | N/A | Yes (to blast crisis) |
| Treatment | - Risk-adapted <br/> - HSCT | - Chemotherapy <br/> - HSCT | - TKIs <br/> - HSCT |
| Curative potential | HSCT | HSCT | - TKIs <br/> - HSCT |

---

## Conclusion

MDS is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder classified by WHO and ICC as a **myeloid neoplasm** [^113k1gbb] and carries a risk of progression to AML [^1133rebm]. It is managed with **risk-adapted** therapy, including hypomethylating agents and allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^111u2TVq] [^114DLsJs], underscoring its **malignant nature**.

### Risk stratifying MDS in the time of precision medicine [^111u2TVq]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2022). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are myeloid neoplasms characterized by morphologic dysplasia, persistent cytopenia, and a variable risk of evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Risk stratification is crucial in a patient-centered approach to the treatment of MDS. Based on hematologic parameters and cytogenetic abnormalities, the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System is currently used for this purpose.

In the past years, the use of massively parallel DNA sequencing has clarified the genetic basis of MDS and has enabled the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic approaches. When conventional cytogenetics is combined with gene sequencing, more than 90% of patients are found to carry a somatic genetic lesion. In addition, a portion of patients has germline variants that predispose them to myeloid neoplasms.

The recently developed International Consensus Classification of MDS includes new entities that are molecularly defined, namely SF3B1-mutant and TP53-mutant MDS. The International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS has just developed the International Prognostic Scoring System-Molecular (IPSS-M) for MDS, which considers hematologic parameters, cytogenetic abnormalities, and somatic gene mutations. The IPSS-M score is personalized and can be obtained using a web-based calculator that returns not only the individual score but also the expected leukemia-free survival, overall survival, and risk of AML transformation. Providing an efficient risk stratification of patients with MDS, the IPSS-M represents a valuable tool for individual risk assessment.

### How to classify risk based on clinical and molecular modeling: Integrating molecular markers in the risk assessment of myelodysplastic syndrome [^113oJGK9]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). High credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), also known as "myelodysplastic neoplasm", is a heterogeneous group of clonal myeloid neoplasms that typically affects older adults. The clinical phenotype, symptoms, and complications relate to the depth of cytopenia and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The diagnosis of MDS relies on morphologic criteria, such as evidence of dysplasia, disordered maturation, and increasing blast counts, which separate the disease into histologic subtypes with different probabilities for progression to AML.

The treatment of MDS is often risk-adapted depending on the prognostic profile of each patient's disease. There has been a coevolution of diagnostic and prognostic systems for MDS developed over the past 40 years, both of which have now incorporated molecular markers. The new International Prognostic Scoring System-Molecular (IPSS-M) improves partitioning of patients compared to prior versions with resultant upgrading of 34% of patients into higher-risk groups due to the presence of mutations. The new IPSS-M also more accurately distinguishes intermediate-risk patients, separating them into two tiers.

The two new diagnostic classifications include MDS defined by mutations in SF3B1 and TP53, though there are differences in diagnostic criteria. Future efforts to refine MDS prognostication could investigate the interface between MDS and clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance, expand access to genomic testing, obtain results in a less invasive manner, and develop treatment-response predictors and dynamic risk models.

### Myelodysplastic syndrome: An update on diagnosis and therapy [^115F1HQM]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a diverse group of disorders characterized by disorderly and ineffective hematopoiesis. Patients suffer morbidity from associated cytopenias that result in an increased risk of infection, transfusion-dependent anemia, and bleeding. Despite the variable risk of transformation to acute leukemia, the majority of deaths are due to bone marrow failure. No truly effective treatment exists for MDS, and therapy usually focuses on reducing or preventing complications of the disease. Identification of potential cellular and molecular targets, such as epigenetic modification, has led to novel therapeutic approaches in recent years. An increasing number of diagnostic markers, prognostic parameters, and therapeutic strategies are available and becoming widely accepted.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes: Clinicopathologic features, pathobiology, and molecular pathogenesis [^112qFZnu]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are clonal stem cell diseases characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, multilineage dysplasia, and peripheral cytopenias with normocellular or hypercellular marrow. They represent a heterogeneous group of disorders with a varied spectrum of clinical, morphologic, biologic, and genetic characteristics. This heterogeneity in disease characterization has led to evolving classification systems, developing prognostic models, and continuing research efforts to elucidate its pathobiology and pathogenesis.

- **Objective**: To summarize updated information and provide a general overview of the clinicopathologic features, pathobiology, and cytogenetic and molecular pathogenesis of MDSs.

- **Data sources**: Relevant articles indexed in PubMed (National Library of Medicine) between 1982 and 2005 and reference medical texts.

- **Conclusions**: Although MDSs remain a relatively poorly defined disease entity, recent advancements in cytogenetic and molecular studies have significantly contributed to our present knowledge of MDSs. Novel strategies for studying the pathogenesis and evolution of MDSs continue to shape our understanding of this disease and guide our approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

### Real-world validation of molecular international prognostic scoring system for myelodysplastic syndromes [^116uKN9j]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous neoplasms ranging from indolent conditions to cases rapidly progressing into acute myeloid leukemia, and therefore, a risk-adapted treatment strategy is needed. Disease-related risk is currently assessed by the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), based on bone marrow blasts, blood cytopenias, and cytogenetic abnormalities. Although IPSS-R is an excellent tool for clinical decision-making, this scoring system has its weaknesses and may fail to capture reliable prognostic information at the individual patient level.

In MDS, conventional prognostic tools based on clinical and hematologic features are being complemented by introducing somatic gene mutations that have been shown to be valuable prognostic markers. Recently, the International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS (IWG-PM) proposed a clinical-molecular prognostic model (Molecular IPSS [IPSS-M]) that was developed using hematologic parameters, cytogenetic abnormalities, and mutations of 31 MDS-related genes. IPSS-M improved prognostic discrimination across all clinical endpoints compared with IPSS-R.

In this study, we aimed to address the issue of clinical implementability of IPSS-M by:

- **Providing an extensive validation** of its prognostic value (also focusing on patients without detectable mutations).
- **Investigating the predictive and prognostic power** of IPSS-M in patients receiving disease-modifying treatment (hypomethylating agents [HMA] and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]).
- **Testing the accuracy** in i

### Revised international prognostic scoring system for myelodysplastic syndromes [^113TKR7c]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is an important standard for assessing the prognosis of primary untreated adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). To refine the IPSS, MDS patient databases from international institutions were coalesced to assemble a much larger combined database (Revised-IPSS [IPSS-R], n = 7012; IPSS, n = 816) for analysis. Multiple statistically weighted clinical features were used to generate a prognostic categorization model.

Bone marrow cytogenetics, marrow blast percentage, and cytopenias remained the basis of the new system. Novel components of the analysis included five rather than three cytogenetic prognostic subgroups with specific and new classifications of a number of less common cytogenetic subsets. This also involved splitting the low marrow blast percentage value and assessing the depth of cytopenias. This model defined five major prognostic categories rather than the four that were present in the IPSS.

Patient age, performance status, serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase were significant additive features for survival, but not for acute myeloid leukemia transformation. This system comprehensively integrated the numerous known clinical features into a method analyzing MDS patient prognosis more precisely than the initial IPSS. As such, this IPSS-R should prove beneficial for predicting the clinical outcomes of untreated MDS patients and aiding the design and analysis of clinical trials in this disease.

### Reclassifying myelodysplastic syndromes: What's where in the new who and why [^1131C1Bk]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

A revision to the 4th edition of the WHO Classification of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDSs), originally published in 2008, is expected in mid-2016. Based on recommendations from a Clinical Advisory Committee, the revision will aim to incorporate new discoveries in MDS that impact existing disease categories. Although the basic diagnostic principles of the WHO classification remain unchanged, several changes to the classification are proposed. All revisions are considered preliminary until the actual publication of the monograph and online document.

Proposals for change include abandoning the routine use of "refractory anemia/cytopenia" in the various disease names, including the prognostic significance of gene mutations in MDS, revising the diagnostic criteria for MDS entities with ring sideroblasts based on the detection of SF3B1 mutations, modifying the cytogenetic criteria for MDS with isolated del(5q), reclassifying most cases of the erythroid/myeloid type of acute erythroleukemia, and recognizing the familial link in some cases of MDS. This review will provide details of the major proposed changes as well as the rationale for the revisions.

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: The classic and the novel [^116NGEb8]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal myeloid neoplasms originating in hematopoietic stem cells. They are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in dysplasia in hematopoietic cells and are associated with peripheral blood (PB) cytopenias, especially anemia, and a propensity for leukemic transformation. The incidence of MDS increases with age and in the general population is approximately 5 cases per 100,000 people per year. The median age of onset is above the age of 70 years. Patients with MDS are classified using one of several scoring systems. Most patients are assigned to lower-risk or higher-risk groups. While these classifications may assist in diagnosis, they mainly serve for prognostication and to direct management.

In this work, we focus on the diagnosis of MDS and emphasize some of the more modern modalities currently under study. The entities of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are beyond the scope of this paper.

As MDS encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders, the diagnostic process is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory features and the exclusion of other diseases. As such, there is no single specific diagnostic test, and there are no definitive diagnostic criteria for MDS.

### Current challenges and unmet medical needs in myelodysplastic syndromes [^115kGsmx]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms that are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, variable cytopenias, and a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Most patients with MDS are affected by anemia and anemia-related symptoms, which negatively impact their quality of life. While many patients with MDS have lower-risk disease and are managed by existing treatments, there is currently no clear standard of care for many patients. For patients with higher-risk disease, the treatment priority is changing the natural history of the disease by delaying progression to acute myeloid leukemia and improving overall survival. However, existing treatments for MDS are generally not curative, and many patients experience relapse or resistance to first-line treatment. Thus, there remains an unmet need for new, more effective but tolerable strategies to manage MDS. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of MDS, and it is becoming clear that the diverse nature of genetic abnormalities that drive MDS demands a complex and personalized treatment approach. This review will discuss some of the challenges related to the MDS treatment landscape, as well as new approaches currently in development.

### Effect of mutation allele frequency on the risk stratification of myelodysplastic syndrome patients [^114Q3oa3]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal myeloid malignancies. While several mutations are closely correlated with clinical outcomes, data concerning the association between mutation variant allele frequencies (VAF) and prognosis are limited. In this study, we performed comprehensive VAF analyses of relevant myeloid-malignancy related mutations in 698 MDS patients and correlated the results with their prognosis. Mutation VAF in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, EZH2, SETBP1, BCOR, SFSF2, ZRSR2, and TP53 mutations correlated with outcomes.

In multivariable analysis, DNMT3A and ZRSR2 mutations with high VAF and mutant IDH2, CBL, U2AF1, and TP53 were independent poor prognostic factors for overall survival. A substantial portion of patients in each revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) risk group could be adjusted to different prognostic groups based on the integrated VAF and mutational profiles. Patients with these unfavorable mutations in each IPSS-R risk subgroup had survivals worse than other patients of the same risk but similar to those in the next higher-risk subgroup. Furthermore, patients harboring the U2AF1 mutation might benefit from hypomethylating agents.

This study demonstrated the critical role of VAF of mutations for risk stratification in MDS patients and may be incorporated in novel scoring systems.

### A pediatric approach to the who classification of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative diseases [^114G5u5v]. Leukemia (2003). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders are rare in childhood, and there is no widely accepted system for their diagnosis and classification. We propose minimal diagnostic criteria and a simple classification scheme, which, while based on accepted morphological features and conforming with the recent suggestions of the WHO, allows for the special issues of myelodysplastic diseases in children.

The classification recognizes three major diagnostic groups:

- **Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)**: Previously named chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (JCML).
- **Myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome**: A disease with distinct clinical and biological features, encompassing both myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurring in Down syndrome.
- **MDS occurring both de novo and as secondary MDS**: A complication of previous therapy or a pre-existing bone marrow disorder. The main subtypes of MDS are refractory cytopenia (RC) and refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). It is suggested to retain the subtype of RAEB-T with 20–30% blasts in the marrow until more data are available.

Cytogenetics and serial assessments of the patients are essential adjuncts to morphology, both in diagnosis and classification.

### Genome sequencing in the management of myelodysplastic syndromes and related disorders [^115aS5gJ]. Haematologica (2025). High credibility.

Myeloid neoplasms originate from the clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, driven by the acquisition of somatic genetic mutations. Within these disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are specifically characterized by morphological abnormalities (dysplasia) and impaired maturation of myeloid precursors (ineffective hematopoiesis), resulting in peripheral blood cytopenia. Several studies have advanced the field of MDS, with a few landmark papers leading to a paradigm shift, opening new avenues of research and enabling a molecular revolution. These seminal papers include the first description of the 5q- syndrome, the identification of somatic mutations of TET2 in myeloid neoplasms, the detection of common pathway mutations in the splicing machinery, and the discovery of clonal hematopoiesis.

The somatic genomic landscape of MDS is now well defined. Genes that are recurrently mutated include epigenetic regulators, as well as genes of RNA splicing machinery, transcription regulation, DNA repair control, cohesin complex, and signal transduction. Furthermore, several disorders with a germline genetic predisposition to MDS have been identified, collectively accounting for up to 15% of all MDS cases. Genomic profiling can significantly improve the diagnostic approach to MDS, allowing the identification of distinct nosological entities such as SF3B1-mutant or TP53-mutant MDS. The Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System for MDS has already proven to be a valuable tool for individualized risk assessment and treatment decisions.

### Real-world validation of molecular International Prognostic Scoring System for myelodysplastic syndromes [^114BmVBz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous myeloid neoplasms in which a risk-adapted treatment strategy is needed. Recently, a new clinical-molecular prognostic model, the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M), was proposed to improve the prediction of clinical outcome of the currently available tool (Revised International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS-R]). We aimed to provide an extensive validation of IPSS-M.

A total of 2,876 patients with primary MDS from the GenoMed4All consortium were retrospectively analyzed.

- **Results**: IPSS-M improved prognostic discrimination across all clinical endpoints with respect to IPSS-R (concordance was 0.81 vs. 0.74 for overall survival and 0.89 vs. 0.76 for leukemia-free survival, respectively). This was true even in those patients without detectable gene mutations. Compared with the IPSS-R based stratification, the IPSS-M risk group changed in 46% of patients (23.6% and 22.4% of subjects were upstaged and downstaged, respectively).

In patients treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), IPSS-M significantly improved the prediction of disease relapse risk and the probability of post-transplantation survival versus IPSS-R (concordance was 0.76 vs. 0.60 for overall survival and 0.89 vs. 0.70 for probability of relapse, respectively). In high-risk patients treated with hypomethylating agents (HMA), IPSS-M failed to stratify individual probability of response; response duration and probability of survival were inversely related to IPSS-M risk.

Finally, we tested the accuracy in…

### Diagnostic algorithm for lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes [^111MHsFk]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Rapid advances over the past decade have uncovered the heterogeneous genomic and immunologic landscape of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These developments have led to notable improvements in the accuracy and timing of diagnosis and prognostication of MDS, as well as the identification of possible novel targets for therapeutic intervention. For the practicing clinician, however, this increase in genomic, epigenomic, and immunologic knowledge needs consideration in a "real-world" context to aid diagnostic specificity.

Although the 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification for MDS is comprehensive and timely, certain limitations still exist for day-to-day clinical practice. This review describes an up-to-date diagnostic approach to patients with suspected lower-risk MDS, including hypoplastic MDS, and demonstrates the requirement for an "integrated" diagnostic approach. Moreover, in the era of rapid access to massive parallel sequencing platforms for mutational screening, we suggest which patients should undergo such analyses, when such screening should be performed, and how those data should be interpreted. This is particularly relevant given the recent findings describing age-related clonal hematopoiesis.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for myelodysplastic syndrome, particularly stem cell transplantation and pre-transplant management, the BMT CTN, EBMT, ELN, and IMDSF 2017 guidelines recommend against making pretreatment decisions based on the planned conditioning intensity. Instead, the focus should be on post-transplant strategies, including chimerism and/or minimal residual disease monitoring, to prevent relapse.

### Pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome: Updated classifications and current diagnosis and treatment challenges [^1159AByX]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are rare in children and have unique clinical manifestations and implications.

To review the clinical features, pathogenesis, and classification of pediatric MDS, published literature and personal experience were utilized. Pediatric MDS vastly differs from adult MDS. Evaluation for the presence of an underlying germline predisposition syndrome is critical for optimal classification and management. Because of the rarity of cases, resources to aid with the recognition, diagnosis, and management of pediatric MDS are limited, and multi-institutional collaborative studies are needed for the future.

### Recent clinical and molecular advances for the classification of myelodysplastic neoplasms [^112uNk1f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Low credibility.

Several major updates have recently occurred for the NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) based on a number of prominent articles that have particular clinical and biologic impact for the field. These changes, which have been included in the iteration of the NCCN Guidelines (Version 1.2023), include the WHO 2022 classification of MDS as well as the ICC suggestions for the same. In addition, the molecular underpinning of MDS has been greatly updated with the generation of the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M) and an improved understanding of the prognostic implications of mutated TP53 subtypes, which are additive to the revised IPSS (IPSS-R) for stratification and management of patients with MDS. This report emphasizes the major components of the relevant changes to serve as a guide for therapeutic decision-making for patients with MDS.

Historically, 30–40% of MDS patients progress to AML; however, unfortunately, the majority of patients are thought to succumb from disease complications, namely cytopenia or an interplay of cytopenia with comorbidities. The patterns of LR MDS disease progression and causes of mortality are not well delineated in the literature. Disease progression can be in the form of further BM failure associated with more severe cytopenias or increased myeloblasts with transformation to higher risk disease and/or AML. The molecular phenotypes associated with different patterns of disease progression and clonal evolution have not been well studied. Hence, we undertook this study to better delineate factors that can help identify patients with LR MDS at risk for progression and/or death early in their disease course, who may benefit from early intervention rather than the "wait and watch" approach.

### Comparison of the revised 4th (2016) and 5th (2022) editions of the World Health Organization classification of myelodysplastic neoplasms [^113k1gbb]. Leukemia (2022). Low credibility.

We used data from 852 consecutive subjects with myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) diagnosed according to the 2016 (revised 4th) World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to evaluate the 2022 (5th) edition WHO classification of MDS. Overall, our analyses support the refinements made in the WHO 2022 proposal. Below, we discuss some differences between the classifications.

NPM1 mutations, common in AML, also occur in persons with MDS, are associated with Auer rods, and can rapidly progress to AML. Those individuals were biologically more akin to AML regardless of blast percentage and may benefit from AML therapies. Consistent with these findings, the WHO 2022 reclassifies these subjects to AML.

- **MDS-U category**: This involves a small subset of subjects who cannot be accurately classified into any other MDS sub-type. Three categories in the WHO 2016 classification of this sub-type include: (1) 1% blood blasts, (2) pancytopenia and single lineage dysplasia, and (3) absence of significant dysplasia but with MDS-defining cytogenetic abnormalities. People with the first two categories are now re-identified as MDS-LB in the WHO 2022 classification. However, those with 1% blood blasts have a poor prognosis resembling MDS-EB and should be closely followed. People in the third category do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for MDS and are considered CCUS in the WHO 2022 classification. Consequently, MDS-U is removed from the WHO 2022 classification.

### Prognostic models in myelodysplastic syndromes [^111UibSJ]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Establishing the prognosis for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is a key element of their care. It helps patients understand the severity of their disease and set expectations for their future. For physicians, an accurate estimate of prognosis drives decisions about the timing and choice of therapeutic options to consider.

The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) has been the standard tool for MDS risk stratification since it was released in 1997. It has been used to describe patients in pivotal clinical trials and is a key element of practice guidelines. Subsequent changes to the classification scheme for MDS and an underestimation of risk in some patients from the low and intermediate-1 categories have led to the development of several newer prognostic models. The most recent is the revised IPSS (IPSS-R), which addresses several of the perceived deficiencies of its predecessor.

Despite their utility, none of the available prognostic systems incorporates disease-related molecular abnormalities such as somatic mutations. These lesions are present in nearly all cases and many have been shown to improve upon existing prognostic models. However, the interpretation of somatic mutations can be challenging, and it is not yet clear how best to combine them with clinical predictors of outcome.

Here I review several prognostic scoring systems developed after the IPSS and describe the emerging use of molecular markers to refine risk stratification in the MDS patient population.

### Moving toward a conceptualization of measurable residual disease in myelodysplastic syndromes [^1136bWdN]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Approximately 90% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) have somatic mutations that are known or suspected to be oncogenic in the malignant cells. The genetic risk stratification of MDSs has evolved substantially with the introduction of the clinical molecular international prognostic scoring system, which establishes next-generation sequencing at diagnosis as a standard of care. Furthermore, the International Consensus Classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias has refined the MDS diagnostic criteria with the introduction of a new MDS/acute myeloid leukemia category.

Monitoring measurable residual disease (MRD) has historically been used to define remission status, improve relapse prediction, and determine the efficacy of antileukemic drugs in patients with acute and chronic leukemias. However, in contrast to leukemias, assessment of MRD, including tracking of patient-specific mutations, has not yet been formally defined as a biomarker for MDS. This article summarizes evidence and challenges and provides a conceptual framework for incorporating MRD into the treatment of MDS and future clinical trials.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes: moving towards personalized management [^1115tYLB]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

MDS is a complex disease that displays marked inter-individual differences in terms of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic options. Compared to many other blood cancers, the diagnostic process for MDS is more challenging, and effective targeted treatments are less abundant. In Europe, the MDS-Europe platform provides comprehensive, consensus-based guidelines for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, derived from two consecutive European Union research projects. Moreover, many Western countries have local web-based guidelines with relevant links. In the United States, the NCCN guidelines offer similar services.

### The genetic basis and expanding role of molecular analysis in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic design for myelodysplastic syndromes [^111fQHGz]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2014). Low credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis. They typically demonstrate peripheral blood cytopenia, bone marrow hypercellularity, and morphologically defined dysplasia of one or more hematopoietic lineages. Classical metaphase cytogenetics and the judicious use of fluorescence in situ hybridization play central roles in the contemporary diagnosis and classification of MDS. An abundance of recent molecular studies is beginning to delineate additional genetic and epigenetic aberrations associated with these disorders. These alterations affect diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. With this understanding, classification systems are evolving from a primarily hematological and morphological basis toward a multifactorial appreciation that includes histomorphology, metaphase cytogenetics, and directed molecular studies.

In the present healthcare environment, it is critical to develop a cost-effective, efficient testing strategy that maximizes the diagnostic potential of even limited specimens. Here, we briefly review the classical genetic approach to MDS, outline exciting new advances in the molecular understanding of this heterogeneous group of hematological neoplasms, and discuss how these advances are driving the evolution of classification and prognostic systems. The rapidly growing understanding of the genetic basis of MDS holds much promise for testing. Here, we provide a frame of reference for the discussion of testing protocols and for addressing testing modalities likely to enter clinical practice.

### Clinical and genetic predictors of prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes [^112gnRhB]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes are a collection of clonal hematopoietic disorders with a wide range of clinical manifestations and eventual outcomes. Accurate prediction of a patient's prognosis is useful to define the risk posed by the disease and to determine which treatment options are most appropriate. Several models have been created to help predict the prognosis for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) has been the standard tool used to risk stratify MDS patients since its publication in 1997. Other models have since been developed to improve upon the IPSS, including the recent Revised International Prognostic Scoring System. Most models consider the presence or severity of peripheral blood cytopenias, the proportion of bone marrow blasts, and specific karyotype abnormalities.

Other factors, including age, performance status, comorbidities, transfusion dependence, and molecular biomarkers, can further refine the prediction of prognosis in some models. Novel, disease-specific biomarkers with prognostic value in myelodysplastic syndromes, such as cell surface markers, gene expression profiles, and high-resolution copy number analyses, have been proposed but not yet adopted clinically. Somatic abnormalities in recurrently mutated genes are the most informative prognostic biomarkers not currently considered by clinical risk models. Mutations in specific genes have independent prognostic significance and, unlike cytogenetic abnormalities, are present in the majority of myelodysplastic syndrome cases.

### Classification and personalized prognostic assessment on the basis of clinical and genomic features in myelodysplastic syndromes [^111aHa9u]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by peripheral blood cytopenia and an increased risk of evolution into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Disease classification provided by the WHO mainly uses morphological features to define MDS categories, leading to a clinical overlap between subtypes and low interobserver reproducibility in the evaluation of marrow dysplasia.

MDS ranges from indolent conditions to cases rapidly progressing into AML. Disease-related risk is assessed by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) on the basis of the percentage of bone marrow blasts, number of peripheral blood cytopenias, and the presence of specific clonal cytogenetic abnormalities. In 2012, a revised version of IPSS (IPSS-R) was proposed, introducing five cytogenetic risk groups together with refined categories for bone marrow blasts and cytopenias. Although IPSS and IPSS-R are excellent tools for clinical decision-making, these scoring systems have weaknesses and may fail to capture reliable prognostic information at the individual patient level. In particular, cytogenetics (which is the only biological parameter included in these scores) is not informative in a large proportion of patients, and chromosomal abnormalities mostly refer to secondary, late genomic events occurring in the natural history of the disease.

The development of MDS is driven by mutations in genes involved in RNA splicing, DNA methylation, chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction.

### Comparison of the 2022 World Health Organization classification and international consensus classification in myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms [^116HKVtR]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Low credibility.

MDS-h, a new entity in the WHO-2022 classification but not in ICC, comprises 10–27% of all MDS cases. It is frequently observed in Asian MDS cohorts or in children. The differing reported prevalence may result from several factors:

- **Variation in criteria**: Differences in criteria used to define hypocellular bone marrow across various studies.
- **Patient enrollment criteria**: Whether the study included de novo cases only or both de novo and secondary cases, as well as differences between French-American-British- and WHO-defined cohorts.
- **Genetic and environmental backgrounds**: Variances exist among study populations.
- **Inclusion of aplastic anemia patients**: The possibility exists of inadvertently including patients with aplastic anemia in the MDS-h cohort.

In our study, 14.8% of patients were qualified for the diagnosis of MDS-h based on WHO-2022 definition (hypocellular marrow: < 30% of normal cellularity in patients younger than 70 years and < 20% in patients aged 70 and older). MDS-h patients show activated immune system features, especially effector T cells targeting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. They typically have severe cytopenia, fewer somatic mutations, higher immunosuppressive therapy response, and better outcomes regarding low-risk IPSS-R. In our study, MDS, NOS patients with MDS-h showed a trend of improved survival compared to other low-risk MDS cases. Recognizing these patients aids in enhancing patient care through tailored treatment strategies.

### An agenda to advance research in myelodysplastic syndromes: A top 10 priority list from the first international workshop in MDS [^1158uSJL]. Blood Advances (2023). Low credibility.

The advent and widespread availability of next generation sequencing has led to the discovery of clonal hematopoiesis (CH), which, in some cases, is associated with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and hematologic malignancies. Therefore, early intervention should be monitored and considered, especially among patients with solid tumors where high-risk CH clones can dramatically expand under the selective pressure of chemotherapy, increasing the risk of subsequent therapy-related myeloid neoplasms.

We need to learn more about the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of CH evolution to accurately predict which patients with CH will develop myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and other blood cancers. Ultimately, the goal is to develop effective secondary preventive or therapeutic strategies that reduce the risk of aggressive hematologic malignancies and other CH-related diseases in patients with higher-risk CH lesions.

The identification of CH before exposure to intensive chemotherapy or radiation therapy is not frequently covered by insurance companies. This poses a barrier to obtaining adequate informed consent and poses risks to patients when deciding to embark on potentially toxic therapies.

Lastly, how best to identify and classify patients with a germline predisposition to develop myeloid malignancies such as MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will be a significant future focus of genetic counseling and risk prevention efforts.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), specifically in the context of stem cell transplantation, the BMT CTN/EBMT/ELN/IMDSF 2017 guidelines recommend pre-transplant management. There is insufficient evidence to recommend continuing hypomethylating agents or proceeding with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) when patients achieve complete remission after hypomethylating agent therapy. However, HSCT should be considered for patients with stable disease after receiving six or more courses of hypomethylating agent therapy.

### Classification and personalized prognostic assessment on the basis of clinical and genomic features in myelodysplastic syndromes [^112va1kq]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Recurrently mutated genes and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We aim to integrate these genomic features into disease classification and prognostication. We retrospectively enrolled 2,043 patients. Using Bayesian networks and Dirichlet processes, we combined mutations in 47 genes with cytogenetic abnormalities to identify genetic associations and subgroups. Random-effects Cox proportional hazards multistate modeling was used for developing prognostic models. An independent validation on 318 cases was performed.

- **Results**: We identify eight MDS groups (clusters) according to specific genomic features. In five groups, dominant genomic features include splicing gene mutations (SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1) that occur early in disease history, determine specific phenotypes, and drive disease evolution. These groups display different prognoses, with groups having SF3B1 mutations associated with better survival. Specific co-mutation patterns account for clinical heterogeneity within SF3B1- and SRSF2-related MDS. MDS with complex karyotype and/or TP53 gene abnormalities, and MDS with acute leukemia–like mutations, show the poorest prognosis. MDS with 5q deletion are clustered into two distinct groups according to the number of mutated genes and/or presence of TP53 mutations. By integrating 63 clinical and genomic variables, we define a novel prognostic model that generates personally tailored predictions of survival. The predicted and observed outcomes correlate well in internal cross-validation and in an independent extension.

### Clinical utility of gene panel-based testing for hereditary myelodysplastic syndrome/acute leukemia predisposition syndromes [^112B8MHr]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia (AL) are clinically diverse and genetically heterogeneous groups of hematological malignancies. Hereditary forms of MDS/AL were considered rare but have been increasingly recognized in recent years. Pathogenic variants in a single gene can predispose carriers to an increased lifetime risk of primary MDS and/or AL. Hereditary MDS/AL can occur in the context of familial MDS/AL that have MDS/AL as the principal clinical feature or arise from inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS), such as Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita/telomerase biology disorders (TBD), Diamond–Blackfan anemia, and severe congenital neutropenia.

Within the past decade, nearly a dozen adult-onset familial MDS/AL syndromes have been defined. These include thrombocytopenia with associated myeloid malignancies caused by germline mutations in RUNX1, ANKRD26, and ETV6; GATA2-associated syndromes (Emberger syndrome, MonoMAC syndrome, immunodeficiency); familial MDS and acute myeloid leukemia caused by mutations in CEBPA, DDX41, and SRP72; and TBD due to mutations in TERT or TERC. Although the majority of patients with classic IBMFS are diagnosed in childhood, some patients have no or only subtle extra hematopoietic manifestations and may present in adulthood with MDS or AL.

A few studies have shown that genetic abnormalities exist in 11–37% of families with hereditary MDS/AL. The recognition of patients with a hereditary predisposition to MDS/AL is particularly important for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation donor selection, pre-tran.

### Comparison of the revised 4th (2016) and 5th (2022) editions of the World Health Organization classification of myelodysplastic neoplasms [^112Zq9n2]. Leukemia (2022). High credibility.

Persons with MDS-h have more severe cytopenias but a better prognosis compared with those with normal/hyper-cellular MDS. These findings were reproduced in our dataset. Persons with hypoplastic MDS were reported to have specific immunological and genomic features, suggesting a unique pathogenesis of this subset. In accordance with these findings, the WHO 2022 classification recognizes MDS-h as a distinct MDS sub-type. The distinction of MDS-h and other hypoplastic bone marrow failure disorders can be difficult, and careful morphological evaluation is critical.

Subjects with single lineage dysplasia are a small but heterogeneous cohort with a high prevalence of bi-cytopenias or pancytopenia. Isolated cytopenia is not associated with the same dysplastic lineage. Although persons with single lineage dysplasia were reported to have a better prognosis, replicability in identifying single versus multi-lineages is low. The threshold of 10% may explain these discordances, and a threshold of 40% dysplastic megakaryocyte has been proposed. The WHO 2022 classification integrates MDS-SLD and MDS-MLD in the WHO 2016 classification into MDS-LB in the WHO 2022 classification. The new sub-type emphasizes low blasts and provides a better description of those persons. Regardless, we suggest persons with MDS-LB-MLD may have a worse prognosis compared with people with MDS-LB-SLD.

Our study has important limitations, such as our data should be confirmed by an independent cohort.

In conclusion, our evaluation supports the refinements made in the WHO 2022 classification of MDS.

### Classification of myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms: The past, present, and future [^111YCUEB]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 summarizes key changes in the classification of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) from the FAB through to the classifications. The FAB and earlier WHO classifications retained the term "refractory anemia" for most categories, despite the knowledge that these disorders were neoplastic. The revised 4th edition WHO classification changed the terminology to "myelodysplastic syndrome" in the specific entity names to better reflect the specificity of the diagnosis, in contrast to the vaguer "refractory anemia" terminology.

The WHO 5th edition changes the name of the entire category to "Myelodysplastic Neoplasms", although they retain the abbreviation of MDS for this group. While these disorders are accepted as neoplasms, such a change in terminology was discussed and rejected by the Clinical Advisory Committees of the revised 4th edition WHO classification and the ICC. Both retained the category name "Myelodysplastic Syndromes". Disease categories have been added and deleted from this category over time.

Of particular note, CMML, originally considered an MDS by the FAB classification, was moved to a new disease group of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases by the WHO 3rd edition. The category remains, but the name was changed to myelodysplastic/MPNs in subsequent classifications. The WHO added categories of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and MDS associated with isolated del(5q) (3rd edition) and added a provisional category of refractory cytopenia of childhood (4th edition). The later provisional entity is retained but was moved to the category of P…

### Familial myelodysplastic syndromes: A review of the literature [^117Mb55M]. Haematologica (2011). High credibility.

Familial cases of myelodysplastic syndromes are rare yet immensely valuable for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of myelodysplasia in general. The best-characterized familial myelodysplastic syndrome is familial platelet disorder with a propensity to myeloid malignancy, caused by heterozygous germline RUNX1 mutations. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, allowing for a better understanding of the incidence, clinical features, and pathogenesis of this disorder.

These recent cases have highlighted the clinical variability of the disorder and confirmed that many patients lack a bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia history. Additionally, several cases of T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia have now been reported, confirming a risk of lymphoid leukemia in patients with inherited RUNX1 mutations. Furthermore, increased awareness among clinicians has helped detect a number of additional families affected by inherited myelodysplastic syndromes. This has led to the identification of novel causative mechanisms of disease, such as RUNX1 deficiency resulting from constitutional microdeletions of 21q22 and myelodysplasia associated with telomerase deficiency.

Awareness of predisposition to myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia in families may be of critical importance in managing younger patients with myelodysplasia, in whom allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered. Such families should be investigated for inherited deficiencies of RUNX1 and/or telomerase to prevent the use of an affected sibling.

### Epidemiology of myelodysplastic syndromes [^117Ci2zo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell malignancies with significant morbidity and high mortality. The incidence of MDS increases markedly with age, and the disease is most prevalent in individuals who are white and male. It is conservatively estimated that more than 10,000 new cases of MDS occur in the United States annually and that at least 60,000 individuals with MDS currently reside in the country. With an aging population and improving awareness of the disease, the documented disease burden is expected to escalate in the near future. Recent studies have identified new or inconsistent etiologic factors that warrant further research. Given the poor survival of individuals with MDS, it is important to identify prognostic factors to better risk-stratify patients for more effective treatment. The relevance of different comorbidities to MDS prognosis and the potential interaction between various comorbidities represent interesting areas of research.

### Comparing the prognostic value of risk stratifying models for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes: Is one model better [^111Kkg25]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Some patients classified as having lower-risk (LR) disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) fare more poorly than predicted. We examined the prognostic utility of IPSS, the MD Anderson LR-Prognostic System (LR-PSS), and the revised IPSS (IPSS-R) in a large cohort of patients classified as having IPSS LR-MDS in the MDS Clinical Research Consortium database. Actual overall survival (OS) was assessed in patients with IPSS LR-MDS (i.e. low and intermediate-1) using Kaplan-Meier methods. Harrell's c index (HCI) and Akaike information criteria (AIC) were used to compare the models.

Median OS of 1,140 eligible patients was 47 months (95% CI, 44–52). Median follow-up was 62 months. HCI values indicating the discriminatory power of the models (where higher is better) were superior for LR-PSS (0.74, 95% CI, 0.70–0.78) compared to IPSS-R (0.64, 95% CI, 0.60–0.67) and IPSS (0.64, 95% CI, 0.60–0.68). Similarly, AIC values indicating the goodness of the fit showed LR-PSS had a better fit than IPSS-R and IPSS (8,110, 8,147, and 8,150, respectively, where lower is better).

- **Patient stratification**: LR-PSS assigned 25.1% and 37.4% of patients with IPSS LR-MDS to LR-PSS Category 3 and IPSS-R Categories ≥ Intermediate, respectively. Of 291 patients (25.5%) who survived ≤ 24 months from diagnosis, only 37.1% and 45% were classified as LR-PSS Category 3 and IPSS-R Categories ≥ Intermediate, respectively (P = 0.06).

While both LR-PSS and IPSS-R distinguish groups with varied survival outcomes among patients with IPSS LR-MDS, both tools fail to identify a significant subset with poor OS. Future studies should assess whether patient…

### Diagnosis and classification of myelodysplastic syndrome: International Working Group on Morphology of myelodysplastic syndrome (IWGM-MDS) consensus proposals for the definition and enumeration of myeloblasts and ring sideroblasts [^112KPkzy]. Haematologica (2008). Low credibility.

The classification of myelodysplastic syndromes is based on the morphological criteria proposed by the French-American-British (FAB) and World Health Organization (WHO) groups. Accurate enumeration of blast cells, although essential for the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome and for assignment to prognostic groups, is often difficult due to imprecise criteria for the morphological definition of blasts and promyelocytes. An International Working Group on Morphology of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (IWGM-MDS) consisting of hematopathologists and hematologists expert in the field of myelodysplastic syndrome reviewed the morphological features of bone marrows from all subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome and agreed on a set of recommendations, including recommendations for the definition and enumeration of blast cells and ring sideroblasts.

- **Recommendations include**:
	(1) defining agranular or granular blast cells, replacing the previous type I, II, and III blasts,
	(2) distinguishing dysplastic promyelocytes from cytologically normal promyelocytes and from granular blast cells,
	(3) counting sufficient cells to provide a precise blast percentage, particularly at thresholds important for diagnosis or prognosis, and
	(4) defining ring sideroblasts as erythroblasts with a minimum of 5 siderotic granules covering at least a third of the nuclear circumference.

Clear definitions and a differential count of a sufficient number of cells are likely to improve precision in the diagnosis and classification of myelodysplastic syndrome. Recommendations should be applied in the context of comprehensive clinical evaluation.

### Epidemiology, natural history, and practice patterns of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes in 2010 [^117SBqZw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

The incidence rate of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the United States is approximately 3.4 per 100,000 people, accounting for more than 10,000 new diagnoses annually and an estimated 60,000 people living with the disease. Common risk factors for developing MDS include advanced age, male gender, and antecedent exposure to chemotherapy or radiation as treatment for other cancers, which alone accounts for 10% of MDS cases. Patients with MDS are typically diagnosed when they are in their 70s, have significant cytopenias, and substantive transfusion needs. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents are used by more than 50% of patients, although the use of disease-modifying agents is increasing and may ultimately impact the number of patients living with MDS.

### Hematopathological concepts and controversies in the diagnosis and classification of myelodysplastic syndromes [^116ik4Gk]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis and classification of most cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is usually accomplished without difficulty, a minority of cases may pose diagnostic problems. In many cases, the diagnostic dilemma can be solved by adhering to basic guidelines recommended for the evaluation of patients suspected of having MDS, particularly focusing on the quality of the blood and bone marrow specimens submitted for morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic studies.

However, in cases where patients have hypocellular MDS or MDS with fibrosis, the criteria for making a diagnosis can be difficult, if not impossible, to apply. Additionally, diagnostic uncertainty arises because the minimal criteria necessary to establish the diagnosis of MDS are not always clearly stated. In this review, some of these diagnostic problems are addressed, and general guidelines for resolving them are suggested. Moreover, data are presented illustrating that the WHO classification offers a valuable tool for the diagnosis and classification of MDS.

### Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for MDS and CMML: Recommendations from an international expert panel [^114rCDc2]. Blood (2017). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for myelodysplastic syndrome, specifically concerning indications for specialist referral, the BMT CTN/EBMT/ELN/IMDSF 2017 guidelines recommend referring patients with MDS associated with inherited germ-line mutations to specialist centers. Young patients (< 40–50 years) with a family history of dyskeratosis congenita, Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and GATA2 mutations should be considered, given the specific sensitivity to conditioning for HSCT in some of these syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, and the need to select family donors who may carry the involved mutation.

### Current challenges and unmet medical needs in myelodysplastic syndromes [^1118rboF]. Leukemia (2021). Low credibility.

Although abnormal findings on routine blood testing often lead to suspicion of MDS, diagnosis is confirmed via bone marrow aspiration (cellular morphology and percentage of blasts), bone marrow biopsy (cellularity and architecture), and cytogenetic or molecular genetic analysis. An analysis of bone marrow cytogenetics is also required to help calculate a prognosis score and may be helpful in treatment selection for certain genetic mutations. Although most patients carry ≥ 1 somatic genetic mutation, these mutations are not part of the diagnostic criteria for MDS, with the exception of SF3B1 mutations. The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines identify seven morphologic subtypes of adult MDS, which are outlined below.

- **2016 WHO classification of MDS**: MDS myelodysplastic syndromes, PB peripheral blood, WHO World Health Organization. Cytopenias are defined as hemoglobin < 10 g/dl, platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/l, and absolute neutrophil count < 1.8 × 10⁹/l. In rare cases, MDS may present with mild anemia or thrombocytopenia above these levels. PB monocytes must be < 1 × 10⁹/l.

### Impact of the International Consensus Classification of myelodysplastic syndromes [^113QNF4G]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

The impact of the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) needs study. We analyzed data from 989 MDS subjects classified using the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to determine the impact of the new proposal. Our analyses suggested the ICC criteria of MDS-SF3B1 identify a more homogeneous disease entity than the WHO 2016 criteria of myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS). MDS not otherwise specified with single lineage dysplasia (MDS, NOS-SLD) patients had a better prognosis than MDS, NOS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS, NOS-MLD) patients. MDS with mutated TP53 and MDS/acute myeloid leukaemia with mutated TP53 patients had the briefest survivals. These data support the ICC of MDS, which allows more accurate diagnoses and risk stratification.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of myelodysplastic syndromes [^115tKvuF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a group of underrecognized hematologic clonal malignancies with a variable propensity for leukemic transformation, presenting a diagnostic challenge due to the lack of hallmark symptoms. MDS can present with varying degrees of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia and can range from indolent to life-threatening at presentation. Clinicians should maintain a heightened level of suspicion when treating elderly patients and those with prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, and environmental toxins in the presence of unexplained cytopenias. Chronic anemia should not be considered a natural consequence of aging. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with unexplained anemia may have findings compatible with MDS, suggesting that MDS should be prioritized higher in the differential diagnosis. Primary care physicians are encouraged to conduct comprehensive evaluations to exclude non-MDS-related causes for persistent cytopenias. Patients with pancytopenia, bicytopenia, or any persistent and unexplained isolated cytopenia — particularly unexplained macrocytic anemia — should be referred to a specialist to establish a diagnosis.

### Incorporation of mutations in five genes in the revised International Prognostic Scoring System can improve risk stratification in the patients with myelodysplastic syndrome [^1179Y7RN]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic disorders characterized by various clinical presentations, risks for leukemia transformation, and reduced survival. This makes the accurate diagnosis, classification, and risk stratification of MDS patients clinically relevant. Several prognostic models, including the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), World Health Organization (WHO) based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS), and the revised IPSS (IPSS-R), have been developed to help risk-stratify these patients and facilitate clinical decision-making.

Over the past decade, high-throughput genetic techniques have uncovered novel genetic alterations and illuminated the genomic landscape of MDS. Importantly, some of these mutations are associated with distinct clinical features and can predict survival. Nevertheless, molecular data are not included in prognostic systems. The 2001 WHO Classification included cytogenetics in MDS classification, and the updated 2016 WHO classification first included the status of the SF3B1 mutation in the classification of MDS with ring sideroblasts.

Recently, Haferlach et al. and Nazha et al. demonstrated that integrating mutational profiling into the IPSS-R could better discriminate MDS patients into various prognostic groups. However, the number of incorporated genes, patient population, and treatment strategies were highly variable in these two studies. More investigations into the use of mutational data for MDS prognostication may provide a clearer view in this regard.

### Myelodysplastic syndromes: 2023 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^1133rebm]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). High credibility.

The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias and an increased risk of transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). MDS occurs more frequently in older males and in individuals with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy.

- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosis of MDS is based on morphological evidence of dysplasia upon visual examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information obtained from additional studies such as karyotype, flow cytometry, and molecular genetics is usually complementary and may help refine the diagnosis. A new WHO classification of MDS was proposed in 2022. Under this classification, MDS is now termed myelodysplastic neoplasms.

- **Risk-stratification**: Prognosis of patients with MDS can be calculated using a number of scoring systems. All these scoring systems include analysis of peripheral cytopenias, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, and cytogenetic characteristics. The most commonly accepted system is the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). Recently, genomic data has been incorporated, resulting in the new IPSS-M classification.

- **Risk-adapted therapy**: Therapy is selected based on risk, transfusion needs, percent of bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic and mutational profiles, comorbidities, potential for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), and prior exposure to hypomethylating agents (HMA). Goals of therapy differ between lower-risk patients and higher-risk patients, as well as in those with HMA failure. In lower-risk cases, the goal is to maintain quality of life and manage symptoms effectively.

### Classification and personalized prognostic assessment on the basis of clinical and genomic features in myelodysplastic syndromes [^113CuEZR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Recurrently mutated genes and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We aim to integrate these genomic features into disease classification and prognostication.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively enrolled 2,043 patients. Using Bayesian networks and Dirichlet processes, we combined mutations in 47 genes with cytogenetic abnormalities to identify genetic associations and subgroups. Random-effects Cox proportional hazards multistate modeling was employed for developing prognostic models. An independent validation on 318 cases was performed.

- **Results**: We identify eight MDS groups (clusters) according to specific genomic features. In five groups, dominant genomic features include splicing gene mutations (SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1) that occur early in disease history, determine specific phenotypes, and drive disease evolution. These groups display different prognoses, with groups having SF3B1 mutations being associated with better survival. Specific co-mutation patterns account for clinical heterogeneity within SF3B1- and SRSF2-related MDS. MDS with complex karyotype and/or TP53 gene abnormalities and MDS with acute leukemia-like mutations show the poorest prognosis. MDS with 5q deletion are clustered into two distinct groups according to the number of mutated genes and/or presence of TP53 mutations. By integrating 63 clinical and genomic variables, we define a novel prognostic model that generates personally tailored predictions of survival. The predicted and observed outcomes correlate well in internal cross-validation and in an independent validation.
