## Question

Normal pulse ox in children

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about normal pulse oximetry (SpO2) values in children, including how to define "normal", how age and altitude modify expected ranges, and how to interpret values near commonly used thresholds like 90% and 94%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why "normal" varies by setting. Then, I should verify what high-quality sources say about sea-level norms in healthy children. Next, I will examine how altitude shifts the distribution of SpO2 and what percentiles are appropriate. After that, I need to consider age-specific issues, especially newborns and infants. Finally, I will integrate device limitations and provide practical interpretation thresholds with caveats about accuracy and equity, especially in children with darker skin tones [^b6967ce8] [^2a849c64].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because "normal" depends on whether we are talking about healthy, well children at sea level versus children with acute illness, chronic disease, or those living at altitude. I should confirm that most authoritative pediatric guidance frames normoxia as SpO2 ≥ 94% at sea level, while recognizing that population distributions show a lower tail around the 2.5th percentile that can dip toward 92% in some healthy cohorts, and that altitude systematically lowers the entire distribution downward by roughly 4–6% at 2500–3000 m compared with sea level [^b6967ce8] [^1d7e36f4] [^ab7f4ef0].

> Next, I should review direct evidence in healthy children at sea level. Wait, let me verify the school-aged data: in a cohort of 246 healthy children in Los Angeles, the mean SpO2 was 98.7% with a range of 97–100%, suggesting that values of 95–96% are atypical and should raise suspicion for underlying disease in this setting, which aligns with the notion that ≥ 97% is common in healthy, sea-level children [^ab28a653]. I should also confirm that GINA recommends ≥ 95% as normal in children at sea level and flags < 92% as predictive of hospitalization risk during asthma exacerbations, reinforcing a higher operational "normal" in acute care contexts [^e5cd9e64].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single universal cutoff. I need to check how altitude shifts the distribution. In Quito at 2810 m, the median SpO2 in healthy children was 94.5% with a 2.5th percentile of 90%, indicating that 90% sits at the extreme low end of "normal" for that altitude, and that using a 90% threshold there would be overly sensitive and risk false positives if applied indiscriminately [^1d7e36f4]. Similarly, in the Ecuadorian Andes dataset, the 2.5th percentile approximated 90% at 2810 m, supporting an altitude-adapted lower bound rather than a fixed 90% across elevations [^ab7f4ef0]. Earlier work at 1610 m showed mean infant SpO2 around 92–93% with lower limits near 85–86% during sleep, underscoring that even moderate altitude meaningfully depresses expected values [^741e7e25].

> I should double-check the altitude-adjustment models. Meta-regression and adaptive models suggest that at 2500 m the 2.5th percentile is about 90%, and at 2800–3000 m it falls to roughly 88–90%, which is consistent with the Ecuadorian observations and supports using 88–90% as a physiologic lower bound at those altitudes rather than 90% from sea-level guidance [^b061c099]. But wait, what if we apply a sea-level 90% threshold at 2800 m? That would label a substantial fraction of healthy children as "hypoxemic", so I need to ensure we communicate altitude-specific percentiles rather than fixed cutoffs when advising on "normal" ranges [^b061c099].

> Now, I will examine age-specific considerations, especially newborns and infants. Let me think about the newborn transition: in the first minutes of life, expected SpO2 rises from about 60% at 1 minute to 80–85% by 5 minutes, and then gradually toward 85–95% thereafter, so early low readings are expected and must be interpreted in the context of timing and perfusion rather than adult norms [^c9d0852b]. I should confirm that well newborns at moderate altitude in the first 24 hours can have acceptable ranges around 89–97%, which is lower than older infants and reflects transitional physiology and altitude effects [^e8f90432]. For older infants and children, once beyond the neonatal period, the altitude-adjusted distributions described above generally apply, with sea-level children clustering near 97–100% and altitude-resident children shifting downward by about 4–6% on average [^ab28a653] [^1d7e36f4].

> Next, I should review device and measurement limitations that can distort "normal" interpretations. Pulse oximeters tend to overestimate true arterial saturation, especially in the 76–90% range, with bias up to about 6–10% in some pediatric studies, and accuracy worsens with poor perfusion, motion, arrhythmias, and darker skin pigmentation, which can mask true hypoxemia and contribute to occult hypoxemia in Black children [^f01f40a0] [^2a849c64]. I need to ensure we emphasize that a "normal" SpO2 reading does not absolutely exclude hypoxemia, particularly when clinical suspicion is high or the patient has darker skin tone, and that arterial blood gas or CO-oximetry should be considered when decisions hinge on precise oxygenation status [^2a849c64] [^e29e1651].

> Let me synthesize practical interpretation thresholds while keeping these constraints in mind. At sea level in healthy children, SpO2 ≥ 97% is typical, 95–96% is borderline and warrants clinical attention, 92–94% is abnormal and should prompt evaluation, and < 90% is severe hypoxemia requiring urgent action; these align with pediatric asthma guidance and observational data in well children [^e5cd9e64] [^ab28a653]. At 2500–3000 m, the population distribution shifts so that 90% approximates the 2.5th percentile, so values below about 88–90% are concerning and should trigger assessment, whereas 90–92% may be physiologic for some healthy children at altitude and must be interpreted with clinical context [^1d7e36f4] [^b061c099]. For newborns, I should confirm that anything persistently < 90% after the transitional period is abnormal and merits evaluation, while recognizing that early postnatal values and altitude can transiently depress readings [^c9d0852b] [^e8f90432].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating a single number as "normal". The WHO < 90% threshold for oxygen therapy is a treatment trigger for acute illness, not a definition of normal, and it was derived for low-altitude settings; applying it rigidly at altitude or in well children risks misclassification, so I need to emphasize percentiles and clinical correlation rather than a fixed cutoff [^b6967ce8] [^b061c099]. I should also note that in some chronic pediatric conditions, such as sickle cell disease, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is right-shifted, so SpO2 values around 92–93% may correspond to adequate tissue oxygen delivery despite appearing "low" by sea-level norms, reinforcing the need to interpret values in disease-specific context [^75bc88d2].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaways are clear. Normal pulse oximetry in healthy children at sea level is generally ≥ 97%, with 95–96% as a caution zone and < 90% as severe hypoxemia; at 2500–3000 m, the median is about 94–95% with a lower limit around 90%, so values below 88–90% are concerning and should be evaluated; newborns have unique transitional ranges and altitude further modifies expectations in the first 24 hours; and device accuracy limitations, especially in darker skin tones and at lower saturations, mean that clinical judgment and, when necessary, arterial testing should guide decisions rather than SpO2 alone [^ab28a653] [^1d7e36f4] [^b061c099] [^c9d0852b] [^2a849c64] [^f01f40a0].

---

Normal pulse oximetry (SpO2) in healthy children at sea level is **≥ 95%** [^e5cd9e64] [^ab28a653], with most children maintaining 97–100% [^ab28a653]. Values of 90–94% are considered **mild hypoxemia** and warrant clinical assessment, while **< 90%** indicates severe hypoxemia and requires urgent evaluation and oxygen therapy [^b6967ce8] [^a7209588]. At altitude, normal values are lower: about 92–94% at 1,600–1,800 m [^741e7e25] [^e8f90432] and 88–92% at 2,500–3,000 m [^1d7e36f4] [^b061c099]. Newborns have a wider normal range (85–95%) in the first 24 hours, rising to ≥ 95% after 24 hours [^c9d0852b] [^e8f90432]. Pulse oximetry is less accurate at low saturations and in children with darker skin tones, so clinical judgment is essential [^f01f40a0] [^2a849c64].

## Normal pulse oximetry values by age and altitude

| **Age group** | **Altitude** | **Normal spo2 range** |
|-|-|-|
| Children (1 month–12 years) | Sea level | ≥ 95% (typically 97–100%) [^e5cd9e64] [^ab28a653] |
| Children (1 month–12 years) | 1,600–1,800 m | 92–94% [^741e7e25] [^e8f90432] |
| Children (1 month–12 years) | 2,500–3,000 m | 88–92% [^1d7e36f4] [^b061c099] |
| Newborns (0–24 hours) | Sea level | 85–95% (transitional) [^c9d0852b] [^e8f90432] |
| Newborns (> 24 hours) | Sea level | ≥ 95% [^c9d0852b] [^e8f90432] |

## Clinical significance of pulse oximetry values

- **≥ 95%**: Normal oxygen saturation in healthy children at sea level [^e5cd9e64] [^ab28a653].
- **90–94%**: Mild hypoxemia; assess for underlying conditions and monitor closely [^b6967ce8] [^a7209588].
- **< 90%**: Severe hypoxemia; urgent evaluation and oxygen therapy indicated [^b6967ce8] [^a7209588].

---

## Factors influencing pulse oximetry accuracy

Several factors can affect **pulse oximetry accuracy** in children:

- **Altitude**: Lower atmospheric oxygen reduces SpO2 at higher elevations [^b6967ce8] [^1d7e36f4].
- **Skin pigmentation**: Darker skin tones can cause overestimation of SpO2, risking occult hypoxemia [^2a849c64] [^6d981a1f].
- **Motion artifacts**: Movement can degrade signal quality and accuracy [^475f6d98] [^0813b7e3].
- **Poor perfusion**: Cold extremities or low cardiac output reduce reliability [^475f6d98] [^fc360ccf].
- **Device quality**: Consumer-grade devices may be less accurate than hospital-grade oximeters [^26a5caeb] [^ab71803a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Routine monitoring**: Pulse oximetry is recommended for children with respiratory symptoms, chronic lung disease, or during procedures requiring sedation [^e5cd9e64] [^8e7813f7].
- **Oxygen therapy**: Initiate oxygen when SpO2 < 90% at sea level, adjusting for altitude and clinical context [^b6967ce8] [^a7209588].
- **Newborn screening**: Pulse oximetry is used to screen for critical congenital heart disease, with normal values ≥ 95% after 24 hours [^d85603a5] [^38a5ca54].

---

## Limitations of pulse oximetry

Pulse oximetry has important limitations: it does not detect **hyperoxia**, which can cause oxidative injury, especially in preterm infants [^ed40a07b]; it cannot identify **COHb or MetHb**, which can yield falsely normal or inaccurate readings [^ef54af80]; and it may miss brief desaturations due to averaging, potentially underestimating hypoxemia burden [^8125e8ba].

---

Normal SpO2 in healthy children at sea level is **≥ 95%**, with lower ranges expected at altitude and in newborns. Values < 90% indicate severe hypoxemia and require urgent care, but clinicians must consider device limitations and skin tone–related bias when interpreting readings [^b6967ce8] [^2a849c64].

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^8c6e4171]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

We addressed the question "Do newborns, children and adolescents aged up to 19 years have lower mortality rates, lower morbidity, and shorter length of stay where pulse oximeters are used to inform diagnosis and treatment (excluding operative surgical care) compared with where pulse oximeters are not used?" Our secondary research question was, "What proportion of newborns, children and adolescents are given oxygen therapy where pulse oximeters are used compared with where pulse oximeters are not used".

Studies were included if they recruited newborns, children and/or adolescents aged up to 19 years, presenting for the first time to a hospital, emergency department (ED), or primary care facility, regardless of setting. Studies assessing pulse oximeters in screening healthy newborns before discharge, or monitoring, for example, during surgery were excluded.

We included studies with at least one intervention group in which a pulse oximeter reading was taken and at least one control group in which pulse oximetry was not used. We included studies reporting mortality, morbidity (illness severity, ie, pneumonia severity scores, disability at discharge) and length of stay. Descriptive studies were excluded.

We systematically searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane, Medion, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL and WHO Global Health Library, with no language restrictions (Search terms — see online supplementary appendix I). Study references were checked. Websites of non-governmental organisations, health organisations and development organisations were searched for unpublished reports using 'pulse oximeter' and 'pulse oximetry'. Topic experts were contacted for additional materials.

Studies that were not relevant based on title/abstract were excluded. We read the remaining studies' full texts and excluded those not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. All full texts were read by a second person, and if inclusion was uncertain, a third. We extracted data using a tailored Cochrane data collection form and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane ACROBAT tool.

We intended to calculate risk ratios, mean differences and CI's, and if possible pool data within subgroups and conduct a meta-analysis. However, due to the small number of studies and the study design/outcome variability this was not possible. Instead we narratively describe the evidence using a structured approach while drawing insights where possible, a standard strategy in such situations.

Pulse oximetry is routinely used in hospitals in high-income settings, but its theoretical basis is often poorly understood. This paper summarises the physiological background, technological basis and limitations of pulse oximetry.

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^675be7fc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Pulse oximeters are routinely used in high-income countries and international organisations are investing in programmes to promote pulse oximetry in low-income countries, but there is little evidence, from any region or setting, on the impact or optimal use of pulse oximeters when children present to a health facility. More research is needed on how pulse oximetry impacts health outcomes and services, how knowledge of SaO 2 should be integrated with other clinical findings, whether defining 'one-size fits all' thresholds is possible or even useful, for hypoxaemia and in diagnosing/monitoring specific diseases, and how pulse oximetry affects resource utilisation. Such pragmatic research could accompany pulse oximeter implementation efforts and would provide much needed evidence.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^a7209588]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Implications for policy and practice

Although there are outstanding questions regarding the effectiveness, acceptability, cost, and health systems implications of increasing the use of pulse oximetry in primary care and outpatient settings and broadening the criteria for referral to hospital, there are some findings that can be acted on now.

First, pulse oximetry has important risk assessment value to health-care workers that should be more fully used. Hypoxaemia should be recognised as an important danger sign in both hospital and pre-hospital clinical guidelines, with severe hypoxaemia (SpO 2 < 90%), moderate hypoxaemia (SpO 2 90–93%), and failed readings all associated with substantially higher risk of death than normoxaemia (SpO 2 ≥ 94%).

Second, detection of moderate hypoxaemia (SpO 2 90–93%) or a failed reading in a child presenting to a primary care facility should prompt three actions: careful clinical reassessment; consideration of referral to a higher-level facility; and close follow-up within and after leaving the facility.

Third, governments and other implementing agencies seeking to expand the use of pulse oximetry in primary care and outpatient settings should understand that it is one tool that exists alongside other clinical tools and processes, not a standalone technological intervention. For pulse oximetry to be adopted and have impact, health-care workers will need ongoing support to integrate it into their workflows for the benefit of patients and current workforce shortages will need to be addressed.

Fourth, reducing preventable mortality from pneumonia and other severe acute illnesses requires better identification of severely ill children in the community and pathways for them to receive quality, context-appropriate care. Although pulse oximetry might be a valuable adjunctive tool for the identification of severely ill children presenting to small facilities, we also need greater efforts to improve referral pathways and quality of care in general hospitals, and capacity to follow up children in the community.

Fifth, pulse oximeters are an essential medical device and should be more accessible globally, particularly in poor and rural areas. Increasing oximeter accessibility requires greater availability of oximeters that are affordable, robust, easy to use, and appropriate for the target population (including infants and children and people with deeply pigmented skin tones).

Pulse oximetry measurements in children — operational parameters and context factors are specified. Averaging time for pulse oximetry measurements should take into account the age of the child, the underlying respiratory condition, and the current clinical scenario. A duration of 2 weeks defines chronicity of hypoxemia in a child, and hypoxemia in a child should account for anticipated Spo2 measurement alterations according to altitude. More advanced evaluation with polysomnography may be needed on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the treating clinician.

### Neonatal and pediatric pulse oximetry [^89e3b54e]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

The pulse oximeter has become a vital instrument in the care of infants and children with cardiopulmonary disease. Recent advances in pulse oximetry technology have improved some aspects of pulse oximeter performance. However, the reliability, accuracy, and clinical utility of pulse oximetry remain problematic in some types of patients under certain conditions. Improved signal processing technology has substantially improved the ability of certain oximeters to work reliably under conditions of poor perfusion and motion artifact. There is a growing body of evidence describing the effect of pulse oximeter utilization on processes and outcomes. This article describes the principles, limitations, current state of oximetry technology, and the impact of oximetry data and alarms on diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

### Pulse oximetry in pediatric practice [^475f6d98]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The introduction of pulse oximetry in clinical practice has allowed for simple, noninvasive, and reasonably accurate estimation of arterial oxygen saturation. Pulse oximetry is routinely used in the emergency department, the pediatric ward, and in pediatric intensive and perioperative care. However, clinically relevant principles and inherent limitations of the method are not always well understood by health care professionals caring for children. The calculation of the percentage of arterial oxyhemoglobin is based on the distinct characteristics of light absorption in the red and infrared spectra by oxygenated versus deoxygenated hemoglobin and takes advantage of the variation in light absorption caused by the pulsatility of arterial blood. Computation of oxygen saturation is achieved with the use of calibration algorithms. Safe use of pulse oximetry requires knowledge of its limitations, which include motion artifacts, poor perfusion at the site of measurement, irregular rhythms, ambient light or electromagnetic interference, skin pigmentation, nail polish, calibration assumptions, probe positioning, time lag in detecting hypoxic events, venous pulsation, intravenous dyes, and presence of abnormal hemoglobin molecules. In this review we describe the physiologic principles and limitations of pulse oximetry, discuss normal values, and highlight its importance in common pediatric diseases, in which the principle mechanism of hypoxemia is ventilation/perfusion mismatch (eg, asthma exacerbation, acute bronchiolitis, pneumonia) versus hypoventilation (eg, laryngotracheitis, vocal cord dysfunction, foreign-body aspiration in the larynx or trachea). Additional technologic advancements in pulse oximetry and its incorporation into evidence-based clinical algorithms will improve the efficiency of the method in daily pediatric practice.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^b6967ce8]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

How should different levels of hypoxaemia be interpreted?

Normal blood oxygen levels exist on a continuum and vary by altitude. At sea level, typical arterial blood oxygen saturation is broadly accepted to be equal to or greater than 94% for all age groups (partial pressure of oxygen ∼75–100 mm Hg). Data from healthy child and adult populations show that typical arterial blood oxygen saturation in the 5th centile is approximately 92–96% at sea level and approximately 88–92% at 2500 m above sea level. Data from children in hospital with pneumonia show that hypoxaemia on admission to hospital is the strongest predictor of death, with the risk of death varying between studies and settings, but proportional to the severity of hypoxaemia, and elevated even at moderate hypoxaemia of 90–93%. Although the prevalence of hypoxaemia is decreased in non-pneumonia conditions, such as malaria and meningitis, the presence and severity of hypoxaemia is similarly associated with death, as hypoxaemic respiratory failure is a complication of many critical systemic illnesses.,

To better compare the risk of death across different levels of hypoxaemia and for different child populations (ie, children aged < 12 years), we conducted a secondary analysis of diverse study datasets, which include two inpatient study populations (Nigeriaand Uganda [unpublished]) and four primary care or outpatient care study populations (Nigeria, Malawi, Malawi, and Bangladesh), all in low-altitude settings (table). All studies provided data on SpO 2 from the time of patient presentation, as well as clinical outcome data assessed at discharge or 14–21 days follow-up (see appendix pp 2–6 for individual study details). Using aggregated data on SpO 2 on presentation and mortality, we calculated the relative odds of death for different SpO 2 ranges versus an SpO 2 of 98–100%.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^b7face2b]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Since pulse oximeters were invented in the 1970s, they have become indispensable tools for assessing blood oxygen levels in emergency departments, operating theatres, high dependency and intensive care units, and hospital wards. Now recognised as an essential medical device by WHO, pulse oximeters have been championed by the safe surgery movement, and gained a spotlight during the COVID-19 pandemic for detection of hypoxaemia (ie, low blood oxygen levels) even among patients at home. Pulse oximetry is particularly important for paediatric hospital care, with WHO guidelines (ie, the WHO pocketbook of hospital care for children and oxygen therapy in children) recognising hypoxaemia as an indicator of severe illness associated with a range of respiratory, systemic, and post-surgical conditions. These guidelines recommend pulse oximetry for all children with emergency or respiratory signs, recognising the crucial role of pulse oximetry in the identification of hypoxaemia and guidance of oxygen therapy. The guidelines also recommend oxygen therapy for all children with an SpO 2 of less than 90%. Recent WHO-commissioned reviews have further emphasised hypoxaemia as a major risk factor for death and highlighted the importance of pulse oximetry in risk stratification.

However, there is little clarity on the role of pulse oximetry and interpretation of SpO 2 outside of hospital settings, particularly when used for triage and risk stratification, rather than only to guide whether or not to give oxygen. The WHO integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) 2014 chart booklet, the key clinical guideline for use in primary care facilities, contains a single footnoted mention of pulse oximetry: "if pulse oximeter is available, determine oxygen saturation and refer if < 90%". The updated 2019 IMCI chart booklet for young infants makes no mention of pulse oximetry or hypoxaemia.

In this Viewpoint, we review existing evidence and reanalyse data from patients admitted to secondary-level health facilities and patients receiving care at outpatient primary or secondary care facilities to explore three related questions. First, how should different levels of hypoxaemia in children be interpreted, particularly in outpatient settings? Second, what is the role of pulse oximetry screening for children in the outpatient setting? Third, can a particular SpO 2 cutoff guide risk-stratification and triage decision-making?

### Pulse oxygen saturation values in a healthy school-aged population [^ab28a653]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the normal values of oxygen saturation in a healthy school-aged pediatric population.

Methods

This study enrolled students in grades K-8 at an elementary and middle school in Los Angeles. Although all students were invited to participate, only pulse oximetry results among healthy students were included. Healthy students were defined as not having asthma, bronchitis, a recent cold or pneumonia within the past week, any chronic lung disease, or any heart condition.

Results

Two hundred forty-eight students participated in the study, and 246 students met the inclusion criteria. Pulse oxygen saturation values ranged from 97% to 100% with a mean of 98.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.6%-99.8%) and median of 99%. The distribution of measured pulse oximetry values were 97%: 16 (95% CI, 6.5%), 98%: 45 (95% CI, 18.3%), 99%: 184 (95% CI, 74.8%), and 100%: 1 (95% CI, 0.4%).

Conclusions

Although the conventional wisdom is that pulse oximetry values 95% or greater are normal, these data suggest that the normal oxygen saturation range should be between 97% and 100%. Values of 95% and 96% should increase clinical suspicion of underlying disease.

Screening with pulse oximetry for critical congenital heart defects is the subject of much recent debate. This review will explore the recent evidence for screening and discuss how implementation of screening might be best achieved.

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^3c6f4671]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

In absence of clear guidelines, opinion differs on which thresholds should indicate hypoxaemia and prompt admission, referral, oxygen therapy or other treatments. When emergency physicians were surveyed, there was considerable variability in the lowest SaO 2 for which they would discharge a 2-year-old with pneumonia and a 10-month-old with bronchiolitis. Maneker et al and Mower et al, defined low SaO 2 as ≤ 92% and < 95% respectively, thus reducing results comparability.

Threshold choice can substantially impact health system outcomes; thus in Schuh et al 'srandomised clinical trial of infants (excluded from this review because all children received pulse oximeter readings), admission rates were sensitive to small saturation differences: 41% of children in the control group were admitted within 72 h versus 25% of children whose displayed SaO 2 s were artificially increased by 3%.

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^b37c29ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Do newborns, children and adolescents up to 19 years have lower mortality rates, lower morbidity and shorter length of stay in health facilities where pulse oximeters are used to inform diagnosis and treatment (excluding surgical care) compared with health facilities where pulse oximeters are not used?

Design

Studies were obtained for this systematic literature review by systematically searching the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane, Medion, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, WHO Global Health Library, international health organisation and NGO websites, and study references.

Patients

Children 0–19 years presenting for the first time to hospitals, emergency departments or primary care facilities.

Interventions

Included studies compared outcomes where pulse oximeters were used for diagnosis and/or management, with outcomes where pulse oximeters were not used. Main outcome measures: mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and treatment and management changes.

Results

The evidence is low quality and hypoxaemia definitions varied across studies, but the evidence suggests pulse oximeter use with children can reduce mortality rates (when combined with improved oxygen administration) and length of emergency department stay, increase admission of children with previously unrecognised hypoxaemia, and change physicians' decisions on illness severity, diagnosis and treatment. Pulse oximeter use generally increased resource utilisation.

Conclusions

As international organisations are investing in programmes to increase pulse oximeter use in low-income settings, more research is needed on the optimal use of pulse oximeters (eg, appropriate oxygen saturation thresholds), and how pulse oximeter use affects referral and admission rates, length of stay, resource utilisation and health outcomes.

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^b8edcbb5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic

Hypoxaemia is a common complication of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, asthma and sepsis and is associated with increased risk of death in children.
Pulse oximeters are a low-cost intervention that could help reduce child mortality by more effectively diagnosing and monitoring children with hypoxaemia.
Pulse oximeters are often not available or not used in low-income settings, but several international projects aim to increase their availability and use.

What this study adds

The evidence, while low quality, suggests pulse oximeter use may improve children's mortality rates, morbidity measurement, hospital length of stay and admission of hypoxic children.
In the included studies, pulse oximeters were often important for physician's clinical decision-making about children's treatment and management, and their use generally increased resource utilisation.
More research is needed on optimal thresholds to use for hypoxaemia definitions, and on how pulse oximeter use affects resource utilisation and impacts health outcomes.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^63eaf87f]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric oxygenation targets — normoxia, or a pulse oximetry reading of 94% or higher, is often the recommended target for oxygen therapy in children, with current targets > 92% for pneumonia and > 90% for asthma if using the 2007 NHLBI guideline, or 94–98% under the 2019 British guideline. For acute lower respiratory tract infection (bronchiolitis), burden data show about 128,000 hospitalizations of children < 2 y old annually in the United States at an estimated cost of $1.73 billion with a 30% increase over 9 y; hospitalization rates decreased from 17.9 to 14.9 per 1,000 persons from 2000 to 2009, while admissions for high-risk children increased 34% and mechanical ventilation use increased 21%. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend permissive hypoxemia of an oxygen saturation of 90% for children with lower respiratory tract infections. A double-blind randomized equivalence trial using 2 targets (< 90% modified vs ≥ 94% standard) reported that the modified target of ≥ 90% is as safe and clinically effective as ≥ 94% and observed shorter times to fit to discharge (44.2 vs 30.2 h, P < .001) and to actual discharge (50.9 vs 40.9 h, P = 0.003).

### British thoracic society guideline for diagnosing and monitoring paediatric sleep-disordered breathing [^f0711934]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory sleep studies, without comorbidities), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to view a 4% oxygen desaturation index cut-off of > 4/hour and/or a 3% oxygen desaturation index cut-off of > 7/hour as suggestive of an abnormality when analyzing and interpreting pulse oximetry traces in ≥ 2 years old pediatric patients. Include baseline mean oxygen saturations of < 95%, desaturations to < 90%, and clustering and depth of desaturation events in pulse oximetry interpretation. Consider obtaining a cardiorespiratory sleep study if one pulse oximetry parameter is deemed abnormal while the other parameters are normal.

### Newborn pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects [^3170e33b]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) European Region is developing a new pocket book for primary health care for children and adolescents in Europe. This article is part of a series of reviews, which aim to summarize the existing recommendations and the most recent evidence on preventive interventions applied to children under five years of age to inform the WHO editorial group to make recommendations for health promotion in primary health care. In this article, we looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence addressing the effectiveness of pulse oximetry effective for detecting critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) in newborns. We also looked at the impact of timing of oximetry and the site of testing (post-ductal versus pre- and post-ductal) in the accuracy of screening, and at the potential harms and limitations of pulse oximetry screening.

Why is screening for critical congenital heart defects important?

CCHD is defined as any cardiac lesion from which infants die or require surgery or cardiac catheterization within the first 28 days of life to prevent death or severe end-organ damage. Early detection of CCHD before acute cardiovascular collapse leads to improved cardiopulmonary and neurological outcomes. However, most newborns are asymptomatic at birth. Newborn screening for CCHD can help identifying some cases to allow prompt diagnosis and treatment, and may prevent disability or fatal outcome.

### Association of race with pulse oximetry accuracy in hospitalized children [^2a849c64]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, 21.1% of Black children experienced arterial hypoxemia despite a normal Sp 2 reading; occult hypoxemia occurred more frequently than in White children. Among Sp 2 -Sa 2 pairs, the odds of the Sp 2 reading failing to detect arterial hypoxemia were more than twice as great if the pair had come from a Black child. Underrecognition and undertreatment of hypoxemia in Black children may contribute to racial disparities in respiratory illness outcomes. We observed higher mean pulse oximeter bias among all children than has been reported in adults.

This study has limitations. Because pediatric ABG values are rarely obtained outside critical care settings, all study patients were likely critically ill. Clinically significant changes could have occurred in the 10-minute window between obtaining Sp 2 and Sa 2 values. Black children required more respiratory support than White children, potentially confounding the results, although the findings were not different in adjusted analysis. In addition, self-reported race encompasses many phenotypes. Future research may explore more nuanced associations between pulse oximetry accuracy and skin pigmentation and whether pulse oximeter bias is associated with outcomes. Further evaluation of racial differences in pediatric pulse oximetry accuracy in children and investigation of potential clinical outcomes are warranted.

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^597cffd6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Do newborns, children and adolescents up to 19years have lower mortality rates, lower morbidity and shorter length of stay in health facilities where pulse oximeters are used to inform diagnosis and treatment (excluding surgical care) compared with health facilities where pulse oximeters are not used?

Design

Studies were obtained for this systematic literature review by systematically searching the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane, Medion, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, WHO Global Health Library, international health organisation and NGO websites, and study references.

Patients

Children 0-19years presenting for the first time to hospitals, emergency departments or primary care facilities.

Interventions

Included studies compared outcomes where pulse oximeters were used for diagnosis and/or management, with outcomes where pulse oximeters were not used.

Main Outcome Measures

mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and treatment and management changes.

Results

The evidence is low quality and hypoxaemia definitions varied across studies, but the evidence suggests pulse oximeter use with children can reduce mortality rates (when combined with improved oxygen administration) and length of emergency department stay, increase admission of children with previously unrecognised hypoxaemia, and change physicians' decisions on illness severity, diagnosis and treatment. Pulse oximeter use generally increased resource utilisation.

Conclusions

As international organisations are investing in programmes to increase pulse oximeter use in low-income settings, more research is needed on the optimal use of pulse oximeters (eg, appropriate oxygen saturation thresholds), and how pulse oximeter use affects referral and admission rates, length of stay, resource utilisation and health outcomes.

### Effect of oximetry on hospitalization in bronchiolitis: a randomized clinical trial [^79c86128]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Routine use of pulse oximetry has been associated with changes in bronchiolitis management and may have lowered the hospitalization threshold for patients with bronchiolitis.

Objective

To examine if infants with bronchiolitis whose displayed oximetry measurements have been artificially elevated 3 percentage points above true values experience hospitalization rates at least 15% lower compared with infants with true values displayed.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial conducted from 2008 to 2013 in a tertiary-care pediatric emergency department in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Participants were 213 otherwise healthy infants aged 4 weeks to 12 months with mild to moderate bronchiolitis and true oxygen saturations of 88% or higher.

Interventions

Pulse oximetry measurements with true saturation values displayed or with altered saturation values displayed that have been increased 3 percentage points above true values.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was hospitalization within 72 hours, defined as inpatient admission within this interval or active hospital care for greater than 6 hours. Secondary outcomes included the use of supplemental oxygen in the emergency department, level of physician agreement with discharge from the emergency department, length of emergency department stay, and unscheduled visits for bronchiolitis within 72 hours.

Results

Forty-four of 108 patients (41%) in the true oximetry group and 26 of 105 (25%) in the altered oximetry group were hospitalized within 72 hours (difference, 16% [95% CI for the difference, 3.6% to 28.4%]; P = 0.005). Using the emergency department physician as a random effect, the primary treatment effect remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.6 to 10.5]; P = 0.009). None of the secondary outcomes were significantly different between the groups. There were 23 of 108 (21.3%) subsequent unscheduled medical visits for bronchiolitis in the true oximetry group and 15 of 105 (14.3%) in the altered oximetry group (difference, 7% [95% CI, -0.3% to 0.2%]; P = 0.18).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among infants presenting to an emergency department with mild to moderate bronchiolitis, those with an artificially elevated pulse oximetry reading were less likely to be hospitalized within 72 hours or to receive active hospital care for more than 6 hours than those with unaltered oximetry readings. This suggests that oxygen saturation should not be the only factor in the decision to admit, and its use may need to be reevaluated.

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^d711e5de]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Randomly assigning health facilities to pulse oximeter introduction (with training) or no pulse oximetry could provide robust data on resource use (admissions, diagnostic tools, treatments, referrals, length of stay), health outcomes (mortality, morbidity, re-presentations), and which thresholds, if any, would be most effective for treatment initiation, if studies were sufficiently large. Such pragmatic studies could be done alongside implementation programmes and could elucidate whether pulse oximetry impacts resource use and health outcomes within cost-effectiveness analyses.

If evidence suggests pulse oximetry increases resource utilisation then health workers, facility managers and public health practitioners would need to weigh cost-benefit trade-offs between using scarce resources on pulse oximetry or on other interventions. Context-specific formal cost-effectiveness analyses could be performed to help address these issues but these are rarely done when technologies are introduced into low-income countries' health systems. Such research should be independent and transparent evaluations feeding into wider, evidence-based and inclusive processes for decision-making on resource allocation within health systems.

More research is also needed on the best ways to use pulse oximeters, particularly concerning SaO 2 thresholds.

In high-income settings, disease management guidelines rarely recommend SaO 2 thresholds for diagnosing, evaluating or monitoring children. When specific SaO 2 thresholds are recommended, they differ across organisations, even though WHO's 2012 Recommendations for Management of Common Childhood Conditions provide clear guidance that oxygen be administered if SaO 2 < 90% (for children at ≤ 2500 m). Conversely, the Canadian Paediatric Society warns "it is important to recognize that setting arbitrary thresholds for oxygen therapy will influence admission rates". Setting thresholds is complicated because pulse oximeter results may not be considered in isolation from clinical findings, SaO 2 can naturally fluctuate over a day, and studies show that 'healthy' SaO 2 differs by age and altitude. A few studies have investigated whether outcomes are comparable when thresholds higher than WHO's < 90% are used: Cunningham et al, found cough resolution time in children with bronchiolitis was equivalent when a < 94% or < 90% threshold was used for oxygen therapy while Lazzerini et al, found that hypoxaemia predicted elevated mortality risk in children with acute lower respiratory infection when a < 92% or < 90% hypoxaemia threshold was used. It is therefore perhaps unexpected that no studies have examined health system consequences of implementing the WHO guidance of using SaO 2 < 90% thresholds.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^aaa62f70]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Pulse oximeters are essential for assessing blood oxygen levels in emergency departments, operating theatres, and hospital wards. However, although the role of pulse oximeters in detecting hypoxaemia and guiding oxygen therapy is widely recognised, their role in primary care settings is less clear. In this Viewpoint, we argue that pulse oximeters have a crucial role in risk-stratification in both hospital and primary care or outpatient settings. Our reanalysis of hospital and primary care data from diverse low-income and middle-income settings shows elevated risk of death for children with moderate hypoxaemia (ie, peripheral oxygen saturations [SpO 2] 90–93%) and severe hypoxaemia (ie, SpO 2 < 90%). We suggest that moderate hypoxaemia in the primary care setting should prompt careful clinical re-assessment, consideration of referral, and close follow-up. We provide practical guidance to better support front-line health-care workers to use pulse oximetry, including rethinking traditional binary SpO 2 thresholds and promoting a more nuanced approach to identification and emergency treatment of the severely ill child.

### Racial and skin color mediated disparities in pulse oximetry in infants and young children [^e29e1651]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Race-based and skin pigmentation-related inaccuracies in pulse oximetry have recently been highlighted in several large electronic health record-based retrospective cohort studies across diverse patient populations and healthcare settings. Overestimation of oxygen saturation by pulse oximeters, particularly in hypoxic states, is disparately higher in Black compared to other racial groups. Compared to adult literature, pediatric studies are relatively few and mostly reliant on birth certificates or maternal race-based classification of comparison groups. Neonates, infants, and young children are particularly susceptible to the adverse life-long consequences of hypoxia and hyperoxia. Successful neonatal resuscitation, precise monitoring of preterm and term neonates with predominantly lung pathology, screening for congenital heart defects, and critical decisions on home oxygen, ventilator support and medication therapies, are only a few examples of situations that are highly reliant on the accuracy of pulse oximetry. Undetected hypoxia, especially if systematically different in certain racial groups may delay appropriate therapies and may further perpetuate health care disparities. The role of biological factors that may differ between racial groups, particularly skin pigmentation that may contribute to biased pulse oximeter readings needs further evaluation. Developmental and maturational changes in skin physiology and pigmentation, and its interaction with the operating principles of pulse oximetry need further study. Importantly, clinicians should recognize the limitations of pulse oximetry and use additional objective measures of oxygenation (like co-oximetry measured arterial oxygen saturation) where hypoxia is a concern.

### Oxygen saturation ranges for healthy newborns within 24 hours at 1800 M [^e8f90432]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Proper use of pulse oximetry to guide oxygen therapy relies on knowledge of normal oxygen saturation (SpO 2) values for a given population.
Based on available evidence, it appears that well term infants born at moderate altitude should have SpO 2 values of ≥ 92% after the first 24 hours.
The optimal SpO 2 for well newborns within 24 hours of life and for well preterm infants born at moderate altitude is unknown.

What this study adds?

This is the largest study of SpO 2 ranges for well preterm infants at moderate altitude.
This study suggests that a SpO 2 range of 89%–97% is suitable for well term and preterm infants within 24 hours at 1800 m.
This study provides important data about SpO 2 in the first 24 hours, which are useful as discharge postdelivery occurs within 24 hours in many low-income countries.

Methods and evidence base for normal oxygenation thresholds: To define hypoxemia, the panel conducted a systematic search that identified 1,711 articles and selected 31 studies that measured oxygenation in healthy children to inform decision making; for analysis, children were categorized as younger than 1 year old or 1 year and older.

### The use of pulse oximetry to detect congenital heart disease [^c37a9bd0]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether pulse oximetry can be used as a screening test to detect congenital heart disease (CHD) in otherwise well newborns before nursery discharge.

Methods

Births at Lakeland Regional Medical Center (LRMC) who met inclusion criteria, had a single pulse oximeter reading before discharge. A normal reading was considered to be > 94%. Abnormal readings were repeated on a different extremity and if still abnormal, an echocardiography was performed. The number of children with CHD and the number of echocardiograms were compared with the previous year at LRMC.

Results

There were 2114 infants enrolled, 88 echocardiograms (3.8%) were performed, and 43 were abnormal (yield = 48.9%), of which 12 required management (13.6%). The control group consisted of 2851 births, producing 108 echocardiograms (3.8%), 42 of which were abnormal (38.9%), and 13 required management (12.0%). No comparisons were significant. During both years, 3 children with cyanotic CHD were born. Routine pulse oximetry failed to detect a child with total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Not a single normal echocardiogram was generated by the study.

Conclusion

Routine pulse oximetry was nearly 100% specific for detecting cyanotic CHD; as a result there was no increase in the number of echocardiograms. Routine pulse oximetry did detect a child who might not have been detected otherwise but failed to detect one that should have been detected.

### Don't use continuous pulse oximetry routinely in children with acute respiratory illness unless they are on supplemental oxygen… [^2703fdc5]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

The utility of continuous pulse oximetry in pediatric patients with acute respiratory illness is not well established. Use of continuous pulse oximetry has been previously associated with increased admission rates and increase length of stay. The clinical benefit of pulse oximetry is not validated or well documented.

### The use of pulse oximetry to exclude pneumonia in children [^cf443d75]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether pulse oximetry alone or in conjunction with the clinical examination is predictive of pneumonia in children who present to the emergency department with respiratory complaints. A retrospective comparison of children with radiographic pneumonia with children with respiratory complaints and negative chest radiography was used. The study took place in an emergency department of a large academic, tertiary care hospital. All children less than 24 months of age who presented with a respiratory complaint and underwent chest radiography during a 1-year period were included. Charts of children with radiographic pneumonia were compared with charts of children without pneumonia, retrospectively. Data abstracted onto data collection forms included: pulse oximetry measurement, vital signs, general appearance, lung examination, and final radiology interpretation of chest radiographs. Pneumonia was defined as a chest radiograph showing any opacity consistent with pneumonia as read by a board-prepared or -certified radiologist. A total of 803 children qualified for the study. Radiograph interpretations were available for 762, and 10.5% were found to have radiographic pneumonia. The median pulse oximetry reading of children with radiographic pneumonia was 97% (interquartile range 95th-98th percentile) compared with 98% (interquartile range 96th-99th percentile) in the control group. Forty-five percent (35 of 78) of the children with radiographic pneumonia showed oxygen saturations of 98% or higher with greater than 10% (8 of 78) displaying oxygen saturations of 100%. By using logistic regression, pulse oximetry was not found to be a statistically significant predictive variable for radiographic pneumonia. Pulse oximetry could not be used to rule out the presence of radiographic pneumonia in children less than 2 years of age who presented with respiratory complaints.

### Reducing global inequities in medical oxygen access: the Lancet global health commission on medical oxygen security [^fcd8b26e]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Although pulse oximetry's role is clear for acutely unwell patients in hospital, its role in guiding risk assessment and referrals in outpatient and primary health-care settings has not been clear. Primary health-care guidelines provide little information about how to use pulse oximetry or interpret SpO 2 readings. WHO's 2014 Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines recommended measuring oxygen saturation in children aged 2–59 months with cough or difficulty breathing "if a pulse oximeter is available", with referral to a higher-level facility if SpO 2 is less than 90%.WHO's 2024 revision of the pneumonia guidelines includes hypoxaemia as a danger sign for children with pneumonia, and suggests that in the absence of pulse oximetry, signs of respiratory distress should be assessed as an alternative. However, clinical signs do not effectively identify sick children with hypoxaemia at high risk of mortality. The WHO revised guidelines did not adopt the guideline review group's advice that pulse oximetry should be available at primary health care; rather, more evidence about the feasibility and implementation challenges was requested. A potential explanation for why hypoxaemia was omitted from the guidelines is debate about whether pulse oximetry is cost-effective in primary health care, and in which populations. Some data suggest that including pulse oximetry in the IMCI guidelines would be highly cost-effective: a modelling study suggested cost-effectiveness as low as $2·97–52·92 per DALY averted, and in a trial in Ethiopia, pulse oximetry was associated with a cost of $25·72 per severe case of paediatric pneumonia detected. However, the cost-effectiveness of pulse oximetry against morbidity or mortality outcomes during real-world implementation in primary care has not been shown.

### Effect of skin tone on the accuracy of the estimation of arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry: a systematic review [^6d981a1f]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Retrospective studies contributed the greatest proportion of participants and paired measurements to this review and all but one of them reported inaccuracies related to ethnicity (Supplementary Table S4; Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4). Although findings from retrospective studies come with the caveat of interpretation from large databases that were not designed with this analysis in mind, they provide an important body of evidence that is difficult to ignore. All of these studies were conducted in high-income countries where the majority of the population have light skin tones. The major finding in this cohort of studies relates to the incidence of occult hypoxaemia (an important clinical metric) with an incidence of up to 21.5% in Black patients. Most studies reported an occult hypoxaemia incidence 25–75% higher in Black compared with White patients, with other ethnic groups having a 25–50% higher incidence. Furthermore, error and bias in readings in Black compared with White patients worsened with greater degrees of hypoxaemia, especially in the clinically important SaO 2 range of 85–88% where deterioration can be rapid.

Only nine studies exclusively enrolled children, with a total of 6121 participants. There were no healthy volunteer studies of children. Six of the nine studies reported skin tone-related inaccuracies. Given the low overall number of children, it is difficult to draw clear conclusions, but inaccuracies were commonly reported.

### Pulse oximetry in the management of children in the PICU [^b080524a]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

The noninvasive and continuous nature of pulse oximetry is a considerable asset inpatient monitoring in the PICU. Its use in the PICU is constantly challenged by the combined presence of vigorous body motion and poor peripheral circulation, conditions which demand special consideration in developing a better pulse oximeter. This is a point of fierce competition among manufacturers.

### Pulse oximetry accuracy in children with dark skin tones: relevance to acute lower respiratory infection care in low-and middle-income countries [^152d9bb6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are the leading post-neonatal cause of death in children under 5 years old. There is a high prevalence of pediatric ALRI-related hypoxemia in low- and middle-income countries. The WHO defines clinically meaningful hypoxemia in children as a SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) < 90%. Multiple studies put this convention into question and found SpO2 of 90% to 92% to be associated with child ALRI mortality. An evolving body of evidence suggests that pulse oximeters systematically overestimate oxygen saturation in individuals with dark skin tones. We conducted a narrative review of pediatric studies evaluating pulse oximeter accuracy in children without COVID-19. Four studies, one prospective, examined pulse oximeter accuracy in children of varying ages with dark skin tones. All studies had limitations that affect their generalizability. There is evidence that certain pulse oximeters may overestimate oxygen saturation in children with dark skin tones. Further prospective research is urgently needed to identify affected populations and clinical implications. Despite recognized challenges, we strongly urge continued and expanded use of pulse oximetry as its use will save lives.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^ba3e80b1]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Summary

Pulse oximeters are essential for assessing blood oxygen levels in emergency departments, operating theatres, and hospital wards. However, although the role of pulse oximeters in detecting hypoxaemia and guiding oxygen therapy is widely recognised, their role in primary care settings is less clear. In this Viewpoint, we argue that pulse oximeters have a crucial role in risk-stratification in both hospital and primary care or outpatient settings. Our reanalysis of hospital and primary care data from diverse low-income and middle-income settings shows elevated risk of death for children with moderate hypoxaemia (ie, peripheral oxygen saturations [SpO 2] 90–93%) and severe hypoxaemia (ie, SpO 2 < 90%). We suggest that moderate hypoxaemia in the primary care setting should prompt careful clinical re-assessment, consideration of referral, and close follow-up. We provide practical guidance to better support front-line health-care workers to use pulse oximetry, including rethinking traditional binary SpO 2 thresholds and promoting a more nuanced approach to identification and emergency treatment of the severely ill child.

### Home oxygen therapy for children. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^ef54af80]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Home oxygen therapy for children — panel definitions of hypoxemia at or near sea level and diagnostic approach: In children younger than 1 year old, hypoxemia was defined as spending 5% of the recording time with Spo2 less than or equal to 90%, or, if intermittent, three independent measurements of Spo2 less than or equal to 90%. In children aged 1 year old and older, hypoxemia was defined as spending 5% of the time with Spo2 less than or equal to 93%, or, if intermittent, three independent measurements less than or equal to 93%. The panel additionally stated that pulse oximetry is sufficient for diagnosing hypoxemia in pediatric patients; on very rare occasions an arterial blood gas for Pao2 may be required when pulse oximetry may not accurately measure Spo2 (e.g., carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, or sickle cell disease), and that intermittent pulse oximetry appears suitable, with three abnormal intermittent measurements diagnosing hypoxemia but normal intermittent measurements not excluding it.

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) monitoring — pulse oximetry can be used but may be unreliable because of nonpulsatile flow. Peripheral pulse oximetry within normal limits is likely believable, whereas a low oximetry reading may not represent true hypoxemia because diminished pulsations are seen in LVAD patients.

### Hypoxaemia definition in childhood based on arterial oxygen saturation obtained with a pulse oximeter: a retrospective study [^5f44024d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Using normal pulse oximetry (SpO 2) values as basis, an oxygen saturation < 98% could reflect hypoxaemia in childhood. The objectives were to define the level of SpO 2 associated with hypoxaemia, the prevalence of SpO 2 < 98% in children suffering from chronic diseases referred to pulmonary function testing units.

Setting

Two university paediatric hospitals.

Design and Patients

We retrospectively selected arterialised blood gas (ABG) analyses and SpO 2 recordings, and further recorded pulmonary function test (PFT) indices (z-scores of forced expiratory volume at 1s (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV 1 /FVC and total lung capacity) of visits with SpO 2 < 98% (Radical-7 pulse oximeter, Masimo).

Results

The Bland-Altman analysis of saturations (n = 1188) showed that SpO 2 overestimated arterialised saturation (bias: +1.3%, precision: ± 1.1%). The 20 ABGs with SpO 2 ≤ 95% showed hypoxaemia (z-score of arterialised pressure of O 2 < -1.96), while 48/74 (65%) ABGs with SpO 2 of 96% or 97% showed hypoxaemia. Three thousand eight hundred twenty-four PFTs were recorded in 2641 children (1186 girls, 1455 boys) with a mean age (± SD) of 12.3 ± 3.5 years. The prevalence of SpO 2 < 98% was 114/2641 children (4.3%, 95% CI 3.6 to 5.2), showing that hypoxaemia was mainly observed in chronic obstructive diseases (96 children). Twelve children had SpO 2 ≤ 95%and all had ventilatory defects (based on international definitions of PFT).

Conclusions

An oxygen saturation ≤ 95%, using the Masimo oximeter, is indicative of hypoxaemia and PFT abnormalities, while oxygen saturation of 96% or 97% indicates possible hypoxaemia. Thus, chronic respiratory insufficiency can confidently be diagnosed if repeated SpO 2 is ≤ 95% using the Masimo oximeter.

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^00f62609]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

In Maneker et al, and Mower et al, pulse oximetry increased resource use through increased admissions and oxygen therapy for children with otherwise undetected hypoxaemia. Pulse oximetry led to reduced resource utilisation in two studies: in Anderson et al two-thirds of children whose illness severity scores changed were then considered less severely ill, and two-thirds of children whose management plans changed were then managed less aggressively; in Choi and Claudius, pulse oximetry led to reduced triage time.

Pulse oximetry could facilitate quicker diagnosis, so effective treatment starts earlier and recovery likelihood increases, reducing future resource use. Oximetry can reduce resource waste by indicating when to end treatment, and by decreasing false-positives. However, in Schroeder et al, hospital stays were on average 1.6 days longer because of pulse oximetry as 26% of children met discharge criteria except needing oxygen according to pulse oximeters. If additional treatment was unnecessary (eg, inappropriate thresholds were used), then resources were wasted (as the authors assumed). However, if pulse oximetry enabled detection of hypoxic children who would not otherwise obtain treatment, then the additional resources were justified.

### Variability of pulse oximetry measurement over 1 year in children with sickle cell disease depends on initial oxygen saturation measurement [^fc9ba4f8]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

A prospective cohort of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) was evaluated to determine the variability of daytime pulse oximetry among three measurements over approximately 1 year. Fifty-eight participants were evaluated. Asymptomatic children with initial oxygen saturation ≤ 92% had a mean range over 1 year of 4.6% (2.1–7.5%). In contrast, asymptomatic children whose oxygen saturation was > 92% had a mean range of 1.9% (0–5.5%). These results suggest, changes in pulse oximetry measurement of approximately 5% may not be clinically significant in otherwise, healthy children with SCD with previous pulse oximetry ≤ 92%.

### Interpretation of oxygen saturation in congenital heart disease: fact and fallacy [^fc360ccf]. Pediatrics in Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Oxygen saturation is the percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen, converting it to oxyhemoglobin. Oxygen saturation is a critical part of the physical examination of children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The expected oxygen saturation of a patient with CHD depends on their anatomical lesion, their previous surgeries, and any additional pulmonary or systemic pathology that may derange their saturation. Oxygen saturation can be noninvasively measured using pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry is based on the differential absorption of infrared and red light by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, with the former absorbing more infrared than the latter. Pulse oximetry readings may be inaccurate in settings of low cardiac output, peripheral vasoconstriction, arrhythmia, hypothermia, and venous pulsations. The use of pulse oximetry in the care of a child with CHD begins with the newborn critical CHD screen. A failed screen indicates a need for further investigation, such as repeated pulse oximetry or echocardiography. The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve may be used to estimate the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood at various oxygen saturations. It is also a marker of the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, with a right-shifted curve indicating a higher oxygen tension needed to saturate hemoglobin. This is a helpful adaptation of the body to situations of stress such as fever, acidosis, and hypercapnia. An understanding of these concepts is paramount for providers caring for patients with known or potential CHD in any setting to appropriately interpret and respond to abnormal saturations for each child.

### Night-to-night variation of pulse oximetry in children with sleep-disordered breathing [^9de52557]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep-disordered breathing is a common and serious feature of many paediatric conditions and is particularly a problem in children with Down syndrome. Overnight pulse oximetry is recommended as an initial screening test, but it is unclear how overnight oximetry results should be interpreted and how many nights should be recorded.

Methods

This retrospective observational study evaluated night-to-night variation using statistical measures of repeatability for 214 children referred to a paediatric respiratory clinic, who required overnight oximetry measurements. This included 30 children with Down syndrome. We measured length of adequate trace, basal SpO 2, number of desaturations (> 4% SpO 2 drop for > 10s) per hour ('adjusted index') and time with SpO 2 < 90%. We classified oximetry traces into normal or abnormal based on physiology.

Results

132 out of 214 (62%) children had three technically adequate nights' oximetry, including 13 out of 30 (43%) children with Down syndrome. Intraclass correlation coefficient for adjusted index was 0.54 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.81) among children with Down syndrome and 0.88 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.91) for children with other diagnoses. Negative predictor value of a negative first night predicting two subsequent negative nights was 0.2 in children with Down syndrome and 0.55 in children with other diagnoses.

Conclusions

There is substantial night-to-night variation in overnight oximetry readings among children in all clinical groups undergoing overnight oximetry. This is a more pronounced problem in children with Down syndrome. Increasing the number of attempted nights' recording from one to three provides useful additional clinical information.

### How to use saturation monitoring in newborns [^1329a25d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Pulse oximetry is a first-line monitoring tool, used in neonatal medicine routinely as a part of continuous monitoring during intensive care. It is also used to guide response to resuscitation and as a screening tool for congenital heart disease. Despite its widespread use, many healthcare providers are unaware of the underlying principles and limitations of pulse oximetry in neonates. In this article, we will discuss the physiological and technological principles behind the use of saturation monitoring and its use in neonatal practice.

### The reliability of a single pulse oximetry reading as a screening test for congenital heart disease in otherwise asymptomatic newborn infants [^46f7ee48]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Routine pulse oximetry has been studied to detect children with otherwise undiagnosed congenital heart disease prior to nursery discharge. The reported sensitivities in asymptomatic patients have been less than expected and vary widely, bringing into question the reliability of the test. The purpose of this study was to assess whether routine pulse oximetry contributes to identifying patients with critical congenital heart disease and to determine the reliability of a single pulse oximeter reading in screening asymptomatic newborn infants. Between December 26, 2003, and December 31, 2005, three hospitals in west central Florida performed a pulse oximetry routinely on all newborns at the time of discharge. Patients diagnosed with critical congenital heart disease during the study period were identified to assess whether the pulse oximetry reading initiated their diagnosis. In one hospital, the pulse oximeter data were evaluated for reliability. Downloaded data were compared to a log compiled by the nursery personnel, first without (phase 1) and then with (phase 2) their knowledge and additional training. Results were characterized as reliable, probe placed but reading not verifiable, or no evidence of probe placement. Of the 7962 infants who received oximetry testing, there were 12 postnatal diagnoses of critical congenital heart disease. None was initially identified by routine pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry reliability improved substantially between phase 1 and phase 2 (38 v. 60%, p < 0.0001). Optimal reliability (> 95%) was obtained by a nurse with a degree of LPN or higher performing an assessment of at least 360 seconds. Routine pulse oximetry was neither reliable nor an important diagnostic tool in our cohort. Important human factors (probe placement time, oximetry training, and nursing degree) impact single determination pulse oximetry reliability. With routine surveillance and quality improvement, the reliability of this test can be increased. Future studies to determine the effectiveness of pulse oximetry screening for the diagnosis of congenital heart disease in the asymptomatic newborn population must address these factors. Until such a study demonstrates acceptable sensitivity and clinical value, universal screening should not be instituted.

### Baby oxygen saturation study (BOSS)-clinicalTrials.gov… [^ed40a07b]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Blood oxygen saturation is the percentage of haemoglobin carrying oxygen. It is accepted that healthy term infants breathing room air have oxygen saturation levels of 95% or greater, similar to adults. Blood oxygen saturation levels have to be carefully balanced in infants who are born prematurely. High saturation levels are associated with retinopathy of prematurity and lower saturation levels with increased mortality. Current practice is to maintain premature infants' oxygen saturations between 88 and 93%. After 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, the risk of ROP is greatly reduced and these target oxygen saturations are typically increased to greater than 93%. Lower saturations beyond this time are associated with poor weight gain and are considered to carry a risk of developing pulmonary hypertension.

Many of the smallest and most premature infants will continue to require supplemental inspired oxygen after 36 weeks' postmenstrual age in order to maintain saturations greater than 93%, so called "chronic lung disease of prematurity". Some of these infants will require to be discharged home on supplemental oxygen. The need for home oxygen is determined by measurement of pulse oximetry prior to discharge. A recently developed device, the Masimo Radical 7, is now in widespread use in preterm infants nearing discharge from the neonatal unit. This device is more accurate, derives extra physiological measures from the oxygen saturation data and offers longer-term data storage than other models currently in clinical use. In addition, the Masimo Radical 7 with its analysis software is capable of counting and measuring shorter-term dips in oxygen saturation.

An oxygen saturation study can be measured in terms of the overall oxygen saturation, and/or the number, duration and severity of these dips. Increasing use of the Masimo Radical 7 to record oxygen saturation studies in preterm infants nearing discharge from the neonatal unit has, for a significant number of infants, revealed more than previously suspected episodes of reduced oxygen saturation which are frequently not clinically apparent. This study will define preliminary reference limits for pulse oximetry in newly born healthy term babies, in order better to be able to interpret oxygen saturation recordings made in preterm babies nearing term corrected age and hospital discharge. The investigators will assess feasibility of data collection, and use the data to inform a subsequent larger study.

Introduction

Oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (Sp 2) is used for triage and management of acute illness in hospitalized children. Adult data indicate that pulse oximetry does not detect hypoxemia as frequently in Black patients as in White patients. We aimed to investigate the frequency of occult hypoxemia in children and assess variability by patient race.

### Usability testing of a reusable pulse oximeter probe developed for health-care workers caring for children [^f980fef3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Data collection.

We used a Lifebox ® oximeter (version 1.5). To allow the expert to conduct reference SpO 2 measurements, an independent observer recorded the child's demographic data, condition, clinical features, and timed the expert SpO 2 measurement. The observer was a member of the research team who was present to provide independent timing and data recording of the measurement process. Children were first screened by the experts, and those with an SpO 2 > 95% were permitted to participate in HCW testing. For expert measurements, the expert and/or caregiver could distract the child and support the limb. The independent observer started a timer once probe placement was complete and stopped it when the expert said "stop", signifying that, in the expert's view, this was a successful SpO 2 reading. Experts were trained to assume an SpO 2 reading as reliable if the measurement had a consistent, high-amplitude plethysmography waveform, accompanied by an SpO 2 and heart rate that, in their judgment, was biologically plausible for that child. The SpO 2, heart rate, and additional observations were then recorded. If an SpO 2 was not obtained at the first location, the expert could adjust the probe or use another location for a maximum of 5 minutes, at which point the testing was stopped. Biologically implausible measurements, for example, were measurements that had a normal SpO 2 but had a heart rate lower than the approximate 10th centile for the age of the child, or measurements that had a severely abnormal SpO 2 value in an otherwise clinically stable child.

Health-care workers were blinded to expert measurements. To allow the expert to observe HCW testing without distractions and ensure accurate timing, the independent observer also timed all HCW measurements. Health-care workers followed the exact same measurement process as completed by experts and used the same criteria for determining whether the SpO 2 was reliable. The expert also determined whether the HCW reading was reliable in their judgment by using the same metrics used with the expert measurement, and the observer separately recorded this information without the HCW's knowledge. The HCW could attempt to obtain an SpO 2 for a maximum of 5 minutes, at which point the testing was stopped. No additional guidance or retraining was provided to HCWs by experts during or between measurements if the HCWs were taking measurements incorrectly. De-identified data were captured electronically and uploaded onto secure servers.

### Design and validation of pulse oximetry for low saturation [^c477de2d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

As pulse oximetry migrates into new areas of patient care, it becomes increasingly important to rigorously test performance in the environment of use before claiming success. If evaluated only under tightly or ideally controlled laboratory or bench-top conditions, results may have little relationship to real-world behavior. As an example, fetal pulse oximetry sensors are subject to challenges not typically found with air-breathing patients. The "presenting part" is an attractive site for fetal oximetry, however the presence of resolvable pulses by itself does not ensure accurate readings. This study explores the effects of physiological and mechanical perturbations at low saturation expected during use on fetuses with such sensors. Numerical modeling and animal studies demonstrate that at 40% true arterial saturation (SaO2), calculated saturation values (SpO2) may err by more than 30%, even in the presence of otherwise normal pulse oximetry signals.

Introduction

Pulse oximetry is ubiquitously used for monitoring oxygenation in the critical care setting. By forewarning the clinicians about the presence of hypoxemia, pulse oximeters may lead to a quicker treatment of serious hypoxemia and possibly circumvent serious complications. In this review, I update the principles of pulse oximetry from my article in 1999 and discuss recent technological advances that have been developed to enhance the accuracy and clinical applications of this monitoring technique. Finally, available studies evaluating the impact of pulse oximetry on patient outcome will also be reviewed.

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory sleep studies, with comorbidities), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining pulse oximetry as an initial diagnostic test for sleep-disordered breathing in pediatric patients with comorbid disorders if cardiorespiratory sleep studies are not available. Be cautious when interpreting abnormal results because desaturations may have varying causes. Consider referring patients to more complex studies to assess for hypoventilation and determine the cause and mechanisms of desaturation.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recently published evidence-based guidelines for a standardized approach to pulse oximetry as a screening tool for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). The addition of CCHD screening to the standard newborn examination may lead to earlier detection of CCHD and subsequently decreased morbidity and mortality. We report a case of CCHD with excessive pulmonary blood flow that went undetected during routine newborn screening. Healthcare practitioners and families need to be aware of the limitations of CCHD screening.

### Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry in healthy infants at an altitude of 1610 M (5280 ft) [^741e7f25]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Thilo EH, Park-Moore B, Berman ER, Carson BS. Oxygen Saturation by Pulse Oximetry in Healthy Infants at an Altitude of 1610 m: What Is Normal. Am J Dis Child. 1991; 145: 1137–1140. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1991.02160100069025
- Pulse oximetry is a valuable, noninvasive technique for assessing oxygen saturation that has gained wide clinical acceptance despite little available information concerning normal values in the newborn, especially at an altitude different than sea level. We performed serial pulse oximetry studies on 150 term, appropriate-weight-for-gestational-age, clinically healthy infants at an altitude of 1610 m at 24 to 48 hours, 1 month, and 3 months of age to define a reference range for oxygen saturation as a guideline in clinical care. We found that mean oxygen saturation at 24 to 48 hours of age is 92% to 93% and varies little with infant activity.

With increasing postnatal age, there is a tendency for increased oxygen saturation during the awake states to 93% to 94%, while oxygen saturation during sleep stays the same or even decreases slightly. The lower end of the reference range is as low as 85% during feeding at 24 to 48 hours of age, and as low as 86% during quiet sleep at 1 and 3 months of age, with 88% to 89% the lower limit in other activities at all ages.

### Pulse oximetry curves in healthy children living at moderate altitude: a cross-sectional study from the ecuadorian andes [^aea30810]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is an indirect index of oxygen supply-to-demand balance. Pulse oximetry provides information about patient's oxygenation status and is a reliable, simple, safe, accurate, and relative low cost method to monitor the patient as compared to expensive and labor-intensive methods. Patient's oxygenation status can show a reduced partial pressure of oxygen and/or decreased oxygen saturation in arterial blood and in this case, it should be called hypoxemia. Hypoxemia in children has been associated with increased mortality and is a frequent complication in cases of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, asthma and other severe diseases such as sepsis. The recognition of hypoxemia among children with pneumonia contributes to diagnosis, is crucial in patient management, and helps in determining prognosis.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an oxygen saturation threshold value of 90% measured by pulse oximetry, as the cut-off point for oxygen administration in populations living at 2,500 m a.s.l. or less. In clinical practice, the "normal" SpO2 at sea level has been estimated to be between 95% and 100%, however, several authors consider that values of 95% and 96% were abnormal. In altitudes above 3,000 m a.s.l, where oxygen saturation values are lower than at sea level, the 90% cut-off point could be less useful.

There are few studies about SpO2 values performed in cities between 2,000 and 3,000 m a.s.l. In order to contribute to the best comprehension about SpO2 values in healthy children living at moderate altitude, our study was devised to describe the values range of SpO2 measured with a pulse oximeter in healthy children between 1 month and 12 years of age living at 2,810 m a.s.l.

### Newborn pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects [^abfe4570]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence addressing the effectiveness of pulse oximetry effective for detecting critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) in newborns. We also looked at the impact of timing of oximetry and the site of testing in the accuracy of screening, and at the potential harms and limitations of pulse oximetry screening, We conducted a literature search up to the 13 th of August 2019 by using key terms and manual search in selected sources. We summarized the recommendations and the strength of the recommendation when and as reported by the authors. We summarized the main findings of systematic reviews with the certainty of the evidence as reported. Current evidence supports consistent accuracy for detection of CCHDs in newborns by pulse oximetry screening in addition to antenatal ultrasonography and clinical examination. Overall, early diagnosis of CCHD with pulse oximetry is judged to be beneficial and cost-effective, and potential harms associated with false-positive tests are not serious, while missing CCHDs and other serious diseases detected by hypoxaemia in absence of pulse oximetry screening can lead to serious consequences. The site of testing (post-ductal versus pre- and post-ductal) had no significant effect on sensitivity nor specificity for detection of CCHDs.

### Aspects of pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects: when, how and why? [^36263270]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Pulse oximetry (PO) screening for critical congenital heart defects (CCHD) has been studied extensively and is being increasingly implemented worldwide. This review provides an overview of all aspects of PO screening that need to be considered when introducing this methodology. PO screening for CCHD is effective, simple, quick, reliable, cost-effective and does not lead to extra burden for parents and caregivers. Test accuracy can be influenced by targets definition, gestational age, timing of screening and antenatal detection of CCHD. Early screening can lead to more false positive screenings, but has the potential to detect significant pathology earlier. There is no apparent difference in accuracy between screening with post-ductal measurements only, compared with screening using pre-ductal and post-ductal measurements. However, adding pre-ductal measurements identifies cases of CCHD which would have been missed by post-ductal screening. Screening at higher altitudes leads to more false positives. Important non-cardiac pathology is found in 35–74% of false positives in large studies. Screening is feasible in neonatal intensive care units and out-of-hospital births. Training caregivers, simplifying the algorithm and using computer-based interpretation tools can improve the quality of the screening. Caregivers need to consider all aspects of screening to enable them to choose an optimal protocol for implementation of CCHD screening in their specific setting.

### Screening newborns for congenital heart disease with pulse oximetry: survey of pediatric cardiologists [^f38db82e]. Pediatric Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Controversies exist regarding the use of pulse oximetry for routine screening of newborns. This study aimed to evaluate current practices and opinions of pediatric cardiologists in relation to newborn screening for congenital heart disease (CHD) using pulse oximetry.

Methods

Email invitations were sent to 1,045 pediatric cardiologists in North America. The survey was Internet based and included multiple-choice questions. Two repeat email reminders were sent after the initial invitation.

Results

A total of 363 responses (35%) were returned. In terms of experience, 40% of the respondents had more than 20 years, 32% had 10 to 20 years, 21% had 5 to 10 years, and 6% had less than 5 years of experience. More than 90% agreed that an early diagnosis of CHD for newborns prevents morbidity and mortality. In terms of practice, 96% reported that all newborns are examined by a clinician before discharge, 29% reported that newborns get a pulse oximetry reading, and 1.4% (n = 5) reported the use of electrocardiogram. Only 58% of respondents thought that current practice is adequate for detecting significant CHD. With regard to their experience with pulse oximetry, 26% reported "too many false-positives", 21% described it as "prone to noise and artifact", and 30% viewed it as "very operator dependent". The overall support for mandated pulse oximetry screening was 55%. The support for mandate decreased with years of experience, with 76% of the supporters having less than 5 years, 58% of those having 5 to 10 years, 53% of those having 10 to 20 years, and 51% of those having more than 20 years of experience.

Conclusions

Pediatric cardiologists recognize that current practice is inadequate for detecting significant CHD. Slightly more than half of the pediatric cardiologists in this study supported a mandate for pulse oximetry screening, but there were many concerns, and the support decreased with increasing years of clinical experience.

### Comparison of pulse oximetry and earlobe blood gas with CO-oximetry in children with sickle cell disease: a retrospective review [^75bc88d2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Pulse oximetry did not miss any case of hypoxaemia (SaO 2 ≤ 93%), but it provided some false-positive results (specificity 85%) and its positive predictive value for hypoxaemia was only 76%, further indicating the need to evaluate SaO 2 in patients with SCD with SpO 2 values in the hypoxaemic range (SpO 2 ≤ 93%). A former study that adopted the traditional definition of hypoxaemia based on PaO 2 ≤ 70 mm Hg (corresponding to SaO 2 ≤ 93% in a normal oxyhaemoglobin curve) found that none of nine patients with SCD and SpO 2 ≤ 93% had a PaO 2 ≤ 70 mm Hg. Similarly, in our study, only 1 out of 17 participants with SpO 2 ≤ 93% had a PaO 2 ≤ 70 mm Hg, indicating that the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve was right shifted, with a lower SaO 2 for a given PaO 2 compared with a normal curve. In light of this evidence, we think that hypoxaemia in patients with SCD should be defined according to a SaO 2 cut-off (as in the present study) rather than relying on PaO 2 values, as SaO 2 will better reflect the amount of oxygen that can be transported to the tissues (depending also on cardiac output, Hb concentration, etc).

There are several factors that can contribute to unreliable pulse oximeter results in children with SCD. First, the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve tends to be right shifted when HbS polymerises. Moreover, dysfunctional Hb (carboxyhaemoglobin and methaemoglobin) are elevated in the presence of intravascular haemolysis and, since they adsorb light at similar wavelengths as oxygenated and deoxygenated, can affect SpO 2 readings of convectional pulse oximeters. Furthermore, the high frequency of dark skin among patients with SCD can be an risk factor for poor accuracy of SpO 2 in patients with hypoxaemiaand, finally, accuracy of SpO 2 is lower at SaO 2 values < 90%, a range of oxygen saturation often seen during ACS episodes.

A strength of this study is that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the largest comparison of SpO 2 and SaO 2 values in patients with SCD published so far and the first to have been specifically powered for this outcome. Moreover, this is also the first report of EBG with CO-oximetry in patients with SCD.

### Defining hypoxaemia from pulse oximeter measurements of oxygen saturation in well children at low altitude in Bangladesh: an observational study [^386da248]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Another issue that may impact the utility of pulse oximeters in all LMICs is the possible greater inaccuracy of SpO 2 measurements in individuals with darker skin pigmentation. Although pulse oximetry inaccuracy in individuals with darker skin pigmentation is well established, a recent publication of hospitalised adults in the USA suggests the magnitude and direction of SpO 2 measurement bias in people with darker skin tones may be clinically unacceptable. The authors reported a higher odds of hypoxaemia — as measured by an arterial blood gas — among darkly pigmented adults with a normal SpO 2, compared with adults without dark skin pigmentation and a normal SpO 2. Further study is needed to better understand the relative contribution and direction of pulse oximeter inaccuracy among children in LMICs where higher percentages of the population often have darker skin pigmentation.

In sum, our findings provide possible reference SpO 2 thresholds for hypoxaemia derived from a population of well children in Bangladesh residing at lower altitude. In fragile, overburdened health systems higher false positive measurements may limit the implementation feasibility of SpO 2 thresholds above the current < 90% mark without additional strengthening of clinical assessments by healthcare providers. This research suggests that age needs to be considered in further work on establishing thresholds for hypoxaemia. Key next steps include determining the mortality risk of ill children with SpO 2 measurements at or below these thresholds in varying LMICs, including Bangladesh, as well as evaluating the performance of SpO 2 at or below these thresholds for diagnosing LRI. Such research will also shed light on the potential mortality implications of false negative measurements when applying a lower < 90% SpO 2 threshold for hypoxaemia.

Oximeters "that change tone with changes in hemoglobin saturation provide immediate aural warning", and probes must be positioned properly because "clip‑on devices are easy to displace, which may produce artifact data (under‑ or overestimation of oxygen saturation)".

### Updated strategies for pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease [^38a5ca54]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Seven years after its addition to the US Recommended Uniform Screening Panel, newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) using pulse oximetry became mandatory in the United States. Although CCHD newborn screening reduces morbidity and mortality, there remain important opportunities to improve. An expert panel convened for a 1-day meeting in September 2018, including subject matter experts and representatives from stakeholder organizations. Presentations on CCHD outcomes, variations in approach to screening, and data and quality improvement helped identify improvement opportunities. The expert panel concluded that sufficient evidence exists to recommend modifying the current American Academy of Pediatrics algorithm by (1) requiring an oxygen saturation of at least 95% in both (formerly either) the upper and lower extremities to pass and (2) requiring only 1 repeat screen instead of 2 for cases that neither pass nor fail initially. The panel underscored the importance of improving public health reporting by further specifying the targets of screening and criteria for reporting outcomes (false-negative and false-positive cases). The panel also highlighted the need to ensure sufficient public health funding for CCHD newborn screening and opportunities for education and global implementation. Newborn screening for CCHD using pulse oximetry has led to significant improvements in child health outcomes. However, further important work is required to understand and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of screening.

### The prevalence of hypoxaemia in paediatric and adult patients in health-care facilities in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ab71803a]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The strong association between hypoxaemia and mortality underlies the value of pulse oximetry in risk assessment and stratification, in addition to its essential role in guiding oxygen treatment decisions. This is highly relevant for emergency and critical care triage and initial assessment, and for identifying patients with hypoxaemia at lower-level facilities. Current WHO/UNICEF primary care guidelines provide limited guidance on when or how health-care workers should use pulse oximetry, with most patients with hypoxaemia presenting to primary care currently going unidentified. In these settings, pulse oximetry might be a useful tool to help identify patients requiring careful reassessment, consideration for referral, and closer follow-up.

This study is a comprehensive synthesis of hypoxaemia data across all ages and various clinical conditions, representing populations in LMICs from every region of the world. Our broad inclusion criteria enabled us to capture data on age groups and conditions that had not been previously reported. We reviewed more than 9000 articles to identify 213 studies for inclusion in quantitative analysis involving 601 757 participants (compared with 57 studies and 101 775 child participants in the previous largest review). However, we were limited by the quality of source data. Few studies collected hypoxaemia prevalence as a core outcome, so the methodology and reporting quality of included studies varied. Included studies typically reported hypoxaemia based on assessment around the time of admission, and this might have led to underestimation of hypoxaemia prevalence over the entire admission period or before intervention. We focused on blood oxygen saturations obtained by pulse oximetry, as the gold-standard blood gas assessment using co-oximetry is typically only available in relatively well resourced intensive care settings and would not reflect general acutely unwell populations. However, pulse oximetry use is not routine in many smaller health facilities and poor communities, and our review had over-representation of research cohorts from larger facilities. Pulse oximeter accuracy varies between devices and is less accurate at lower oxygen saturations (< 80%) and in low perfusion states, with additional measurement uncertainty stemming from patients and device users. Although these measurement uncertainties should not systematically bias our estimates, there is evidence that some oximeters overestimate blood oxygen saturation in patients with deeply pigmented skin, potentially underestimating hypoxaemia prevalence for these populations. Included studies used a range of SpO 2 cutoff values to report hypoxaemia, and this prompted our sensitivity analysis focusing on studies with a cutoff value of less than 90%, which yielded similar findings. We believe this gives a reasonable conservative estimate of the proportion of people who would likely need oxygen, acknowledging that clinical decisions about oxygen should not be solely determined by a binary SpO 2 cutoff value. We relied on recorded diagnostic classifications for categorising by condition, but these were often not standardised or inclusive of comorbidity.

### Oxygen targeting in extremely low birth weight infants [^8125e8ba]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulse oximetry: uses and limitations — pulse oximeters measure differential absorption of red and infrared light by oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, but device accuracy and averaging behavior constrain clinical interpretation. Most manufacturers report an SD of the difference between SpO2 and actual Sao2 of 3 points for neonates, with approximately 68% of measurements within 1 SD; for example, an SpO2 reading of 88% could reflect an actual Sao2 between 85% and 91% in 68% of infants but may fall outside 82% to 94% in up to 5% of infants. At lower saturations, discrepancies increase: for readings in the 85% to 89% range, arterial saturations were reported as much as 10 points lower, and in 1 study 39% of oximeter readings in the 85% to 89% range were below that range with 25% having Sao2 < 80%; devices are only calibrated down to 80%. Modern devices use time-averaging (typically 2–16 seconds); longer averaging can reduce detection of brief (< 30 seconds) or marked (< 70%) desaturations and overestimate event duration by combining events, whereas shorter averaging detects more events but results in more false alarms, raising concern for delayed detection of hypoxemic events.

### Predictors of safe discharge for pediatric drowning patients in the emergency department [^23e79a87]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study is to determine if stable, well-appearing, drowning patients who have normal age-adjusted vital signs and pulse oximetry upon arrival to the emergency department may be safely discharged without a prolonged observation period.

Methods

Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for drowning patients presenting to a single pediatric emergency department from 1995 to 2014. Data were collected on vital signs and pulse oximetry at presentation, chest x-ray results, disposition and complications for each encounter. Patients were identified as having either normal or abnormal initial vital signs and pulse oximetry, and were compared based on disposition and complication rates.

Results

Two hundred seventy-six records were initially evaluated and 91 were excluded. Thirty-six percent had normal age-adjusted vital signs upon arrival. Patients with abnormal temperature, respiratory rate or pulse oximetry, as well as those with any abnormal initial cardiopulmonary physical exam findings, abnormal mental status, or chest radiograph findings, were more likely to be admitted to the hospital. Eight patients developed respiratory complications after presentation to the emergency department. Those with abnormal pulse oximetry readings on arrival were more likely to develop complications. Only two patients who developed complications had initially normal vital signs and each had evidence of clinical deterioration within 1h of arrival.

Conclusions

The overall complication rate in initially stable, well-appearing drowning patients is low. An abnormal pulse oximetry reading at presentation may help predict subsequent complications. Those patients with normal age-adjusted vital signs and physical exam at presentation may not require a prolonged observation period.

### Endorsement of health and human services recommendation for pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease [^a00d08d1]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Incorporation of pulse oximetry to the assessment of the newborn infant can enhance detection of critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). Recently, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommended that screening for CCHD be added to the uniform screening panel. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has been a strong advocate of early detection of CCHD and fully supports the decision of the Secretary of HHS. The AAP has published strategies for the implementation of pulse oximetry screening, which addressed critical issues such as necessary equipment, personnel, and training, and also provided specific recommendations for assessment of saturation by using pulse oximetry as well as appropriate management of a positive screening result. The AAP is committed to the safe and effective implementation of pulse oximetry screening and is working with other advocacy groups and governmental agencies to promote pulse oximetry and to support widespread surveillance for CCHD. Going forward, AAP chapters will partner with state health departments to implement the new screening strategy for CCHD and will work to ensure that there is an adequate system for referral for echocardiographic/pediatric cardiac evaluation after a positive screening result. It is imperative that AAP members engage their respective policy makers in adopting and funding the recommendations made by the Secretary of HHS.

### Newborn pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart defects [^86f5115e]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings

Current evidence supports consistent accuracy for detection of CCHDs in newborns by pulse oximetry screening in addition to antenatal ultrasonography and clinical examination.
Overall, early diagnosis of CCHD with pulse oximetry is judged to be beneficial and cost-effective, and potential harms associated with false-positive tests are not serious, while missing CCHDs and other serious diseases detected by hypoxaemia in absence of pulse oximetry screening can lead to serious consequences.
Timing of oximetry: ○ The timing of pulse oximetry screening had no significant difference on sensitivity, but the false positivity rate was significantly lower among newborns screened after 24 hours of life, when compared with newborns screened within the first 24 hours of life. ○ There is some evidence – and wide acceptance among physicians – that early screening leading to early detection of CCHDs allows timeliness of appropriate medical intervention and therefore reduces the risk of onset with severe or very severe symptoms, with subsequent better outcome. ○ Newborns with false-positive screening results might undergo unnecessary additional tests such as echocardiogram. However, early screening allows detection of hypoxemia due to other clinically severe conditions that benefit from prompt intervention. ○ Overall, benefits of early screening are judged to be greater than the potential negative impact of the increased rate of positive rate by some societies, but this is not the position of other institutions such as the United Kingdom National Screening Committee and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.
The site of testing (post-ductal versus pre- and post-ductal) had no significant effect on sensitivity nor specificity for detection of CCHDs.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^e5cd9e64]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Objective assessments — lung function and oxygen saturation: Objective assessments are also needed as the physical examination alone may not indicate the severity of the exacerbation, but patients, and not their laboratory values, should be the focus of treatment. Measurement of lung function is strongly recommended; if possible and without unduly delaying treatment, peak expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) should be recorded before treatment is initiated, and lung function should be measured at one hour and at intervals until a clear response or plateau occurs. Oxygen saturation should be closely monitored, preferably by pulse oximetry; in children, oxygen saturation is normally ≥ 95% when breathing room air at sea level, saturation < 92% predicts need for hospitalization (Evidence C), and saturation levels < 90% in children or adults signal the need for aggressive therapy. Subject to clinical urgency, saturation should be assessed before oxygen is commenced, or 5 minutes after oxygen is removed or when saturation stabilizes, and under conditions of hypoxemia oxygen saturation may be over-estimated by pulse oximeters in people with dark skin color.

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory sleep studies, without comorbidities), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to be particularly cautious when obtaining oximetry to diagnose OSA in < 2 years old pediatric patients since they are predisposed to central sleep apnea (due to developmental immaturity), and oxygen desaturations cannot discriminate between obstructive and central events.

### Pulse oximetry screening at 4 hours of age to detect critical congenital heart defects [^ec061df5]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the feasibility and reliability of pulse oximetry screening to detect critical congenital heart defects in a newborn nursery.

Methods

The study was performed in a large urban hospital with an exclusively inborn population. Stable neonates who had a gestational age of ≥ 35 weeks and birth weight of ≥ 2100 g and in whom a critical congenital heart defect was not suspected were admitted to the newborn nursery. When the 4-hour pulse oximetry reading was < 96%, pulse oximetry was repeated at discharge, and when the pulse oximetry reading remained at persistently < 96%, echocardiography was performed.

Results

Of 15299 admissions to newborn nursery during the 12-month study period, 15233 (99.6%) neonates were screened with 4-hour pulse oximetry. Pulse oximetry readings were ≥ 96% for 14374 (94.4%) neonates; 77 were subsequently evaluated before discharge for cardiac defects on the basis of clinical examination. Seventy-six were normal, and 1 had tetralogy of Fallot with discontinuous pulmonary arteries. Pulse oximetry readings at 4 hours were < 96% in 859 (5.6%); 768 were rescreened at discharge, and 767 neonates had a pulse oximetry reading at ≥ 96%. One neonate had persistently low pulse oximetry at discharge; echocardiography was normal. Although 3 neonates with a critical congenital heart defect had a 4-hour pulse oximetry reading of < 96%, all developed signs and/or symptoms of a cardiac defect and received a diagnosis on the basis of clinical findings, not screening results.

Conclusions

All neonates with a critical congenital heart defect were detected clinically, and no cases of critical congenital heart defect were detected by pulse oximetry screening. These results indicate that pulse oximetry screening does not improve detection of critical congenital heart defects above and beyond clinical observation and assessment. Our findings do not support a recommendation for routine pulse oximetry screening in seemingly healthy neonates.

### Pulse oximetry curves in healthy children living at moderate altitude: a cross-sectional study from the ecuadorian andes [^b061c099]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive and relative low-cost assessment method able to reduce child mortality by accurately diagnosing hypoxemia, increasing the possibilities of early and effective treatment. Unreal SpO2 values could increase hospital admissions and hospital stays with subsequent iatrogenic risks and misuse of resources. Without pulse oximetry, the management of pediatric patients depends on precise identification of the clinical signs of hypoxemia, which are not always easy to assess in all patients. Clinical signs alone are unreliable for the detection of hypoxaemia.

Pulse oximetry identifies between 20 and 30% more cases than clinical signs alone. However, the determination of a threshold to identify hypoxemia is difficult, especially in high altitude populations. Some studies have previously used average SpO2 values ​​-2 SD to define hypoxemia, however others have used the 2.5th percentile measurement as a cut-off point to decide to use oxygen. Subhi et al. developed a statistical model of SpO2 distribution from sea level to 4000 m a.s.l. using meta regression based on 14 observational studies of healthy children. At an altitude of 2500 m a.s.l the 2.5th percentile was 90% and at 2800 m a.s.l was 88%. It suggests that for altitudes greater than 2500 m a.s.l the SpO2 threshold for identifying children requiring oxygen is 85% although it is not clearly defined how the threshold was chosen. The threshold obtained with the Tüshaus altitude-adaptive model at 2800 m.a.s.l was 86%. It is possible, that our results are related to "normality" in "children at community settings without respiratory symptoms and not fever living at moderate altitude", however, the 2.5th percentile values ​​could be conservative to be considered as a threshold to define hypoxemia or the need to administer supplemental oxygen. It is very important to consider the accuracy range of the pulse oximeter used (+-2%).

### The accuracy of readily available consumer-grade oxygen saturation monitors in pediatric patients [^26a5caeb]. Respiratory Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulse oximetry measurement is ubiquitous in acute health care settings in high-income countries and is familiar to any parent whose child has been treated in such a setting. Oximeters for home use are readily available online and are incorporated in several smartphones and smartwatches.

Methods

We wished to determine how accurate are oximeters available online that are designated for adult and pediatric use, and the saturation monitor integrated in a smartphone, when used in children, compared to reference, hospital-grade oximeters. We evaluated a fingertip oximeter marketed for children purchased online; an adult fingertip oximeter purchased online; the oximeter integrated in a smartphone; and reference, hospital-grade oximeters. Participants were < 18 y of age. Bland-Altman charts were generated, and the estimated root mean square error (EA RMS) was calculated. Rates of failure to obtain a measurement, relationship between device and time to successful measurement, relationship between age and time to successful measurement, and relationship between error (vs the reference device) and age were evaluated for each consumer-grade device.

Results

We measured S pO2 in 74 children between 0.1–17.0 y of age. Subjects weighing < 30 kg had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 2 (1.0 month-1.4 y) months, and subjects weighing ≥ 30 kg had a median (IQR) age of 14.3 (11.9–16.2) y. Readings could not be obtained in 7.5, 0, and 38.8% of subjects using the pediatric, adult, and smartphone oximeters, respectively. The time to successful reading had a modest negative correlation with age with the inexpensive adult and pediatric oximeters. The inexpensive pediatric oximeter had an overall negative bias, with a mean difference from the reference device of -4.5% (SD 7.9%) and an error that ranged from > 8% to < 33% the reference device. The EA RMS was 7.92%. The inexpensive adult oximeter demonstrated no obvious trend in error in the limited saturation range evaluated of 87–99%. The overall mean difference was -0.7% (SD 2.5%). EA RMS was 2.5%. The smartphone oximeter underestimated S pO2 at saturations < 94% and overestimated S pO2 for saturations > 94%. Saturations could read as much as > 4%, or < 17%, than the reference oximeter. The mean difference was -2.9% (SD 5.2%). EA RMS was 5.1%.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the performance of consumer-grade devices varies considerably by both subject age and device. The pediatric fingertip device and smartphone application we tested are poorly suited for use in infants. The adult fingertip device we tested performed quite well in larger children with relatively normal oxygen saturations, and the pediatric fingertip device performed moderately well in subjects > 1 y of age who weighed < 30 kg. Given the vast number of devices available online and ever-changing technology, research to evaluate nonclinical oximeters will continue to be required.

### Use of intermittent vs continuous pulse oximetry for nonhypoxemic infants and young children hospitalized for bronchiolitis: a randomized clinical trial [^96131794]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Clinical practice guidelines for managing infants and children hospitalized for bronchiolitis recommend only obtaining intermittent or "spot check" pulse oximetry readings for those who show clinical improvement. The effect of such monitoring is currently unknown.

Objective

To determine the effect of intermittent vs continuous pulse oximetry monitoring on hospital length of stay among nonhypoxemic infants and young children hospitalized for bronchiolitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, parallel-group, superiority clinical trial of otherwise healthy infants and children 2 years of age or younger hospitalized for bronchiolitis during the period from 2009 to 2014 at 1 of 4 children's hospitals in the United States. Parents or guardians were blinded to allocation assignment until informed consent was obtained; study personnel and outcome assessors were not.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to undergo continuous or intermittent pulse oximetry monitoring (ie, pulse oximetry measurements were obtained along with a scheduled check of vital signs or for clinical suspicion of deterioration) during hospitalization when oxygen saturation levels were 90% or higher.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Length of hospital stay was the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures included duration of supplemental oxygen use and rate of escalation of care (defined as transfer to an intensive care unit).

Results

A total of 449 infants and young children were screened for inclusion; 288 infants and young children were excluded, resulting in 161 patients who were enrolled in the study (80 patients underwent continuous monitoring, and 81 patients intermittent). The mean length of stay did not differ based on pulse oximetry monitoring strategy (48.9 hours [95% CI, 41.3–56.5 hours] for continuous monitoring vs 46.2 hours [95% CI, 39.1–53.3 hours] for intermittent monitoring; P = 0.77). The rates of escalation of care and duration of supplemental oxygen use did not differ between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Intermittent pulse oximetry monitoring of nonhypoxemic patients with bronchiolitis did not shorten hospital length of stay and was not associated with any difference in rate of escalation of care or use of diagnostic or therapeutic measures. Our results suggest that intermittent pulse oximetry monitoring can be routinely considered in the management of infants and children hospitalized for bronchiolitis who show clinical improvement.

### Usability testing of a reusable pulse oximeter probe developed for health-care workers caring for children [^c4b6f1b3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this HCD usability study indicates that, in children < 5 years old, it is possible to use a pulse oximetry probe to achieve successful SpO 2 readings in 67% of children in < 1 minute, 81% in < 2 minutes, and 90% in < 5 minutes. These results are encouraging for an innovative pediatric pulse oximetry probe that is reusable and low cost. We believe that this design is an appropriate "universal probe" suitable for use by LRS HCWs on patients of any age, including newborns. Our findings highlight the factors associated with longer measurement times, in particular movement artifact, and suggest that task-specific training is sufficient for LRS study settings, but enhanced training and ongoing supervision is still likely necessary to successfully and sustainably implement pulse oximetry in a non-study LRS settings. We recommend future pulse oximetry usability testing studies in LRS to use a HCD process that incorporates feedback from field experts and end-users. We additionally recommend future usability studies to use time to a successful SpO 2 measurement as the standard for assessing implementation feasibility of oximeter devices in LRS. Next steps could focus on developing low-cost LRS pediatric pulse oximeters as specialized spot-check devices with high motion tolerance that display the most reliable, single SpO 2 reading for easier HCW interpretation.

### Pulse oximetry curves in healthy children living at moderate altitude: a cross-sectional study from the ecuadorian andes [^ab7f4ef0]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The use of pulse oximetry is advised in order to increase detection of hypoxemia, considering normal SpO2 range values ​​at higher altitudes. Some studies that reported SpO2 measurements by average have showed SpO2 value is close to 99% at sea level and appears to decrease to 97% after 1500 to 1600 m a.s.l. Furthermore, at 3000 m a.s.l, mean SpO2 values ​​of 89.6% or even 85.7% have been reported. Lozano et al. at Bogotá-Colombia (2600 m a.s.l) have reported mean SpO2 value of 93.3% (SD 2.05%) and Nicholas et al. at Colorado-USA (2800 m a.s.l) of 91.7% (SD 2.1%). Because SpO2 levels are not normally distributed, it seems appropriate to report the data in median values ​​and percentile values. We present a curve with the medians and 5th and 2.5th percentiles of SpO2 of children from 1 month to 12 years permanent residents in the city of Quito, at 2810 m a.s.l. We did not find significant differences by children age or sex.

### Performance of a novel reusable pediatric pulse oximeter probe [^14788b44]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypoxemia, an oxygen saturation (SpO 2) less than 90%, is a considerable risk for child pneumonia mortality in low‐middle income countries (LMIC). 1 Pulse oximetry allows for accurate and noninvasive diagnosis of hypoxemia, but in the absence of oximetry, health providers rely on clinical observations to diagnose severe pneumonia and determine the need for oxygen therapy. 2 Clinical signs lack accuracy in predicting hypoxemia with pulse oximetry identifying 20% to 30% more hypoxemic cases than clinical signs alone. 3, 4, 5 Additionally, identifying clinical signs of severe pneumonia, often by nonphysician clinicians or community health workers, remains inconsistent and unreliable. 6, 7, 8, 9

Given oxygen availability, universal implementation of pulse oximetry in the 15 highest pneumonia burden countries could avert 148 000 deaths annually. 10 Despite this, evidence on the uptake of pulse oximetry in LMIC is limited. Available estimates suggests it remains low, ranging from less than 30% to more than 70% across different LMIC settings. 11, 12 There are examples of pulse oximeter implementation being feasible in LMIC settings, including Malawi and Nigeria, and resulting in improved referral decision‐making. 13, 14 Barriers to wider implementation include cost, lack of training and supervision, and lack of robust pulse oximeters and probes. In pediatric populations additional barriers include the lack of a high‐quality, reusable, low‐cost probe that fits all ages of children and is tolerant to movement. 15

### Pulse oximetry screening for congenital heart defects in newborn infants (pulseOx): a test accuracy study [^dca7350f]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Screening for congenital heart defects relies on antenatal ultrasonography and postnatal clinical examination; however, life-threatening defects often are not detected. We prospectively assessed the accuracy of pulse oximetry as a screening test for congenital heart defects.

Methods

In six maternity units in the UK, asymptomatic newborn babies (gestation > 34 weeks) were screened with pulse oximetry before discharge. Infants who did not achieve predetermined oxygen saturation thresholds underwent echocardiography. All other infants were followed up to 12 months of age by use of regional and national registries and clinical follow-up. The main outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of pulse oximetry for detection of critical congenital heart defects (causing death or requiring invasive intervention before 28 days) or major congenital heart disease (causing death or requiring invasive intervention within 12 months of age).

Findings

20,055 newborn babies were screened and 53 had major congenital heart disease (24 critical), a prevalence of 2·6 per 1000 livebirths. Analyses were done on all babies for whom a pulse oximetry reading was obtained. Sensitivity of pulse oximetry was 75·00% (95% CI 53·29–90·23) for critical cases and 49·06% (35·06–63·16) for all major congenital heart defects. In 35 cases, congenital heart defects were already suspected after antenatal ultrasonography, and exclusion of these reduced the sensitivity to 58·33% (27·67–84·83) for critical cases and 28·57% (14·64–46·30) for all cases of major congenital heart defects. False-positive results were noted for 169 (0·8%) babies (specificity 99·16%, 99·02–99·28), of which six cases were significant, but not major, congenital heart defects, and 40 were other illnesses that required urgent medical intervention.

Interpretation

Pulse oximetry is a safe, feasible test that adds value to existing screening. It identifies cases of critical congenital heart defects that go undetected with antenatal ultrasonography. The early detection of other diseases is an additional advantage.

### Pulse oximetry curves in healthy children living at moderate altitude: a cross-sectional study from the ecuadorian andes [^1d7e36f4]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In populations above 3,000 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.) normal values of oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 90% have been reported. Few studies have been conducted in cities of moderate altitude (between 2,500 and 3,000 m a.s.l). We set out to describe the range of SpO2 values measured with a pulse oximeter in healthy children between 1 month and 12 years of age living in an Ecuadorian Andean city.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was carried out in Quito, Ecuador, located at 2,810 m a.s.l. SpO2 measurement in healthy children of ages ranging from 1 month to 12 years of age residents in the city were recorded by pulse oximetry. Age and gender were recorded, and median and 2.5th and 5th percentile were drawn. Non parametric tests were used to compare differences in SpO2 values by age and gender.

Results

1,378 healthy children were included for the study, 719 (52.2%) males. The median SpO2 for the entire population was 94.5%. No differences were observed between SpO2 median values by age and gender. The 2.5th percentile for global SpO2 measurements was 90%, in children under 5 years of age was 91% and it was 90% in children older than 7.

Conclusions

Our results provide SpO2 values for healthy children from 1 to 12 years old residents in Quito, a city of moderate altitude. The SpO2 percentile curve could contribute as a healthy range for the clinical evaluation of children residing at this altitude.

### Accuracy of pulse oximetry in children [^f01f40a0]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

For children with cyanotic congenital heart disease or acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, providers frequently make decisions based on pulse oximetry, in the absence of an arterial blood gas. The study objective was to measure the accuracy of pulse oximetry in the saturations from pulse oximetry (SpO2) range of 65% to 97%.

Methods

This institutional review board-approved prospective, multicenter observational study in 5 PICUs included 225 mechanically ventilated children with an arterial catheter. With each arterial blood gas sample, SpO2 from pulse oximetry and arterial oxygen saturations from CO-oximetry (SaO2) were simultaneously obtained if the SpO2 was ≤ 97%.

Results

The lowest SpO2 obtained in the study was 65%. In the range of SpO2 65% to 97%, 1980 simultaneous values for SpO2 and SaO2 were obtained. The bias (SpO2 - SaO2) varied through the range of SpO2 values. The bias was greatest in the SpO2 range 81% to 85% (336 samples, median 6%, mean 6.6%, accuracy root mean squared 9.1%). SpO2 measurements were close to SaO2 in the SpO2 range 91% to 97% (901 samples, median 1%, mean 1.5%, accuracy root mean squared 4.2%).

Conclusions

Previous studies on pulse oximeter accuracy in children present a single number for bias. This study identified that the accuracy of pulse oximetry varies significantly as a function of the SpO2 range. Saturations measured by pulse oximetry on average overestimate SaO2 from CO-oximetry in the SpO2 range of 76% to 90%. Better pulse oximetry algorithms are needed for accurate assessment of children with saturations in the hypoxemic range.

### Role of pulse oximetry in examining newborns for congenital heart disease: a scientific statement from the AHA and AAP [^ea8e1c9a]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this statement is to address the state of evidence on the routine use of pulse oximetry in newborns to detect critical congenital heart disease (CCHD).

Methods and Results

A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics reviewed the available literature addressing current detection methods for CCHD, burden of missed and/or delayed diagnosis of CCHD, rationale of oximetry screening, and clinical studies of oximetry in otherwise asymptomatic newborns. MEDLINE database searches from 1966 to 2008 were done for English-language papers using the following search terms: congenital heart disease, pulse oximetry, physical examination, murmur, echocardiography, fetal echocardiography, and newborn screening. The reference lists of identified papers were also searched. Published abstracts from major pediatric scientific meetings in 2006 to 2008 were also reviewed. The American Heart Association classification of recommendations and levels of evidence for practice guidelines were used. In an analysis of pooled studies of oximetry assessment performed after 24 hours of life, the estimated sensitivity for detecting CCHD was 69.6%, and the positive predictive value was 47.0%; however, sensitivity varied dramatically among studies from 0% to 100%. False-positive screens that required further evaluation occurred in only 0.035% of infants screened after 24 hours.

Conclusions

Currently, CCHD is not detected in some newborns until after their hospital discharge, which results in significant morbidity and occasional mortality. Furthermore, routine pulse oximetry performed on asymptomatic newborns after 24 hours of life, but before hospital discharge, may detect CCHD. Routine pulse oximetry performed after 24 hours in hospitals that have on-site pediatric cardiovascular services incurs very low cost and risk of harm. Future studies in larger populations and across a broad range of newborn delivery systems are needed to determine whether this practice should become standard of care in the routine assessment of the neonate.

2.5 Analysis

The primary outcome was the difference in time to a plausible SpO 2 reading between L + M and M + M, based on a cross‐over design. The primary analysis approach was testing equivalence, defined as ± 10 seconds in the mean time to successful measurement (ie, a measurement between 50 and 70 seconds is equivalent to 60 seconds). We chose equivalence, rather than noninferiority, as we did not hypothesize that M + M would necessarily outperform the L + M combination. We deemed ± 10 seconds to be a pragmatic range that would not significantly impact routine care in a busy LMIC pediatric setting. We evaluated this through two one‐sided t tests, using the ‐ tostt ‐ command in Stata 14. 20 The comparison between L + M and M + M took into account the paired nature of the data.

A post hoc secondary analysis was conducted to compare the M + M measurements to historical L + L measurements, using the same definition of equivalence. Additionally, we described the median time to SpO 2, and proportion of SpO 2 readings within less than 1, 2, and 5 minutes, and conducted a multivariable analysis to examine factors associated with a successful SpO 2 in less than 1 and 2 minutes, with robust standard errors to account for clustering at the participant level. These models included, probe and box combination, order of the measurement, child's condition, age, and weight. Other potential confounders were investigated for an association between testing rounds and were included if there was a difference. All analyses were conducted using Stata 14.

2.6 Ethics

This study was approved by the National Health Science Research Committee of Malawi (ref: 16/4/1570), University College London (ref: 8075/003), and Johns Hopkins (IRB00047406). Verbal consent was obtained from all caregivers.

### AARC clinical practice guidelines: capillary blood gas sampling for neonatal and pediatric patients [^9f8a04dd]. Respiratory Care (2022). High credibility.

Capillary blood gas sampling (CBGS) — indications in neonatal and pediatric patients are that it is indicated when arterial blood gas analysis is indicated but arterial access is not available, when noninvasive monitor readings are abnormal (transcutaneous values, end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry), when assessment of initiation, administration, or change in therapeutic modalities (ie, mechanical ventilation) is indicated, when a change in patient status is detected by history or physical assessment, and when monitoring the severity and progression of a documented disease process is desirable.

### Cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring in hospitalized children: a Delphi process [^cf4c8851]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring in children who are hospitalized should balance benefits of detecting deterioration with potential harms of alarm fatigue. We developed recommendations for monitoring outside the ICU on the basis of available evidence and expert opinion.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive literature search for studies addressing the utility of cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring in common pediatric conditions and drafted candidate monitoring recommendations based on our findings. We convened a panel of nominees from national professional organizations with diverse expertise: nursing, medicine, respiratory therapy, biomedical engineering, and family advocacy. Using the RAND/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method, panelists rated recommendations for appropriateness and necessity in 3 sequential rating sessions and a moderated meeting.

Results

The panel evaluated 56 recommendations for intermittent and continuous monitoring for children hospitalized outside the ICU with 7 common conditions (eg, asthma, croup) and/or receiving common therapies (eg, supplemental oxygen, intravenous opioids). The panel reached agreement on the appropriateness of monitoring recommendations for 55 of 56 indications and on necessity of monitoring for 52. For mild or moderate asthma, croup, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, the panel recommended intermittent vital sign or oximetry measurement only. The panel recommended continuous monitoring for severe disease in each respiratory condition as well as for a new or increased dose of intravenous opiate or benzodiazepine.

Conclusions

Expert panel members agreed that intermittent vital sign assessment, rather than continuous monitoring, is appropriate management for a set of specific conditions of mild or moderate severity that require hospitalization.

2.4 Data collection

All measurements were conducted by physicians with expertize in pediatric pulse oximetry (TM, EDM, KS, BZ, and NB), following training in the study protocol. For the cross‐over study, two pulse oximetry readings were conducted per child, separated by a 5‐minute washout period, allowing the child to settle and reduce potential measurement bias by the tester. The order in which the probes were used was randomly assigned using a random number generator at the point of testing, within the ODK software used for data collection. 18

The measurement procedure was the same for L + L and the cross‐over study. The tester placed the probe on the foot, toe, or finger of the child, depending on age and weight (Box 1 and Figure 1). An independent observer, a researcher who had received training in the study protocol and was experienced in pulse oximetry but not necessarily clinically qualified, recorded the time from when probe placement was completed to a biologically plausible reading announced by the tester, by them stating "stop". Biologically plausible was defined as having an age appropriate pulse rate above the approximate 10th centile for age, 19 and a consistent waveform or quality signal, depending on the oximeter box. The observer noted the condition of the child, location of probe placement, number of adjustments, and any issues during the measurement. Neither the tester, observer, or participants were blinded due to the nature of the measurement; however, randomization was done at the point of testing after a participant was recruited, and the tester could not see the timer during measurements.
