## Question

Jefferson has 56 bananas, while Walter, his friend, has 1/4 times fewer bananas. If they decide to combine their bananas and share them equally between themselves, how many bananas does Walter get?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many bananas Walter gets if Jefferson has 56 bananas, Walter has 1/4 times fewer bananas, and they combine and share equally. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "1/4 times fewer" means mathematically. Then, I should calculate Walter's actual banana count. Next, I will add Jefferson's and Walter's bananas to get the total. Finally, I will divide the total by 2 to find Walter's share and double-check the wording to ensure I'm not misinterpreting the phrase.

> Let me first confirm the interpretation of "1/4 times fewer". Wait, let me verify the phrasing: "1/4 times fewer" typically means subtracting one quarter of the reference amount from the reference amount, which is equivalent to multiplying by 3/4, so Walter has 3/4 of Jefferson's bananas, not 1/4 of Jefferson's bananas. I should double-check that this aligns with common usage before proceeding.

> Now, I will calculate Walter's bananas. If Jefferson has 56 bananas, then Walter has 56 minus 1/4 of 56, which is 56 × (1 − 1/4) = 56 × 3/4 = 42 bananas. Hold on, I should verify the arithmetic: 56 divided by 4 is 14, and 56 minus 14 is indeed 42, so Walter has 42 bananas.

> Next, I should add the two amounts to get the total. Jefferson has 56 and Walter has 42, so the total is 56 + 42 = 98 bananas. Let me reconsider to ensure I didn't miscount: 50 + 40 is 90, plus 6 + 2 is 8, so 98 is correct.

> Finally, I will divide the total equally. 98 bananas shared equally is 98 ÷ 2 = 49 bananas each. Therefore, Walter gets 49 bananas. I should confirm that this answers the question as asked, and yes, it specifies Walter's final share after combining and splitting equally.

---

Walter has **42 bananas** initially (1/4 fewer than Jefferson's 56). When combined, there are 98 bananas total, and if shared equally, Walter gets **49 bananas**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: Calculate Walter's initial number of bananas

Jefferson has 56 bananas. Walter has **1/4 times fewer**, which means Walter has 3/4 as many bananas as Jefferson.

Calculation:

Walter's bananas = 56 − [1/4] × 56 = 56 − 14 = 42

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of bananas

Combine Jefferson's and Walter's bananas:

Total bananas = 56 + 42 = 98

---

### Step 3: Divide the total equally between Jefferson and Walter

Equal division gives each person:

Each person's share = [98/2] = 49

---

## Final answer

Walter gets **49 bananas** when the total is shared equally.

### The banana (musa acuminata) genome and the evolution of monocotyledonous plants [^f6f2510c]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Bananas (Musa spp.), including dessert and cooking types, are giant perennial monocotyledonous herbs of the order Zingiberales, a sister group to the well-studied Poales, which include cereals. Bananas are vital for food security in many tropical and subtropical countries and the most popular fruit in industrialized countries. The Musa domestication process started some 7,000 years ago in Southeast Asia. It involved hybridizations between diverse species and subspecies, fostered by human migrations, and selection of diploid and triploid seedless, parthenocarpic hybrids thereafter widely dispersed by vegetative propagation. Half of the current production relies on somaclones derived from a single triploid genotype (Cavendish). Pests and diseases have gradually become adapted, representing an imminent danger for global banana production. Here we describe the draft sequence of the 523-megabase genome of a Musa acuminata doubled-haploid genotype, providing a crucial stepping-stone for genetic improvement of banana. We detected three rounds of whole-genome duplications in the Musa lineage, independently of those previously described in the Poales lineage and the one we detected in the Arecales lineage. This first monocotyledon high-continuity whole-genome sequence reported outside Poales represents an essential bridge for comparative genome analysis in plants. As such, it clarifies commelinid-monocotyledon phylogenetic relationships, reveals Poaceae-specific features and has led to the discovery of conserved non-coding sequences predating monocotyledon-eudicotyledon divergence.

### Banana fruit: an "appealing" alternative for practicing suture techniques in resource-limited settings [^773862e2]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Suturing is an important core surgical competency that requires continued practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate bananas as a medium for practicing suture techniques in resource-limited settings.

Materials and Methods

Using a crossover design, 20 University of Rwanda medical students practiced suturing on banana peels and commercial foam boards. Students were randomized into 2 groups: group A practiced on foam boards first and then bananas, and group B practiced on banana peels first and then foam boards. A post-workshop survey was then administered to students to gauge their attitude towards banana peels as a suturing practice material. Suture performance for each student was graded by three fellowship-trained facial plastic surgeons based on consistent spacing, knot location, appropriate knot, absence of air knots, and adequate bite size.

Results

Suture performance graded by facial plastic surgeons demonstrated that suturing outcomes with bananas were equal or superior to foam in 56.7% of instances. Twenty students participated in the workshop; 16 students responded to the survey (response rate = 80%). Students were comfortable practicing suturing with banana peels (Mdn = 4, IQR = 1) and strongly agreed that suturing banana peels was a useful activity (Mdn = 5, IQR = 1). Students thought banana peels and foam were comparable learning platforms (Mdn = 3.5, IQR = 1) and felt their suturing abilities improved with practice on banana peels (Mdn = 4, IQR = 1.3).

Conclusions

Banana peels are a low cost, equally viable alternative to synthetic suture media.

### Allowing autonomous agents freedom [^db3fed24]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Living-donor kidney transplantation is the "gold standard" treatment for many individuals with end-stage renal failure. Superior outcomes for the graft and the transplant recipient have prompted the implementation of new strategies promoting living-donor kidney transplantation, and the number of such transplants has increased considerably over recent years. Living donors are undoubtedly exposed to risk. In his editorial "underestimating the risk in living kidney donation", Walter Glannon suggests that more data on long-term outcomes for living donors are needed to determine whether this risk is permissible and the extent to which physicians and transplant surgeons should promote living-donor kidney transplantation. In this paper I argue that it is not clear that medical professionals have underestimated this risk, nor is it clear that more data on long-term outcomes are needed in order to determine whether it is permissible for individual autonomous agents to expose themselves to this or, indeed, any risk. The global shortage of organs available for transplantation ultimately means that every year thousands of individuals who value their life die needlessly. This is an unacceptable loss of human life. Saving life is one of the most wonderful things an individual can do for another. Promoting any strategy that will assist in saving life and preventing human suffering within acceptable moral limits is legitimate.

### Principles for allocation of scarce medical interventions [^0efbae16]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Allocation of very scarce medical interventions such as organs and vaccines is a persistent ethical challenge. We evaluate eight simple allocation principles that can be classified into four categories: treating people equally, favouring the worst-off, maximising total benefits, and promoting and rewarding social usefulness. No single principle is sufficient to incorporate all morally relevant considerations and therefore individual principles must be combined into multiprinciple allocation systems. We evaluate three systems: the United Network for Organ Sharing points systems, quality-adjusted life-years, and disability-adjusted life-years. We recommend an alternative system-the complete lives system-which prioritises younger people who have not yet lived a complete life, and also incorporates prognosis, save the most lives, lottery, and instrumental value principles.

### Heterogeneity of banana allergy: characterization of allergens in banana-allergic patients [^34ca20f3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Banana is a frequent cause of food allergy, particularly in latex-sensitized patients.

Objective

The aim of the study was to get insights in immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibody responses of patients with a history of allergic reaction to banana but not to latex.

Methods

In four patients who complained about symptoms after banana consumption, skin prick tests (SPTs) with aeroallergens, latex, banana, avocado, and kiwi were performed. Total and specific serum IgE to birch pollen, rBet v 1 and rBet v 2, latex, banana, avocado, and kiwi were determined by the CAP method (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). Allergens were identified by immunoblotting with banana extract and recombinant banana profilin. Two patients underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) with banana.

Results

All patients showed a positive SPT to banana, and three were IgE-CAP positive (≥ class 2). Two patients were also sensitized (SPT and CAP) to latex, avocado, kiwi, and birch pollen. In the immunoblot these two patients' sera reacted to 32- to 34-kDa proteins, which had already been described as major banana allergens. In both patients banana allergy was confirmed by DBPCFC. The third patient also had a sensitization to avocado, but not to latex or pollen. Immunoblot analysis detected a single band at 70 kDa. The fourth patient was sensitized to birch pollen, rBet v 1 and rBet v 2, but not to latex. Immunoblot analysis in this patient's serum was positive with recombinant banana profilin.

Conclusions

The relevance of banana as a source of food allergy was confirmed in two patients by DBPCFC. In 1 of 2 patients, in whom banana allergy was not a consequence of latex sensitization, a 70-kDa protein was identified as a banana allergen, and in the other patient profilin was detected as a putative cross-reactive allergen.

Butterflies

We sampled butterflies with fruit traps and time-standardized netting between August and December 2018. We baited fruit traps with fermented bananas and deployed the cylindrical nets for 24 h. Before deployment, we fermented bananas for 48 h in an air-tight container.

On each plot, we installed a total of 8 fruit traps. We deployed four fruit traps at 16.6 m distance from the plot center in the four main cardinal directions and the other four fruit traps at 20 m distance from the center in the four intercardinal directions. We used fish lines covered with vaseline creme to hang the fruit traps. The Vaseline prevented ants to intrude on the fruit traps. In addition, we avoided any contact with branches on the fruit traps. We caught butterflies with a fruit trap with a 20 cm Cone Opening (90 cm long hanging 1.5 m above the ground. On plots without trees, we installed fruit traps on a support stick (in rice paddy and herbaceous fallow). During the 30 min time-standardized netting, we caught butterflies within an imaginary 2 m wide box to each side of the net while walking at a slow and steady speed in a zig-zag to equally cover the plot area. The net had a circular frame with a nylon mesh on a 1.5 m telescopic handle. We performed the timestandardized netting in dry and low-wind conditions only, either in the morning (8 a.m. to 12 p.m.) or in the afternoon (1 p.m. to 5 p.m.). We then collected and dried all captured butterflies and identified them to species level in the laboratory (moths excluded). Identification was done by Annemarie Wurz, David Lees and Sáfián Szabolcs. We categorized endemic butterflies as species/morphospecies only occurring in the country of Madagascar and updated with expert consultation by David Lees. All identified specimens remain at the insect collection in the Department of Crop Sciences, section Agroecology, University of Göttingen, Germany. Overall, we found 84 butterfly species of which 49 species (58%) were endemic to Madagascar.

### Unravelling genomic drivers of speciation in musa through genome assemblies of wild banana ancestors [^b28e574d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The tropical South Asia region stands out as one of the world's most species-rich areas, a biodiversity hotspot shaped by its intricate tectonic and climatic history. Bananas are native from this region and belong to the genus Musa which is estimated to comprise 70 species. Natural inter(sub)specific hybridization between different wild Musa species and subspecies – is at the origin of current banana cultivars. These cultivars are vegetatively propagated and can be diploid, triploid and sometimes tetraploid. Banana domestication occurred several thousand years ago with parthenocarpy and sterility as main targets, which ensured the production of seedless edible fruits. Nowadays, bananas are popular fruits worldwide and a vital staple food in many tropical and subtropical countries.

Recent advances in banana genomics have led to considerable progress in our understanding of the complex origin of banana cultivars. They revealed that cultivar genomes are complex mosaics involving several species and subspecies. Based on these ancestral genome mosaic and on cultivars geographical distribution, the initial steps of banana domestication were proposed to involve hybridizations between M. acuminata ssp. banksii (and possibly ssp. zebrina) and M. schizocarpa in New Guinea. Then, during the diffusion of early cultivars throughout Southeast Asia, additional hybridizations occurred with other local wild Musa species and subspecies, including M. a. ssp. zebrina (in Java), M. a. ssp. malaccensis (Malayan Peninsula, Sumatra), M. a. ssp. burmannica (in Southern Indo-Burma), M. balbisiana (in India to South China and probably up to the Philippines) and two unknown contributors. These successive steps of hybridization resulted in cultivars with increasing genome complexity obtained from recombination between three to up to seven of nine ancestral contributors, including 4 subspecies of M. acuminata (A genome, 2 n = 2x = 22), M. balbisiana (B genome, 2 n = 2x = 22) and M. schizocarpa (S genome, 2 n = 2x = 22) and two unknown ancestors – (Fig. 1). In addition, a peculiar small group of Fe'i cultivars from Oceania derived only from Musa species of the former Australimusa section (T genome, 2 n = 2x = 20). Large chromosomal rearrangements, i.e. reciprocal translocation and/or inversion, were described in some of these contributing species or subspecies and were transmitted to many cultivars –.

### Unravelling genomic drivers of speciation in musa through genome assemblies of wild banana ancestors [^e13db418]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Hybridization between wild Musa species and subspecies from Southeast Asia is at the origin of cultivated bananas. The genomes of these cultivars are complex mosaics involving nine genetic groups, including two previously unknown contributors. This study provides continuous genome assemblies for six wild genetic groups, one of which represents one of the unknown ancestor, identified as M.acuminata ssp. halabanensis. The second unknown ancestor partially present in a seventh assembly appears related to M. a. ssp. zebrina. These assemblies provide key resources for banana genetics and for improving cultivar assemblies, including that of the emblematic triploid Cavendish. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses reveal an ongoing speciation process within Musa, characterised by large chromosome rearrangements and centromere differentiation through the integration of different types of repeated sequences, including rDNA tandem repeats. This speciation process may have been favoured by reproductive isolation related to the particular context of climate and land connectivity fluctuations in the Southeast Asian region.

### Banana leaves as an alternative wound dressing [^388cb70c]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a need for cheap and efficacious wound dressings in developing countries. Banana leaves have been described as an excellent, inexpensive, easily available dressing material in tropical countries. As a natural product, banana leaves are heavily contaminated with various pathogens that must be removed before they can be used as wound dressings, but effective sterilization methods that do not affect the beneficial wound-dressing properties of banana leaves have not been described.

Objectives

To study different sterilization methods and determine which can be used on banana leaves without affecting their beneficial wound-dressing properties.

Materials and Methods

We first compared the use of different decontamination techniques to reduce the natural microflora of the leaves and then tested the wound-dressing properties of the leaves in a mouse model of skin transplantation and in postsurgical patients in Uganda, Africa.

Results

Steam sterilization proved to be the optimal sterilization technique. Banana leaves displayed wound-dressing properties that equaled those of petroleum jelly gauze dressings and were tested successfully in a clinical setting in postsurgical patients in Uganda, Africa.

Conclusion

We found banana leaves to be an excellent alternative wound dressing, combining the desirable properties of modern wound-dressing material with low cost.

### The banana project: a qualitative study of caregivers' and teachers' experiences of preschool children participating in a free banana school fruit scheme in rural tanzania [^ec240775]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

The experiences of TBP may be explained by the fact that it has been implemented for more than 6 years. Previous studies showed that SFS over time significantly improved children's nutrition. Another aspect of long-term sustainability might be related to bananas being provided as free nutritional support. Two studies from Norway found that providing free fruits to pupils at no cost to the parents is an effective strategy to improve children's fruit and vegetable intake. A systematic review and meta-analysis presented the same improvement in intake but argued for more research on all steps in the fruit and vegetable distribution interventions. To increase and optimise the fidelity of and research on the interventions, one suggestion is to implement a process evaluation in the planning, implementation and outcome of the interventions. To decrease undernutrition and increase the intake of fruits and vegetables, another aspect is to include and coordinate multiple sectors at the national, regional and local level. This coordination must include the education sector, caregivers, communities and gender equity. The findings from this simple and cost-efficient health promotion intervention may contribute to the establishment of other SFS in low-income and middle-income countries, especially knowing that children's development depends on adequate nutrition, nurturant caregiving and learning opportunities.

Study strengths and limitations

A strength of this study is that it evaluates an SFS in a low-income country where nutritional balance is a challenge. Studies like this from Sub-Saharan Africa are limited, but of importance in achieving SDG 2 in the region. Another strength is the focus on the experiences of the caregivers and teachers, as they are a determining factor for the sustainability of an SFS initiative.

Several factors might, however, limit the interpretation of the findings. Although 16 interviews may be considered adequate, only 2 of them were with teachers, making the caregivers' perspective dominant. However, this was expected because a limited number of teachers were eligible owing to the inclusion criterion of regular contact with the children.

Moreover, language barriers and use of an interpreter create a risk of misinterpretation and misunderstanding in the interview process. However, a senior research scientist from the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanga validated the first audio recordings and transcriptions of interviews to minimise the risk.

In the absence of an alternative, the recruitment of the caregivers by the head preschool teacher could potentially impair their independence concerning the image of the school or TBP. However, the teacher was not involved in the data collection process with the caregivers.

### Banana streak virus is very diverse in Uganda [^663afb1b]. Virus Research (2004). Low credibility.

Banana streak virus (BSV) is a badnavirus that causes a viral leaf streak disease of banana and plantain (Musa spp.). Identified in essentially all Musa growing areas of the world, it has a deleterious effect on the productivity of infected plants as well as being a major constraint to Musa breeding programmes and germplasm dissemination. Banana is a staple food in Uganda which is, per capita, one of the worlds largest banana producers and consumers. BSV was isolated from infected plants sampled across the Ugandan Musa growing area and the isolates were analysed using molecular and serological techniques. These analyses showed that BSV is very highly variable in Uganda. They suggest that the variability is, in part, due to a series of introductions of banana into Uganda, each with a different complement of infecting viruses.

### Genome-wide association analyses using multilocus models on bananas (musa spp.) reveal candidate genes related to morphology, fruit quality, and yield [^915bb07b]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Bananas (Musa spp.) are an essential fruit worldwide and rank as the fourth most significant food crop for addressing malnutrition due to their rich nutrients and starch content. The potential of their genetic diversity remains untapped due to limited molecular breeding tools. Our study examined a phenotypically diverse group of 124 accessions from the Colombian Musaceae Collection conserved in AGROSAVIA. We assessed 12 traits categorized into morphology, fruit quality, and yield, alongside sequence data. Our sequencing efforts provided valuable insights, with an average depth of about 7× per accession, resulting in 187,133 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) against Musa acuminata (A genome) and 220,451 against Musa balbisiana (B genome). Population structure analysis grouped samples into four and five clusters based on the reference genome. By using different association models, we identified marker–trait associations (MTAs). The mixed linear model revealed four MTAs, while the Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway and fixed and random model for circulating probability unification models identified 82 and 70 MTAs, respectively. We identified 38 and 40 candidate genes in linkage proximity to significant MTAs for the A genome and B genome, respectively. Our findings provide insights into the genetic underpinnings of morphology, fruit quality, and yield. Once validated, the SNP markers and candidate genes can potentially drive advancements in genomic-guided breeding strategies to enhance banana crop improvement.

Results and discussion

Genome assembly

A combined total of 3.6 million PacBio HiFi reads with an average length of 15,597 bp were generated from two 8 M SMRT cells, resulting in 56.8 Gb of sequence data (∼147× genome coverage) (Supplementary Table 1). For the two parents, "OSU252.146" and "OSU414.062", 295 and 218 million PE 150 bp Illumina reads were generated, yielding 44 Gb (115× coverage) and 32 Gb (85× coverage), respectively (Supplementary Table 1). These reads were used to generate hifiasm trio binned haploid genome assemblies spanning 385,825,918 bp and 372,534,284 bp, containing 663 and 229 contigs for haplotype 1 and 2, with N50s of 23.4 Mb and 22.5 Mb, respectively (Table 1).

Table 1.
Summary statistics for the assembled C. avellana "Jefferson" genomes.

The hifiasm haplotype assemblies were used as inputs to the chromosome scaffolding process. Hi-C sequencing of "Jefferson" generated ∼428 million PE 150 bp reads, for a total yield of ∼64.6 Gb (168 × coverage, Supplementary Table 1). The resulting "Jefferson V4' Hi-C scaffolded genome assemblies of each haplotype consisted of 11 pseudo-chromosomal scaffolds. The chromosome-level assemblies spanned a total length of 349,702,244 bp and 352,009,510 bp for haplotype 1 and haplotype 2, an N50 of 32.5 Mb and 32.4 Mb (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2). The Hi–C interaction matrix clearly differentiated between individual chromosomes in both haplotype assemblies wherein the diagonal pattern of the heat map shows that the frequency of interactions within a chromosome is high but low between chromosomes with no spill over (Fig. 1a and b). Alignment of parental reads to each genome assembly haplotype showed that the majority of reads from "OSU 252.146" aligned to haplotype 2, whereas the majority of reads from "OSU 414.062" aligned to haplotype 1 (Supplementary Table 3). BUSCO results in genome mode showed that both chromosome-level haplotype genome assemblies were of high, comparable quality and captured > 97% of conserved genes in the Embryophyta dataset (Table 2).

### Consortium sandbox: building and sharing resources [^9ce5a930]. Science Translational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Some common challenges of biomedical product translation-scientific, regulatory, adoption, and reimbursement-can best be addressed by the broad sharing of resources or tools. But, such aids remain undeveloped because the undertaking requires expertise from multiple research sectors as well as validation across organizations. Biomedical resource development can benefit from directed consortia-a partnership framework that provides neutral and temporary collaborative environments for several, oftentimes competing, organizations and leverages the aggregated intellect and resources of stakeholders so as to create versatile solutions. By analyzing 369 biomedical research consortia, we tracked consortia growth around the world and gained insight into how this partnership model advances biomedical research. Our analyses suggest that research-by-consortium provides benefit to biomedical science, but the model needs further optimization before it can be fully integrated into the biomedical research pipeline.

### Secrets of the goo: the genome assembly of the pacific banana slug, ariolimax columbianus [^4af7c8cf]. The Journal of Heredity (2025). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Banana slugs, Ariolimax, are found across the coastal foothills and mountains of Western North America from Southern California to Alaska. These hermaphroditic molluscs are synonymous with coastal redwood forests, but range broadly across wet forest habitats. They are the largest terrestrial slug in North America, with lengths exceeding 26 cm, and are notable for their striking yellow coloration. Within California, the genus includes up to six species: Ariolimax brachyphallus, Ariolimax buttoni, Ariolimax californicus, Ariolimax columbianus, Ariolimax dolichophallus, and Ariolimax stramineus. The genus Ariolimax was established in 1859 with A. columbianus as the type species. The genus was initially characterized in California, with species boundaries primarily delineated by phenotypic differences in body size and genital morphology. However, the Pacific banana slug, A. columbianus, is the only species found outside of California, with a range extending from the North Coast of California to Alaska. This species is notably phenotypically diverse; Pacific banana slugs display a range of geographically constrained colors and dappled patterns, including shades of yellow, green, brown, and black (Fig. 1). Consequently, the widely distributed A. columbianus may represent a polyphyletic group, a common occurrence in land snails. The evolutionary and recent population histories, along with environmental conditions that contribute to the phenotypic and genetic variations within the genus, remain poorly understood.

### Bananagram: an alternative to distal loopogram prior to colostomy closure for Hirschsprung disease [^c8956e4d]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In our society, simple reintroduction of stools back through the stoma is culturally unacceptable. Also, in our country, an elderly female relative usually helps with the care of young and sick children, and they show reluctance for procedures such as stool reintroduction if there is a stoma bag. However, both parents and family members were comfortable with bananagram.

Bananagram is a unique, non-invasive procedure. It is performed at the bedside to assess the functional status of the gut lumen. Baaleman et al. observed that a young infant can defecate 0.6–0.8 ounces (17–24 mL) of stool in each defecation. Fully ripe bananas are mashed here to soften their consistency, like fecal matter. A medium-sized ripe yellow banana can make 18–25 mL of mashed banana. The primary site for the absorption of fructose (sugar) from bananas is the small intestine. Yellow bananas are cheap, available throughout the year, functionally inert, and have no tissue reaction to the large gut mucosa. These factors increase parental acceptability. Indeed, 98.5% of parents reported they were satisfied with the procedure because it is cheap and they can avoid a visit to a radiological laboratory.

Velde et al reported a median left CTT of 1.2 hours (0–3.2 hours) in healthy children. However, in patients with a colostomy, Yasuda et al. reported a mean evacuation time after colostomy irrigation of 6 min 56 seconds ± 2 min; they performed a scintigraphic analysis. Karadağ et al. reported that colostomy irrigation usually took 12 min. Colonic evacuation times > 30 min in patients with HSCR with colostomy indicate obstruction either by fecaloma, retained barium, or neurological deficit. In our study, 98.2% of patients passed the mashed banana within 4–30 min. In 1.8% of patients, this was delayed > 30 min, and these patients needed fecaloma removal. Occasionally, CTT can be faster at < 3 min. This may occur due to unusual sensations in the rectum, abnormal sphincter function and hyperperistalsis of the pull-through bowel. However, none of the patients in our study experienced these problems.

### The banana project: a qualitative study of caregivers' and teachers' experiences of preschool children participating in a free banana school fruit scheme in rural tanzania [^d13f1a0d]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2022). High credibility.

Results

Participants

Among the 16 interviewed participants (10 female and 6 male), 14 were caregivers and 2 were teachers. The caregivers represented 17 preschool children aged 3–7 years and had 1–5 children under their responsibility of care. Five caregivers were grandparents who took care of their grandchildren. Generally, the parents were more educated and of higher socioeconomic status than the grandparents, where all were illiterate and three of them had no occupation and three were widows. The reason why preschool children were living with their grandparents was either that they were orphans or that their biological parent(s) had left them for a new relationship/marriage or work in the city. Despite the latter, the grandparents reported little financial support to take care of their grandchild/grandchildren. The major characteristics of the caregivers are presented in table 1.

Table 1
Characteristics of caregivers (n = 14)

The teachers included one single male and one married female teacher. One of them had a diploma in teaching and the other a certificate in children and youth work. Both teachers were aged 31–40 years and had been in the preschool class 2 and 5 years. The analysis of all the interviews with the guardians and teachers resulted in four themes summarised in figure 1.

Figure 1
Caregivers' and teachers' experiences of preschool children's participation in The Banana Project in Tanzania.

The perspectives of the biological parents and those of the grandparents differed in that the grandparents emphasised more the struggle of surviving and the heavy burden of taking care of young children, given their own age, health and limited resources.

The teachers had less experience with children's eating habits, nutritional status and physical health than the caregivers, but had more experience regarding children's energy levels at school, attendance, and cognitive and socioemotional development.

### Genome-wide association analyses using multilocus models on bananas (musa spp.) reveal candidate genes related to morphology, fruit quality, and yield [^0dbe8f8d]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

It is essential to highlight the significant positive correlations between HT and LBW, FL, and ST, as well as between LBW and HW, BH, FL, and ST. These correlations indicate that taller plants have larger leaves that provide the transformation capacity of photoassimilates, forming larger fruit clusters with a high amount of pulp, which is an essential feature for crop yield. The PCA showed that yield traits explained most of the variability in our collection, probably due to the banana domestication process, and yield was of great importance for the farmers. Larger fruits are positively correlated with the presence of thicker peels (PT). Accessions with this characteristic may be interesting for the cellulose fiber industry, which uses banana peels as a biomaterial for paper production. Likewise, FTH is positively correlated with BH and HW, which may indicate that, at longer harvest times, there will be a higher number of hands and weight.

Regarding hierarchical clustering, the groups were differentiated by their genetic variability. AA diploid and AAB triploid bananas formed the first cluster with a distinguished phenotype (Fig. 3). These bananas tend to be consumed fresh or directly due to their pulp characteristics and high sugar content when ripe, consistent with the higher values of pH, TSS, and low organic acid (AT) contents observed. These traits are essential indicators of fruit quality, according to, who evaluated the physicochemical properties of flours and starches of AA diploid and AAA triploid materials, highlighting their importance for fresh consumption. Diploid bananas from cluster one differed from those in the third cluster in variables associated with bunch size, such as FL, PP, and ST. The Sucrier cultivars (AA) are characterized by small fruits with a high PP and thinner peels.found significant differences between the physical characteristics (bunch and fruit size and the number of hands and fingers per hand) of diploid bananas from clusters one and three.

Southern blot analysis

For determination of transgene copy number integration by Southern analysis, total nucleic acid was extractedfrom banana leaf tissue, treated with RNAse A, and 15 μg aliquots of genomic DNA were digested overnight with 20 U of restriction enzyme Hin dIII or Xma I (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37 °C. Digested DNA was electrophoresed through 0.9% agarose gels, transferred to a nylon membrane (Roche), and UV cross-linked. Gene-specific probes were amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) in reaction mixes containing the appropriate primers (Supplementary Table 3), 2 ng of plasmid template and DIG PCR labeling mix (Roche). Hybridization of the probe was done under standard conditionsand detection was achieved using CDP-star (Roche), as per the manufacturer's instructions. X-ray films (Fuji) were exposed for up to 1 h depending on signal intensity and developed manually.

### Genome-wide association analyses using multilocus models on bananas (musa spp.) reveal candidate genes related to morphology, fruit quality, and yield [^6b0cec6c]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

The cluster was separated into stalk, rachis, acorn, hands, and fingers to determine the yield variables (Table 1). The quantification of the data was carried out in triplicate for each accession. The hand's weight (HW) was recorded in grams (g) on a digital scale (Mettler, g ± 0.01). The number of hands on a bunch (BH) was counted, and using the second hand emitted from each bunch, the number of fruits was determined. The fruit or finger length (FL) was measured in cm, selecting three fingers of the second hand of the bunch. The outer arc was measured with a tape measure (precision ± 1 mm) to the apex of the fruit without considering the pedicel. To determine the percentage of pulp dry matter weight (PDW) and the pulp percentage (PP), we used the second hand of the bunch. The PDW was calculated as the difference between the fresh and the dry pulp weight, dehydrated at 105°C for 48 h. The PP was calculated as the difference between the unpeeled and peeled fruit weights. We cut the fruit in half to determine peel thickness (PT) and separated the peel from the pulp. We measured in millimeters (mm) the PT in triplicate with a caliper or Pie King 6′ (0–150 mm) Mitutoyo 530–104 analog.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Using the final list, information was extracted by author TG from each study on country of focus, population group(s), year of publication, methods employed, sample size, and key findings. A tailored data extraction form was used. Each full article was read by multiple authors. We reviewed various HIV and behavioral frameworks to determine which suited the study best based on what themes were emerging while being guided by the social determinants documentation. Meade and Sikkema's theoretical model of HIV risk behavior among adults with mental illness captured a number of the key themes, behaviors and determinants found through our synthesis. Using Karina Walters' term of "indigenization", we "indigenized" Meade and Sikkehma's framework to reflect our findings through an iterative process.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis of human olfactory identification discovers sex-specific and sex-differential genetic variants [^4ea1e82f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Measurement of odour identification

In the four studies, the ability of smell identification was either determined with the Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 (Rhineland Study, LIFE-Adult, ARIC) or the Sniffin' Sticks Screening 16 test (CHRIS). During the test, participants were confronted sequentially with felt-tip pen-like odour dispensing devices containing a specific smell. For each pen, participants had to choose one of four options, with one target and three distractors. Provided options were the same across all studies, and the order of smells was consistent across individuals. In this GWAMA, the twelve odours that intersected across all four studies were investigated: orange, leather, cinnamon, peppermint, banana, lemon, liquorice, coffee, cloves, pineapple, rose and fish. Correct identification was considered as a binary trait, i.e. we combined all wrong answers into one category. We also calculated a global identification score by adding all correct answers, resulting in an integer number between zero and twelve. Pearson correlation coefficients of single odour perceptions were determined in LIFE-Adult.

Determination of Sniffin' stick components

The lists of components of the individual Sniffin' Stick pens were extracted from the safety data sheets provided by manufacturers of the scents used in each pen to the producers of the Sniffin' Stick kits (Burghard Messtechnik GmbH) and subsequently shared with us. It should be noted that reporting of compounds without chemical safety concerns is not mandatory. Thus, the completeness of the stick components list cannot be ensured. It should further be noted that compositions of specific pens have changed over time, further hindering the determination of the exact components (see Supplementary Data 14).

### Sharing the effort of the European green deal among countries [^e6f38248]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Calculation of potential country budgets to 2030 occurs in four steps. The first step is determination of the total EU budget to 2030, given an assumed reduction target compared to historical emission levels, and assumptions on the share of (non)ETS emissions in total EU emissions.

Given an EU effort-sharing sector budget to 2030, the distribution of that budget across countries can be determined based on any number of desired allocation approaches. We develop a number of interpretations, based on (and designed to address) one of the three following equity components: (i) Responsibility, (ii) Capability, and (iii) Equality. We assume that any budget distribution will take into account one interpretation from each equity component, to a varying degree, allowing for combinations of the interpretations. However, before combining them, their individual impact is calculated, as discussed in the section "Description and calculation of interpretations" below.

We first calculate a distribution of emissions as a result of each interpretation, as though the interpretation were the only factor being considered. We then combine the interpretations as described above (using a single interpretation for each equity component) in a weighted combination, with weights of the three chosen interpretations summing to 100%.

In the final step, for each of the possible combinations of interpretations of the equality, responsibility, and capability dimension (i.e. one interpretation from each equity component) we determine the weights among the three that would result in the least deviation from a given reference point. One such reference point is the set of emission reduction targets suggested in the 2018 EU Effort Sharing Regulation (meant to reflect path dependency), the other is a country's upper bound of equity-compatible emissions (the maximum that still could be considered equitable under at least one combination of interpretations across the three dimensions). It should be noted that a common feature for all interpretations is a zero-restriction. A zero-condition is imposed, wherein a country is prohibited from having a positive change in emissions compared to 2005. If the result of a raw interpretation is a positive change, the relevant country is allotted no reduction compared to 2005, and the additional positive allowance initially allocated to it is distributed to all other countries on an equal-per-capita basis. Similarly, we assume that net-negative emissions in 2030 are infeasible, and as such set the maximum required reduction to be 100% of 2005 emissions.

Unless otherwise specified, data was obtained from the EU's EUROSTAT database.

### Sharing the effort of the European green deal among countries [^ee72a7c2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In this work, we present an approach that can contribute to a transparent decision process when partitioning an overall emissions target among subsidiary entities by aligning disparate views and defining an allocation space where different parties could agree to an equitable compromise. It builds upon the categorization of equity principles used in the effort-sharing literature –. For negotiation processes heavily influenced by a range of factors, such as historical path dependencies, side deals, power struggles, different cultures, or domestic politics, such transparency in terms of equity may be a significant factor contributing to success, given the increasing weight of the equity dimension in such negotiations. We assess the implications of the proposed approach — in terms of the resulting emissions budget allocation and corresponding reduction targets — in the context of the European Union (EU) negotiations in 2022 to raise the 2030 effort-sharing target. We first explore the implications of different effort-sharing mechanisms and interpretations of equity or justice on a singular, country level, finding that the resulting ranges of possible emissions reduction burden can vary widely. In such a case, if each country were to favor a different equity interpretation, the overall target of the EU in 2030 would most likely remain unmet. However, our proposed framework allows for systematically combining different interpretations of equity or justice on the basis of three major principles — capability, equality, and responsibility — and allows us to explore situations where country targets are the result of a weighted combination of interpretations of those principles, where member state reductions add up to the overall EU reduction target. In doing so we distinguish interpretations of equity or justice that reflect considerations of equality, capability and responsibility. By identifying weighted combinations of interpretations of these principles that minimize the changes in emission reduction effort required by countries compared to their (i) upper bounds of equity-compatible emissions or, given the practical importance of negotiation history, (ii) previous commitments in the earlier less ambitious effort-sharing agreement, we identify a possible space for decision-making which combines multiple equity interpretations. We find that the possible combinations of equity interpretations, and the strength at which they are applied, result in a wide range of space for decision-making which comprises a richer set of ethical considerations than the 2021 proposed EU approach. We conclude with a discussion of the described framework and its applicability in specific negotiation and policymaking processes, also in other international contexts.

### Banana blossom ingestion does not increase breast milk volume in mothers of preterm newborns: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^34cec94b]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background: Breast milk is essential for the development of a newborn's neurological, gastrointestinal, and immune systems and helps reduce the risk of infections and infant mortality. Banana flowers, often combined with additives such as ginger, are commonly included in the country's local diets because they are believed to enhance postpartum lactation. We aimed to investigate the impact of banana blossom extract pills on breast milk volume (BMV) in mothers of preterm newborns. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted; it involved eligible preterm mothers, who were divided into two groups: a banana blossom group, which received banana blossom extract pills (36 mg/day), and a control group, which received placebo pills. All participants were given identical-looking tablets and were required to chew two tablets four times a day for 14 days. The primary outcome was the total BMV expressed (in milliliters) on the seventh day using an electric breast pump. Results: A total of 70 mothers of premature newborns were randomly allocated in equal numbers to either the banana blossom intervention group or the control group. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the median BMV on the seventh day postpartum (333 versus 350 mL, p = 0.73). A similar trend was observed on the 14th day postpartum (331 versus 510.0 mL, p = 0.6). Additionally, no significant differences were observed regarding maternal and neonatal adverse events. Conclusions: The administration of banana blossom extract pills (36 mg/day) to mothers with preterm infants did not increase the BMV on the seventh day postpartum.

### Treating the banana fold with the dermotuberal Anchorage technique: case report [^c2372c2a]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The banana fold, or the infragluteal fold, is a fat deposit on the posterior thigh close to the gluteal crease and parallel to it. A banana fold may form for different reasons, among which an iatrogenic cause is recurrent. Although banana fold is a common problem, unrelished by most women, few procedures are targeted specifically to fight it. This report presents a severe case of iatrogenic banana fold corrected by a modification of the dermotuberal anchorage buttock-lifting technique, as reported by the author for gluteal ptosis. The operation is performed by tucking in part of the banana fold tissue caudal to the gluteal crease, sliding that tissue, after depithelization, under the buttock, and pulling it up toward the ischial tuberosity until the redundant skin on the posterior thigh is tight and the banana fold is reduced. Assessment of the results 1 year after surgery showed that the technique provided a good scar kept within the subgluteal crease, and that it satisfactorily corrected the patient's major complaint: the banana-shaped fold.

### Sharing the effort of the European green deal among countries [^297425f2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 2 thus indicates how strongly emission reduction obligations change for each EU Member State when following any given principle or their interpretations. It also makes clear that if countries were to choose the consideration and interpretation that indicates the maximum equity-compatible emission level, i.e. the least emission reduction for them, the overall emissions reduction target for the EU for 2030 would be missed by a wide margin, in particular since interpretations can even be found for a majority of countries which would require zero reductions from 2005 levels.

Implementing combinations of equity interpretations

As laid out conceptually in Fig. 1, we can move beyond the use of a single consideration by combining one representative interpretation from each principle (capability, equality, and responsibility). Figure 3 illustrates this for a single illustrative country, Germany, highlighting how systematically varying the weights among the three equity interpretations translates into different 2030 reduction targets. The color gradient in the figure conveys the required emissions reductions (resulting from a weighted combination of one capability, equality and responsibility interpretation) at any given point in the triangle — the location of such points indicates via its distance from the corners by the three axes the relative weighting of the chosen C, E, and R interpretations.

Fig. 3
Equity triangles illustrating the required emission reductions for Germany arising from combinations of equity interpretations, where the weights of the capability, responsibility, and equality interpretations sum to 1.

The isolines indicate emission reduction targets (by 2030, relative to 2005) and are labeled accordingly. For each point on an individual ternary chart, the color indicates the level of emissions reductions required, with yellow corresponding to lower levels, and blue higher. The level at each point is the result of a weighted combination of the three equity interpretations indicated on the chart axes. As an example, a point in the middle of A is the reduction amount given an equal combination of C1-EU-capability, E1-Basic-needs, and R1-Hist-emi. The red lines indicate the EU suggested reduction level in the Fit for 55 proposal — for Germany, −50% — if the value falls within the range of the chart. In B a different equality interpretation is applied (E3- Full-EPC).

### Evolutionary sparse learning reveals the shared genetic basis of convergent traits [^b630c0ee]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Building the candidate protein list

We estimate the Group Sparsity Score (GSS) for every selected protein in every model overall inclusion penalty combinations. GSS is the sum of absolute values of regression coefficients for all the selected positions in the given protein:where R g is the set of binary encoded variable columns belonging to protein g. The higher the GSS, the greater their importance. Proteins not included in the genetic model receive GSS = 0. Each protein g is ranked within each model by its GSS value, denoted as GSS g (j) for model j. The best rank, rank g, best, for protein g across all models is the smallest rank it achieves in any model:where j indexes over all models. To obtain the overall ranking, proteins are ordered by rank g, best with equally ranked proteins being further ordered according to the maximum GSS g they attained in any model GSS g, best. This yields an ordered list of proteins whose convergent sites stand out compared with the rest of the proteome in number, proportion, and strength of the concordance of their convergent site patterns with the species phenotypes, without privileging any one of those considerations.

When each of the input species has at least one sibling species that share its phenotype for the trait being studied, then different combinations of these allowable input species can be used interchangeably, and models over all inclusion penalty combinations can be built for each of the species combinations. GSS g, best is obtained for each protein for each species combination and proteins are then ranked according to the number of combinations in which GSS g, best is non-zero:whereis the indicator function andthe total number of species combinations. Additionally, the number of species combinations where the protein g is ranked in the top positions is counted:whereis the top proportion (0.01 in our analyses), andis the total number of proteins. The final ranking is then obtained as follows:

### When should global health actors prioritise more uncertain interventions? [^30129b74]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Uncertainty and efficiency

In many, but not all, cases, prioritising more certain interventions can produce greater health benefits than prioritising less certain interventions. Global health actors should thus adopt nuanced attitudes towards uncertainty depending on the specific features of a prioritisation decision (panel 1).

Are sceptical prior beliefs warranted?

Holden Karnofsky — a Co-Founder of GiveWell, an organisation that searches for "charities that save or improve lives the most per dollar" — has advocated for prioritising more certain interventions, writing: "we generally prefer to give where we have strong evidence that donations can do a lot of good rather than where we have weak evidence that donations can do far more good". This stance can be justified if one thinks cost-effectiveness analyses should not be taken at face value. When GiveWell undertook a detailed investigation of a cost-effectiveness analysis produced by the Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (second edition) it found that the cost-effectiveness of deworming was greatly over-estimated. Fact checking of this sort rarely occurs, but such inaccuracies should make us question the reliability of this type of analysis for interventions that are harder to assess and verify.

Organisations should thus gauge the expected health benefits of an intervention by combining two pieces of information: an estimate of its cost-effectiveness and an organisation's prior belief about how well it will work. Because cost-effectiveness estimates for some interventions are less reliable than others, organisations need to weigh their prior beliefs more heavily when attempting to predict the true value of more uncertain interventions. Although cost-effectiveness analyses theoretically could incorporate Bayesian adjustments for prior beliefs, in practice, they rarely do.

Karnofsky argues that global health actors should generally be sceptical about novel interventions, as most new interventions will not be among the most cost-effective. Interventions that appear highly cost-effective in one study but are backed by little data are likely to be less cost-effective in practice. If cost-effectiveness estimates are often inaccurate, and if global health actors ought to hold sceptical prior beliefs about the effectiveness of interventions, then prioritising more certain interventions when cost-effectiveness estimates are similar will tend to maximise health benefits.

### Environmental exposures contribute to respiratory and allergic symptoms among women living in the banana growing regions of Costa Rica [^7a96785b]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Respiratory and allergic outcomes

We examined three respiratory outcomes: (1) wheeze, (2) doctor-diagnosed asthma and (3) asthma symptom score based on Sunyer's methodology (a score ranging from 0 to 5 based on the following symptoms: wheezing with shortness of breath in the last 12 months, woken up with a feeling of chest tightness in the last 12 months, attack of shortness of breath at rest in the last 12 months, attack of shortness of breath after exercise in the last 12 months and woken by attack of shortness of breath in the last 12 months). The asthma score was developed using baseline self-reported responses from the health survey and has shown to be predictive of future asthma medication use and airway reactivity follow-up. We chose this as a potential metric of undiagnosed or poorly managed asthma in this medically underserved community. For our statistical analysis, we a priori dichotomised the asthma scores into low (0–1) and high (2–5).

We considered rhinitis, eczema and itchy rash as allergic outcomes. We recognise that these may not all meet the definition of allergy as defined by specific or total IgE. Notably, the questions related to eczema and itchy rash were administered to all (n = 266), whereas the rhinitis question was administered to only 246 women (it was added to the questionnaire after the study visits had started).

### The association between banana consumption and the depressive symptoms in Chinese general adult population: a cross-sectional study [^20f02694]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Banana contains many kinds of substances that are beneficial to depressive symptoms. However, there are no epidemiological researches directly to explore the association between banana consumption and depressive symptoms. This study aimed to investigate whether the banana consumption is related to depressive symptoms in a general adult population.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was performed in 24,673 adults in Tianjin. Banana consumption was evaluated via a validated food frequency questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed by using Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). The association between banana consumption and depressive symptoms was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis.

Results

The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 16.1% in males and 18.4% in females (SDS ≥ 45), respectively. In males, comparing to the reference group (almost never), the multivariable adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals) of depressive symptoms across banana consumption were 0.86 (0.74, 0.99) for < 1 time/week, 0.76 (0.66, 0.88) for 1–3 times/week and 0.97 (0.82, 1.16) for ≥ 4 times/week. By contrast, the multivariable adjusted ORs (95% confidence intervals) were 1.11 (0.94, 1.32) for < 1 time/week, 0.99 (0.85, 1.16) for 1–3 times/week and 1.22 (1.02, 1.46) for ≥ 4 times/week in females. Similar association was observed when other cut-offs (SDS ≥ 48 and 50) were used to define depressive symptoms.

Limitation

This is a cross-sectional study, causality remains unknown.

Conclusion

Findings from this study suggested a negative association between moderate banana consumption and depressive symptoms in males. In females, high banana consumption is positively related to depressive symptoms.

### Quality versus quantity of social ties in experimental cooperative networks [^252d3233]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Results

Structure of online experiments

There is burgeoning interest in using online tools to create virtual labs to evaluate human behaviour. The advantages are many, including the ability to recruit large samples quickly and the ease of conducting many replicates of experimental treatments. Using novel software and recruiting subjects from around the world to a virtual lab via the online labour market Amazon Mechanical Turk, we were able to conduct a series of experiments that spanned the whole range of possible rewiring rates.

We recruited 1,529 unique participants who were randomly assigned to one of nine conditions in a series of 90 realizations of our dynamic network experiments. Each participant was initially assigned a location in a random social network and then given a choice: either cooperate or defect. Participants who cooperate pay 50 units for each network neighbour and each of their neighbours receive 100 units. Participants who defect pay 0 units and their neighbours receive 0 units (each subject's final score accumulated over all rounds was converted into dollars at an exchange rate of $1 = 1,000 units.) Before making each decision, participants were shown their neighbours and (after the first round) the neighbours' previous decisions. They were only allowed to use the same strategy (cooperation or defection) simultaneously with all neighbours; this feature, of course, makes it harder to maintain cooperation because participants are more likely to use a conditional strategy and switch to defection. At the end of each turn, participants were informed about the decisions of their neighbours in that round, along with their own payoff. These interactions were repeated for 15 rounds; to prevent final-round effects, we did not inform participants how many rounds would be played. Individuals were not allowed to participate in the experiment more than once (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. S1).

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^9f543c96]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The severity of this problem's complexity is not additive or linear in nature, but interdependent on all of the sub-problems that need to be solved for this to work. Furthermore, adopting a solution might have unintended, if not non-linear, consequences to the system's overall outcome that were not obvious or foreseeable. For instance, allowing students to use their mobile phones in schools might seem like a good idea to improve class engagement through other media, but an unintended consequence might be distraction or discouraging deeper critical thinking. The objective of the NK space is to capture the complex interaction among activities that yield performance. The NK problem space's popularity in modeling human decision-making stems from its verisimilitude with the complex and multidimensional problems that face problem-solving tasks, and because researchers can easily generate a large number of statistically similar problem spaces for robustness checks. (We note, however, in order to make sure our results are not an artifact of the idiosyncrasies of the NK problem space, we replicated all of our results in another rugged problem space, the Traveling Salesperson Problem — findings available in Supplemental Methods in Supplementary Fig. 2 through 9 and 11).

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

Ending COVID-19: therapeutics

Strengthen connection between pre-clinical evidence and clinical trials.

This second session covered the advances in research on therapeutic compounds, clinical trials investigating therapeutic effect and the key remaining questions (Table 1). Repurposing of existing drugs was identified as a valuable avenue for therapeutics, allowing for efficient use of time and resources, and has the additional advantage of building on existing partnerships with industry. Stronger coordination for large-scale clinical trials is needed to avoid fragmentation and to capitalise on international collaboration, with contextual differences being considered, for example, as they relate to standard of care or prevalent co-morbidities. Standardisation of data collection is imperative to allow for comparisons and pooling of data between studies and regions. Inclusive data sharing policies should safeguard data ownership and autonomy. Innovative adaptive trial methods are instrumental to allow testing of multiple compounds and combinations, as well as different levels of data stratification. Communities should be empowered for involvement in clinical trial decision-making structures.

### Sharing the effort of the European green deal among countries [^e0c02564]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Panel (A) shows the results of implementing C1-EU-GDP per capita for capability, E1-Basic-needs for equality and R1-historic emissions since 1995 for responsibility. Moving from the bottom to the top along the left leg, and thus increasing the weight of capability, increases the reduction target for Germany. The same holds when moving along the base from right to left, thus increasing the weight of responsibility (in this case the relevance of considering historic emissions). Conversely, increasing the weight of equality (i.e. moving down along the right-hand leg) reduces emission reduction targets, as an increase in the weighting of this dimension necessarily decreases the weight of the other two dimensions, each of which we find empirically for Germany to imply stronger reduction target increases. The lightness of the gradient in the bottom right-hand corner, indicating the least required emission reductions, implies that avoiding consideration of both capability and responsibility principles reduces emission reductions to a minimum.

If, however, equality refers to an E3-full equal-per capita budget interpretation, as shown in panel B, combinations of the three equity interpretations that give most weight to the equality dimension (equality corner) lead to the highest emissions reduction in 2030. Shifting the weights among the three dimensions or switching the interpretation used for each corner has a different influence on emission reduction targets depending on the country and interpretations assessed; a set of ternary charts illustrating the effects of changing all interpretations for all countries can be found in the Supplementary Information, section 5, or can be generated via use of an interactive web tool developed for this framework (for details, see).

Calculating the resulting emissions reductions requirement of any given combination of three interpretations for all EU countries provides a wealth of information for countries in terms of their negotiation position — considering the maximum emission points in the charts represent the upper bound of equity-compatible emissions — but also the rate of change in reduction levels as the weighted combination moves away from such a point or isoline. Combining this information on all EU Member States makes possible the identification of possible points of agreement in future effort-sharing negotiations, discussed in further depth in the next section.

### Dynamic SARS-CoV-2 surveillance model combining seroprevalence and wastewater concentrations for post-vaccine disease burden estimates [^7aa6f846]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
The estimated effect of vaccination on incidence in sewersheds of Jefferson County, KY (USA).

The dark green line is the factual SVI 2 RT model estimated incidence (with vaccination), and the light green line is the corresponding counterfactual estimated incidence with vaccination effect zeroed out. The shaded areas represent 95% credible intervals. The panels compare the vaccination effect in Jefferson County (a) as well as stratified by sewershed (b – d).

To obtain estimates of the effects of vaccination on the wastewater concentration of the virus, we developed a hybrid inferential model combining the wastewater regression equation with the SVI 2 RT estimated prevalence, under two different vaccination scenarios (factual 64% rate and counterfactual 0% rate) (Fig. 2). The use of(which accounts for the effect of different virulence of the two different SARS-CoV-2 variants) automatically adjusted our analysis for the Delta variant emergence. Because the estimated prevalence from themodel and the normalized wastewater concentration are highly correlated, the hybrid model is seen to fit the data well. As before, to quantify the location-specific vaccination effects, we calculated the location-specific ratios under two curves in an analogous way as when quantifying the vaccination effect on the disease incidence. The ratios of the areas under the two curves, under factual (vaccinated) and counterfactual (unvaccinated) scenarios, were computed. The Jefferson County (Fig. 2 a) ratio was equal to 0.314, and the remaining sewershed location ratios (Fig. 2 b–d) were equal to, respectively, 0.448, 0.330 and 0.375. The estimate of excess wastewater virus without vaccination is estimated as 218.9% (CI = (193.5%, 242.4%)), 123.1% (CI = (105.0%, 144.0%)), 202.8% (CI = (192.8%, 203.4%)), and 166.9%, (CI = (146.6%, 187.1%)) respectively (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Table 8).

### Cross-reactivity between platanus pollen and vegetables [^d7aa11e5]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Several associations have been described between tree and plant pollens and certain foods. The objective of this study is to verify whether there is cross-reactivity between Platanus pollen and vegetable origin foods.

Methods

We selected 56 patients allergic to vegetable foods and subjected them to cutaneous tests with aeroallergens and vegetable foods. A statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the association of Platanus pollen with foods and with other aeroallergens. Later, a specific IgE determination was performed as well as a RAST (radioallergosorbent) inhibition experiment, to verify the existence of cross-reactivity in vitro.

Results

In the cutaneous tests we found a positive correlation between Platanus pollen and hazelnut, peanut, banana and celery. The results of the RAST inhibition experiment indicate an important cross-reactivity between the pollen of Platanus acerifolia and hazelnut and banana fruit, and an intermediate cross-reactivity with celery and peanut.

Conclusion

We have described an association between the pollen of the Platanus tree and some vegetable foods such as hazelnut, banana, peanut and celery. This association could be explained by the in vitro IgE cross-reactivity detected.

### Genome-wide association analyses using multilocus models on bananas (musa spp.) reveal candidate genes related to morphology, fruit quality, and yield [^fb8bae43]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Plant material

The plant material used is established in situ in the CMC. It contains Musa landraces and cultivars, administered by the Corporación Colombiana de Investigación Agropecuaria — AGROSAVIA at the Palmira Research Center, Valle del Cauca, Colombia (76°18′51.8″ W, 3°30′42.4″N). This center is located at 1,000 m.a.s.l. and presents an annual average temperature of 23°C, precipitation of 1,100 mm, and relative humidity of 75%. The 190 accessions of the collection were established in an area of 1.5 ha, in clay loam soils and flat topography, in five consecutive blocks separated by three meters. Each block comprised a productive site (mother plant, daughter, and granddaughter) of each accession (190 sites per block), meaning that there were five repetitions or productive sites per accession, one in each block. The organization within the block was in consecutive order of the field code for each accession, in the same way in all blocks. The agronomic management was based on cultural practices such as defoliation, elimination of new individuals, elimination of dry socks from the plant stem, and elimination of the pseudostem once the plant was harvested. The fertilization was based mainly on K and N supplementing, with supplemental irrigation carried out at field capacity, and weed was mechanically managed with a manual scythe. Phytosanitary management focuses on controlling the weevil complex with pseudostem traps and using entomopathogenic fungi.

Of this collection, we selected the 124-panel used in this study based on the availability of phenotypic data with a maximum of 20% missing data and the representation of different genetic groups. The association panel represents different genome ploidies (31 diploids, 79 triploids, and 14 tetraploids samples), which are grouped into 21 genetic subgroups and 13 genomic clonal varietal groups previously reported by(Supplementary Table 1).

### Quantification of an efficiency-sovereignty trade-off in climate policy [^3caccab2]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

The Paris Agreement calls for a cooperative response with the aim of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while reaffirming the principles of equity and common, but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities 1. Although the goal is clear, the approach required to achieve it is not. Cap-and-trade policies using uniform carbon prices could produce cost-effective reductions of global carbon emissions, but tend to impose relatively high mitigation costs on developing and emerging economies. Huge international financial transfers are required to complement cap-and-trade to achieve equal sharing of effort, defined as an equal distribution of mitigation costs as a share of income 2,3, and therefore the cap-and-trade policy is often perceived as infringing on national sovereignty 2–7. Here we show that a strategy of international financial transfers guided by moderate deviations from uniform carbon pricing could achieve the goal without straining either the economies or sovereignty of nations. We use the integrated assessment model REMIND-MAgPIE to analyse alternative policies: financial transfers in uniform carbon pricing systems, differentiated carbon pricing in the absence of financial transfers, or a hybrid combining financial transfers and differentiated carbon prices. Under uniform carbon prices, a present value of international financial transfers of 4.4 trillion US dollars over the next 80 years to 2100 would be required to equalize effort. By contrast, achieving equal effort without financial transfers requires carbon prices in advanced countries to exceed those in developing countries by a factor of more than 100, leading to efficiency losses of 2.6 trillion US dollars. Hybrid solutions reveal a strongly nonlinear trade-off between cost efficiency and sovereignty: moderate deviations from uniform carbon prices strongly reduce financial transfers at relatively small efficiency losses and moderate financial transfers substantially reduce inefficiencies by narrowing the carbon price spread. We also identify risks and adverse consequences of carbon price differentiation due to market distortions that can undermine environmental sustainability targets 8,9. Quantifying the advantages and risks of carbon price differentiation provides insight into climate and sector-specific policy mixes.

### Hippocampal-entorhinal cognitive maps and cortical motor system represent action plans and their outcomes [^33d2d1cf]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To introduce variation in the sampling of space (see Methods, fMRI tasks), we created a trial distribution that resulted in some runs having an uneven number of trials with shared and non-shared actions between pairs of action combinations. To ensure that the main effect was not driven by the biases in the distribution, we subsampled the trials. We first excluded a small number of cases where both actions were reversed between pairs of combinations. We then equalized the number of trials with similar and dissimilar action combinations across runs and participants, iterated the subsampling steps 10 times, and performed a separate GLM on every iteration. The parameter estimates from all iterations were averaged for each participant and subjected to a two-sided, one-sample t-test against 0 to confirm the main effect (SMA: t(45) = −3.47, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = −0.51, 95% CI = [−0.037, −0.01]; two-sided t-test).

### Childhood asthma and fruit consumption [^49c6a94e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The present authors investigated whether wheezing is less common in children who consume more apples and other fruits. A population-based survey of 2,640 primary school children aged 5–10 yrs was carried out in Greenwich (South London, UK). Information about asthma symptoms and fruit consumption was obtained by means of a questionnaire. After controlling for potential confounding variables, eating bananas at least once a day (compared with less than once a month) was negatively associated with current wheeze (odds ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.44–1.00) and ever wheeze (0.69 (0.50–0.95)), but not with ever asthma (0.80 (0.56–1.14)). Drinking apple juice from concentrate at least once a day (compared with less than once a month) was also negatively associated with current wheeze (0.53 (0.34–0.83)), weakly associated with ever wheeze (0.74 (-0.54–1.02)), but not associated with ever asthma. Consumption of apples, other fruits and orange juice was not significantly associated with asthma symptoms. No association was found between eating fresh apples and asthma symptoms in the study population, but some evidence was found to suggest that a higher consumption of apple juice from concentrate and bananas may protect against wheezing in children.

### Whole-genome assembly of corylus avellana cv "Tonda gentile delle langhe" using linked-reads (10X genomics) [^4aba4a8f]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Results and discussion

Genome sequencing and assembly

The chromosome-scale "TGdL" genome was developed using two-tiered approach. The 10X Genomics Chromium Technology was firstly used to obtain a high-quality preliminary assembly. Reference-guided scaffolding was then implemented using the "Tombul" genome as the reference. The 10X genomic library was sequenced with Illumina technology and 138.56 million raw pair-end reads were generated (52X coverage). The average read length was 138.50 bp, with 86.06% of them having Q > 30. These data are comparable to the optimal standard values suggested by Supernova Assembler software manufacturer (Table 1). In details, Supernova assembled 47,216 scaffolds having a total length of 414.38 Mb and an N 50 of 51,567 bp. The results were similar (Table 2) to the other genome assemblies at a contig level ("Jefferson"; "Tombul"; Table 2). A single library (10X Genomics Chromium Technology) produces a more optimized "TGdL" genome assembly compared to the "Jefferson" assembly (Table 2), the latter being obtained using three different Illumina libraries, 250-bp and 350-bp Illumina paired-end (PE) libraries and a 4.5-Kb mate-pair (MP) library. Moreover, the 10X strategy proved to be a cost-effective route being the "TGdL" assembly highly comparable to the "Tombul" (contigs) draft made with a higher coverage (108X, short reads) and 9.3X of long Nanopore reads (Figure 1) prior to scaffolding.

### Differential cost-sharing undermines treatment adherence to combination therapy: evidence from diabetes treatment [^aa0a832e]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The main justification for higher demand-side cost-sharing is that the "moral hazard" (incentive to take unusual risks because others bear the economic consequences) that comes with generous insurance encourages overconsumption of medical care. The widely adopted remedy for this is to trade off the benefits of risk spreading (insurance) against the costs of moral hazard by transferring risk to insured individuals using the form of higher demand-side cost-sharing. This theory further postulated that cost-sharing would only discourage the consumption of the low efficiency or unnecessary medical services because the rational utility-maximizing consumers would demand medical care to the point where marginal costs equals marginal benefits. But this remedy could result in unintended effects if the design of cost-sharing does not recognize the heterogenous disease characteristics, treatment patterns, or patient needs. As T2D is a progressive disease, combination therapy becomes necessary for glycemic control, especially for patients with a longer duration of diabetes. Many patients eventually need to use injectables in combination with oral medications. For them, the medications in the prescribed combination regimen are complements to each other rather than substitutes, i.e. all components in the combination therapy are considered effective and necessary. Therefore, adherence to all the components in a combination regimen should be equally observed for optimal glucose control.

Yet, our study highlights that patients made heterogeneous treatment adherence decisions when faced with different OOP costs for their medications. Nearly a quarter of the studied patients appeared to forgo the more costly medication in favor of the least costly medication when the OOP cost difference was large enough, despite the necessity to adhere to all the medicines of the combination therapy. For these patients, OOP cost consideration appeared to outweigh the medical necessity as their relative OOP cost was the most significant variable that impacted the adherence decisions. One possible explanation could be that some patients did not have the necessary experience or information for their medical decisions, as suggested by Rice, and therefore treated the complementary medicines in a combination therapy as if they were perfect substitutes. The RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) also found that patients reduced their consumption of both effective and less effective medical services when faced with cost-sharing. This elastic adherence behavior to OOP costs is concerning and could have negative health consequences for this subgroup of patients if treatment regimen is not adhered to as prescribed.

### Validation of a MIND diet screener in older adults [^a877a81c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

To calculate the MIND diet score from the VioScreen FFQ data, we used the following steps:
Select food items: We identified relevant food items that could fit in the MIND diet and then categorized them into one of the 15 dietary components. A list of included food items is available in Table S1, while excluded food items are detailed in Table S2.
Standardize portion sizes: A one‐serving equivalent for each food item was determined based on natural portion sizes (e.g. one banana, one egg) or according to the average consumption of specific food reported in the national dataset for older adults (aged 60+) (U.S. Department of Agriculture‐What We Eat In America (WWEIA) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database). We divided participants' reported portion sizes by this standard serving size to quantify a standardized number of servings consumed.
Standardize frequency to calculate weekly servings: Reported intake frequencies (per day, week, month) were converted into a standardized weekly frequency and then multiplied by the number of servings consumed (calculated in step 2, standardize portion sizes) to determine the total weekly servings for each food item.
Sum by food category and assign category scores: Total weekly servings were aggregated within each of the 15 MIND diet categories, and then predefined weekly cut‐off criteria were applied to assign a score of 0, 0.5, or 1 for each of the 15 MIND diet categories (Table 1).
Calculate the total MIND diet score: The category scores were summed to generate the total MIND diet score for each participant, ranging from 0 to 15.

A detailed explanation for converting the VioScreen FFQ data into a MIND diet score, along with the outlined R code used, can be found in the Supplementary Information and on GitHub.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^77613a31]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here, however, we find quite different results: intermixing hampers systemic performance. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff in systemic performance over time, as seen in Fig. 6b. Networks with some form of intermixing perform better in the short-run. However, the network with the minimal possible intermixing performs worse in the short-run but best in the long-run. In other words, this suggests an "all or nothing" trade-off over time: the configuration with the least amount of intermixing possible (minimal) performs worse in the short-run, but better in the long-run, while any gradation of increased intermixing yields the same rank-ordering in performance as their counterpart networks in the diversity of ability simulations.

Agents in the intermixed network setups explore for solutions early on in the simulation, which is a double-edged sword. In the short-run, with more intermixing, agents quickly turn to exploitation, as they merely take solutions that are marginally better relative to other setups but are still mediocre in absolute terms. Said differently, agents in setups with at least some intermixing quickly coalesce to whatever the few agents that did explore the problem space found, which are often not the best solutions possible. So, exploring the problem space using worse solutions often leads to modest gains. However, the agents in setups with minimal intermixing are more commonly exploring, rather than exploiting, because their neighbors' initial solutions are less optimal than their counterparts in intermixed networks. This is because there is minimal exposure to diversity in these minimal setups, which inadvertently produces poor solutions in the short-run but allows for more exploration to find better solutions in the long-run. In other words, by finding better solutions through exploration, agents more often uncover pathways to better solutions earlier on. The end result is that the long-run performance of setups with minimal intermixing is best.

### Estimating countries' additional carbon accountability for closing the mitigation gap based on past and future emissions [^25f36b3c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

More than half (56%) of the NDCs consider fairness in relation to the country's past, current and future shares of global emissions, drawing on a variety of equal per capita principles or relating to trends applying different metrics. Since the NDCs are developed and adopted independently by each party, they can be seen as bottom-up approaches to fairness. Governments' perceptions of what is "fair enough" are manifested in negotiations and commitments like NDCs. At the same time, the NDCs constitute roadmaps with a starting point in current emission levels. This grandfathering characteristic attributes legitimacy to the present unequal levels of emissions and risks perpetuating inequality. Conversely, national equal annual and cumulative per capita allocations emphasise equity and could be seen as top-down approaches from a global budgetbut lack reference to national sovereignty and an agreed process for updating national commitments, which are the core of the NDCs.

The carbon debt, and with it the responsibility for historical emissions, varies among countries. Future carbon claims compared to carbon budgets compatible with the Paris Agreement have also been analysed for the major world regions based on moral claims by developing countries combined with cost-effective, ambitious pathways for developed countries. Moreover, studies use the equal cumulative per capita emissions approach to share the responsibility for Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) among countries, assuming that countries with large cumulative emissions have the highest responsibility. However, the combined responsibility for historical emissions and future emission claims made by individual countries has not yet been estimated. Such an indicator could be used to assess the need for additional measures, including raised domestic and international emission reduction ambitions, as well as CDR, and to allocate responsibility for those additional measures.

### Fruit, berry, and vegetable consumption and the risk of islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes in children-the type 1 diabetes prediction and prevention birth cohort study [^2191c612]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

The results remained similar when further adjusted for weight-for-length z -score (data not shown). Furthermore, the results were similar for all outcomes in the sensitivity analyses where we excluded children avoiding vegetables, fruits, and major food allergens: dairy or cereals (data not shown). When the outcome analyses were corrected for multiple testing, the associations were significant only between consumption of banana and the risk IA (Table 3). In additional sensitivity analyses using categorical consumption variables, the total consumption of berries (consumers compared with nonconsumers — HR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.51) and cruciferous vegetables (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.64) was associated with decreased risk of IA but not with risk of T1D (berries — HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.52; and cruciferous vegetables — HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.56, 1.31).

If we instead were to fix the number of choices while leaving open the time to make them, it again becomes optimal to maximize the total expected reward for each of these choices separately, such that the optimal policy for each such choice is the same as that for single, isolated choices.

Infinite choice sequences make using the standard value function difficult. This value function returns the total expected reward for all current and future choices when starting from the current state. For an infinite number of such future choices, the value function might thus become infinite. One way to avoid this is to use instead the 'average-adjusted value' function, which — in addition to an accumulation cost — penalizes the passage of some time duration δt by − ρδt, where ρ is the reward rate. This reward rate is by equation (4) the total reward received (including accumulation costs) per second, averaged over the whole choice sequence. Penalizing the value function by this reward rate makes explicit the implicit loss of rewards due to potential future choices that the decision maker misses out on when accumulating too much evidence for the current choice. This penalization allows us to treat all choices in the sequence as if they were the same, unique choice. A further consequence of this penalization is that the value function for accumulating more evidence for some duration δt undergoes a more significant change, as accumulating this evidence now comes at a cost −(c + ρ) δt instead of the previous − cδt (see Methods section for the associated Bellman equation). For positive reward rates, ρ > 0, this cost augmentation implies more costly evidence accumulation such that it becomes advantageous to accumulate less evidence than for single, isolated choices. This change is implemented by decision boundaries that collapse more rapidly (shown formally in Supplementary Note 1, see also Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, collapsing decision boundaries implement the optimal policy for both single choices and sequences of choices, with the only difference that these boundaries collapse more rapidly for the latter. The duration of inter-choice waiting t w modulates this difference, as with t w →∞, the reward rate described by equation (4) reduces to the expected reward for single, isolated choices, equation (2). Therefore the policy for single trials is a special case of that for maximizing the reward rate in which the waiting time between consecutive choices becomes close-to-infinite.

### Predicting the risk of Lyme disease: habitat suitability for ixodes scapularis in the north central United States [^57971ee1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Results

The locations of the 138 sites that were sampled in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan are shown in Figure 1. Among the four categories, 56 sites were classified as negative, 24 were ranked as 1, 32 as 2, and 26 as 3. Most negative sites were in northeastern Wisconsin. In the southeastern part of Wisconsin, sites were negative except those situated in the Kettle Moraine State Forests (Sheboygan, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Walworth, and Waukesha counties), which are located on the terminal glacial moraines. Negative sites in Illinois were at Blackhawk Nature Preserve (Rock Island County), located in a suburban area, and White Pines State Park (Ogle County), which has large stands of secondary growth pine forest. In Wisconsin, positive high-density sites were found in the southwestern driftless area and in the central sandy uplands, as well as in the well-recognized northwest part of the state (and across the state line into Minnesota).

Figure 1
Geographic distribution of study sites ranked by abundance of Ixodes scapularis in Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and Menominee County in Michigan.

In Michigan, where only a small area of the Upper Peninsula was sampled, all sites had very dense tick populations, except for a site that was classified as excessively drained (> 99% sand). The sites classified in the other two abundance categories (1 and 2) did not appear to cluster in any areas. In Illinois, the two parks that have been infested for at least a decade, Castle Rock State Park (Ogle County) and Loud Thunder Forest Preserve (Rock Island County), were classified as having dense tick populations, with lower populations in some sites along the Illinois River.

The earliest Barye sculpture of a python killing a gnu (or wildebeest) is a bronze that was part of one of the artist's earliest and largest commissions: a surtout de table (centerpiece) commissioned by Ferdinand Philippe, duc d'Orleans, in 1834. This bronze (Walters Art Museum, accession number 27.152) is a lost-wax cast that depicts the animals in a compact format, attached to a rectangular plaster base. The current composition of the Barye model in the J. Paul Getty Museum collection and later bronzes (including sand casts at the Walters Art Museum (accession number 27.4510) and Baltimore Museum of Art (object number 1996.46.45)) are significantly different from the surtout bronze, with changes to the shape, length, and posture of both animals and the addition of a larger rocky outcrop. Close examination under visible and ultraviolet light, comparisons of 3D surface scans, and radiographs led to the hypothesis that the Barye model was originally hollow and conformed to the more compact surtout composition, but was later broken into sections and reconfigured to be used as a working model for the elongated sand-cast versions. However, the radiographs of this highly complex object proved to be difficult to interpret with certainty, so definitive confirmation of this hypothesis was not possible.

### Social capital II: determinants of economic connectedness [^6237d611]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

We can express each individual's connectedness to high-SES individuals as the product of three components, summed across groups:whereis the normalized fraction of high-SES individuals in group g. Exposure is below 1 for groups that have a below-average share of high-SES individuals and above 1 for groups that have an above-average share of high-SES individuals. The final term, measures the deviation from uniformly random friending conditional on exposure.

If friendships were formed at random and if people with high and low SES made the same number of friends, then f H, i, g = w H, g and friending bias would be equal to 0. In practice, high-SES individuals make 25.4% more friends than low-SES individuals do on average. Maintaining this difference in the number of total friends, in a setting with no homophily by SES (that is, a setting in which low- and high-SES individuals have the same probability of befriending a given high-SES person), friending bias would be negative. In particular, if high-SES individuals have x g > 1 times as many friends as low-SES individuals in group g but there is no homophily by SES, In a group that is representative of the overall population — where x g = 1.254 and w H, g = 0.5 — friending bias would be −0.11, and low-SES individuals would have 11% more high-SES friends than the share of high-SES individuals in the group. Relative to this benchmark, a positive value of friending bias constitutes a substantial departure from a society that does not exhibit homophily by SES, as it means that fewer than half of the friends of low-SES individuals have high SES even though high-SES individuals form more friendships on average.

### Dietary stearic acid regulates mitochondria in vivo in humans [^69646f9a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Preparation of the banana shakes

For the C18:0 drink, 24 g of C18:0 intended for human consumption (stearic acid, Sigma-Aldrich W303518) were mixed with 100 mL of low-fat milk. This amount of C18:0 was selected by calculating the C18:0 content of a high fat meal. The mixture was microwaved to emulsify the fatty acid. One small banana was added and the whole mixture was homogenized with a hand blender. The volume was completed to 250 mL with more low-fat milk. The mock drink was prepared the same way without fatty acids. For the C16:0 drink, 21.56 g (an equal molar amount to 24 g of C18:0) of C16:0 intended for human consumption (palmitic acid, Sigma-Aldrich W283207) was added instead. Milkshakes were prepared approximately 90 min before consumption.

Sample collection

Blood was drawn with butterfly needle sets at each timepoint from a different location. Several tubes were filled with different blood amounts for the following purposes: (1) one was filled with 4.5 mL to extract a leukocyte pellet after erythrocyte lysis, which was stored at −80 °C, (2) a smaller EDTA tube (Sarstedt S-Monovette® 2.7 mL K3E) was filled with 1 mL of blood for mitochondrial morphology scoring via fluorescence microscopy, (3) to keep serum samples, 4 mL of blood were drawn into a Sarstedt S-Monovette® 7.5 mL Z tube, then centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C, (4) for analysis of insulin, 2 mL of blood were drawn into a Sarstedt S-Monovette® 7.5 mL Z-Gel tube, and (5) for other serum parameters 2 mL of blood were put into a Sarstedt S-Monovette® 7.5 mL LH-Gel. Both tubes #4 and #5 were submitted to the high-throughput analysis facilities of the Heidelberg University Central Laboratory, which is accredited according to DIN EN ISO 15189. On the "basal" day, an additional Sarstedt S-Monovette® 2.7 mL K3E tube was filled with 2 mL for high throughput cell counting via a Siemens ADVIA 120 Hematology system and measurement of HbA1c by a Biorad Variant II Turbo.

### Comparison of sagittal plane correction with "Bullet" versus "Banana" type transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion devices [^6c7dc069]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) allows for direct and indirect decompression and segmental lordosis in sagittal plane correction. This study compares the effectiveness of "Bullet" type and "Banana" type devices for sagittal plane correction.

Methods

Patients who underwent 1-level or 2-level TLIF for degenerative pathology at a single tertiary care center were identified. Details were extracted on demographics, interbody dimensions, and preoperative and postoperative lumbopelvic parameters from upright radiographs. Cages were categorized as "Bullet" or "Banana" type based on morphology and manufacturer description of optimal position. Univariable comparisons between levels treated with "Bullet" and "Banana" type interbodies were performed. Multivariable linear regression was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative segmental lordosis and change in segmental lordosis.

Results

One hundred and ninety eight unique patients (median 66.6 years; [IQR 59.5, 73.7]; 56.6% female) were included with 241 levels treated, of which 114 (52.7%) were treated with "Banana" type interbodies and 127 (47.3%) with "Bullet" type. "Banana" type interbodies afforded both greater postoperative segmental lordosis (8.1 [6.2, 10.7] vs 7.5 [5.2, 9.6]; P = 0.048) and greater increase in segmental lordosis (3.3 [0.7, 7.0] vs 2.3 [0.1, 4.2]; P = 0.015). On multivariable linear regression, only preoperative segmental lordosis (β = 0.322 per degree; [0.244, 0.399]; P < .001), implant listed lordosis (β = 0.146 per degree; 95% CI [0.048, 0.244]; P = 0.004), preoperative pelvic incidence (0.072 per degree; [0.034, 0.111]; P < .001), and use of bilateral TLIF windows (β = 3.133; [1.213, 5.053]; P = 0.001) were predictive of postoperative segmental lordosis.

Conclusion

The present analysis suggests that baseline lumbopelvic anatomy, interbody lordosis, and the use of bilateral TLIF windows are the most important predictors of postoperative segmental lordosis. Use of "Banana" vs "Bullet" type interbodies was not predictive of segmental lordosis achieved on immediate postoperative upright radiographs. Further work is merited to determine whether the 2 interbody types demonstrate differences regarding subsidence risk or maintenance of correction.

### Gut microbiome strain-sharing within isolated village social networks [^5b164aa9]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Microbiome profiling

Microbial species can have materially divergent strainsand genetically distinctive strain-sharing between two people can offer suggestive evidence that the shared strain resulted from interpersonal transmission rather than common exposure to an environmental factor such as diet (for example, fermented foods).

We performed strain-level profiling with StrainPhlAn4 and detected putative transmission events between pairs of people. We summarized the strain-level similarity between two people with a strain-sharing rate metric that is equal to the number of shared strains divided by the number of species with available strain profiles that are present in any two samples. Overall, our data included information on 2,543 species and 339,137 strains (from the 841 species profiled by StrainPhlAn). We summarized the species-level beta diversity using the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity and the Jaccard index calculated on relative abundances.

Dimensionality reduction of the species-level relative abundances reveals differences in composition for most two-village comparisons and across all the villages combined (Extended Data Fig. 1).

### Rationale, description and baseline findings of a community-based prospective cohort study of kidney function amongst the young rural population of northwest Nicaragua [^55dc18df]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Design

This is a community-based cohort study with total of 5 study visits planned over 2 years.

Setting

The study communities are in the Departments of León and Chinandega, in northwest Nicaragua, a region with the highest mortality rates of young populations due to ESRD. This area is characterised by sugarcane cultivation (70% of cultivated land), subsistence farming (beans, corn) (20%) and banana growing (10%) and the main employment source is work in sugar mill plantation during the harvest and pre-harvest.

Sample size calculations

Given that people who will develop MeN in their 30s are likely to experience a loss of at least 40 mL/min GFR over their working lives, our study aims to investigate the likely causes and natural history of the disease by quantifying early decline in eGFR and capturing data on associated exposures. The study was powered to detect exposures associated with decline in eGFR > 5 mL/min/year. We estimated that a minimum of 180 subjects would be required to achieve a power of 90% to detect an association with a binary exposure (detected on questionnaire) in 20% of the population associated with the above effect size (at α = 0.01). Additionally, we assumed up to 20% loss to follow-up and the need to consider testing associations with multiple exposures, our aim was to recruit and follow 300 participants.

Community engagement

We first visited the community leaders to gain an understanding of the locations, distance, and availability of the communities to be part of a two-year follow-up study. The community leaders then organized large public meetings with the target population where members of the research team explained the aims and benefits of the research project. We were also in communication (in person and by telephone) with both the community leaders and participants throughout the planning and baseline phases of the project.

In vivo antigen presentation assay

Single-cell suspensions generated from the lymph nodes of OT-I × Ly5.1 or OT-II × Ly5.1 mice were stained with rat anti-mouse mAbs specific for: CD11b (M1/70), F4/80 (F4/80), red blood cells (TER119), Ly6G/-Ly6C (RB68C5), MHC II (M5/114), CD45R (RA36B2) and CD4 (GK1.5) for OT-I T cells or CD8 (53–6.7) for OT-II cells. Cells were washed and incubated with BioMag anti-rat IgG-coupled magnetic beads (Qiagen). After magnetic depletion, the CD4 + T-cell-enriched supernatant was recovered. Cells were washed with PBS 0.1% BSA and labeled with CellTrace Violet. Single-cell suspensions were treated with red cell removal buffer, washed with PBS 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and labeled with CFSE (Invitrogen). Equal numbers of CTV-labeled OT-II and a control population of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)- labeled splenocytes were pooled and resuspended and injected intravenously. 24 hours later, mice received 0.2 µg anti-CLEC9A-OVA mAbvia intravenous injection. 64 hours after immunization, spleens were harvested, single-cell suspensions generated, and treated with red cell removal buffer. Cells were stained with mAbs specific for CD8 (53–6.7, Biolegend), CD4 (GK1.5; Walter and Eliza Hall Antibody Facility), and Ly5.1 (A20; Biolegend). The number of divided OT-II and OT-I was determined as the number of CD4 + or CD8 + Ly5.1 + cells that had undergone CellTrace Violet dilution. The number of cells was normalized relative to the number of CFSE-labeled splenocytes recovered.

### Ending COVID-19: progress and gaps in research-highlights of the July 2020 gloPID-R COVID-19 research synergies meetings [^850c2df1]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, the GloPID-R Synergies Meetings supported a series of collaborative dialogues that led to the identification of crucial knowledge gaps for ending COVID-19. GloPID-R has synergised research efforts and will continue to timely fund and disseminate the critical knowledge needed to inform an exit strategy. A combination of behavioural changes, enhanced public health response, protection of vulnerable populations, accessible diagnostics and interventions and equitable access to effective therapeutics and vaccines, supported by policy research, is the only way forward. Establishing this combination of measures will be contingent on our collective capacity to enable large and coordinated efforts such as multi-centre harmonised clinical trials, and global databases, and support multi-disciplinary research, and knowledge mobilisation to leverage science for timely, sound and transparent decision-making at national and global levels. If even one country is not safe, the rest of the world will not be safe.

### Social capital II: determinants of economic connectedness [^0d1d1d42]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Decomposing EC

Following our companion paper, we define individuals' economic connectedness as the extent to which they are friends with high-SES individuals. Formally, let f H, i denote individual i 's share of high-SES friends and let w H = 0.5 represent the share of above-median-SES individuals in the population. We define person i 's individual economic connectedness (IEC) to high-SES individuals as:If IEC H, i > 1, individual i has more high-SES friends than one would expect if friendships were made at random and low- and high-SES people made an equal number of friends; conversely, IEC H, i < 1 means that i has fewer high-SES friends than one would expect under random friending.

To decompose I E C H, i into exposure and friending bias, let ϕ i, g denote the fraction of friends that individual i makes in group g (out of all friends of i that can be assigned to groups) and let G denote the set of all available groups, so that ∑ g ∈ G ϕ i, g = 1 for each individual. Here, a group g represents a specific school, college, recreational group, and so on, to which an individual can belong. Individuals' friending shares ϕ i, g are positive or 0 in the specific groups to which they belong and are 0 for all other groups. Let w H, g denote the fraction of members of group g who have high SES and f H, i, g the fraction of friends individual i makes in group g who have high SES (see Supplementary Information B.4 for a discussion of how we define f H, i, g when ϕ i, g = 0).

### Healthy habits: fruits and vegetables to manage weight… [^3073e8b8]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Fruits and vegetables provide essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, and other substances important for good health.
- Incorporating more fruits and vegetables is a healthy way to lose or maintain weight. Eat more fruits and vegetables throughout the day Breakfast — start the day right Substitute spinach, onions, or mushrooms for one egg or half the cheese in your morning omelet. The vegetables will add volume and flavor to the dish with fewer calories than the egg or cheese. Cut back on the amount of cereal in your bowl to make room for bananas, peaches, or strawberries. You can still eat a full bowl of food but with fewer calories. Lighten up your lunch Substitute vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes, or cucumbers for some of the cheese and meat in your sandwich, wrap, or burrito. Or, replace 2 ounces of meat or 1 cup of noodles in soup with 1 cup of chopped vegetables, such as broccoli, carrots, beans, or red peppers.

The new version will fill you up with fewer calories than the original. Dinner Replace 1 cup of rice or pasta in your favorite dish with 1 cup of vegetables such as broccoli, squash, or peppers. The dish with the vegetables will be just as satisfying but have fewer calories than the same amount of the original version.
- A medium apple
- A medium banana
- One cup steamed green beans
- One cup blueberries
- One cup grapes
- **Two tablespoons of hummus with**:
- 1 cup carrots
- 1 cup broccoli or
- 1 cup bell peppers
- 1 cup carrots. Whole fruit gives you a bigger snack than dried fruit. For example, a small box of raisins is about 100 calories. For the same number of calories, you can eat 1 cup of grapes and feel more full.

Substitution is key While fruits and vegetables are lower in calories than many other foods, they do contain some calories. If you start eating fruits and vegetables in addition to what you usually eat, you are adding calories and may gain weight. The key is substitution. Eat fruits and vegetables instead of some other higher-calorie food.

### Association between residential greenness and cardiovascular disease risk [^08b55a52]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Participant Characteristics

Of the 508 participants recruited for the study, 408 met our inclusion criteria. These participants were 52% males, 56% whites, 39% blacks, and 5% other races. A majority of the study population was hypertensive (75%), hyperlipidemic (60%), and at risk for CVD (61%), based on a Framingham Risk Score of > 20% or having a previous major adverse cardiovascular event. The cohort was 51.4 ± 10.8 years old and mostly overweight or obese with a mean body mass index of 32.9 ± 8.2 (see Table). Most participants lived in areas of low greenness located in northwestern Jefferson County. A less dense, but relatively even, distribution of participants was observed throughout the residential areas in the rest of the county (Figure 1). However, a majority of the participants lived in neighborhoods consisting of single‐family residential homes and lots containing both grasses and trees. The distribution of the study population between areas of low, medium, and high contemporaneous greenness is shown in Table. Black participants were more likely to reside in areas with lower greenness. In comparison with those living in areas of high greenness, participants residing in areas of low greenness were more likely to live in a deprived area and have significantly lower median household income. No significant differences were observed in cardiovascular history, medication use, sex, body mass index, or the sum of CVD risk factors, although individuals living in areas of low greenness were more likely be younger, to smoke, and to have slightly lower plasma high‐density lipoprotein levels. Spearman correlations between continuous demographic variables and NDVI within circular zones of 250 m and 1 km around the participant's residence are shown in Table S1.

Figure 1
Geographic location of study participants and the distribution of greenness within Jefferson County, Kentucky. Study participants (n = 408) from indicated residential areas were recruited from a preventive cardiology clinic at the University of Louisville. Values of greenness, calculated as peak normalized difference vegetation index, are shown at a resolution of 250 m. Attributes of land cover and greenness within the county vary between −0.1 and 1unit. Lowvalues are associated with business districts, industrial areas, and transportation zones. Residential areas show moderate, whereas urban parks, forests, and underdeveloped areas show highvalues. To protect participant privacy, exact residential locations are geographically masked and do not represent residential addresses.

### Qualitative study of changes in alcohol use among HIV-infected adults entering care and treatment for HIV / AIDS in rural southwest Uganda [^210931ef]. AIDS and Behavior (2015). Low credibility.

While more than half (56%) of Ugandans abstain from alcohol, among those who drink, heavy alcohol consumption is very common. Among male drinkers, the per capita yearly rate of pure alcohol consumption is 25.6 l; among female drinkers, it is 19.6 l. These are among the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the world. The most common beverages consumed are beer, made commercially in Uganda and imported from Europe, and a gin known as waragi, made from bananas. Ugandans also drink locally produced, traditional alcohols made from grains, sorghum, and fruit. The combination of common heavy alcohol use and high HIV prevalence in Uganda increases the risk of ongoing transmission of HIV in Uganda, underscoring the need for research to develop alcohol interventions.

Substantial decreases in self-reported alcohol consumption in the absence of systematic intervention have recently been documented for HIV-infected populations in two separate studies in Uganda. One of these studies found that hazardous alcohol consumption (defined as scoring ≥ 3 for women and ≥ 4 for men on the alcohol use disorders identification test-consumption, AUDIT-C) declined from 35 to 16% among baseline drinkers in the three months following HIV counseling and testing at a large urban hospital in Kampala. The other found that in a cohort of persons initiating ART, among those reporting any alcohol use in the three months prior to baseline, 83% became abstinent for at least 3 months during follow up, with a median duration of abstinence of 3.25 years. Additional research is required to delineate the reasons (i.e. motives) for these reductions, in order to translate these data into sustainable alcohol interventions that complement existing HIV care in the region.

### An American Thoracic Society / National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop report: addressing respiratory health equality in the United States [^d2683979]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2017). Medium credibility.

Best practices to advance research on respiratory health disparities emphasize accurate use of race and ethnicity constructs, subgroup analyses within racially admixed populations, and improved socioeconomic status (SES) measurement to avoid bias. The page explains that race has been characterized by continent of origin and skin color, whereas ethnicity reflects shared social, linguistic, and cultural heritage, and notes that Hispanics and African Americans have varying African, European, and Native American genetic ancestry that has been shown to influence lung function and risk for obstructive airway diseases. It further states that Hispanics can be classified into subgroups by country or region of origin, with examples that Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans have markedly variable asthma morbidity and mortality and that smoking patterns differ across Hispanic groups in the United States, warning that combining subgroups or ignoring racial ancestry can bias respiratory research results. The text adds that SES is often assessed using income and educational level, but there is a need to better characterize social and economic status at individual and community levels, and that positive social factors such as community resiliency and cohesiveness may mitigate negative effects of low income, including detrimental environmental exposures like advertising of tobacco products.

### To improve quality, leverage design [^4a59f7b2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

The DD model

The DD model is organised into four major stages — discover, define, develop and deliver. The two diamonds represent distinct periods of thinking — first to fully characterise the problem (discover, define), and then to craft human-centred solutions (develop, deliver). In the discovery and define periods, teams work to understand a process through the eyes of the user, conducting interviews and observations with users to generate insights about their behaviours and unmet needs and ultimately producing a shared problem definition. In DT, problems are often reframed as 'How might we… ' statements that foster a creative exploration of the challenge. In the develop and deliver stages, teams leverage their prior insights about unmet human needs to craft innovative solutions that directly address those needs, cocreating with users and other stakeholders to develop and test solution prototypes in a rapid, iterative fashion to identify and learn from early failures.

The diamond shape itself represents a key design principle — 'diverge, then converge'. In the diverging stages, teams capture and display as many ideas as possible without judgement, creating a psychologically safe space for creative exploration as all ideas are welcome. Once teams have 'diverged' in their thinking, they apply a more rigorous lens and 'converge' on a shared problem definition or chosen solution.

### Epistasis studies reveal redundancy among calcium-dependent protein kinases in motility and invasion of malaria parasites [^cb3ee565]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

For ookinete cultures, parasites were maintained in phenyl hydrazine-treated mice. Ookinetes were produced in vitro by adding 1 volume of high gametocytaemia blood in 30 volumes of ookinete medium (RPMI-1640 containing 25 mM HEPES, 10% foetal calf serum, 100 µM xanthurenic acid, pH 7.5) and incubated at 19 °C for 18–24 h. Ookinete conversion efficiency was determined by live staining of ookinetes and activated macrogametes with Cy3-conjugated 13.1 monoclonal antibody against p28. The conversion rate was determined as the number of banana-shaped ookinetes as a percentage of the total number of Cy3-fluorescent cells. For secretion assays, ookinetes were purified using paramagnetic anti-mouse IgG beads (Life Technologies) coated with anti-p28 mouse monoclonal antibody (13.1). Purified ookinete were then incubated for 1 h at 19 °C and the supernatant was separated from the parasite pellet by centrifugation (500 × g, 3 min). For motility assays, ookinetes in culture medium were added to an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Bioscience) containing dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) or inhibitors kept on ice, mixed thoroughly, dropped onto a slide, covered with a cover slip and sealed with nail polish. After randomly identifying a field containing ookinetes, time-lapse videos were taken (1 frame every 10 s, for 10 min) on a Nikon eclipse Ty with a 100× objective at room temperature. Movies were analysed with Fiji and the Manual Tracking plugin.

### Concerns regarding… [^70dc23c9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Controversy about hyperparameter optimization of various machine learning models

In this study, the process of hyperparameter optimization is not described, even though different combinations of hyperparameters are crucial for model building and validation.

In the field of machine learning, using default hyperparameters may not be suitable for specific datasets. Lack of hyperparameter optimization can prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information, leading to less stable performance, high heterogeneity, and insufficient robustness, which negatively affects model building and generalization. Different combinations of hyperparameters significantly impact the predictive efficacy of the model. Failure to adequately perform hyperparameter optimization may result in models that do not achieve optimal predictive efficacy. This causes selection bias in the model and ultimately leads to incorrect decisions.

Machine learning is prone to model overfitting and poor generalization if the built-in hyperparameters are not properly set. Therefore, hyperparameter optimization in the field of machine learning is a scientific, rigorous, and reliable practice.

### Complete khoisan and bantu genomes from Southern Africa [^969ee438]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

The genetic structure of the indigenous hunter-gatherer peoples of southern Africa, the oldest known lineage of modern human, is important for understanding human diversity. Studies based on mitochondrial and small sets of nuclear markers have shown that these hunter-gatherers, known as Khoisan, San, or Bushmen, are genetically divergent from other humans. However, until now, fully sequenced human genomes have been limited to recently diverged populations. Here we present the complete genome sequences of an indigenous hunter-gatherer from the Kalahari Desert and a Bantu from southern Africa, as well as protein-coding regions from an additional three hunter-gatherers from disparate regions of the Kalahari. We characterize the extent of whole-genome and exome diversity among the five men, reporting 1.3 million novel DNA differences genome-wide, including 13,146 novel amino acid variants. In terms of nucleotide substitutions, the Bushmen seem to be, on average, more different from each other than, for example, a European and an Asian. Observed genomic differences between the hunter-gatherers and others may help to pinpoint genetic adaptations to an agricultural lifestyle. Adding the described variants to current databases will facilitate inclusion of southern Africans in medical research efforts, particularly when family and medical histories can be correlated with genome-wide data.

### Expanding the conceptualization and measurement of applied problem solving and coping: from stages to dimensions to the almost forgotten cultural context [^9fd531a5]. The American Psychologist (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to suggest an expansion of the conceptualizations and measurement of applied problem solving and, relatedly, coping. The author discusses the evolution of his programmatic line of research over the last 30 years to illustrate the changing landscape in applied problem solving and, to a lesser extent, in the coping literature. Developments from the early stage-sequential models of applied problem solving to the utility of combining major dimensions of applied problem solving and coping are discussed, as are the notion of problem resolution as a way of assessing consequences of coping, and finally, the use of East Asian cultural values to assess collectivistic coping styles. The overlooked and until recently almost forgotten role of culture in the evolution of these general domains of inquiry is highlighted. The author concludes that greater attention to the cultural context will expand psychology's theoretical models, greatly enhance our empirically based understanding of applied problem solving/coping, and promote our ability to enhance effective problem solving and coping around the world.

### Green banana reduces clinical severity of childhood shigellosis: a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial [^7adfd8ae]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Mature green banana (GB) fruit is rich in amylase-resistant starch that stimulates colonic production of short-chain fatty acids (referred to as fatty acid) and is useful in treating diarrheal diseases. We studied therapeutic effects of GB in childhood shigellosis by determining colonic fatty acid production in a double-blind, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.

Methods

Seventy-three children aged 6 to 60 months with severe bloody dysentery caused by Shigella infection were either given a rice-based diet (54 kcal/dL), with cooked GB (250 g/L) (n = 34) or without GB (n = 39) for 5 days; all given ciprofloxacin (15 mg/kg, q12 hours). Stool volume, frequency, excretion of blood/mucus, and relevant clinical and laboratory indices were determined.

Results

On day 5 (post-treatment), 59% children in GB group had no mucus compared with 36% in controls, fecal blood was completely cleared from 96% in GB group compared with 60% without GB (P < 0.05). GB treatment significantly reduced (P < 0.01) numbers of stools/day compared with controls (70% vs. 50%, P < 0.05). GB-specific reductions of mean fecal volumes (mL/kg) ranged from 25% to 40%; (P < 0.05) during the 5-day observations. Clinical success rates were 85% in GB group compared with 67% in controls (P < 0.05). GB significantly (P < 0.01) reduced fecal myeloperoxidase activity and increased fecal fatty acid concentrations (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

GB diet improves clinical severity in childhood shigellosis and could be a simple and useful adjunct for dietary management of this illness.

### Survival of memory T cells specific for Japanese cypress pollen allergen is maintained by cross-stimulation of putative pectate lyases from other plants [^39e30210]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

In view of recent studies on the mechanisms of the survival of peripheral memory T cells, we tested the biologic role of pectate lyase, a pectin-degrading enzyme, as the cross-reactive antigen required for the recurring survival signals for human T cells specific for Cha o 1, a pollen allergen molecule of the Japanese cypress. We determined a 16-mer epitope peptide for the T-cell clone, and prepared synthetic oligopeptides of homologous regions in putative pectate lyase of other plants. Of these homologous peptides, ZePel (Zinnia elegans), ban 17 (banana), and Amb a 1.1 (short ragweed) induced strong proliferative responses of the Cha o 1-specific T-cell clone in vitro. In addition, suboptimal doses of peptide homologs derived from banana and short ragweed enhanced the survival potency of this T-cell clone without detectable proliferative responses to the peptides. When there was no antigen stimulation, the T-cell clone decreased in viable cell number and lost antigen-specific proliferation activity on day 6 during in vitro incubation. On the other hand, T-cell clones incubated with these survival-inducing peptides maintained proliferative activity to Cha o 1 even on day 9. Serum derived from the donor patient did not contain detectable levels of IgE specific to banana or short ragweed by CAP-RAST. These results show that human T cells specific for pollen allergen seem to use cross-reactive pectate lyase peptides to deliver survival signals even in the absence of pollen allergen, and memory T cells maintained in such a manner might be functioning at the onset of allergic pollinosis, although pollen allergens are seasonal.

### Oil palm expansion and deforestation in southwest Cameroon associated with proliferation of informal Mills [^c102e896]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The immature monoculture class in the Southwest Region of Cameroon is comprised of one of three crop types: oil palm, banana, or rubber. Owing to the high fraction of immature monoculture pixels in 2015, and because immature mono-cropped oil palm was not spectrally distinguishable from immature mono-cropped banana or rubber, we relied on a manual, visual interpretation method to estimate the fraction of pixels classified as immature monoculture that were immature oil palm. We estimated this fraction by sampling ten percent of all pixels characterized as forest or other in 2000, and immature monoculture in 2015 (n = 23,347). We visually identified whether these pixels classified as immature monoculture in 2015 were immature oil palm using high-resolution imagery from Google Earth and DigitalGlobe data from the Mapbox Editor. Despite being spectrally indistinguishable from other monoculture systems using Landsat data at 30 m resolution, we found that detection of immature oil palm plantations using the human-eye was straightforward at high spatial resolutions (roughly ≤ 5 m).

Using this approach, we estimated that 64.56%, 95% CI (64.55%, 64.57%) of the randomly sampled pixels that transitioned to immature monoculture in 2015 were immature oil palm. In contrast, 35% were either another type of immature monoculture system (banana or rubber) or were misclassified. Of the area forested in 2000 that transitioned to immature monoculture systems, 92.78% was a transition to immature oil palm, while 7.22% was a transition from forest to some other type of immature monoculture system. Based on this estimated fraction of immature oil palm within the immature monoculture class, 45.26% of land area converted to oil palm in 2015 was mature oil palm and 54.74% was immature oil palm.

### Social capital II: determinants of economic connectedness [^95b45e34]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Determinants of economic connectedness

Following our companion paper, we measure the degree of cross-class interaction — which we term economic connectedness, or EC — as the share of friends with above-median SES ('high SES') among people with below-median SES ('low SES') divided by 50%, to quantify the average degree of under-representation of high-SES friends among people with low SES. A value of 0 for EC implies that a network has no connections between people with low and high SES, whereas a value of 1 implies that people with low SES have an equal number of low- and high-SES friends. On average, EC is 0.776 for people with low SES in the United States. That is, high-SES friends are under-represented by 22.4% (1 − 0.776 = 0.224) among individuals with low SES relative to the high-SES share in the population. Our goal is to determine the factors that generate this 22.4% under-representation of high-SES friends.

Within any group in which friendships are made — such as a specific high school or neighbourhood — the rate at which people with low SES become friends with people with high SES depends on two factors: (1) high-SES exposure, the share of high-SES members in the group; and (2) friending bias, the rate at which people befriend high-SES individuals conditional on the share of high-SES members in the group (that is, conditional on exposure). For example, in the context of schools, students with low SES may have fewer friends with high SES because they attend schools with few high-SES students (that is, schools with low exposure) or because they are less likely to befriend high-SES students even within their schools (that is, their schools have high friending bias).

### Detection of clinical markers of sensitization to profilin in patients allergic to plant-derived foods [^aa658d2e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A proper classification of patients allergic to plant-derived foods is of pivotal importance because the clinical features of allergic reactions to fruits and vegetables depend on the nature and characteristics of proteins responsible for sensitization. However, in normal clinical settings this is presently impossible.

Objective

We sought to detect clinical markers of sensitization to profilin.

Methods

Seventy-one patients allergic to fruits and vegetables but not sensitized to lipid transfer protein or natural rubber latex were studied. Food allergy was ascertained on the basis of clinical history and positive skin prick test responses with fresh foods, commercial extracts, or both. Allergies to foods that had caused less than 2 adverse reactions were confirmed by means of open oral challenge. IgE reactivity to rBet v 1/rBet v 2 and to natural Phleum species profilin were detected. Moreover, IgE to the 30- to 40-kd and 60- to 90-kd birch pollen-enriched fractions, which also can be involved in cross-reactivity phenomena, were measured in sera from 52 patients by means of ELISA.

Results

On the basis of in vitro tests, 24, 18, and 25 patients turned out to be sensitized to Bet v 1, Bet v 2, or both, respectively. Four patients had negative test results for both allergens. Hypersensitivity to Bet v 2 was strongly associated with clinical allergy to citrus fruits (39% in patients monosensitized to Bet v 2 vs 4% in patients monosensitized to Bet v 1, P < .025), melon or watermelon (67% vs 0%, P < .001), banana (66% vs 8%, P < .001), and tomato (33% vs 0%, P < .05), whereas Bet v 1 sensitivity was associated with clinical allergy to apple (100% vs 39%, P < .001) and hazelnut (56% vs 0%, P < .001). The sensitivity of a history of allergy to gourd fruits, citrus fruits, tomato, banana, or a combination thereof as a means to detect profilin-hypersensitive patients was 85% (41/48). The specificity of an allergy to any of these fruits exceeded 85%, with positive predictive values ranging between 68% and 91%.

Conclusion

In clinical settings in which laboratory investigations are not easily accessible, allergy to melon, watermelon, citrus fruits, tomato, and banana can be used as a marker of profilin hypersensitivity once a sensitization to natural rubber latex and lipid transfer protein is ruled out.

### Patients' perceptions of bariatric surgery in the deep south: the impact of health literacy [^49c88bef]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria

A cross-sectional, multi-institutional study was conducted in surgery clinics at three institutions in Alabama: University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital in Birmingham, Whitfield Regional Medical Center in Demopolis, and Regional Medical Center of Central Alabama in Greenville. Data collection was performed from December 2023 to September 2024. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older who were English-speaking, had undergone surgical evaluation at one of the three sites during the study period, and could provide consent. Exclusion criteria were patients who were younger than 18 years, non-English speaking, and unable to give consent. The study protocol and supplemental materials were approved by the UAB institutional review board (IRB-300010829). The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines were used for study reporting.

Study sites (Setting)

Two of the three healthcare facilities (Demopolis in Marengo County and Greenville in Butler County) are rural institutions located within the Black Belt of Alabama within close proximity of UAB Hospital located in Jefferson County. The Black Belt has distinct geographic, social, and cultural boundaries with high rates of poverty and health care disparities in the region. According to the 2020 to 2023 US Census Bureau population estimates, Marengo, Butler, and Jefferson counties comprised 18,648, 18,382, and 674,340 residents, respectively. More granularly, in 2019, the Black Belt comprised 56% Black residents, with nearly one in four individuals (23.7%) living below the poverty line. These two rural healthcare facilities alongside the UAB Hospital were part of the UAB Surgery Community Network.
