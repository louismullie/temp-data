## Question

What condition is represented by ICD-10 code F50.2?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition is represented by ICD-10 code F50.2. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10 category structure to confirm where F50.2 sits. Then, I should verify the exact diagnostic label assigned to F50.2. Next, I will review how F50.2 is used in epidemiologic and clinical studies to ensure consistency. Finally, I will consider related codes and any nuances that might confuse F50.2 with nearby subtypes, and then synthesize a concise, accurate answer.

> Let me first confirm the category. F50 falls under the Mental, Behavioral and Neurodevelopmental Disorders chapter, specifically the F50–F59 block for behavioral syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors, with F50 designated for eating disorders, so F50.2 is an eating disorder code within that block [^c57e51b9] [^53104356].

> Wait, let me verify the exact label for F50.2. Multiple authoritative sources consistently map F50.2 to bulimia nervosa, including nutrition practice guidance that lists F50.2 as bulimia nervosa and large epidemiologic studies that operationalize bulimia nervosa using F50.2 and its atypical variant F50.3, which aligns with standard ICD-10 usage in research and clinical settings [^53104356] [^793c7a87] [^e279564e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how F50.2 is used in real-world datasets. Registry-based studies frequently define bulimia nervosa using F50.2 (sometimes together with F50.3 for atypical presentations), and validation work in Danish registers supports high accuracy for F50.2-coded bulimia nervosa when compared with chart review, reinforcing that F50.2 indeed corresponds to bulimia nervosa in practice [^793c7a87] [^1c179561] [^e279564e].

> I need to check for potential confusion with nearby codes. F50.0 and F50.1 represent anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa, respectively, whereas F50.2 is the typical bulimia nervosa diagnosis; F50.3 denotes atypical bulimia nervosa, and F50.8/F50.9 capture other specified and unspecified eating disorders, so F50.2 is distinct from anorexia and from residual eating disorder categories [^793c7a87] [^53104356].

> Let me reconsider whether any source contradicts this. I briefly wondered if F50.2 might be a residual or unspecified code, but that would be incorrect; F50.9 is the unspecified eating disorder code, whereas F50.2 is specifically bulimia nervosa, and that distinction is consistently maintained across coding references and research applications [^53104356] [^793c7a87].

> Final answer: ICD-10 code F50.2 represents bulimia nervosa [^53104356] [^793c7a87].

---

ICD-10 code F50.2 denotes **bulimia nervosa** [^53104356], an eating disorder characterized by recurrent binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxatives, fasting, or excessive exercise). It is distinct from anorexia nervosa (F50.0–F50.1) and is used in clinical and research settings to identify cases for diagnosis, treatment, and epidemiology [^793c7a87] [^e279564e]. Accurate coding supports care pathways, reimbursement, and public health surveillance [^cd4941f1] [^439852f4].

## Clinical features of bulimia nervosa (F50.2)

Bulimia nervosa is defined by **recurrent episodes of binge eating** — consuming unusually large amounts of food with a sense of loss of control — followed by compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, or excessive exercise [^notfound]. Key features include:

- **Binge eating episodes**: Recurrent, at least once weekly for 3 months.
- **Compensatory behaviors**: Recurrent, at least once weekly for 3 months.
- **Body image disturbance**: Undue influence of body shape/weight on self-evaluation.
- **Absence of anorexia nervosa**: No persistent restriction leading to significantly low body weight [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines

The ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa (F50.2) include:

- **Recurrent binge eating**: Episodes of excessive intake with loss of control.
- **Compensatory behaviors**: Recurrent to prevent weight gain.
- **Frequency**: Both behaviors occur at least weekly for 3 months.
- **Body image disturbance**: Overvaluation of shape/weight.
- **Exclusion of anorexia nervosa**: No persistent energy restriction causing low weight [^notfound].

These criteria align with DSM-5, though DSM-5 recognizes binge-eating disorder separately and uses frequency thresholds (at least once weekly for 3 months) [^notfound].

---

## Differentiation from other eating disorders

ICD-10 distinguishes bulimia nervosa from related eating disorders:

| **ICD-10 code** | **Disorder** | **Key distinguishing features** |
|-|-|-|
| F50.0 | Anorexia nervosa | - Significantly low body weight <br/> - Restriction of intake <br/> - Fear of weight gain |
| F50.1 | Atypical anorexia nervosa | - Meets AN criteria without low weight |
| F50.2 | Bulimia nervosa | - Binge eating <br/> - Compensatory behaviors <br/> - Normal/overweight |
| F50.3 | Atypical bulimia nervosa | - Meets BN criteria with atypical features |
| F50.4–F50.9 | Other/unspecified eating disorders | - Does not meet full criteria for AN/BN |

---

## Clinical implications and treatment considerations

Bulimia nervosa is associated with significant medical and psychiatric comorbidity, including electrolyte disturbances, gastrointestinal complications, dental erosion, and mood/anxiety disorders [^notfound]. Treatment typically involves:

- **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is first-line; interpersonal therapy (IPT) is also effective.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs, particularly fluoxetine, reduce binge/purge frequency.
- **Medical monitoring**: Address electrolyte imbalances, dental care, and nutritional rehabilitation [^notfound].

---

## Epidemiology and prevalence

Bulimia nervosa is more common in females and often begins in adolescence or early adulthood. Epidemiologic studies using ICD-10 codes report varying prevalence depending on cohort and methodology, with registry-based estimates showing stable or declining incidence in some regions and increases in others, particularly among younger females [^011a9c72] [^e279564e] [^f13738c3].

---

## Coding accuracy and validation

Validation studies show high accuracy for ICD-10 bulimia nervosa codes (F50.2, F50.3) versus chart review, supporting their use in research and surveillance [^1c179561]. However, clinicians should ensure documentation meets ICD-10 criteria to avoid misclassification [^cd4941f1].

---

## Impact of ICD-10 coding on healthcare delivery

ICD-10 coding for bulimia nervosa facilitates:

- **Standardized diagnosis**: Enables consistent identification and treatment planning [^cd4941f1].
- **Reimbursement**: Supports appropriate billing and coverage for evidence-based care [^cd4941f1].
- **Public health surveillance**: Tracks prevalence, trends, and outcomes to inform policy and resource allocation [^439852f4].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite benefits, ICD-10 coding has limitations: clinicians may misclassify atypical presentations or comorbid conditions, and administrative data may under- or overestimate prevalence without validation [^1c179561]. Ongoing education and auditing are essential to maintain accuracy [^cd4941f1].

---

ICD-10 code F50.2 denotes **bulimia nervosa**, supporting accurate diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance. Clinicians should apply ICD-10 criteria carefully and document comprehensively to optimize care and data quality [^53104356].

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Comparing the ICD-11 chronic pain classification with ICD-10: how can the new coding system make chronic pain visible? A study in a tertiary care pain clinic setting [^8463e321]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain is a frequent reason for patients to ask for medical services. However, systematic information about the extent and impact of pain, especially in developing countries, has not been available up to now. We evaluated whether the 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) can fill this gap by coding all electronic out-patient medical records of the pain clinic at Siriraj Hospital in Thailand in 2019 (8714 visits), using the ICD-10 and ICD-11 browsers referenced on the WHO websites. The 3 most frequent pain-related codes in ICD-10 were R52.2 "other chronic pain" (29%), M54.5 "low back pain" (18%), and M79.6 "pain in limb" (13%). In ICD-11, the 3 most frequent codes were MG30.31 "chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain associated with structural changes" (28%), MG30.51 "chronic peripheral neuropathic pain" (26%), and MG30.10 "chronic cancer pain" (23%). Thus, using the currently valid ICD-10 system, roughly one-third of patient encounters were coded as "other chronic pain", and the next 2 were specifying the pain region rather than any underlying cause. By contrast, ICD-11 coding of the same patients identified underlying causes (bones and joints, somatosensory nervous system, cancer, or surgery), which provide guidance towards differential patient management. In our pain clinic, most patients suffered from chronic cancer pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain, which were poorly defined or nonexistent in the current ICD-10 coding system. Compared with the ICD-10, the ICD-11 provides more detailed diagnostic categories and is more informative for clinical use, research, and resource allocation for pain-related conditions.

### Life years lost associated with mental illness: a cohort study of beneficiaries of a South African medical insurance scheme [^5f1d41b3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2. Procedures

Our primary exposures were ICD-10 diagnoses of mental disorders made in outpatient or hospital settings. We grouped diagnoses into organic mental disorders (ICD-10 codes F00-F09), substance use disorders (F10–F17, F19), psychotic disorders (F20–F29), mood disorders (F30–F39), anxiety disorders (F40–F48), eating disorders (F50), personality disorders (F60–F69), developmental disorders (F80–F89), or any mental disorder (F00–F99). We further subdivided substance use disorders into alcohol use disorder (F10) and drug use disorders (F11–F17, F19), mood disorders into bipolar disorders (F31) and depressive disorders (F32–F33, F34.1), and anxiety disorders into generalised anxiety disorder (F41.1) and post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1). We did not analyse behavioural syndromes associated with physiological and physical factors (F50-F59) and behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90-F98) given the heterogeneous nature of these categories and, for the latter category, given the limited follow-up time and low mortality rates in young beneficiaries.

In secondary analyses, we only analysed ICD-10 diagnoses made in a hospital setting and psychiatric medication prescriptions as proxies for mental disorders. We grouped psychiatric medication following the ATC classification system into substance use medication (N07B), antipsychotic (N05A), antidepressant (N06A), anxiolytic (N05B), or any psychiatric medication (N05A, NO5B, N06A, and N07B).

We ascertained the vital status of beneficiaries based on mortality records from NPR and the medical insurance database. If the death dates recorded by the medical insurance did not match NPR data, we used death dates from NPR. Finally, we divided mortality by natural, unnatural, or unknown causes of death. Unnatural causes include all deaths by external causes, such as suicides, homicides, accidents, medical errors, alcohol intoxications and drug overdoses (ICD10 V01 — Y98) and natural causes include all causes of death from chapters 1 to 18 of the ICD-10. Unknown causes include death under investigation at the time of link- age, death due to unidentified causes, and death recorded only by the medical insurance but not by the NPR.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^a5ef0d27]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

ICD-10 Classification Process

We extracted all ICD-10 codes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 testing visit for each patient by matching visit numbers. Codes specific for the outcomes (R50* for fever, R05* for cough, and R06.0* for dyspnea) were selected on the basis of the specifications suggested by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. The asterisk (*) denotes that any code starting with the specified alphanumeric sequence would be included (ie, R06.03 is included for cough). Using this approach, the following codes were present in our data: R50.9, R50.81, R05, R06.02, R06.00, R06.03, and R06.09. Patients with at least 1 code in a given category were classified as having the symptom according to ICD-10 code.

### The classification of feeding and eating disorders in the ICD-11: results of a field study comparing proposed ICD-11 guidelines with existing ICD-10 guidelines [^cd2006c6]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In developing the ICD-11 chapter on Mental, Behavioral, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse identified clinical utility and global applicability as guiding principles. To this end, a Working Group convened by WHO reviewed the extant research base on feeding and eating disorders and proposed changes to the ICD-10 guidelines with the following aims: (a) to improve communication among users (e.g. practitioners, patients, families, administrators), (b) to foster conceptualization and understanding of feeding and eating disorders, (c) to accurately and easily describe actual clinical presentations, (d) to assist with clinical management, and (e) to enhance clinical outcomes at the individual and population levels.

The Working Group identified three overarching limitations inherent to the ICD-10 eating disorders guidelines: (1) the ICD-10's separation of feeding and eating disorders into two separate groups is not consistent with empirical data and current clinical practice, (2) the ICD-10 guidelines result in a lack of consistency in assigned diagnoses for eating disorders, with a large proportion classified using available "atypical" categories or "other specified" or "unspecified" residual categories, and (3) the ICD-10 guidelines fail to explicitly recognize the full range of cultural differences in clinical manifestations of feeding and eating disorders.

To address the first shortcoming of the ICD-10, and consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5), feeding and eating disorders represent a single grouping in the ICD-11 (Table 1 summarizes the essential features of proposed categories). Further, to improve the clinical utility of the diagnostic system and to reduce the use of "atypical", "other specified", or "unspecified" diagnostic categories in ICD-10, which have limited clinical utility or informational value, the Working Group recommended (1) broadening the guidelines for AN and BN to include atypical and developmental variations of presentation, (2) adding BED, and (3) adding avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) to the diagnostic nomenclature. To a great extent, the addition of ARFID represents a revised and expanded understanding of F98.2 Feeding disorder of infancy and childhood.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^38cbc533]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Esotropia ICD-10 CM codes — entities and laterality rules are specified as follows: Nonaccommodative (unspecified) H50.00; Accommodative H50.43; Alternating H50.05; Alternating with A pattern H50.06; Alternating with V pattern H50.07; Alternating with X or Y pattern (with other noncomitancies) H50.08; Monocular H50.01–; Monocular with A pattern H50.02–; Monocular with V pattern H50.03–; Monocular with X or Y pattern (with other noncomitancies) H50.04–; Intermittent, alternating H50.32; Intermittent, monocular H50.31–; Unspecified H50.00. CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; = 1, right eye; 2, left eye. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes indicates laterality. Esotropia and exotropia do not have bilateral codes. Therefore, if the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), most often you will find: Right is 1 Left is 2.

### Validation of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa diagnosis coding in Danish hospitals assisted by a natural language processing model [^1c179561]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Danish Health Care Registers rely on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-classification and stand as a widely utilized resource for health epidemiological research. Eating disorders are multifaceted syndromes where two distinctive diagnoses are defined, anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). However, the validity of the registered diagnoses remains to be verified. Manuel chart review is often the method for validation of diagnosis codes, but there is limited research on how natural language processing (NLP) models could enhance this process.

Objective

To investigate the accuracy of the clinical use of ICD-10 diagnosis codes F50.0, F50.1, F50.2, and F50.3 in the Danish Health Care Registers, using a manual chart review assisted by NLP.

Method

From a cohort of all individuals attending hospitals in Region of Southern Denmark with registered electronic health information, we extracted medical information from the electronic health journal on 100 individuals with each of the four diagnosis codes. After extraction, an NLP model with regular expression search patterns identified relevant text passages for manual chart review.

Results

Overall, 372 of the 400 diagnosis codes (93%) were correct. A diagnosis code for AN was correct in 90% of instances, 96% for atypical AN, 96% for BN and 90% for an atypical BN diagnosis code.

Conclusion

We found that the accuracy of a diagnosis code F50.0, F50.1, F50.2, and F50.3 to be high. This confirms that the generally well-documented validity of the Danish health care registers also applies to the eating disorder diagnoses.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^30383e9a]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Exotropia ICD-10 CM classifications — the page lists specific coding categories and codes: Alternating (H50.15), Alternating with A pattern (H50.16), Alternating with specified noncomitancy not elsewhere classifiable (includes alphabetical patterns) (H50.18), Alternating with V pattern (H50.17), Monocular (H50.11–), Monocular with A pattern (H50.12–), Intermittent unspecified (H50.30), Alternating, intermittent (H50.34), Monocular, intermittent (H50.33–), and Unspecified (H50.10). The notation states "CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; = 1, right eye; 2, left eye", and additional guidance explains that "the final character of the codes indicates laterality", that "Esotropia and exotropia do not have bilateral codes", so "if the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side", and that when laterality is specified "most often you will find: Right is 1" and "Left is 2".

### Predictors of anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity and order of diagnosis in a Danish national cohort [^bf9e56ee]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Strengths and Limitations

Using register data allows for the analysis of large sample sizes, along with comprehensive sociodemographic and clinical information on individuals with AN or OCD and their relatives, collected over decades. Throughout the time period examined in this study, the definition of AN remained consistent, despite changes to the specific ICD codes (306.50 in ICD‐8 to F50.0 and F50.1 in ICD‐10), which were accounted for in this study. Register data also circumvents selection and recall bias, as well as inconsistencies related to determining order of onset — whether it be onset of symptoms, meeting full diagnostic criteria, or receiving a professional diagnosis — which often accompany self‐report. Notably, the positive predictive values for AN and OCD in Danish registers are high (Egedal et al; Nissen et al.).

### The impact of gender-affirming interventions on eating disorder diagnosis risk among transgender and gender-diverse individuals [^869e0c8e]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study population

In this retrospective cohort study, we queried the database to select patients who identified as transgender and gender diverse (TGD) based on the presence of ICD-10 codes indicating gender identity disorders (GID) (ICD-10 codes F64.0-F64.9), which has been shown to be a highly specific method of identifying transgender patients in the EHR/EMR record –. Recent studies have shown an 88–100% accuracy in identifying transgender status based on ICD codes. We acknowledge that the term GID has been updated in the DSM-5 to Gender Dysphoria and therefore we will only use the term GID to reference the specific ICD-10 code used to query our population. We also agree that the current use of ICD-10 codes for GID diagnosis can pathologize one's transgender identity into a medical diagnosis. We therefore only use this ICD-10 code to identify transgender individuals and we do not support this code's pathologization of a non-cisgender identity. Furthermore, this group was then divided into several cohorts based on whether the type of gender-affirming care an individual received. We created four cohorts: those receiving hormone replacement therapy (HT), those who received gender-affirming surgical intervention (SX), those who received any form of gender-affirming care (HT and/or SX)(Any GAMT), and those who have had no gender-affirming interventions (Referred to as no intervention; NI). For all patients, we collected available clinical data including patient demographics (age, race, sex, ethnicity), BMI, comorbid conditions (Table 1), and the outcomes of developing an eating disorder (ICD-10: F50), including Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia, and Binge eating (both as individual and composite outcomes), occurring any time after the diagnosis of GID (index event). The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of F50 after the index event. While Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia, and Binge Eating disorder were the three most prevalent eating disorders, other eating disorders such as Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (OSFED) and Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) would be captured in the cohort titled "Eating Disorder (composite)". This cohort includes individuals with any subtype of a F50 diagnosis (EDNOS and OSFED included).

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Association of etiological factors across the extreme end and continuous variation in disordered eating in female Swedish twins [^793c7a87]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

ED diagnoses (categorical measurement)

ED diagnoses were identified from three sources. First, we used lifetime diagnoses from the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR), which includes diagnoses from psychiatric inpatient care from 1973 onwards and from specialized outpatient care from 2001 onwards. NPR diagnoses are coded according to ICD-9 and ICD-10. The CATSS data used in this study were linked to the NPR up until 31 December 2016. As a consequence, the end of follow-up in the NPR in our sample was 17 years for the youngest birth cohort (born 1999) and 24 for the oldest birth cohort (born 1992). EDs in the NPR have not yet been subjected to formal reliability/validity testing; however high validity of the NPR has been reported for a range of other psychiatric disorders (Idring et al; Ludvigsson et al; Rück et al; Sellgren, Landen, Lichtenstein, Hultman, & Langstrom). The following ICD-10 diagnoses of interest were retrieved for all participants: F50.0 (AN), F50.1 (atypical AN), F50.2 (BN), F50.3 (atypical BN), and F50.9 [eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS)]. The Swedish ICD-10 does not provide data on AN subtypes (restricting v. binge eating/purging type). It is important to note that the diagnosis of F50.1 (atypical AN) in the ICD system was typically given when the amenorrhea criterion in F50.0 was not present. This is different from the current DSM-5 classification of atypical AN (meets all criteria for AN except low weight). Individuals with DSM-5 atypical AN are not captured by AN/atypical AN in this analysis. We excluded individuals with the following codes: overeating associated with other psychological disturbances (F50.4), vomiting associated with other psychological disturbances (F50.5), other eating disorders (F50.8), feeding disorder of infancy and childhood (F98.2), and Pica of infancy and childhood (F98.3). In total, 93 out of 2962 individuals (3.1%) had an ED diagnosis of interest in the NPR (Table 1).

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^7b265eb9]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

Methods

This cohort study used deidentified data and was deemed exempt by the institutional review board group of UnitedHealth Group. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines.

We counted the unique individuals per 100 000 members per month with outpatient or inpatient care and a primary diagnosis code (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10]) for eating disorders (ICD-10: F50); alcohol use disorders (ICD-10: F10); depression, anxiety, and suicidality (ICD-10: F33, F34, F40, F41, T14); or opioid use disorders (ICD-10: F11). We excluded outpatient claims from members with inpatient claims in the same condition-month and emergency department claims.

### Maternal eating disorders, body mass index, and offspring psychiatric diagnoses [^81b59843]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

Data on the diagnoses of the offsprings' neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders were collected from HILMO. The diagnosis status was identified and grouped by the ICD-10 codes of any mental, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental disorder (F00-F99); mood disorders (F30-39, F92); anxiety disorders (F40-43, F93); sleep disorders (F51); intellectual disabilities (F70-79); specific developmental disorders (F80-83); ASD (F84); ADHD and conduct disorders (F90-91); disorders of social functioning with onset specific to childhood and adolescence, including selective mutism and attachment disorders, and tic disorders and Tourette syndrome (hereafter called social functioning and tic disorders) (F94-95); and other feeding disorders of infancy and childhood (F98.2).

Main Exposures

Maternal prepregnancy BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared using maternal height and prepregnancy weight reported from the first maternal care visit in the Medical Birth Register. It was categorized according to the World Health Organization guidelines as underweight for BMI less than 18.5; normal weight, 18.5 to 24.9; overweight, 25.0 to 29.9; obesity, 30.0 to 34.9; and severe obesity, 35.0 or higher. The data on maternal eating disorder diagnoses were obtained from HILMO, all diagnosed before pregnancy and identified using ICD codes as follows: any maternal eating disorder (ICD-9, 3071A, 3075B, and 3075E; ICD-10, F50), AN (ICD-9, 3071A; ICD-10, F50.0, F50.1), BN (ICD-9, 3071B; ICD-10, F50.2, F50.3), and EDNOS (ICD-9, 3071E; ICD-10, F50.8, F50.9).

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^12e9dff6]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Racial inequalities in mental healthcare use and mortality: a cross-sectional analysis of 1.2 million low-income individuals in rio de janeiro, Brazil 2010–2016 [^9e284669]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes

Three outcomes were considered for mental health: PHC usage (number of consultations as part of ESF), hospitalisation (count) and mortality for any mental disorder. Both primary and secondary causes of PHC usage were used to determine if consultations included mental health conditions. Mental disorders were grouped into six main categories with associated ICD-10 and ICPC codes (online supplemental material 2) to cover all relevant conditions: substance abuse/dependence disorders (ICD-10 F10–F19; ICPC P15, P17–P19); psychotic syndromes (ICD-10 F20–F25, F28, F29; ICPC P29, P71–P73, P98, P99); mood affective disorders (ICD-10 F30–F34, F38, F39; ICPC P03, P76); neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (hereafter referred to as anxiety disorders) (ICD-10 F40–F45, F48; ICPC P01, P02, P74, P79, P82); personality and behaviour disorders (ICD-10 F50, F51, F60–F63, F91–F94; ICPC P80, P86); suicide/associated outcomes (ICD-10 X60-X84, R45.851; ICPC P77). All relevant ICD-10 and ICPC codes for mental disorders were analysed by the six main categories and also in total (ie, any mental health conditions from any category). This was to record the maximum number of contacts with the health system and to account for comorbidity of psychiatric disorders.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^8a6194c6]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

With this study, we supply comprehensive data of an evaluative field test demonstrating that the new chronic pain diagnoses conform to the WHO requirements for ICD-11 coding.

In the line coding, the new ICD-11 classification was tested against the established system of the ICD-10 and outperformed it in almost every way: With the ICD-11, coding was more accurate, easier, and less ambiguous to use than the ICD-10. In particular, chronic secondary pain was difficult to code in the ICD-10 (72.8% false). The lack of unique codes for these conditions in the ICD-10 required the co-selection of unspecific codes (R52) to indicate the presence of chronic pain. Most participants failed to use this code combination and offered a broad variety of codes and combinations instead, demonstrating that reliable coding of chronic pain conditions with the ICD-10 is difficult. This difficulty is reflected by the fact that these codes are rarely used in healthcare statistics. Here, the ICD-11 fared significantly better.

### Mapping diagnostic trajectories from the first hospital diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder: a Danish nationwide cohort study using sequence analysis [^8ecc3da9]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Background

A key clinical problem in psychiatry is predicting the diagnostic future of patients presenting with psychopathology for the first time. The objective of this study was to establish a comprehensive map of subsequent diagnoses after a first psychiatric hospital diagnosis.

Methods

Through the Danish National Patient Registry, we identified patients aged 18 years or older with an inpatient or outpatient psychiatric hospital contact and who had received one of the 20 most common first-time psychiatric diagnoses (defined at the ICD-10 two-cipher level, F00-F99) between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2008. For each first-time diagnosis, the 20 most frequent subsequent psychiatric diagnoses (F00-F99), and death, occurring during 10 years of follow-up were identified as outcomes. To assess diagnostic stability, we used social sequence analyses, assigning a subsequent diagnosis to each state with a length of 6 months following each first-time diagnosis. The subsequent diagnosis was defined as the last diagnosis given within each 6-month period. We calculated the normalised entropy of each sequence to show the uncertainty of predicting the states in a given sequence. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of receiving a subsequent diagnosis (at the one-cipher level, F0-F9) after each first-time diagnosis.

Findings

The cohort consisted of 184949 adult patients (77129 [41.7%] men and 107820 [58.3%] women, mean age 42.5 years [SD 18.5; range 18 to > 100). Ethnicity data were not recorded. Over 10 years of follow-up, 86804 (46.9%) patients had at least one subsequent diagnosis that differed from their first-time diagnosis. Measured by mean normalised entropy values, persistent delusional disorders (ICD-10 code F22), mental and behavioural disorders due to multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances (F19), and acute and transient psychotic disorders (F23) had the highest diagnostic variability, whereas eating disorders (F50) and non-organic sexual dysfunction (F52) had the lowest. The risk of receiving a subsequent diagnosis with a psychiatric disorder from an ICD-10 group different from that of the first-time diagnosis varied substantially among first-time diagnoses.

Interpretation

These data provide detailed information on possible diagnostic outcomes after a first-time presentation in a psychiatric hospital. This information could help clinicians to plan relevant follow-up and inform patients and families on the degree of diagnostic uncertainty associated with receiving a first psychiatric hospital diagnosis, as well as likely and unlikely trajectories of diagnostic progression.

### Eating disorders in children, adolescents, and young adults during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: a Danish Nationwide register-based study [^e279564e]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

2 Method

The study was a population‐based time series analysis. We linked all Danish individuals aged 6–24 years from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2023, to individual‐level data on diagnoses and dates of hospital encounters from the Danish National Patient Registry. The Patient Registry includes both inpatient and outpatient contacts at hospitals (Schmidt et al.). Eating disorders were defined as any primary or secondary diagnosis, registered across psychiatric and somatic hospital settings with International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD‐10) codes of F50.X. We specifically examined the two ED subtypes anorexia nervosa (F50.0 + F50.1) and bulimia nervosa (F50.2 + F50.3), both including typical and atypical variants.

We assessed the monthly IRs of any ED and ED subtypes stratified by age groups (6–12, 13–16, 17–19, and 20–24 years) enabling comparisons with existing literature (Surén et al; Taquet et al; Trafford et al.). The IRs were calculated as the number of individuals with a first‐ever ED diagnosis per month per 100,000 person‐years (py).

Interrupted time‐series analyses were used to examine the association between specific time periods and ED diagnoses. Models were based on time‐series of monthly numbers of incident ED diagnoses from January 2015 through December 2023 with a total of 105 data points. Monthly counts were modeled using negative binomial regression with inclusion of Fourier terms to account for seasonality (Bhaskaran et al.). The time series was divided into three periods: (1) before the pandemic from January 2015 to February 2020, (2) during the pandemic from March 2020 to January 2022, and (3) after the pandemic from February 2022 to December 2023. All pandemic‐related restrictions were abolished in Denmark on January 31st, 2022. We modeled the level change (step function) of the pandemic and post‐pandemic periods and estimated the cumulative number of excess cases of incident EDs and corresponding risk ratios (RRs) for each period, comparing the fitted trend of observed numbers with predictions derived from the pre‐pandemic trend. Analyses were performed using STATA 18 (StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The study was registered at University of Southern Denmark's repository (record no. 11.106). According to Danish law, purely registry‐based studies are exempt from ethical approval.

### Maternal diabetes and the risk of feeding and eating disorders in offspring: a national population-based cohort study [^11e3d2b0]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Gestational diabetes has been coded independently throughout the study period (ICD-8: 63474, Y6449; ICD-10: O244, O249). If a mother was recorded with different diabetes types at various hospital contacts, she was classified based on the first diagnosis type. Diabetic complications, such as diabetic coma, ketoacidosis, nephropathy, ophthalmic, neurological, circulatory, and unspecified, or multiple complications, could in part reflect poor glycemic regulation. We used DNPR to identify mothers with pregestational diabetes who had diabetic complications (ICD-10 codes: E100–E108, E110–E118, and H36.0).

Feeding and eating disorders

FED, specific to infancy and early childhood, are characterized by refusal of food and extreme faddiness in the presence of an adequate food supply, a reasonably competent caregiver, with the absence of organic disease, and behavioral problems such as eating of non-edible substances (pica) or voluntary regurgitation of foods (rumination-regurgitation disorder).FED should be diagnosed only if the difficulties are clearly beyond the normal range, if the nature of the eating problem is qualitatively abnormal in character, or if the child fails to gain weight or loses weight over a period of at least 1 month. Information on FED diagnosed before 6 years old was obtained from the DNPR and the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, which hold all inpatient and outpatient psychiatric disorders diagnosis in Denmark. The ICD-10 codes for FED were F98.2 and F50.8.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6ece3d7b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rapid access to well-characterized, large SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cohorts is critical for scientific discovery. ICD-10 codes are a standard terminology and are attractive for data aggregation because they are uniformly used among health care systems. However, these codes perform poorly in capturing COVID-19–related symptoms. Our findings highlight the critical need for meticulous data validation to feed multicenter registries built from EMRs. Reliable, accurate data are the foundation of scientific discovery; the right data lead to the right solutions.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorders diagnoses among adolescents and young adults in catalonia: a population-based cohort study [^13c6fc11]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

2.3 Variables

We considered the first incident ED diagnosis as the outcome of interest. Diagnosis of EDs was made at primary care facilities based on standard practice, and were registered by general practitioners or pediatricians during their daily practice. EDs were identified on the basis of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM) codification system. All descendants of the F50 code were considered, including anorexia nervosa (F50.1), bulimia nervosa (F50.2), other specified EDs including binge‐eating disorder and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (F50.8), and unspecified EDs (F50.9).

We also extracted information on sex (female, male) and age. The age range included in this study was defined according to the World Health Organization definition of adolescents and young adults (10–19 and 15–24 years, respectively) (World Health Organization,), and was further divided into three age groups (10–14, 15–19, and 20–24 years).

We assessed socioeconomic status using the Mortalidad en áreas pequeñas Españolas y Desigualdades Socioeconómicas y Ambientales (MEDEA) deprivation index, which is calculated at the census tract level and it is categorized into quintiles, with the first and fifth quintiles representing the least and most deprived areas (Domínguez‐Berjón et al.). We included a rural category, as the MEDEA deprivation index is only available for individuals living in urban areas of Catalonia.

### Use of and comorbidities associated with diagnostic codes for COVID-19 in US health insurance claims [^4cec95fd]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Accurate identification of COVID-19 diagnosis in patient medical records is essential for studies using administrative data to examine morbidity, mortality, and risk factors associated with COVID-19. Before April 1, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested using the existing International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code B97.29 (other coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere) as the primary diagnostic code for patients infected with COVID-19. On April 1, 2020, a new code U07.1 (2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease) was added to ICD-10-CM and was rapidly adopted by hospitals. Our study examined how nonhospital and hospital health care professionals have used these diagnostic codes in practice using a national medical claims data set in the US. We analyzed the comorbidities associated with COVID-19 diagnosis to assess the specificity of the legacy code and the importance of using both codes.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^558158a2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.

### Accuracy of the modified global burden of disease international classification of diseases coding methods for identifying sepsis: a prospective multicentre cohort study [^d97f2020]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the initial 100 patients 42 [42% (95% CI, 32.3–51.8%)] had a clinical diagnosis of sepsis, consequently, we continued the study using the original eligibility criteria.

Of 6869 screened patients, 450 were included in the analysis (Fig. 1). Of these, 215 [47.8%; (95% CI, 43.2%-52.4%)] patients were assigned a clinical diagnosis of sepsis, which was considered acceptable for valid statistical analysis. The number (%; 95% CI) coded for sepsis by different ICD coding methods were modified GBD- explicit 108 (24.0%; 20.3–28.2%), modified GBD- implicit 175 (38.9%;34.5–43.5%), modified GBD- implicit plus 222 (49.3%; 44.7–53.9%) and Angus 170 (37.8%; 33.4–42.3%) (Fig. 1).

### One size does not fit all. genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^0d2dfc45]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

In the UK Biobank data set, we identified 1,550 individual participants with any eating disorder. They either self‐reported one or multiple of the three primary eating disorders anorexia nervosa (n = 720), bulimia nervosa (n = 402), or binge‐eating disorder (n = 561) in the mental health questionnaire (Davis et al.) or had an International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD‐10) (World Health Organization,) hospital diagnosis recorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics of F50.0 or F50.1 for anorexia nervosa (n = 48), F50.2 or F50.3 for bulimia nervosa (n = 21), or F50.5 for vomiting associated with other psychological disturbances, F50.8 for other eating disorders, including pica or F50.9 for eating disorder, unspecified (n = 15). We excluded the 15 participants with F50.5, F50.8, and F50.9 from this analysis due to insufficient numbers to perform analyses. This resulted in 768 (4.7%) participants with anorexia nervosa, 423 (2.7%) with bulimia nervosa, and 561 (3.5%), with binge‐eating disorder because if participants self‐reported more than one eating disorder diagnosis (n = 194), they were assigned to all applicable primary eating disorder groups. We randomly sampled one set of controls in the ratio of 1–10, resulting in 15,500 controls by using the following exclusion criteria: Controls must have answered the mental health questionnaire (Davis et al.), were not diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder (i.e. self‐report or ICD‐10 diagnosis), or taking any psychotropic medication. The subsample included 17,050 (92% female) European participants (for full descriptives of the UK Biobank sample, see Table S1) representing 3.4% of the UK Biobank participants (n = 502,682). This study was completed under the UK Biobank approved study application 27546.

### Genetic and environmental contributions to diagnostic fluctuation in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [^cc2a9856]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods and materials

The current study was approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden.

Register data

We acquired information from several Swedish national registers linked by the unique individual identification number. The Swedish Population Register provided birth year and month, death date and migration information (Ludvigsson et al.). The Multi-Generation Register contained information on biological parents for each individual who was born after 1932 and lived in Sweden since 1961. The National Patient Register (NPR) included inpatient psychiatric diagnoses since 1973 and outpatient psychiatric diagnoses since 2001; diagnoses of eating disorders in the NPR were based on the Swedish versions of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 1987–1996) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10, since 1997) (Ludvigsson et al.). The Swedish National Quality Register for Eating Disorder Treatment (Riksät, since 1999) and quality assurance system for eating disorders (Stepwise, since 2005) were two treatment quality registers for eating disorder treatments from specialized centres across Sweden (Birgegard et al; Emilsson et al; Javaras et al.); diagnoses in the treatment quality registers were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Data from the registers were updated until 2013–12–31.

Anorexia nervosa diagnosis was identified with ICD-9 code 307B or ICD-10 codes F50.0 or F50.1 from the NPR, or meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for anorexia nervosa or sub-threshold anorexia nervosa in Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) from the treatment quality registers. We were unable to distinguish between restricting and binge-eating and purging anorexia nervosa from the ICD diagnosis in the NPR. Bulimia nervosa diagnosis was identified with ICD-10 codes F50.2 or F50.3 from the NPR, or meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for bulimia nervosa or sub-threshold bulimia nervosa in EDNOS from the treatment quality registers. Bulimia nervosa was not an independent eating disorder category in the Swedish version of ICD-9. Therefore, its diagnostic period was shorter than that of anorexia nervosa, which could lead to under-detection of bulimia nervosa cases relative to anorexia nervosa cases.

### Comorbid mental disorders during long-term course in a nationwide cohort of patients with anorexia nervosa [^1c9cfa64]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHOD

2.1 Study samples

The study was based on the complete nationwide cohort of all individuals born 1961–2008 who were diagnosed with an eating disorder (ED) in 1994–2018 and at the time of the first diagnosis were at age 8–32 years. EDs were defined by the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition (WHO,), code F50 in the National Patient Register (NPR). Patients with AN (F50.0, F50.1) were identified in the registers as individuals with at least one AN diagnosis at the first day of registration with a non‐emergency incident ED diagnosis, regardless of whether the patient simultaneously had a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. The age range of the sample was guided by the idea that the validity of the diagnosis of AN is uncertain outside this age range. Based on studies analyzing childhood AN (see Herpertz‐Dahlmann et al.), we decided to truncate the empirical distribution at the lower age of 8 years at first diagnosis. The upper age at first diagnosis limitation was guided by the following considerations. First, it is questionable whether late onset exists or is due to late diagnosis (Scholtz, Hill, & Lacey). Secondly, in a previous study on life‐time incidence rates of first‐time diagnosed AN up to age 65 based on Danish registry data, we found a sharp decline of incidences starting with the age‐group 30–39 (Scholtz et al; Steinhausen & Jensen).

Diagnoses

Between the baseline and post-acute phases, the frequency of individual ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes increased within several chapters (Fig. 2). The greatest percentage increase was observed in the ICD-10 chapter of "diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism" (+ 16.3%), followed by "diseases of the nervous system" (+ 11.1%), "external causes of morbidity and mortality" (+ 7.9%), and "mental and behavioral disorders" (+ 7.7%).

Fig. 2
Percentage change from baseline to post-acute phase in ICD-10 diagnoses in the overall population (N = 19,558). Diagnosis codes (shown in parentheses) include those with a prevalence of ≥ 2% in the baseline population and with an increase from baseline to post-acute phases. Code ranges, raw values at baseline and post-acute phases, and diagnoses decreasing from baseline to post-acute phases are shown in Table 3. ICD-10, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision

Frequencies of other disorders increased more modestly or decreased (Table 3); the greatest percentage decrease was observed in the chapter of "diseases of the respiratory system" (–18.3%). Within this chapter, the decrease was driven specifically by a drop in frequency of the subchapters acute upper and lower respiratory infections (–56.6% and –69.3%, respectively), which outweighed increases in frequency of other respiratory conditions, such as "other respiratory diseases principally affecting the interstitium" (+ 59.8%; Table S 2 and Fig. S 1).

### Analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring of mothers with eating disorders in Sweden [^ae4e1619]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Exposed Cohorts and Matched Comparators

Within the study base, 3 cohorts of exposed children were identified. Maternal eating disorder exposure was stratified into the subtypes anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and unspecified eating disorder and defined as (1) a maternal eating disorder diagnosis registered at least twice (anorexia nervosa, ICD-9 307B and ICD-10 F50.0 and F50.1; bulimia nervosa, ICD-10 F50.2 and F50.3; unspecified eating disorder, ICD-9 307F and ICD-10 F50-9) in the Patient Register or (2) 1 main diagnosis in inpatient care before delivery date. Participants diagnosed before 9 years of age (and no registered diagnoses thereafter) were excluded to avoid misclassification of pediatric feeding disorders. Eating disorder status was further divided into ongoing disease, defined as at least 1 visit listing the specific diagnosis during the pregnancy or within 1 year before estimated conception, or previous eating disorder, defined as a last registered diagnosis more than 1 year before estimated conception.

All exposed children were matched with 5 comparator children, free of any maternal eating disorder exposure, based on maternal age at delivery, sex, and birth year. To adjust for unmeasured shared familial factors, we used the Multigeneration Register and identified a cluster of all exposed children with at least 1 exposure-discordant full maternal cousin (Figure 1).

### Migraine and the development of additional psychiatric and pain disorders in the transition from adolescence to adulthood [^532f04cf]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

56,597 adolescents at the age of 15 years were insured by the BARMER insurance company in 2006. 431 of these adolescents received the consistent diagnosis of migraine by their physicians, had no other headache diagnosis (G44.- and/or R51) and none of the pre-defined psychiatric and pain disorders in 2006 and therefore met the inclusion criteria for the migraine group. The control group consisted of 22,368 individuals. For detailed information of inclusion and exclusion process see Figure 1.

A high percentage of the adolescents with migraine (88.4%) developed at least one of the evaluated additional disorders in the 10-year follow-up period (Control group: 69.7%). The overall analysis (Table 1) showed that patients with a migraine diagnosis had a 1.3(1.2;1.3) fold higher risk to develop one or more of the evaluated additional disorders compared to persons without a headache diagnosis.

Table 1.
Adolescents with migraine developing the evaluated additional disorders over the 10 year follow up compared to the control group.

The analysis of the different later additional disorders resulted in the following:

In the course of the disease, patients with migraine had a 2.1(1.8;2.4) fold higher risk to develop an affective or mood disorder (ICD 10 diagnoses F30 - F39), compared to the control group.

Patients diagnosed with migraine developed neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (ICD 10 diagnoses F40 - F48) 1.8(1.6;1.9) fold more often than persons without a migraine and/or any other headache diagnosis.

Furthermore the risk for adolescents diagnosed with migraine for suffering from a subsequent behavioral syndrome associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors (ICD 10 diagnoses F50 - F59) in the course of the disease was 1.8(1.3;2.3) fold higher compared to the control group.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^f0ecb9a3]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In October 2015, discharge data coding in the USA shifted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), necessitating new indicator definitions for drug overdose morbidity. Amid the drug overdose crisis, characterising discharge records that have ICD-10-CM drug overdose codes can inform the development of standardised drug overdose morbidity indicator definitions for epidemiological surveillance.

Methods

Eight states submitted aggregated data involving hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge records with ICD-10-CM codes starting with T36-T50, for visits occurring from October 2015 to December 2016. Frequencies were calculated for (1) the position within the diagnosis billing fields where the drug overdose code occurred; (2) primary diagnosis code grouped by ICD-10-CM chapter; (3) encounter types; and (4) intents, underdosing and adverse effects.

Results

Among all records with a drug overdose code, the primary diagnosis field captured 70.6% of hospitalisations (median = 69.5%, range = 66.2%-76.8%) and 79.9% of ED visits (median = 80.7%; range = 69.8%-88.0%) on average across participating states. The most frequent primary diagnosis chapters included injury and mental disorder chapters. Among visits with codes for drug overdose initial encounters, subsequent encounters and sequelae, on average 94.6% of hospitalisation records (median = 98.3%; range = 68.8%-98.8%) and 95.5% of ED records (median = 99.5%; range = 79.2%-99.8%), represented initial encounters. Among records with drug overdose of any intent, adverse effect and underdosing codes, adverse effects comprised an average of 74.9% of hospitalisation records (median = 76.3%; range = 57.6%-81.1%) and 50.8% of ED records (median = 48.9%; range = 42.3%-66.8%), while unintentional intent comprised an average of 11.1% of hospitalisation records (median = 11.0%; range = 8.3%-14.5%) and 28.2% of ED records (median = 25.6%; range = 20.8%-40.7%).

Conclusion

Results highlight considerations for adapting and standardising drug overdose indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^2079c164]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

2.3. Data analysis

2.3.1. Line coding

For the ICD-10 and the ICD-11, the percentage of correct codes for each diagnosis and the percentage of difficulties with assigning the code were computed. The variable for the reported ambiguity of assigning the diagnosis was transformed into a binary variable (yes or no) and the frequencies determined. The frequencies of correctly assigned diagnoses, cases without difficulties, and cases without ambiguity were compared between ICD-10 and ICD-11 with the McNemar test. The respective frequencies for specificity (too little detail, too much detail, or just right) were calculated and compared between ICD-10 and ICD-11 with the McNemar–Bowker test. We also compared the groups of chronic primary and chronic secondary pain regarding correctly assigned diagnoses, difficulties, ambiguity, and specificity.

2.3.2. Case coding

The percentage of correct codes per pain diagnosis was calculated, and the mean judgements of the 3 facets of clinical utility for each pain diagnosis were computed. The correct selection of the main condition according to the morbidity rules was analysed between the rules by the χ² test.

2.3.3. Evaluation

Frequencies for coverage, ease of use, and level of detail were calculated. The textboxes were scrutinized for relevant comments and coded whether the participant reported gaps (no comment or no gap or gap) or redundancies (no comment or no redundancy or redundancy) and frequencies reported.

### Patterns of medical diagnoses before and after a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^cf7b369d]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Method

3.1 Study Design and Setting

We conducted this nationwide population‐based cohort study in Denmark using data from the Danish national health registries. In Denmark, the health care system is tax‐supported and mainly provided free of charge. All inhabitants are assigned a 10‐digit civil registration number at birth or immigration, which is registered in the Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) (M, L, and S; Pedersen). The CRS holds information on date and place of birth, sex, civil, and vital status.

Since 1977, all hospital admissions have been registered in the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) (Schmidt et al.). Admissions are registered with a primary and optionally one or more secondary diagnoses. From 1977 to 1994 the DNPR only included in‐patient contacts, but from1995 and onwards the registry also contains diagnosis codes from out‐patient clinics and emergency room visits.

The Danish Central Psychiatric Research Register (PCR) (Mors, Perto, and Mortensen) holds nationwide data on all diagnoses from in‐patient contacts from all psychiatric departments since 1970. Since 1995, the PCR also included out‐patient contacts. The PCR and DNPR merged in 1995.

All health care registries are linked to the CRS allowing for unambiguous individual record linkage via the civil registration number.

We retrieved data from the CRS, the DNPR, and the PCR on all patients diagnosed from 01.01.1987 to 01.01.2018 with an incident primary or secondary diagnosis code of AN (ICD‐8 code 306.5 and ICD‐10F50.0 and F50.1). As the DNPR was established in 1977 we chose to only include patients diagnosed from 1987 and onward to obtain complete 10 years look‐back for all patients. Index date was defined as the date of the first registered AN diagnosis code. We included both in‐ and out‐patient diagnosis codes. We included individuals aged 6 years and above.

3.2.2 Comparison Cohort

A comparison cohort was generated from the CRS and the DNPR and randomly matched 1:10 by sex and age (± 14 days) to the AN patient's index date. Individuals in the comparison cohort had no prior AN diagnosis. If they later received an AN diagnosis code, they entered the AN cohort and were matched with 10 new comparisons but remained in the comparison cohort to avoid informative censoring (Heide‐Jørgensen et al.).

FIGURE 1
Annual age‐stratified observed incidence in eating disorders per 100,000 for females aged 10–59 years from 2010 to 2023. The graph depicts the observed annual age‐stratified observed incidence rates (IRs) per 100,000 from 2010 to 2023 for females and included all ICD‐10 diagnoses: Anorexia nervosa (AN; F50.0 + 50.1), bulimia nervosa (BN; F50.2 + 50.3), and other EDs (F50.4–50.9).

FIGURE 2
Annual observed incidence in eating disorders per 100,000 for females aged 10–59 years stratified by diagnostic group from 2010 to 2023. The graph shows the annual total incidence rates (IRs) per 100,000 in EDs for all females aged 10–59 years stratified by ICD‐10 diagnostic group: Anorexia nervosa (AN; F50.0 + 50.1), bulimia nervosa (BN; F50.2 + 50.3), and other EDs (F50.4–50.9).

5.1 Excess Incidence (95%) between 2020 and 2023

As shown in Table 1, the total excess incidence for any ED in females in 2020 was 26.2 cases (95% CI: 9.1–43.2), increasing to 71.1 (95% CI: 53.2–88.9) in 2021, before falling to 30.2 (95% CI:10.4–50.5) in 2023. This indicates that the IRs among females were 16.7% higher than expected in 2020, 45.5% higher in 2021, and 19.4% higher in 2023. For males, the number of excess cases for any ED remained comparatively low, decreasing from 2.6 cases per 100,000 in 2020 to 1.0 case in 2023, leveling off to a rate that was 5.6% higher than expected.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

3. Results

3.1. Line coding

In total, the participants rated 2576 lines. They assigned more codes correctly using the ICD-11 (63.3%) than the ICD-10 (42.1%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 229.23, P < 0.001), encountered fewer difficulties assigning ICD-11 diagnoses (no difficulty 86.6%) than ICD-10 diagnoses (47.2%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 863.81, P < 0.001), and perceived fewer cases of ambiguity for the ICD-11 (no ambiguity: 75.5%) than for the ICD-10 (29.1%) (χ² [1, N = 2512] = 1003.84, P < 0.001).

Six of the lines referred to what is called "chronic primary pain" in the ICD-11 and 12 referred to chronic secondary pain. The diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly in the ICD-11 between chronic primary (62.2%) and secondary pain syndromes (63,8%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 0.64, P > 0.4) (Fig. 1). In the ICD-10, however, coding of chronic secondary pain was poor (27.2%) while existing chronic primary pain conditions were recognized correctly (70.8%) (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 722.51, P < 0.001). Regarding the perceived difficulty of the code assignment, primary and secondary pain did not differ in the ICD-11 (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 0.004, P > 0.9), but did so in ICD-10 (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 58.87, P < 0.001), with secondary pain being more difficult (refer to Fig. 1 for percentages). A parallel picture is revealed for ambiguity of code assignment. In the ICD-11, no difference between primary and secondary pain was observed (χ 2 [1, N = 2576] = 0.09, P > 0.7), but in the ICD-10, more ambiguity was reported for code assignments for secondary pain (χ² [1, N = 2576] = 49.14, P < 0.001).

Mortality in COPD — The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes mortality statistics for selected causes of death annually for all WHO regions, and in ICD-10 deaths from COPD or chronic airways obstruction are included under "COPD and allied conditions" (ICD-10 codes J42-46). Under-recognition and under-diagnosis of COPD reduces the accuracy of mortality data, and COPD may be listed as a contributory cause or omitted from death certificates. In 2011, COPD was the third leading cause of death in the United States. Data from the GBD Study 2017 estimated a COPD-attributable death rate was 42/100,000 (4.72% of all-cause deaths). With these caveats, globally there are around three million deaths annually due to COPD, and projections estimate over 5.4 million annual deaths from COPD and related conditions by 2060.

### Pediatric patients hospitalized with eating disorders in Ontario, Canada, over time [^2c573bd1]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Outcome Measure and Exposure

The primary outcome was the annual rate of hospitalization of individuals aged 5 to 17 years with eating disorder diagnoses per 10 000 population in Ontario from FY 2002 to FY 2019. Overall rates and specific rates by sex (male and female), age group (< 12, 12–14, and 15–17 years), and eating disorder diagnoses (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or other eating disorder) were calculated. Other eating disorders included eating disorders not otherwise specified, pica, rumination, and feeding disorders of childhood. Hospitalizations with eating disorder diagnoses were defined using diagnostic codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) with Canadian modifications, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV)and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5)in CIHI-DAD (codes F500, F501, F502, F503, F504, F505, F508, F509, F982, and F983) or OMHRS (codes 307.1, 307.50, 307.51, 307.52, 307.53, 307.59, and provisional diagnoses 10 and 12). The feasibility of identifying eating disorder hospitalizations using ICD-10 and DSM-IV and DSM-5 codes in CIHI-DAD and OMHRS databases has been established in prior Canadian research. Specific codes used are available in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. For eating disorder diagnostic groupings, hospitalizations were sorted into mutually exclusive groups. The DSM-IV and DSM-5 detail mutually exclusive diagnostic criteria for many diagnoses, such that individuals cannot have multiple eating disorder diagnoses concurrently. Specifically, a DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnosis of anorexia nervosa supersedes a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa and a DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnosis of anorexia or bulimia nervosa supersedes the other eating disorder diagnoses included in this study. Hospitalizations of individuals younger than 5 years, older than 17 years, and not residing in Ontario were excluded. Annual population counts of individuals aged 5 to 17 years eligible for provincial insurance from Ontario's health system registry were used as the population denominators.

### Machine learning model to predict mental health crises from electronic health records [^c57e51b9]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Features generation

We extracted a total of 198 features from the ten data tables (Supplementary Table 5). Each data table was processed separately, and no imputation that could add noise to the data was performed. Feature extraction was performed according to six procedures:
Static or semi-static features. Demographics data were represented as constant values attributed to each patient, with age treated as a special case that changed each year.
Diagnosis features. Patients were assigned their latest valid diagnosed disorder or a 'non-diagnosed' label and then separated into diagnostic groups according to the latest valid diagnosed disorder at the last week of the training set to avoid leakage into the validation and test sets. Each diagnosed disorder was mapped to its corresponding first-level category according to the ICD-10 (ref.) code system. For instance, F200 paranoid schizophrenia disorder was mapped to the F2 Schizophrenia and Psychotic category. We shortened the names of the first-level ICD-10 categories for brevity and to improve figure layouts: F0 Organic: organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders (ICD-10 codes F00–F09). F1 Substance Misuse: mental and behavioral disorders caused by psychoactive substance use (ICD-10 codes F10–F19). F2 Schizophrenia and Psychotic: schizophrenia and schizotypal and delusional disorders (ICD-10 codes F20–F29). F3 Mood: mood (affective) disorders (ICD-10 codes F30–F39). F4 Neurotic, Stress and Anxiety: neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (ICD-10 codes F40–49). F6 Personality and Behavior: disorders of adult personality and behavior (ICD-10 codes F60–69). Other Diagnosis: any other disorder not contemplated by the previous categories (ICD-10 codes F50–59 and F70–99). Not Diagnosed: no diagnosed disorder available in the EHR.
EHR weekly aggregations. EHRs related to patient–hospital interactions were aggregated on a weekly basis for each patient. The resulting features constituted counts per type of interaction, one-hot encoded according to their categorization. If a specific type of event did not occur in a given week, a value of '0' was assigned to the feature related to the corresponding type of event for the corresponding week.
Time-elapsed features. At each patient-week, for each type of interaction and category, we constructed a feature that counted the number of weeks elapsed since the last occurrence of the corresponding event. If the patient had never experienced such an event type up to that point in time, NaN values were used.
Last crisis episode descriptors. For each crisis episode, a set of descriptors summarizing the length and severity of the crisis episode was built. These descriptors were used to build features for the subsequent weeks until the next crisis occurred. If the patient had never had a crisis episode up to that point in time, NaN values were used.
Status features. For specific EHRs that are characterized by the start–end date, features for the corresponding weeks were built by assigning their corresponding value (or category); otherwise, they were set to NaN.

### Assessment of unmet health-related social needs among patients with mental illness enrolled in Medicare advantage [^f6a7eb83]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Outcomes and Variables

Each of the 7 HRSNs represented an outcome of interest and included (1) financial strain, (2) food insecurity, (3) housing instability, (4) housing quality, (5) severe loneliness, (6) transportation problems, and (7) utility affordability. Prevalence for each HRSN was assessed based on responses to the survey questions. Survey responses were treated as dichotomous (positive or negative screening result). We also examined the incremental consequences of HRSNs based on the total number of HRSNs reported.

The major independent variable for the adjusted logistic regression models was the presence of mental illness up to 12 months before the date of survey completion. We identified codes indicating mental illness listed as the primary, principal, or secondary diagnoses of a patient's inpatient or outpatient medical claims data, and participants were grouped into 4 study cohorts (SPMI, non-SPMI, SPMI plus non-SPMI, and no mental illness) following the criteria outlined in a Milliman research reporton the economic the impact of integrated medical-behavioral health care and consistent with definitions used by other researchers (Figure 1). Accordingly, SPMI was defined as having any of the following diagnoses: bipolar disorders (ICD-10-CM codes F30.XX, F31.XX, and F34.0), major depressive disorders (ICD-10-CM codes F32.0-F32.5, F32.89, F32.9, F33.XX, and F34.1), or schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (ICD-10-CM codes F20.XX, F21, F22, F24, F25, F28, and F29). Non-SPMI was defined as having any the following diagnoses: adjustment disorders (ICD-10-CM codes F43.0, F43.2X, F43.8, and F43.9), anxiety disorders (ICD-10-CM codes F40.XXX, F41.X, and F42.X), dissociative and conversion disorders (ICD-10-CM code F44.XX), eating disorders (ICD-10-CM code F50.XX), neurocognitive disorders (ICD-10-CM codes F01.XX, F02.XX, F03.XX, and G30.X), other mood disorders (ICD-10-CM codes F34.8X, F34.9, and F39), posttraumatic stress disorder (ICD-10-CM code F43.1X), or somatoform disorders (ICD-10-CM code F45.XX). Patients who had both SPMI and non-SPMI diagnoses were included in the SPMI plus non-SPMI cohort. All 3 cohorts (SPMI, non-SPMI, and SPMI plus non-SPMI) were mutually exclusive, allowing us to examine the association of different mental illnesses with HRSNs.

### Validity of international classification of diseases (ICD)-10 diagnosis codes for identification of acute heart failure hospitalization and heart failure with reduced versus preserved ejection fraction in a national Medicare sample [^808a2516]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospitalization in older adults. Medicare data have been used to assess HF outcomes. However, the validity of ICD-10 diagnosis codes (used since 2015) to identify acute HF hospitalization or distinguish reduced (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) versus preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unknown in Medicare data.

Methods

Using Medicare data (2015–2017), we randomly sampled 200 HF hospitalizations with ICD-10 diagnosis codes for HF in the first/second claim position in a 1:1:2 ratio for systolic HF (I50.2), diastolic HF (I50.3), and other HF (I50.X). The primary gold standards included recorded HF diagnosis by a treating physician for HF hospitalization, ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 50 for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and EF > 50 for HFpEF. If the quantitative EF was not present, then qualitative descriptions of EF were used for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction/HFpEF gold standards. Multiple secondary gold standards were also tested. Gold standard data were extracted from medical records using standardized forms and adjudicated by cardiology fellows/staff. We calculated positive predictive values with 95% CIs.

Results

The 200-chart validation sample included 50 systolic, 50 diastolic, 47 combined dysfunction, and 53 unspecified HF patients. The positive predictive values of acute HF hospitalization was 98% [95% CI, 95–100] for first-position ICD-10 HF diagnosis and 66% [95% CI, 58–74] for first/second-position diagnosis. Quantitative EF was available for ≥ 80% of patients with systolic, diastolic, or combined dysfunction ICD-10 codes. The positive predictive value of systolic HF codes was 90% [95% CI, 82–98] for EFs ≤ 50% and 72% [95% CI, 60–85] for EFs ≤ 40%. The positive predictive value was 92% [95% CI, 85–100] for HFpEF for EFs > 50%. The ICD-10 codes for combined or unspecified HF poorly predicted heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or HFpEF.

Conclusions

ICD-10 principal diagnosis identified acute HF hospitalization with a high positive predictive value. Systolic and diastolic ICD-10 diagnoses reliably identified heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and HFpEF when EF 50% was used as the cutoff.

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^1107af4b]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM — compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families' annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family's inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children's health care.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^46dfe7de]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

The ability of the O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify true injury cases is unknown. Furthermore, per the ICD-10-CM guidelines for Coding and Reporting, codes from Chapter 15, PCP (O00-O9A) 'have sequencing priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes from other chapters may be used in conjunction with Chapter 15 codes to further specify conditions'. Specifically, O9A.2 'should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate injury, poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or under-dosing code, and then the additional code(s) that specifies the condition caused by the poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing'. Similarly, O9A.3-O9A.4 should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate codes to identify any associated current injury due to physical abuse or sexual abuse. However, it has not been studied how often and why the O9A.2-O9A.5 are listed as a secondary diagnosis, and what percentage of injuries complicating pregnancy-related outcomes are potentially missed when the definition for injury hospitalisations captures only principal diagnoses of O9A.2-O9A.5.

ICD-10-CM coding of inpatient and emergency department discharge data follows guidelines for assigning a principal diagnosis. In inpatient data, the principal diagnosis is defined as 'that condition established after study to be the chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care'. This definition does not apply to hospital-based outpatient services, including emergency department visits. In outpatient settings, the first-listed diagnosis represents 'the code for the diagnosis, condition, problem or other reason for the encounter/visit shown in the medical record as chiefly responsible for the service provided. In some cases the first-listed diagnosis may be a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the physician'.

This analysis evaluates the ability of O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify injuries in inpatient and emergency department discharge claims from one healthcare facility in Kentucky, looking additionally at the codes' positive predictive value (PPV) when used as a principal diagnosis within inpatient data, as a secondary diagnosis within inpatient data, and in any position within emergency department data.

### The classification of feeding and eating disorders in the ICD-11: results of a field study comparing proposed ICD-11 guidelines with existing ICD-10 guidelines [^b35102a9]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, the results in this study indicate that the proposed ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for eating disorders represent a significant improvement over ICD-10. Clinicians report that the ICD-11 has high clinical utility; the additional diagnostic categories appear to be widely understood and are expected to increase the clinical accuracy in the diagnosis of feeding and eating disorders. These improvements in diagnosis have the potential to facilitate the organization and delivery of services and to achieve better clinical outcomes over time.

### Postdischarge mortality in a cohort hospitalized with anorexia nervosa [^5505e6b9]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

This study was based on a dataset containing hospital discharge abstracts (called the discharge abstracts database, or DAD) from all acute care hospital admissions in Canada (with the exception of the province of Quebec) linked to the National Vital Statistics Deaths Database. Detailed information about these information sources is available on the Statistics Canada Web Page (Statistics Canada). In brief, the DAD captures administrative, clinical, and demographic information on hospital discharges (including deaths, sign‐outs, and transfers). The discharge abstracts are submitted directly from acute care facilities, health regions or health authorities, or provincial ministries or departments to federal agencies that curate national datasets. Each province and territory also collects registrations for all deaths within their borders. These include the medical certificate of death completed by the last medical practitioner in attendance, or a report from a coroner or medical examiner if an inquest or inquiry was held. The provincial estimates are aggregated at the national level for entry into the National Vital Statistics Deaths Database and linked with the DAD by Statistics Canada. The datasets are made available to academic researchers through a network of Regional Data Centers. Notably, while in‐hospital deaths are recorded in the DAD database, these same deaths are also recorded in the deaths database.

We restricted our sample to hospital discharges from acute care settings and excluded those from prior to 2006, the date at which ICD‐10 (specifically, a Canadian adaptation called ICD‐10CA) was adopted by all of the provinces (Canadian Institute for Health Information). Notably, the target population was not admissions to psychiatric units or facilities, but rather admissions in which the primary diagnosis was indicative of a mental disorder, including all the disorders in the Mental and Behavioral Disorders ICD‐10 chapter. In addition, age was restricted to 10–85 years at the time of admission. When there were multiple admissions, we selected the first one. The DAD data specifies the diagnosis judged to be most responsible for the admission as well as up to 24 additional diagnoses. In this study, we focused on the condition considered most responsible for the admission. The cohort of discharged patients was subdivided according to whether their initial admission was for AN or not using the ICD‐10 codes for AN (F50.0X, which includes unspecified F50.00, restricting F50.01, and binge eating/purging type F50.02) and atypical AN (F50.1).

### Consensus recommendations for optimizing electronic health records for nutrition care [^681631bc]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2020). High credibility.

Nutrition diagnosis and malnutrition coding — nutrition screening and assessment identify problems requiring treatment, and the Academy's Nutrition Care Process utilizes nutrition diagnoses to standardize nutrition diagnostic terminology; a nutrition diagnosis as defined by the Academy describes a specific nutrition problem that can be improved or resolved through nutrition interventions. The domains of nutrition diagnoses include "intake", "clinical", and "behavioral-environmental" as defined on-page, while a medical diagnosis is used by health care providers and coders as described in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Malnutrition is one nutrition clinical domain and medical diagnosis (ICD-10 code) that affects patient care as well as appropriate coding, billing, and reimbursement; patients can be diagnosed with malnutrition in any health care setting, organizations should adopt explicit malnutrition criteria that all health care professionals can apply consistently, and the Academy and ASPEN published recommended criteria for the identification of adult and pediatric malnutrition.

Variable Definitions

Patient Demographics and PTE Categories

Demographics included age, income quartiles, and marital status (eMethods in Supplement 1). Nine PTE categories were identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code-based discharge diagnoses in the DNPR and DPCRR for fire or explosion, transportation accident, exposure to toxic substance, medical complications or injury, traumatic brain injury (TBI), physical assault, pregnancy-related trauma, and suicide death of a family member (eTable 1 and eMethods in Supplement 1). To capture more serious events consistent with PTEs, hospitalization of 2 days was required for transportation accident, exposure to toxic substance, and medical complications or injury and 3 days for pregnancy-related trauma (except stillbirth). If individuals experienced more than 1 event on the same day, they were coded in a multiple PTEs category. PTE categories were discrete; individuals in the cohort were classified once for first-recorded PTE.

Psychiatric Disorders

Nine psychiatric disorder categories were determined using ICD-10 codes in the DPCRR and DNPR. The categories included (1) organic disorders (F00-F09); (2) substance use disorders (F10-F19); (3) schizophrenia or psychotic disorders (F20-F29); (4) manic episode or bipolar disorders (F30-F31 and F34-F39); (5) depressive disorders (F32-F33); (6) neurotic or somatoform disorders (F40-F42 and F44-F48); (7) stress-related disorders (F43); (8) physiological disorders (F50-F59); and (9) adult personality disorders (F60-F69). For each category, we identified incident psychiatric disorders, defined as first-recorded diagnosis within 5 years of PTEs, as in prior research. Incidence was captured for all possible disorder categories.

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^9b81e000]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^c79aace6]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Cataract ICD-10 coding — age-related cataract (ARC) categories and laterality are specified, listing Cortical ARC (H25.01–), Anterior subcapsular polar ARC (H25.03–), Posterior subcapsular polar ARC (H25.04–), Other age-related incipient cataract (H25.09–), Age-related nuclear cataract (H25.1–), ARC, morgagnian type (hypermature cataract) (H25.2–), Combined forms of ARC (H25.81–), Total or mature cataract (H25.89 Other ARC), and ARC; exfoliation of lens capsule (H25.89 Other ARC). For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Rates of neuropsychiatric disorders and gestational age at birth in a Danish population [^5c6cfd79]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Neuropsychiatric Disorders in Offspring

We used International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codesto ascertain neuropsychiatric diagnosis of interest records up to August 10, 2017. We did not include International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) diagnoses before 1994 to avoid differences in disease classification and missing records of outpatient visits. Considering the duration of follow-up and disease prevalence in the study population, we focused on 9 major types and 8 subtypes of neuropsychiatric diagnoses recorded in the DPCR. The major neuropsychiatric diseases disorders included (1) mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance abuse (ICD-10 codes F10-F19); (2) schizophrenia and related disorders (ICD-10 codes F20-F29); (3) mood disorders (ICD-10 codes F30-F39); (4) neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (ICD-10 codes F40-F48); (5) eating disorders (ICD-10 code F50); (6) specific personality disorders (ICD-10 code F60); (7) intellectual disability (ICD-10 codes F70-F79); (8) pervasive developmental disorders (ICD-10 code F84); and (9) behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (ICD-10 codes F90-F98). Among these major groups, we also investigated 8 subtypes of common neuropsychiatric diseases, including (1) mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol use (ICD-10 code F10), (2) mental and behavioral disorders due to cannabis use (ICD-10 code F19), (3) schizophrenia (ICD-10 code F20), (4) schizoaffective disorders (ICD-10 code F25), (5) bipolar disorder (ICD-10 codes F30 and F31), (6) anorexia nervosa (ICD-10 code F50.0), (7) childhood autism (ICD-10 code F84.0), and (8) hyperkinetic disorder (ICD-10 code F90). For each neuropsychiatric disorder, the date of onset was defined as the first day of the initial contact with inpatient or outpatient psychiatric services for the diagnosis of interest.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6cf86e4d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes are used to characterize coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related symptoms. Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses.

Objective

To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (< 50, 50–64, and > 64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson χ2 tests were used to compare different subgroups.

Results

Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24–0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96–0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39–0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42–0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84–0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95–0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16–0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22–0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96–0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40–0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (χ² = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (χ² = 14.25; P = 0.003) but not for cough (χ² = 5.13; P = 0.16).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^9ece1f72]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

### Prevalence of maternal mental illness among children and adolescents in the UK between 2005 and 2017: a national retrospective cohort analysis [^d7c7edfa]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

This study was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for CPRD research (17_187). The requirement for informed consent was waived because the study used de-identified patient data.

Procedures

The key outcome measure was prevalence of maternal mental illness. Maternal mental illness was identified if there was evidence in the database of the following ICD-10 categories: non-affective psychosis (ICD 10 codes F20–4, F28–9); affective psychosis, including bipolar disorder (F25, F30–1); depressive disorders (F32–9); anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic stress disorders (F40–8); eating disorder (F50–3); personality disorders (F60–3); substance and alcohol dependence disorders (F10–19); and other psychiatric disorders not otherwise specified (F99). Acute alcohol intoxication (F10.0) and acute stress reaction (F43.0) were excluded.

Four data fields were used to classify mental disorder: diagnosis of a mental disorder during clinical consultation (including antecedent diseases, eg alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver); symptoms of mental disorder recorded during a consultation; referral to psychiatric care services; and prescription of psychotropic medications. The dates of these medical events were also obtained. Diagnostic and symptom codes were identified using previously published lists, or by searching the Read Code list using relevant strings and stubs (appendix p 12). Symptom codes were mapped to diagnostic categories. Medications were extracted using relevant British National Formulary chapters and each class of medication was assigned to their primary indication: antidepressants (depressive disorder); antipsychotics (non-affective psychosis), anxiolytics or hypnotics (anxiety disorders); mood stabilisers (affective psychosis); and drugs used to treat substance dependence. Code lists were finalised and assigned specific mental disorders using input from four clinical experts (ES, KK, DMA, and KMA) and uploaded to an.

### Time trends in treatment modes of anorexia nervosa in a nationwide cohort with free and equal access to treatment [^21586e0c]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study sample

The study comprises a nationwide cohort of patients diagnosed for the first time with AN (F50.0) or atypical AN (F50.1) according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition (ICD‐10) (WHO, 1992) in the Danish National Patient Register (NPR) in the period 1994–2013. Atypical AN is defined as a disorder meeting some criteria of the typical form (BMI below 17.5 kg/m², self‐induced weight loss, body image distortion, and endocrine disorder most often reflected by secondary amenorrhea) without fulfilling all key symptoms. All patients with a previous eating disorder diagnosis (F50x [ICD‐10] or 305.60, 306.50, 306.58, 306.59 [ICD‐8]) were excluded.

Each patient in the study sample was followed for 5 years after diagnosis in the registers covering the years 1994–2018 in total. The first 5 years of treatment were chosen to minimize the effect of enduring long‐standing courses with recoveries and relapses, which change the approach as described in a recent review (Russell, Mulvey, Bennett, Donnelly, & Frig, 2019) and which may blur potential trends. All patients with less than a 5‐year follow‐up were excluded; the same applied to patients who were included less than 5 years before the end of the study period 31/12–2018 (Figure 1). The age range at first time diagnosis was set at a minimum of 8 years and the empirical maximum was 32 years. Patients with an AN‐diagnosis before age 8 were excluded due to unclear validity of the diagnosis given the major difficulties of differential diagnosis at this young age.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Associations between parental socioeconomic-, family-, and sibling status and risk of eating disorders in offspring in a Danish national female cohort [^f5a732a2]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 Exposures

The evaluated exposures were: order of the child's birth, number of full and half siblings, family composition (single parent/both parents living together), low/medium/high level of maternal and paternal income (separately, in tertiles per calender year), occupational level (outside the labor market; manual and nonmanual employee; director or leader), and basic (compulsory school), short (vocational training/high school), medium (up to and including bachelor), or higher education (graduate/postgraduate degree) (for detailed definitions see Table S1). All exposures, when possible, were defined in childhood at start of follow‐up, that is, the year the index person turned 6, ensuring exposure came before outcome. Only numbers of half and full siblings were considered time‐dependent variables, to include all of the index person's siblings (not all of them were born the year the index person turned 6). Parents' time spent at work (half time/full time employment) was investigated in the initial analyses in a subsample of the cohort (index persons born January 1, 1989 to December 31, 2006) because data were not available from 2007 onwards.

2.4 Outcomes

The outcomes were defined as ICD‐10 diagnoses (World Health Organization,), which is currently in use in Denmark, in the offspring of narrow AN (ICD‐10: F50.0), broad AN (ICD‐10: F50.0, F50.1), BN (ICD‐10: F50.2, F50.3), EDNOS (ICD‐10: F50.8, F50.9), and MDD (ICD‐10: F32, F33) in either the National Patient Register or the Psychiatric Central Research Register. Only the EDNOS diagnosis is available in ICD‐10 and not specific ED diagnoses such as binge‐eating disorder. A person could be in more than one of the diagnostic groups (Figure S1). MDD in the offspring was included as a psychiatric comparison, representing a prevalent major mental illness. The date of onset for each outcome was defined as the registration date for the first inpatient or outpatient contact leading to a discharge diagnosis of the respective disorder. To minimize misdiagnoses of other childhood feeding and eating disorders, any ED diagnosis before age 6 was not included. Individuals diagnosed with MDD before age 6 were excluded from that particular analysis.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^3f880b19]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. The transition from ICD-9-CM was effectively instantaneous, with 99.8% of all diagnoses coded using ICD-10-CM in October 2015.

We examined study population characteristics by month from 2010 through 2017 to look for changes that might have introduced trend artifacts (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Although the number of eligible enrollees varied by year, population characteristics remained nearly constant across all months. In particular, no noteworthy changes in the number of eligible enrollees, mean age, sex, health insurance plan type, or fraction of enrollees located in California occurred at the October 2015 transition to ICD-10-CM. The proportion of enrollees with at least 1 eligible diagnosis in a month was consistent over the sample period.

Table 1 summarizes overall findings on changes in diagnostic category prevalence rates within each classification system. No large changes were observed in the WHO chapters, suggesting that overall coding practice (and population health) was relatively stable across the transition. However, the F test rejects simple linearity in favor of a model with a discontinuity in slope or trend for 11 of 17 WHO chapters (58%), identifying small changes at the ICD-10-CM transition but none that approached the threshold that we considered large (ie, ≥ 20%).

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^51ad6a56]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association COVID-19 data standards — scope and special considerations: This document provides data standards for cardiovascular and other complications related to COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the intent is to provide data elements consistent with current practice guidance and to include updated terminology and attributes in compliance with Task Force methodology and ACC/AHA policies for harmonization. The document is intended for use by researchers, registry developers, and clinicians and is proposed as a framework for ICD-10 code development of COVID-19–related cardiovascular conditions. In this document, data elements were not differentiated for specific encounters such as for inpatients versus outpatients, dates of encounter, number of encounters, baseline or repeated data elements, and databases can be built and customized according to users' needs to capture such information. The intent was not to provide recommendations regarding COVID-19 treatment, and the writing committee recommends that readers follow prevailing COVID-19 management guidelines.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Time trends in healthcare-detected incidence of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in the Norwegian national patient register (2010–2016) [^011a9c72]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Few studies have investigated temporal trends in the incidence of eating disorders (EDs). This study investigated time trends in the age- and sex-specific incidence of healthcare-detected anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) from 2010 to 2016.

Methods

Data were retrieved from the Norwegian National Patient Register as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10): narrowly defined AN (F50.0), broadly defined AN (F50.0 + 50.1), narrowly defined BN (F50.2), and broadly defined BN (F50.2 + 50.3). The average annual percent changes (AAPCs) in incidence rates (IRs) were examined by Joinpoint regression analyses.

Results

The overall (i.e., both genders, ages 10–49) rates of AN were stable across the 7-year period, with IRs ranging from 18.8 to 20.4 per 100,000 for narrowly defined AN and 33.2 to 39.5 per 100,000 for broadly defined AN, whereas overall rates of BN declined. Age- and gender-stratification revealed a significant average annual increase in AN (narrow and broad) among 10- to 14-year-old girls. The incidence of broadly defined AN also increased significantly among females aged 15–19 years between 2010 and 2012, before leveling off. Nearly universal declines in the incidence of narrowly and broadly defined BN among females occurred. IRs among males were stable and comparatively low, with no significant trends toward increasing or decreasing rates of AN or BN over time.

Discussion

Although register-based studies provide an underestimate of the true incidence and may not accurately reflect population-level changes in true ED occurrence, this study extends our knowledge regarding trends in the detected incidence of EDs into the second decade of the 21st century.

Individuals with mental disorders often develop comorbidity over time. Past studies of comorbidity have often restricted analyses to a subset of disorders and few studies have provided absolute risks of later comorbidity.

Objectives

To undertake a comprehensive study of comorbidity within mental disorders, by providing temporally ordered age- and sex-specific pairwise estimates between the major groups of mental disorders, and to develop an interactive website to visualize all results and guide future research and clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study included all individuals born in Denmark between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2015, and living in the country between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2016. The analyses were conducted between June 2017 and May 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Danish health registers were used to identify mental disorders, which were examined within the broad 10-level International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, subchapter groups (eg, codes F00-F09 and F10-F19). For each temporally ordered pair of disorders, overall and lagged hazard ratios and 95% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Absolute risks were estimated using competing risks survival analyses. Estimates for each sex were generated.

Results

A total of 5 940 778 persons were included in this study (2 958 293 men and 2 982 485 women; mean [SD] age at beginning of follow-up, 32.1 [25.4] years). They were followed up for 83.9 million person-years. All mental disorders were associated with an increased risk of all other mental disorders when adjusting for sex, age, and calendar time (hazard ratios ranging from 2.0 [95% CI, 1.7–2.4] for prior intellectual disabilities and later eating disorders to 48.6 [95% CI, 46.6–50.7] for prior developmental disorders and later intellectual disabilities). The hazard ratios were temporally patterned, with higher estimates during the first year after the onset of the first disorder, but with persistently elevated rates during the entire observation period. Some disorders were associated with substantial absolute risks of developing specific later disorders (eg, 30.6% [95% CI, 29.3%-32.0%] of men and 38.4% [95% CI, 37.5%-39.4%] of women with a diagnosis of mood disorders before age 20 years developed neurotic disorders within the following 5 years).

Conclusions and Relevance

Comorbidity within mental disorders is pervasive, and the risk persists over time. This study provides disorder-, sex-, and age-specific relative and absolute risks of the comorbidity of mental disorders. Web-based interactive data visualization tools are provided for clinical utility.
