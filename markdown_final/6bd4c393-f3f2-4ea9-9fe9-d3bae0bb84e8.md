## Question

Calculate the dose for breakthrough pain using morphine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate the appropriate breakthrough morphine dose for a patient already receiving around-the-clock opioids. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient is opioid-tolerant. Then, I should calculate the total daily morphine equivalent dose. Next, I will apply the 5% to 20% rule to estimate the breakthrough dose. After that, I need to consider route-specific adjustments, especially if using parenteral morphine. Then, I should individualize based on patient factors and titrate to effect. Finally, I will set monitoring and adjustment thresholds, including when to increase the background opioid rather than the rescue dose, and I will double-check special scenarios like transdermal fentanyl transitions and renal impairment before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: breakthrough pain in cancer is a transient exacerbation superimposed on otherwise controlled background pain in patients receiving scheduled opioids, and the rescue dose should be proportional to the total daily opioid exposure, typically expressed as morphine milligram equivalents per day, with the patient opioid-tolerant before prescribing short-acting opioids for rescue [^114P4gib] [^112M9ziQ].

> I need to calculate the total daily morphine equivalent dose from the current regimen. For example, if a patient is on extended-release morphine 30 mg every 12 hours, that equals 60 mg/day, and if on transdermal fentanyl 25 mcg/hour, that approximates 60 mg/day oral morphine equivalents, though equianalgesic ratios vary and should be applied cautiously with clinical judgment and close monitoring [^115y7LJc] [^112Z8gt9].

> Next, I should review the breakthrough dose principle: multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on using an immediate-release opioid at about 5% to 20% of the total daily morphine equivalent dose for each breakthrough episode, with many clinicians targeting around 10% as a pragmatic starting point, and I should confirm that this applies across oral and parenteral routes with appropriate equianalgesic adjustments [^114snfpK] [^11379hkg] [^112eXJ6S] [^1179oybF].

> Let me calculate the breakthrough dose now: for a total daily morphine equivalent of 60 mg, 10% equals 6 mg, so a reasonable oral immediate-release morphine rescue dose would be 6 mg as needed, with a range of 3 to 12 mg reflecting 5% to 20% of the daily total. I should double-check that this aligns with the 5% to 20% framework and note that some older sources described a one-sixth rule, but contemporary guidelines favor the 5% to 20% range, so I will prioritize the latter [^114snfpK] [^112hSoTB].

> Hold on, I should verify route-specific adjustments: if using intravenous morphine for rapid relief, the equianalgesic parenteral-to-oral morphine ratio is commonly cited as about 1:3, so a 6 mg oral breakthrough dose corresponds to roughly 2 mg IV, and small studies suggest that IV morphine at about 20% of the oral daily dose can be effective for episodic pain, but I need to ensure careful titration and monitoring given interpatient variability and the risk of oversedation or respiratory depression [^112Z8gt9] [^116KSdgT] [^114EeB5w].

> I will now examine individualization and titration: elderly patients, those with hepatic or renal impairment, or high opioid tolerance may require lower starting percentages within the 5% to 20% range, whereas some patients may need higher percentages. The key is to start conservatively, reassess pain relief at about 30 to 60 minutes, and titrate the rescue dose or frequency based on response and adverse effects, documenting each change and the clinical rationale [^112Z8gt9] [^116mHRpg] [^1179oybF].

> Wait, let me verify monitoring thresholds and when to adjust the background regimen: if a patient consistently requires more than about four breakthrough doses per day, I should reassess the underlying pain control and consider increasing the around-the-clock opioid dose rather than escalating rescue doses indefinitely, and if the breakthrough pattern suggests end-of-dose failure, shortening the interval or increasing the basal dose may be more appropriate than simply adding more rescue medication [^111N5u27] [^112L1Ea2] [^1179oybF].

> But wait, what if the patient is on transdermal fentanyl or transitioning to it? I should confirm that during the first 48 to 72 hours of a new transdermal opioid, breakthrough pain may be more frequent and require scheduled immediate-release opioids every 3 to 4 hours as a bridge, with rescue doses available as needed, and then reassess the total daily opioid exposure to recalculate the rescue percentage once steady state is reached [^1145hepL] [^111boG5S].

> I need to ensure safety checks are explicit: start low, go slow, monitor for sedation, respiratory depression, and constipation, and remember that rapid-onset fentanyl formulations exist for patients with rapid-onset breakthrough pain, but they require strict opioid-tolerance criteria and careful titration. For most patients, conventional immediate-release morphine remains a reasonable and cost-effective rescue option when aligned to the 5% to 20% rule and titrated thoughtfully [^112M9ziQ] [^115mAEFK] [^111dq4G8].

> Let me reconsider the practical example to ensure internal consistency: for 60 mg/day oral morphine equivalents, an oral immediate-release morphine rescue dose of 6 mg as needed, with a range of 3 to 12 mg, is appropriate. If using IV morphine, about 2 mg IV as needed is a reasonable starting point, with dose adjustments based on response and side effects, and I should document the percentage of daily dose used to guide future titration and to communicate clearly with the care team [^114snfpK] [^112Z8gt9] [^1179oybF].

For breakthrough pain in patients on around-the-clock opioids, the recommended morphine dose is **5–20% of the total daily morphine equivalent dose** [^114snfpK] [^11379hkg], with 10% as a typical starting point [^1179oybF]. Use **immediate-release morphine** for slow-onset or predictable breakthrough pain [^112ZarXA], and titrate to effect based on response and side effects [^111N5u27]. If more than four breakthrough doses are needed per day, reassess and increase the background opioid dose [^111N5u27] [^112L1Ea2].

---

## Calculation of breakthrough morphine dose

The breakthrough dose is calculated as a **percentage of the total daily opioid dose** [^116mHRpg], expressed as morphine equivalent [^112eXJ6S]:

- **Recommended range**: 5–20% of the total daily morphine equivalent dose (MED) [^114snfpK] [^11379hkg].
- **Typical starting dose**: 10% of the total daily MED [^1179oybF].
- **Example calculation**: If the total daily MED is 60 mg, the breakthrough dose would be 6 mg (10% of 60 mg).

---

## Clinical considerations and adjustments

Several factors influence the **appropriate breakthrough dose**:

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, weight, renal and hepatic function, and opioid tolerance [^116SZqho].
- **Pain characteristics**: Severity, onset, duration, and predictability of breakthrough pain episodes [^114P4gib].
- **Response to therapy**: Titrate the breakthrough dose based on analgesic response and side effects [^111N5u27].

---

## Frequency and timing of breakthrough doses

Immediate-release morphine is typically administered **every 4 hours as needed** [^1179oybF]. For predictable breakthrough pain (e.g. incident pain), administer a dose **30 minutes before the triggering activity** [^112ZarXA].

---

## Monitoring and titration

Regular assessment is essential to ensure effective pain control and minimize adverse effects. Clinicians should monitor pain relief, side effects, and the **number of breakthrough doses** required per day [^111N5u27]. If more than four breakthrough doses are needed per day, reassess and increase the background opioid dose [^111N5u27] [^112L1Ea2].

---

## Alternative medications and formulations

While morphine is commonly used for breakthrough pain, **alternative medications and formulations** may be considered:

- **Rapid-onset transmucosal fentanyl**: Effective for rapid-onset breakthrough pain, particularly in opioid-tolerant patients [^114P4gib] [^1154fCmz].
- **Hydromorphone or oxycodone**: Alternative opioids for patients intolerant or unresponsive to morphine [^115yTKSe].
- **Adjunctive medications**: Non-opioid analgesics, antidepressants, or anticonvulsants may be added for neuropathic or mixed pain syndromes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major oncology and palliative care guidelines provide the following **recommendations**:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ASCO | Immediate-release opioids at 5–20% of the total daily opioid dose for breakthrough pain [^114snfpK] [^11379hkg] |
| ESMO | Use immediate-release opioids for breakthrough pain, individualized titration based on response [^112aSKRD] [^114rnZMw] |
| WHO | Provide immediate-release morphine as rescue medication for breakthrough pain [^116mHRpg] |

---

## Summary of key points

- **Breakthrough morphine dose**: 5–20% of the total daily opioid dose, typically 10% [^114snfpK] [^1179oybF].
- **Administration**: Immediate-release morphine every 4 hours as needed, or 30 minutes before predictable episodes [^1179oybF] [^112ZarXA].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess pain control, side effects, and frequency of breakthrough doses [^112hSoTB] [^112L1Ea2].
- **Adjustment**: Increase background opioid dose if more than four breakthrough doses are required per day [^111N5u27] [^112L1Ea2].
- **Alternatives**: Consider rapid-onset transmucosal fentanyl or other opioids if morphine is ineffective or poorly tolerated [^114P4gib] [^115yTKSe].

---

The recommended morphine dose for breakthrough pain is **5–20% of the total daily opioid dose**, with 10% as a typical starting point. Immediate-release morphine is used for slow-onset or predictable breakthrough pain, and dosing should be individualized and titrated based on response and side effects.

Management of acute background pain

The majority of children with cancer experience medium-to-severe pain, which may be disease- or treatment- (including procedure/intervention)-related somatic, visceral, neuropathic, and/or spiritual pain. Reasons for children with acute cancer pain to have worsening pain may include disease progression or infection at the tumor site, development of tolerance, drug interactions, decreasing renal function with accumulation of nociceptive metabolites (eg, morphine-3-glucuronide or hydromorphone-3-glucuronide), and/or somatization and psychological distress.

Data suggest that applying the following World Health Organization (WHO) principles of pain management results in good pain relief for the majority of children with cancer, including those with mucositis pain:

Using a two-step strategy ("by the analgesic ladder")
Dosing at regular intervals ("by the clock")
Using the appropriate route of administration ("by the appropriate route")
Adapting treatment to the individual child ("with the child").

Using a two-step strategy ("by the analgesic ladder")

Pain severity dictates the choice of analgesic. Mild acute cancer pain may be treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol) and/or ibuprofen if there are no contraindications. Medium-to-severe acute cancer pain requires strong pain medication, such as opioids (eg, morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone, or methadone) (see Table 1). These same concepts would not hold true for severe chronic pain, however. In children with such conditions as functional abdominal pain, tension-type headaches/migraines, chronic musculoskeletal pain/juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome, and pain "beyond the expected time of healing" (eg, daily chronic pain weeks or months after a hemoglobin sickle-cell anemia-induced vaso-occlusive crisis), opioids would actually be contraindicated and usually should not be administered.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of ABSTRAL was investigated in a clinical trial in opioid tolerant adult patients experiencing breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough cancer pain was defined as a transient flare of moderate-to-severe pain occurring in patients with cancer experiencing persistent cancer pain otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications including at least 60 mg morphine/day, 50 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for 1 week or longer. All patients were on stable doses of either long-acting oral opioids or transdermal fentanyl for their persistent cancer pain.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed in patients with cancer to evaluate the effectiveness of ABSTRAL for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Open-label titration identified a dose of ABSTRAL in which a patient obtained adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects, within the range of 100 mcg to 800 mcg. In the double-blind efficacy study, patients who identified a successful dose were randomized to a sequence of 10 treatments; seven with ABSTRAL and three with placebo.

Of the 131 patients who entered the titration phase of the study, 78 (60%) achieved a successful dose during the titration phase. Sixty- six patients entered the double-blind phase and 60 completed the study. The dose of ABSTRAL was determined by titration starting at 100 mcg. The final titrated dose of ABSTRAL for breakthrough cancer pain was not predicted from the daily maintenance dose of opioid used to manage the persistent cancer pain. In a second open-label safety study using an identical titration regimen, 96 of 139 patients (69%) who entered the study titrated to a dose in which the patient obtained adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects during the titration phase. Table 5 presents the final titrated dose for both the doubleblind efficacy and open-label safety studies.

The primary outcome measure, the mean sum of pain intensity difference at 30 minutes (SPID30) for ABSTRAL-treated episodes was statistically significantly higher than for placebo-treated episodes.

### Impact of opioid rescue medication for breakthrough pain on the efficacy and tolerability of long-acting opioids in patients with chronic non-malignant pain [^115wnC8d]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In patients with malignant and non-malignant chronic pain treated with ATC opioids, end-of-dose pain is usually managed by increasing the ATC opioid dose or shortening the dosing interval, whereas other types of breakthrough pain are treated with IR short-acting opioids on a pre-emptive or as-needed basis. However, there is little long-term evidence that this is the most appropriate strategy to deal with breakthrough pain in chronic non-malignant patients. We are not aware of any randomized controlled studies that have investigated the impact of IR opioid rescue medication use for breakthrough pain on the efficacy and tolerability of chronic opioid therapy in patients with chronic non-malignant pain. In this review, we have attempted to address this question based on indirect comparisons between studies of long-acting opioids in chronic non-malignant pain that allowed the use of IR short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain and those that did not.

In the meta-regression analysis, whether or not rescue medication was allowed did not significantly impact on analgesic efficacy even after adjusting for potentially confounding variables, such as study design, Jadad score, and opioid type. We assumed that rescue medication was used in studies in which this was not explicitly stated, if they were usual care or non-interventional studies. The analgesic effect was significantly greater in the uncontrolled studies than the controlled studies, which is to be expected as larger effects tend to be seen in uncontrolled studies. These larger effects are often due to the bias inherent in the study design, but there is no reason to assume that those biases are different in rescue vs non-rescue studies. Assuming this bias to be constant, we did not attempt to adjust for bias in our analyses, and we do not claim to estimate a valid treatment effect of the opioids under review. These results suggest that allowing treatment of breakthrough pain with short-acting IR opioids is of no additional benefit in terms of long-term analgesic efficacy, but also does not reduce analgesic efficacy in patients with chronic non-malignant pain treated with long-acting opioids.

### Controversies in pharmacotherapy of pain management [^113MFtJb]. The Lancet: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Since the establishment of the WHO three-step ladder for management of cancer pain, several controversies have arisen, which are partly due to new drug development, reformulations of older analgesics, and technological advancements. As a result, clinicians need clarification of several questions. Is morphine the opioid of choice for moderate to severe pain in cancer? Should combinations of opioids be used? When should spinal opioids be used to treat pain in cancer? What are the appropriate opioid doses for breakthrough pain? Should selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 2 inhibitors be used? What is the best tactic to treat neuropathic pain, and what first-line adjuvant analgesic should be used? And do bisphosphonates relieve bone pain in cancers other than breast cancer and myeloma? This review addresses these questions.

ACOEM opioids — breakthrough pain (BTP) outside cancer indicates caution; functional gain documentation is recommended, dose escalation risk is noted, and treatment of nonmalignant BTP without overt trauma is not recommended: Non–cancer-related breakthrough pain (BTP) has been treated with opioids; in treating BTP, functional gain is recommended to be documented; otherwise, the total dose should revert to the prior dose level; the treatment of BTP with opioids is likely a common means of dose escalation; thus, treatment of nonmalignant BTP in the absence of overt trauma is not recommended.

Breakthrough pain medication at the end of life

Even when good baseline pain relief has been achieved, most patients will require occasional ' ' doses of analgesia. Uniformly effective breakthrough dosing protocols have not been determined for children with EB at end of life, although there are general recommendations from several international sources, and data to support the use of up to 20% of total daily opioid consumption, in adults with cancer. In general, a short-acting, immediate release form of opioid should be given at approximately 10% to 15% of the total background opioid dose of the previous 24 hours. If rescue dosing is used frequently and consistently, then the baseline opioid dosing needs to be increased. Individual patient factors should be taken into consideration (including prior opioid exposure, renal and hepatic function, other medication use) and consultation with an expert in pain management and/or palliative care is recommended. The same principle is recommended for opioids given via all routes of administration. When very rapid onset is needed, transmucosal administration of opioids may be preferable (see Box 9). Commercially available transmucosal preparations of fentanyl are available in doses likely to be suitable for older children and adults. Evidence supports the use of transbuccal fentanyl for breakthrough pain in cancer patients. An additional benefit of fentanyl is that it is not dependent on renal excretion. In some centers, the injectable formulations of morphine or diamorphine have been used buccally at around a third of the standard enteral dose (equivalent to the intravenous dose), allowing more flexibility of dosing. It is also important to remember that extreme anxiety may confound pain perception or expression and that there may be benefit in offering additional doses of buccal midazolam where this is felt to be a significant factor. Therapy should be targeted at specific symptoms whenever possible, although combination therapy is not unusual. Breakthrough analgesia should be offered in the face of unexplained ' ' in case of undiagnosed pain, after which medication for primary agitation/anxiety may be considered. While it is likely that both of these would cause a degree of sedation at higher doses, this should not be the primary aim of treatment.

Good practice points

Palliative pain care is an expected part of care for EB, which in many cases is life-limiting in nature. All basic principles of palliative care apply as they do for other terminal disease states.

### Challenges of pain control and the role of the ambulatory pain specialist in the outpatient surgery setting [^114Cpn6K]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

In chronically opioid-consuming patients, the shift to an oral opioid requires particular attentiveness. Inpatients need opioids for a comparatively extended duration of time epidurally or intravenously relative to those required in opioid-naïve patients. There is no widely acknowledged guideline as to the method in which postoperative transition to an oral opioid regimen is optimally accomplished in outpatients. Carroll et alrecommended (for inpatients) converting the intravenous dose into its equivalent oral dose, giving half to two-thirds of this amount as a long-acting opioid, and keeping the remaining dose available as an administered short-acting opioid as needed. In effect, short-acting opioids can address any breakthrough pain, and long-acting opioids can function as a stable baseline of pain management. As postoperative pain begins to diminish, reducing the dosage of a short-acting opioid seems to be an effective method in reducing the total dose of opioids administered daily.

### Initial pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy evaluation of nasal morphine gluconate for breakthrough pain in cancer patients [^114ik9o9]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with controlled background pain associated with cancer frequently also experience episodes of moderate to severe intensity breakthrough pain. Opioid pharmacotherapy, particularly with oral morphine, remains the cornerstone for the management of cancer pain. Nasal administration of opioids provides a mechanism for more rapid drug absorption and more rapid onset of pain relief compared with oral dosing. This non-randomized, open-label, uncontrolled investigation evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of a single 40 mg dose of nasal morphine gluconate, administered to cancer patients in response to an episode of breakthrough pain. Single dose nasal morphine gluconate administered to 11 patients was associated with effective plasma morphine concentrations (mean C(max) 64 ng/ml; range 33.8–121 ng/ml) and low plasma morphine metabolites (morphine-6-glucuronide mean C(max) 114 ng/ml; range 46–189 ng/ml; morphine-3-glucuronide mean C(max) 572 ng/ml; range 257–990 ng/ml). Side effects were minor and limited to nasal irritation. Patients reported rapid onset of pain relief (perceptible pain relief achieved in 10/11 patients, time to onset 2.4 ± 2.1 min; and meaningful pain relief, achieved in five patients, 6.8 ± 7.3 min to onset, mean t(max) 0.36 h). Pain intensity scores were significantly reduced at all times after dosing; pain relief scores were unchanged. Patient satisfaction ratings were high. These results show that nasal morphine has rapid absorption and apparent onset of effect. Additional multi-dose, dose-ranging and placebo-controlled studies of nasal morphine for cancer pain are warranted.

### Fentanyl pectin nasal spray versus oral morphine in doses proportional to the basal opioid regimen for the management of Breakthrough cancer pain: a comparative study [^111mqxyg]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Fentanyl products have shown superiority over oral opioids for the management of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP). However, these studies did not use an appropriate patient selection, and drugs have been compared using a different rationale.

Objectives

The aim of this randomized, crossover, controlled study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS) and oral morphine (OM), given in doses proportional to opioid daily doses.

Methods

Cancer patients with pain receiving ≥ 60 mg of OM equivalents/day and presenting with ≤ 3 episodes of BTcP/day were included. Patients received, in a randomized, crossover manner, FPNS or OM at doses proportional to the daily opioid regimen in four consecutive episodes of BTcP. Pain intensity was measured before (T0), 15 (T15), and 30 minutes (T30) after study drugs.

Results

A total of 167 episodes were treated, 82 with FNPS and 85 with OM. A statistical difference in pain intensity between the two groups was observed at T15, but not at T30 (P = 0.018 and P = 0.204, respectively). In a greater number of episodes treated with FPNS, there was a pain decrease of ≥ 33% in comparison with OM after 15 and 30 minutes (76.5% vs. 32.8%, and 89% vs. 54.9%, respectively). Similar differences were found in the decrease in pain intensity of ≥ 50% after 15 and 30 minutes (52.3% vs. 11.4%, and 75% vs. 45.8%, respectively). The difference was highly significant at T15 (P < 0.0005). The mean (SD) pain difference at T15 of FPNS and OM were 3.24 (1.7) and 2.70 (1.2), respectively, whereas the mean (SD) SPIDs30 of FPNS and OM were 4.87 (1.7) and 4.54 (1.5), respectively. The difference was highly significant at T15 (P = 0.019). No severe adverse effects after study drug administration were observed.

Conclusion

When used in doses proportional to the basal opioid regimen, FPNS showed a superior analgesic effect over OM for the management of BTcP. Only minor adverse effects were found with both medications.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^112SNomw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine-based management of chronic pain in persons living with HIV who are on buprenorphine for opioid use disorder includes adjuvants, dose adjustments, formulation changes, and escalation strategies: Clinicians should use adjuvant therapy appropriate to the pain syndrome for mild-to-moderate breakthrough pain, and based on expert opinion the clinician should increase the dosage of buprenorphine in divided doses as an initial step, with dosing ranges of 4–16 mg divided into 8-hour doses noted as having shown benefit. Based on expert opinion, clinicians might switch from buprenorphine/naloxone to buprenorphine transdermal formulation alone. If a maximal dose of buprenorphine is reached, it is recommended that an additional long-acting potent opioid such as fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone should be tried, and if usual doses of an additional opioid are ineffective, a closely monitored trial of higher doses of an additional opioid is recommended, noting that buprenorphine's high binding affinity for the µ-opioid receptor may prevent lower doses of other opioids from accessing the µ-opioid receptor. For patients on buprenorphine maintenance with inadequate analgesia despite these strategies, transitioning the patient from buprenorphine to methadone maintenance is recommended.

### Safety and effectiveness of intravenous morphine for episodic breakthrough pain in patients receiving transdermal buprenorphine [^114hRpnK]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

Supplemental dosing of an opioid is the main treatment suggested to manage breakthrough pain in cancer patients. The intravenous route has been proven to be safe and effective, providing rapid analgesia in patients receiving oral morphine. Transdermal buprenorphine (TTS-BUP) is increasingly used in cancer pain management, but this drug has been labeled as a difficult drug to use in combination with other opioids. The aim of this open-label study was to verify the safety and effectiveness of intravenous morphine (IV-MO) for the treatment of episodic pain in cancer patients receiving TTS-BUP. A consecutive sample of 29 cancer patients, who were treated with TTS-BUP, reported an acceptable basal analgesia, and presented with episodic pains were selected for the study. The IV-MO dose was one-fifth of the morphine equivalent oral daily dose calculated using a ratio of TTS-BUP/oral morphine of 1:75, and a morphine IV/oral ratio of 1:3. For each episode, pain intensity and opioid-related adverse effects were recorded when severe pain occurred (T0), and 15 minutes after. One hundred six breakthrough events in the 29 patients (3.7 episodes per patient, on average) were recorded during admission. The mean pain intensity decreased from an initial value of 7.3 (confidence interval [CI] 95% 7.0–7.5) to 2.9 (CI 95% 2.5–3.3) 15 minutes after IV-MO. Ninety-eight episodes (92.4%) were considered treated successfully, defined as a reduction of more than 33% within 15 minutes; 88 of these episodes (83.0%) had more than 50% pain intensity decrease. No differences in age, gender, pain mechanism, and time of events were found. Eight episodes (7.5%) did not respond effectively within 15 minutes, and required further doses. The occurrence of adverse effects for each episode treated was not frequent and intensity was not relevant. IV-MO was effective and safe in most cancer patients receiving TTS-BUP who experienced pain exacerbation.

### Fentanyl (Subsys) [^11171kp2]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate SUBSYS to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions.

From the 100 mcg initial dose, closely follow patients and change the dosage level until the patient reaches a dose that provides adequate analgesia using a single SUBSYS dose per breakthrough cancer pain episode with tolerable side effects. Patients should record their use of SUBSYS over several episodes of breakthrough cancer pain and review their experience with their physicians to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted.
For each breakthrough pain episode treated, if pain is not relieved after 30 minutes, patients may take ONLY ONE additional dose of the same strength for that episode. Thus patients should take a maximum of two doses of SUBSYS for any breakthrough pain episode.
Patients MUST wait at least 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with SUBSYS.
If there is a need to titrate to a 200 mcg dose, prescribe 200 mcg SUBSYS units.
Subsequent titration steps are 400 mcg, 600 mcg, 800 mcg, 1200 mcg and 1600 mcg. See Table 2.
To reduce the risk of overdose during titration, patients should have only one strength of SUBSYS available at any time.

SUBSYS Titration Process

Once titrated to a dose that provides adequate pain relief and tolerable side effects, patients should generally use ONLY ONE SUBSYS dose of the appropriate strength per breakthrough pain episode.

On those occasions when the breakthrough pain episode is not relieved within 30 minutes after administration of the SUBSYS dose, the patient may take ONLY ONE additional dose using the same strength for that episode.

Patients MUST wait at least 4 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with SUBSYS. Once a successful dose has been found, patients should limit consumption to four or fewer doses per day.

Dosage adjustment of SUBSYS may be required in some patients in order to continue to provide adequate relief of breakthrough pain.

If signs of excessive opioid effects appear following administration of a single SUBSYS dose, subsequent doses should be decreased.

Generally, only increase the SUBSYS dose when a single administration of the current dose fails to adequately treat the breakthrough pain episode for several consecutive episodes.

If the patient experiences greater than four breakthrough pain episodes per day, the dose of the maintenance (around-the-clock) opioid used for persistent pain should be re-evaluated. In addition, if pain worsens, re-evaluate the patient for changes in the underlying pain condition.

### Opioids for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients [^114P4gib]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2006). Breakthrough pain is a transient exacerbation of pain that occurs either spontaneously or in relation to a specific predictable or unpredictable trigger despite relative stable and adequately controlled background pain. Breakthrough pain usually related to background pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity and generally self limiting with a mean duration of 30 minutes. Breakthrough pain has traditionally been managed by the administration of supplemental oral analgesia (rescue medication) at a dose proportional to the total around-the-clock (ATC) opioid dose.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of opioid analgesics given by any route, used for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer, and to identify and quantify, if data permitted, any adverse effects of this treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries in January 2005 for the original review, and again on 6 February 2013 for this update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of opioids used as rescue medication against active or placebo comparator in patients with cancer pain. Outcome measures sought were reduction in pain intensity measured by an appropriate scale, adverse effects, attrition, patient satisfaction and quality of life. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and examined eligible studies. We retrieved full text if any uncertainty about eligibility remained. We screened non-English texts. We conducted quality assessment and data extraction using standardised data forms. We compared drug and placebo dose, titration, route and formulation and recorded details of all outcome measures (if available).

Main Results

The original review included four studies (393 participants), all concerned with the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) in the management of breakthrough pain. Two studies examined the titration of OTFC, one study compared OTFC versus normal-release morphine and one study compared OTFC versus placebo. Fifteen studies (1699 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this update. All studies reported on the utility of seven different transmucosal fentanyl formulations, five of which were administered orally and two nasally. Eight studies compared the transmucosal fentanyl formulations versus placebo, four studies compared them with another opioid, one study was a comparison of different doses of the same formulation and two were randomised titration studies. Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl formulations were an effective treatment for breakthrough pain. When compared with placebo or oral morphine, participants gave lower pain intensity and higher pain relief scores for transmucosal fentanyl formulations at all time points. Global assessment scores also favoured transmucosal fentanyl preparations. One study compared intravenous with the transmucosal route and both were effective.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl is an effective treatment in the management of breakthrough pain. The RCT literature for the management of breakthrough pain is relatively small. Given the importance of this subject, more trials, including head-to-head comparisons of the available transmucosal fentanyl formulations are required.

### Impact of opioid rescue medication for breakthrough pain on the efficacy and tolerability of long-acting opioids in patients with chronic non-malignant pain [^115AwQJH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

All English, German, French, Spanish, or Italian language full-text research articles were eligible for inclusion, as long as they met the criteria defined below.

All published, prospective, blinded, or open-label clinical trials with either a randomized or controlled design were eligible. Prospective observational studies were also accepted. Case reports, conference proceedings, or retrospective studies (surveys or audits) were excluded from this review.

Eligible patients were adults aged ≥ 18 yr with chronic non-malignant pain (such as chronic musculoskeletal pain, vascular disorders, chronic pancreatitis, lower back pain, osteogenic pain, coronary artery disease, phantom limb pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, or neuropathic pain). Studies that included patients with malignant pain were eligible only if less than one-third of the study population were patients with malignant pain. Studies in both opioid-naïve patients and patients already on opioids were eligible.

Treatments included in the review were long-acting opioids or opioid formulations [such as methadone, transdermal fentanyl, or sustained-release (SR) morphine] including the weak opioids, tramadol, codeine, and slow-release dihydrocodeine. All routes of administration, other than intrathecal or intraspinal, were eligible. Since intrathecal use of opioids is an invasive method often used as a last resort in a selection of patients unresponsive to other treatments, we felt that that patient group is not comparable with those receiving oral or transdermal opioids. All studies in which one or more opioids was administered for at least 4 weeks, including those that compared one opioid with placebo, other opioids, or other active controls were eligible for inclusion. Studies had to have a flexible dosing regimen (at least during the maintenance phase); studies with specific criteria for dose escalation or dose escalation to a maximum dose were eligible.

Whether an IR opioid was used as rescue medication or not had to be defined. If this information was not given explicitly in the publication, a single attempt was made to contact the authors to obtain this information before the study was excluded.

Studies reporting at least one of the following outcome measures were eligible.
A measure of analgesic efficacy, such as pain relief or pain intensity measured by the Brief Pain Inventory, a visual analogue scale, or equivalent, or patient and investigator global assessment of analgesic efficacy.
Tolerability: number or percentage of patients reporting either nausea, constipation, or somnolence/sedation (or drowsiness if somnolence/sedation not reported).

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^111frrUk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — research gaps and future directions for opioid use in adults with cancer pain are presented as prioritized questions, covering comparative effectiveness, dosing strategies, and special populations, and the page provides resource links. Priorities include clinically meaningful differences between opioids in patients with cancer; differences between scheduling an immediate-release opioid with as-needed dosing versus extended-release administration with as-needed immediate-release opioids for breakthrough pain; the preferred opioid for breakthrough pain; and the optimal increase or decrease when modifying opioid dose in response to changes in pain. Additional questions address the clinical impact of renal and hepatic dysfunction on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of each opioid; conversion factors for different opioids and routes and whether these vary based upon dose (low dose v high dose); optimal strategy for opioid switching; strategies for preventing and managing opioid-induced adverse effects; the real-world role of genetic testing in guiding opioid dosing; and the safest and most effective strategies for treating cancer pain in patients with opioid use disorders or nonmedical opioid use. The page also states that cancer clinical trials are vital and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate, and it directs readers to www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.cancer.net for more information and patient resources.

Methadone dosing for chronic pain in persons living with HIV — when using opioid treatment programs — includes split dosing and adjunct options as follows: The splitting of methadone into 6- to 8-hour doses is recommended to lengthen analgesia with the goal of continuous pain control, and providers may add 5%-10% of the current methadone dose as afternoon and evening doses for a total 10%-20% increase when prescribing remaining daily doses for opioid use disorder. If prescribing additional methadone is not possible, an additional medication may be recommended based on pain etiology, and acute exacerbations or "breakthrough pain" should be treated with small amounts of short-acting opioid analgesics in patients at low risk for opioid misuse, with providers and patients agreeing on pill number, frequency, and expected duration.

Breakthrough pain and withdrawal

Breakthrough or transient pain is described as brief exacerbations of pain that occur in the background of stabilized pain management adequately controlled by around-the-clock (ATC) SR opioid therapy. Transient pain is treated with adjunctive PRN doses of PO IR opioids (morphine, oxycodone, or hydrocodone), as well as buccal or intra-nasal fentanyl in concert with an appropriate ATC SR opioid therapy. IR transmucosal fentanyl doses should be titrated according to patient response. Adequate pain relief from first dose of TD-O should be evaluated at initiation of pharmacotherapy and continued over the first 3–5 days of administration. The goal is to limit the number of breakthrough pain doses such that the patient's life is disrupted as little as possible during their day and at rest.

If more than two doses are required for breakthrough pain over a 24-hour period in order to achieve adequate pain control once steady state has been reached, then the clinician may consider increasing the TD-O dose.TD-Fe dosage increases are usually 25%–33% of the patch strength and based on the patient's response to therapy. The ideal dose of TD-O is individualized and determined by continued evaluation of pain control and use of breakthrough pain pharmacotherapy.

For minimal withdrawal symptoms, patients should be counseled to utilize their scheduled IR opioid every 3–4 hours and not PRN during the transition period. The withdrawal prevention or bridge dose of IR PO opioid should be equal to 10%–15% of the previous 24 hour opioid dose taken prior to beginning TD-Fe pharmacotherapy. Patients can also self-medicate with additional doses or IR opioids about every 2 hours, PRN, if they experience breakthrough pain during this initial period and thereafter.

### Fentanyl citrate (abstral) [^112L1Ea2]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

2.3 Maintenance Therapy

Once an appropriate dose for pain management has been established, instruct patients to use only one ABSTRAL tablet of the appropriate strength per dose. Maintain patients on this dose.

If adequate analgesia is not obtained after use of ABSTRAL, the patient may use a second ABSTRAL dose (after 30 minutes) as directed by their health care provider. No more than two doses of ABSTRAL may be used to treat an episode of breakthrough pain.

Patients must wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough pain with ABSTRAL.

2.4 Dose Re-adjustment

If the response (analgesia or adverse reactions) to the titrated ABSTRAL dose markedly changes, an adjustment of dose may be necessary to ensure that an appropriate dose is maintained.

If more than four episodes of breakthrough pain are experienced per day, re-evaluate the dose of the longacting opioid used for persistent underlying cancer pain. If the long-acting opioid or dose of long-acting opioid is changed, re-evaluate and re-titrate the ABSTRAL dose as necessary to ensure the patient is on an appropriate dose.

Limit the use of ABSTRAL to treat four or fewer episodes of breakthrough pain per day.

It is imperative that any dose re-titration is monitored carefully by a healthcare professional.

2.5 Administration of ABSTRAL

Place ABSTRAL tablets on the floor of the mouth directly under the tongue immediately after removal from the blister unit. Do not chew, suck, or swallow ABSTRAL tablets. Allow ABSTRAL tablets to completely dissolve in the sublingual cavity. Advise patients not to eat or drink anything until the tablet is completely dissolved.

In patients who have a dry mouth, water may be used to moisten the buccal mucosa before taking ABSTRAL.

2.6 Discontinuation of Therapy

For patients no longer requiring opioid therapy, consider discontinuing ABSTRAL along with a gradual downward titration of other opioids to minimize possible withdrawal effects.

In patients who continue to take their chronic opioid therapy for persistent pain but no longer require treatment for breakthrough pain, ABSTRAL therapy can usually be discontinued immediately.

### Dosing considerations with transdermal formulations of fentanyl and buprenorphine for the treatment of cancer pain [^115y7LJc]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Opioids continue to be first-line pharmacotherapy for patients suffering from cancer pain. Unfortunately, subtherapeutic dosage prescribing of pain medications remains common, and many cancer patients continue to suffer and experience diminished quality of life. A large variety of therapeutic options are available for cancer pain patients. Analgesic pharmacotherapy is based on the patient's self-report of pain intensity and should be tailored to meet the requirements of each individual. Most, if not all, cancer pain patients will ultimately require modifications in their opioid pharmacotherapy. When changes in a patient's medication regimen are needed, adequate pain control is best maintained through appropriate dosage conversion, scheduling immediate release medication for withdrawal prevention, and providing as needed dosing for breakthrough pain. Transdermal opioids are noninvasive, cause less constipation and sedation when compared to oral opioids, and may improve patient compliance. A relative potency of 100:1 is recommended when converting the patient from oral morphine to transdermal fentanyl. Based on the limited data available, there is significant interpatient variability with transdermal buprenorphine and equipotency recommendations from oral morphine of 75:1–110:1 have been suggested. Cancer patients may require larger transdermal buprenorphine doses to control their pain and may respond better to a more aggressive 75–100:1 potency ratio. This review outlines the prescribing of transdermal fentanyl and transdermal buprenorphine including how to safely and effectively convert to and use them for those with cancer pain.

### Symptom management in patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116C5dAT]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer severe chronic cancer pain — opioid titration and breakthrough pain: In lung cancer patients with severe chronic cancer pain treated with systemic strong opioids, dose titration using either immediate release or sustained release oral morphine is suggested (Grade 2B). The recommended starting dose is oral morphine 30 mg/24 h in patients not previously treated with opioids, and 60 mg/24 h in those already taking an opioid at step 2 of the WHO ladder; where immediate release oral morphine is used, the four-hourly dose is used to treat episodes of uncontrolled pain and in this context may be used up to hourly, and where sustained release morphine is used, the total estimated daily dose is prescribed as once-daily or twice-daily oral morphine. In lung cancer patients with severe chronic cancer pain treated with systemic strong opioids who experience breakthrough pain, parenteral morphine or transmucosal fentanyl citrate are recommended (Grade 1B); oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, fentanyl buccal tablet and transnasal fentanyl spray are all effective formulations for breakthrough pain, and in patients with severe chronic cancer pain who experience a lack of effective analgesia, or uncontrollable side effects, or both, it is appropriate to switch to an alternative strong opioid, or route of administration, or both, though evidence of benefit from this approach is lacking.

### Fentanyl buccal tablet vs. oral morphine in doses proportional to the basal opioid regimen for the management of breakthrough cancer pain: a randomized, crossover, comparison study [^1154fCmz]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Fentanyl products have shown superiority to oral opioids for the management of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP). However, these studies did not use appropriate patient selection, and drugs have been compared by using different rationales.

Objectives

The aim of this randomized, crossover, controlled study was to compare efficacy and safety of fentanyl buccal tablets (FBTs) and oral morphine (OM), given in doses proportional to opioid daily doses.

Methods

Cancer patients with pain receiving ≥ 60 mg or more of oral morphine equivalents per day and presenting with ≤ 3 episodes of BTcP per day were included. In a randomized, crossover manner, patients received FBT or OM at doses proportional to the daily opioid regimen in four consecutive episodes of BTcP. Pain intensity was measured before (T0) and 15 (T15) and 30 minutes (T30), after study drugs.

Results

In total, 263 episodes of BTcP were treated. A statistical difference in changes in pain intensity-decrease of ≥ 33% and ≥ 50%-between the two groups was observed at T15 and T30 (P < 0.0005). No severe adverse effects after study drug administration were observed.

Conclusion

When used in doses proportional to the basal opioid regimen, FBT showed a clear superiority and was well tolerated when compared with OM during the first 30 minutes, which is the approximate target for a timely intervention required for a BTcP medication.

### Opioids for the management of breakthrough (episodic) pain in cancer patients [^116SeWyB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Breakthrough pain is a transient increase in pain intensity over background pain. It is a common and distinct component of cancer pain that can have a negative impact for both the patient and carers' quality of life. Breakthrough pain is usually related to background pain and is typically of rapid onset, severe in intensity, and generally self-limiting with an average duration of 30 minutes. At present the current approach to managing breakthrough pain is using supplemental analgesia (also known as rescue medication) at a dose proportional to the total around-the-clock (ATC) opioid dose.

Objectives

This review explores and assesses the evidence for the use of opioids in the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CancerLit (1993 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005) and Cochrane databases were searched. Handsearching of medical journals and reference from key textbooks was undertaken and drug companies contacted for unpublished data. There was no language restriction. Date of most recent search: January 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of opioids used as rescue medication against active or placebo comparator in patients with cancer pain were included. Outcome measures sought were reduction in pain intensity measured by an appropriate scale, adverse effects, attrition, patient satisfaction and quality of life. There were no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligible studies were selected and examined independently by the two reviewers. Full text was retrieved if any uncertainty about eligibility remained. Non-English texts were screened. Quality assessment and data extraction were conducted using standardised data forms. Drug and placebo dose, titration, route and formulation were compared and detail of all outcome measures (if available) recorded.

Main Results

Four studies (393 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all were concerned with the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) in the management of breakthrough pain. Two studies examined the titration of OTFC, one study compared OTFC to normal release morphine and one study compared OTFC to placebo.OTFC was shown to be an effective treatment for breakthrough pain. When compared to placebo and morphine, participants gave lower pain intensity scores and higher pain relief scores for OTFC at all time points. Global assessment scores also favoured OTFC.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that OTFC is an effective treatment in the management of breakthrough pain. The randomised trial literature for the management of breakthrough pain is small and no trials were found for other opioids. Given the importance of this subject, more trials need to be undertaken.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^112Y6kuA]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

From the practical point of view, in our daily activity, most patients have been reluctant to try the dose, either on in-patient or outpatient basis, and avoid using the OTFC, preferring, at the end, traditional oral dosing of morphine. The aim of this randomised, crossover, controlled study was to verify the safety and effectiveness of a fixed dose of OTFC, proportional to the daily dose, compared to the standard treatment available in the unit, which is IV-MO, used in a similar way for the management of breakthrough pain.

### Intrathecal morphine reduces breakthrough pain during labour epidural analgesia [^117HmKey]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

When using the combined spinal-epidural (CSE) technique for labour analgesia, parturients often experience breakthrough pain after the spinal medication has receded. We tested the hypothesis that a small dose of intrathecal morphine would reduce breakthrough pain.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to receive either 100 microg of morphine (MS) or placebo (PLCB) with the spinal injection of bupivacaine and fentanyl. Assessments included need for supplementation during labour analgesia, use of pain medications for 24 h after delivery, and side-effects. The primary end-point was the rate of breakthrough pain.

Results

Sixty subjects were enrolled, 55 subjects completed the trial. The MS group had a significantly lower rate of breakthrough pain than the PLCB group [0.6 (0.6) vs 1.1 (0.8) episodes per patient; P < 0.01], and longer time to first episode of breakthrough pain (300 vs 180 min; P = 0.03). The MS group used 75% less opioid medications during the subsequent 24 h, but had a 17% incidence of nausea.

Conclusions

The addition of small dose of morphine to the spinal component of the CSE technique improved the effectiveness of epidural labour analgesia and reduced the need for pain medications over 24 h, but resulted in a small increase in nausea.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^112G8TrW]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Adapting treatment to the individual child ("with the child")

Analgesic treatment should be individualized according to the child's pain and his/her response to treatment. Treatment effectiveness should be frequently assessed and reassessed, and modified as required. Some children may require extremely high doses of opioids to control severe cancer pain. As mentioned previously, adjuvant drugs may be appropriate in the pain management of an individual child, as part of a multimodal approach.

At analgesic dosing, sedation is not expected. It is a commonly believed myth that patients, parents, or clinicians must choose between a child being either in pain or being oversedated. Oversedation with multimodal analgesia can be avoided, including in cases where opioid rotation at equianalgesic doses is necessary due to opioid-induced side effects. The effective analgesic opioid dose is what relieves pain, and different children may respond differently to the same dose. The effective dose must be adjusted to the child's needs, which involves assessing the child's response frequently using validated pediatric pain scales and watching closely for opioid-induced side effects and toxicity.

### The use of instanyl® in the treatment of breakthrough pain in cancer patients: a 3-month observational, prospective, cohort study [^112B35UV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Descriptive analyses were provided for all collected data. For the primary outcome variables, the proportion of patients with successful titration was calculated (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) using the number of patients with a baseline visit as the denominator; the proportions of patients titrated to the different dose levels (50, 100, and 200 μg) were calculated using the number of patients with successful titration as the denominator. The primary outcome variable was examined across levels of baseline characteristics – age, gender, body mass index (BMI), type of cancer (including presence and site of metastases), BTP episodes by frequency, duration and localisation, current BTP medication, and current background pain medication — multivariate logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders of any associations.

For the secondary efficacy variables, the change in maintenance dose from Week 4 to Week 13 was analysed for patients reaching a maintenance dose. Since a patient's pain could change, the protocol allowed for a dose adjustment (increase or decrease) after the first maintenance dose was achieved at the end of titration. Therefore, the highest prescribed dose level and the usual dose per BTP episode were also recorded. The change in the level of background pain medication (expressed as morphine equivalents) was analysed from baseline to Week 4 and to Week 13, and from Week 4 to Week 13. BPI-SF and PTSS Total and domain scores (for UK and France) were summarised at baseline and Week 4; the change from baseline to Week 4 was analysed using a paired t -test or a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, where appropriate. Incidence rates of ADRs were summarised, as were the primary reasons for terminating Instanyl® treatment. Time to discontinuation of Instanyl® was calculated as the difference in days between baseline and the last known date of Instanyl® treatment, plus 1 day, and presented as a Kaplan–Meier plot (with 95% CI).

For descriptive statistics, no imputation of missing data occurred. Patients lacking data to show whether or not a successful titration had been achieved were considered not to have been successfully titrated. Questionnaire data were treated as missing and excluded from the analyses where patients had not completed total and domain scores for all four pain severity questions and a minimum of four interference questions on the BPI-SF, and if fewer than four of the six questions of the PTSS had been completed.

### Breakthrough cancer pain and rational drug use [^112FoXgx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 3
Temporal relationship between breakthrough pain episodes and oral morphine treatment. Adapted from with permission

Pain control with only an around-the-clock extended-release opioid medication will lead to a high level of opioid exposure and adverse neurological and gastrointestinal effects, and the profile of extended release opioid does not match that of BTcP (Fig. 4). While using a lower dose of an extended-release opioid together with an immediate-release opioid would result in lower overall exposure compared to a high dose of an extended-release opioid, BTcP is still not well controlled because the characteristics of BTcP do not match that of an immediate-release opioid (i.e. onset of action about 30 min, duration of about 4 h) (Fig. 4). Thus, control of background pain with a low dose of an extended opioid and managing BTcP with a ROO provides a good combination of overall pain control and lower opioid exposure (by matching the temporal characteristics of BTcP) (Fig. 4). Indeed, rapid onset and short duration of action allow good control of analgesia, while the pharmacokinetic properties of ROOs may permit reduction of the total opioid burden and associated adverse effects. Moreover, the efficacy of ROOs has been most effectively demonstrated by a meta-analysis that concluded that it is superior to oral morphine, which in turn is superior to placebo in control of BTcP.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112rUx6q]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Methadone titration — management of breakthrough pain: For breakthrough pain, a short-acting opioid preparation may be used until steady state is achieved (i.e., 5–7 days). As-needed methadone has also been used in a palliative care setting; however, it is generally discouraged to avoid drug accumulation. The use of breakthrough pain medications in patients with CNCP is noted as controversial, and if opioid medications for breakthrough pain are indicated following titration to a stable methadone dose in CNCP patients, they should be used sparingly.

Pharmacologic analgesia — opioid selection, patient-controlled analgesia, and tapering in trauma patients are individualized. "No "ideal" opioid exists". "Base selection on patient-specific factors such as organ dysfunction (e.g., avoiding morphine in patients with renal compromise) and desired duration of action (i.e., fentanyl for premedication in shorter procedures such as chest tubes, but morphine or hydromorphone for breakthrough pain)". "Some guidance on starting opioid doses is provided in Table 7", but dosing and tapering "vary by injury pattern, organ dysfunction, operative schedules, and several other clinical and demographic factors". "Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) provides fast pain relief leading to higher patient satisfaction and has safeguards in place to prevent additional doses from being administered in patients who are not oxygenating adequately", though "concern exists that patients may use higher amounts of opioids with PCA administration compared to conventional therapy", and "PCAs may be a useful adjunct in trauma patients who are unable to take enteral pain medications". For discontinuation, "Guide opioid tapering by the duration of opioid use (acute vs. chronic) as well as anticipated duration of pain", and "individualize each patient's taper plan".

Opioids

Use of Opioids for Management of Pain

Opioids are the mainstay of pharmacologic options in treating pain in patients with pancreatic cancer. The vast majority of prescribed opioids are pure mu‐receptor agonists, which bind to mu‐receptors located in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This results in activation of descending inhibitory pathways along with inhibition of afferent pain transmission in the dorsal horn, thalamus, and inflamed peripheral tissues [39]. Some opioids exhibit additional mechanisms for analgesia, such as N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism (methadone and levorphanol) and/or monoamine reuptake inhibition (tramadol, tapentadol, methadone, and levorphanol) [40, 41]. Currently, the role for buprenorphine, a partial mu‐receptor agonist, in managing cancer pain is not well established because of concerns for analgesic ceiling effects [42, 43]. Other mixed agonist/antagonists, such as nalbuphine and pentazocine, are not useful because of activation of kappa‐receptors associated with undesired dysesthesia [44, 45, 46].

The goal of opioid therapy should be to optimize analgesia and functioning while simultaneously minimizing risks associated with opioid use. This is best achieved by appropriate opioid selection, dosing, and titration, prompt management of common side effects, and consideration of the potential risk for misuse and addiction. Opioid‐naïve patients with moderate to severe pain may be started on immediate release (IR) weaker opioids such as tramadol or low doses of stronger opioids such as hydrocodone (available only with acetaminophen), morphine, oxycodone (available with and without acetaminophen), oxymorphone, and hydromorphone. These may initially be prescribed on an as‐needed basis to allow for understanding of an individual's medication requirement [47]. Patients requiring several daily doses of IR opioids would benefit from extended release (ER) opioid, providing prolonged and more consistent plasma concentration of drug, thus minimizing fluctuations. IR opioid should be made available for management of breakthrough pain, on an as‐needed basis every 3 to 4 hours, at approximately 10%–20% of the basal daily dose of the scheduled ER opioid [48]. Because of the dynamic nature of cancer‐associated pain and the substantial variation in individual responsiveness to opioids, there may be a need for ongoing adjustments with close monitoring of outcomes (analgesia, adverse effects, activity, and affect) to achieve an individualized tolerated and effective analgesic response.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^111U3EBs]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

For each episode, when it occurred (T0), 15 min after (T1), and 30 min after (T2) the study of drug administration, patients were asked about the following parameters, which were recorded: pain intensity, using a numerical scale from 0 to 10, and opioid-related symptoms, using a scale from 0 to 3 (absent, slight, moderate, severe). These scales have been reported in several previous papers on same subject, are familiar to the staff, and represent the standard in the unit. Data were collected by nurses trained in symptom measurement as a part of their daily activity. They were also previously trained for data collection of breakthrough pain events. This tertiary unit offers a high level of nurse training and monitoring. In particular, for each episode, nurses were instructed to routinely collect changes in pain intensity (numerical scale 0–10) and emerging problems: when they are called for pain increases considered to be severe in intensity by patients (T0), 15 min after IV-MO injection (T1) and 30 after (T2).

Daily doses of oral morphine equivalents and basal pain intensity were also recorded. A decrease in pain intensity of at least > 33% at T1, not requiring further treatment for the next 2 h, was considered as an effective treatment of each episode. Patients were offered the common prescription used in the unit, that is IV-MO, but at half dose, if they were not satisfied with the treatments within T1.

Data analysis

A power analysis indicated that a sample size of 25 episodes per group would allow to detect a 20% difference (P < 0.05, power = 0.8). This computation assumes that the mean difference is 0.20 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.07–0.33 and the common within-group standard deviation of 0.28.

Frequency analysis was performed with χ² test. The univariate and multivariate repeated measures analysis (analysis of variance (ANOVA)) was used to compare the scores or the means of non-parametric and parametric variables, respectively, at different time intervals. The one-way ANOVA and Mann–Whitney U statistic test were used to compare the different parametric or non-parametric variables. All P -values were two-sided and P -values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Advances in opioid therapy and formulations [^1131krYo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Newly developed opioid analgesics and drug delivery systems may provide pain relief for patients intolerant of morphine. Long-acting oral opioids supply satisfactory analgesia at more convenient dosing intervals. Implantable pumps can provide full analgesic doses of opioids both subcutaneously and intrathecally over extended time periods. Optimal opioid use should rely on individualized dose-finding approaches to enhance pain relief while limiting drug-related side effects and avoiding the common problems associated with opioid prescription in clinical practice.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^115qbB23]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Breakthrough pain in children with cancer is an exacerbation of severe pain that occurs over a background of otherwise controlled pain. There are no randomized controlled trials in the management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer, and limited data and considerable experience indicate that breakthrough pain in this pediatric patient group is common, underassessed, and undertreated. An ideal therapeutic agent would be rapid in onset, have a relatively short duration, and would be easy to administer. A less effective pharmacologic strategy would be increasing a patient's dose of scheduled opioids, because this may increase the risk of oversedation. The most common and effective strategy seems to be multimodal analgesia that includes an immediate-release opioid (eg, morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, or diamorphine) administered intravenously by a patient-controlled analgesia pump, ensuring an onset of analgesic action within minutes. Intranasal fentanyl (or hydromorphone) may be an alternative, but no pediatric data have been published yet for commercially available fentanyl transmucosal application systems (ie, sublingual tablets/spray, buccal lozenge/tablet/film, and nasal spray), and these products cannot yet be recommended for use with children with cancer and breakthrough pain. The aim of this paper was to emphasize the dearth of available information on treatment of breakthrough pain in pediatric cancer patients, to describe the treatment protocols we currently recommend based on clinical experience, and to suggest future research on this very important and under-researched topic.

### Fentanyl (Lazanda) [^111N5u27]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Titration

The objective of dose titration is to identify an effective and tolerable maintenance dose for ongoing management of breakthrough cancer pain episodes. The effective and tolerable dose of LAZANDA will be determined by dose titration in individual patients.

Titration steps: If adequate analgesia is not achieved with the first 100 mcg dose, dose escalate in a step-wise manner over consecutive episodes of breakthrough pain until adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects is achieved.

Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.

The titration steps should be:

Patients should confirm the dose of LAZANDA that works for them with a second episode of breakthrough pain and review their experience with their physicians to determine if that dose is appropriate, or whether a further adjustment is warranted.

The safety and efficacy of doses higher than 800 mcg have not been evaluated in clinical studies. Avoid the use of a combination of dose strengths to treat an episode as this may cause confusion and dosing errors.

In order to minimize the risk of LAZANDA-related adverse reactions and to identify the appropriate dose, it is imperative that patients be supervised closely by health professionals during the titration process.

Maintenance Therapy

Once an appropriate dose has been established, instruct patients to use that dose for each subsequent breakthrough cancer pain episode. Limit LAZANDA use to four or fewer doses per day.

Patients MUST wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain with LAZANDA.

During any episode of breakthrough cancer pain, if there is inadequate pain relief after 30 minutes following LAZANDA dosing or if a separate episode of breakthrough cancer pain occurs before the next dose of LAZANDA is permitted (i.e., within 2 hours), the patients may use a rescue medication as directed by their healthcare provider.

2.5 Dose Re-Adjustment

If the response (analgesia or adverse reactions) to the titrated LAZANDA dose markedly changes, an adjustment of dose may be necessary to ensure that an appropriate dose is maintained.

If more than four episodes of breakthrough pain are experienced per day, re-evaluate the dose of the long-acting opioid used for persistent underlying cancer pain. If the long-acting opioid or dose of long-acting opioid is changed, re-evaluate and re-titrate the LAZANDA dose as necessary to ensure the patient is on an appropriate dose.

Limit the use of LAZANDA to treat four or fewer episodes of breakthrough pain per day.

It is imperative that any dose re-titration is monitored carefully by a healthcare professional.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^114EdgWD]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

The use of supplemental doses of opioids is commonly suggested to manage breakthrough pain. A comparative study of intravenous morphine (IV-MO) and oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) given in doses proportional to the basal opioid regimen was performed in 25 cancer patients receiving stable opioid doses. For each episode, when it occurred and 15 and 30 min after the treatment, pain intensity and opioid-related symptoms were recorded. Fifty-three couples of breakthrough events, each treated with IV-MO and OTFC, were recorded. In episodes treated with IV-MO, pain intensity decreased from a mean of 6.9 to 3.3 and to 1.7 at T1 and T2, respectively. In episodes treated with OTFC, pain intensity decreased from a mean of 6.9 to 4.1 and to 2.4 at T1 and T2, respectively. Statistical differences between the two treatments were found at T1 (P = 0.013), but not at T2 (P = 0.059). Adverse effects were comparable and were not significantly related with the IV-MO and OTFC doses. Intravenous morphine and OTFC in doses proportional to the scheduled daily dose of opioids were both safe and effective, IV-MO having a shorter onset than OTFC. Future comparative studies with appropriate design should compare titration methods and proportional methods of OTFC dosing.

### Alternative treatments of breakthrough pain in patients receiving spinal analgesics for cancer pain [^113h6Jnk]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Patients who experience a poor response to different systemic opioid trials (oral and intravenous) are candidates for spinal treatment. Breakthrough pain occurring in this group of patients is challenging for physicians. This phenomenon has never been described in this context and the treatment is quite difficult, as patients already demonstrated a poor response to systemic opioids. We report a preliminary experience of alternative methods, including the intrathecal injection of local anesthetic boluses as needed, or alternatively, the use of sublingual ketamine. Twelve consecutive patients with advanced cancer and pain were selected for intrathecal treatment after receiving different trials with systemic opioids. During intrathecal therapy, pain flares not responding to high doses of intravenous morphine were treated with intrathecal boluses of local anesthetics titrated to achieve the best balance between analgesia and adverse effects, or with sublingual ketamine (25 mg), according to their preference. Pain and symptoms were recorded for each episode of breakthrough pain during hospital admission. Effective pain control was achieved in all the episodes treated within 10 minutes with either method, without relevant complications. A mean volume of 0.6 mL of levobupivacaine (LB) 0.25% (1.5 mg) was effective within a few minutes and was well tolerated in patients receiving a continuous intrathecal infusion of a combination of morphine and LB in different doses. Similarly, ketamine in doses of 25 mg sublingually was effective and relatively well tolerated. Despite the difficult clinical situation of these patients, these approaches controlled almost all breakthrough pain events previously unresponsive to relatively high doses of intravenous opioids. These intensive treatments should be reserved for a very selected population and initiated in an appropriate setting with frequent monitoring facilities and skilled nursing.

### Buprenorphine (Butrans) [^1123cKgR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3 Initial Dosage

Use of BUTRANS as the First Opioid Analgesic (opioid-naive patients)

Initiate treatment with BUTRANS with a 5 mcg/hour patch.

Conversion from Other Opioids to BUTRANS When BUTRANS therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

There is a potential for buprenorphine to precipitate withdrawal in patients who are already on opioids.

Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Less than 30 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day: Initiate treatment with BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, middle column).

Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Between 30 mg to 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day:

Taper the patient's current around-the-clock opioids for up to 7 days to no more than 30 mg of morphine or equivalent per day before beginning treatment with BUTRANS. Then initiate treatment with BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, right column). Patients may use short-acting analgesics as needed until analgesic efficacy with BUTRANS is attained.

Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Greater than 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day: BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour may not provide adequate analgesia for patients requiring greater than 80 mg/day oral morphine equivalents. Consider the use of an alternate analgesic.

Table 1: Initial BUTRANS Dose

Conversion from Methadone to BUTRANS

Regular evaluation is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.

### The use of instanyl® in the treatment of breakthrough pain in cancer patients: a 3-month observational, prospective, cohort study [^111BRAxX]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Maintenance treatment

The median time from baseline to maintenance treatment was 29 days (95% CI: 29–31), possibly a reflection of the study design (i.e. investigators first determined the maintenance dose at Week 4). The most common first maintenance dose achieved was 50 μg, followed by 100 μg, then 200 μg; a similar pattern was observed for the highest prescribed dose level achieved (Table 3). The usual dose per BTP episode was 50 or 100 μg in the majority of patients (Table 3). Most patients (70%) received one dose per BTP episode (50 μg: 70%; 100 μg: 73%; 200 μg: 64%). The majority showed no change in maintenance dose from Week 4 to Week 13 (Table 4).

No relationship between the successfully titrated dose of Instanyl® and level of background medication was found.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^116A3hEY]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Dosing at regular intervals ("by the clock")

Regular scheduling ensures a steady blood level, reducing the peaks and troughs of "as needed" (pro re nata [PRN]) dosing. Dosing that is "PRN only" (without scheduled analgesia) may take several hours and require higher opioid doses to relieve pain; it may result in cycles of undermedication and associated pain, alternating with periods of overmedication and possible drug toxicity. Commonly used opioid regimens include immediate-release oral morphine every 4 hours, or controlled-release morphine twice daily, plus a PRN dose of 10% of the 24-hour morphine requirement as an hourly fast-release breakthrough pain medication (the same holds true for both medications). Most pediatric medical institutions in developed countries administer opioids to children with cancer using a continuous infusion of one opioid (typically morphine, fentanyl, or hydromorphone; or in the UK, diamorphine) plus a PCA bolus (see Table 2). If a child is too young or unable to push the PCA button, many institutions, including ours, will implement a nurse-controlled analgesia (NCA) bolus policy. In our previous breakthrough cancer pain study, none of the children had uncontrolled background pain after 48 hours of scheduled opioids.

### Breakthrough pain and its treatment: critical review and recommendations of IOPS (Italian oncologic pain survey) expert group [^115Wgo24]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Controversies exist about the definition and epidemiology of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP), the pharmacological treatment options, drug dosing, and how to select the medications for BTcP among the new fentanyl products. Existing data were critically evaluated to provide recommendations by an expert group. An algorithm to diagnose BTcP should be used followed by a careful assessment. Fentanyl products provide efficacy and rapidity of action to counteract the temporal pattern of BTcP. The doses of opioids used for background pain should guide the choice of the doses of fentanyl products. The choice of fentanyl products should be based on individual clinical conditions.

### Fentanyl (abstral) [^1124HBgp]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of ABSTRAL was investigated in a clinical trial in opioid tolerant adult patients experiencing breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough cancer pain was defined as a transient flare of moderate-to-severe pain occurring in patients with cancer experiencing persistent cancer pain otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications including at least 60 mg morphine/day, 50 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for 1 week or longer. All patients were on stable doses of either long-acting oral opioids or transdermal fentanyl for their persistent cancer pain.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed in patients with cancer to evaluate the effectiveness of ABSTRAL for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Open-label titration identified a dose of ABSTRAL in which a patient obtained adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects, within the range of 100 mcg to 800 mcg. In the double-blind efficacy study, patients who identified a successful dose were randomized to a sequence of 10 treatments; seven with ABSTRAL and three with placebo.

Of the 131 patients who entered the titration phase of the study, 78 (60%) achieved a successful dose during the titration phase. Sixty-six patients entered the double-blind phase and 60 completed the study. The dose of ABSTRAL was determined by titration starting at 100 mcg. The final titrated dose of ABSTRAL for breakthrough cancer pain was not predicted from the daily maintenance dose of opioid used to manage the persistent cancer pain. In a second open-label safety study using an identical titration regimen, 96 of 139 patients (69%) who entered the study titrated to a dose in which the patient obtained adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects during the titration phase. Table 4 presents the final titrated dose for both the double-blind efficacy and open-label safety studies.

The primary outcome measure, the mean sum of pain intensity difference at 30 minutes (SPID30) for ABSTRAL-treated episodes was statistically significantly higher than for placebo-treated episodes.

Regarding medical management for cancer pain, more specifically with respect to opioids, initiation, WHO 2018 guidelines recommend to offer regularly-dosed immediate-release oral morphine or regularly-dosed slow-release morphine to maintain effective and safe pain relief whenever oral dosing is possible.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^112M9ziQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — breakthrough cancer pain (Recommendation 6.2) states that evidence remains insufficient to recommend a specific, short-acting opioid for breakthrough pain. A 2015 systematic review of oral or nasal fentanyl included 11 RCTs with a total of 1,121 patients and found fentanyl effective compared with placebo but with limited evidence relative to other opioids; subsequent trials found fentanyl noninferior to morphine at 30 minutes in 114 patients and favored fentanyl for pain reduction at 30 minutes in 68 patients. For many patients, clinical interpretation advises regular immediate- or extended-release opioid plus an immediate-release opioid for breakthrough episodes at approximately 10% (ranging from 5% to 20%) of the daily MME dose.

### Morphine sulfate (MS contin) [^112Z8gt9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Conversion from Other Opioids to MS CONTIN

When MS CONTIN therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioids to MS CONTIN defined by clinical trials. Initiate dosing using MS CONTIN 15 mg orally every 8 to 12 hours.

It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral morphine dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour oral morphine dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to an overdose. While useful tables of opioid equivalents are readily available, there is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Close observation and frequent titration are warranted until pain management is stable on the new opioid. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and for signs of oversedation/toxicity after converting patients to MS CONTIN.

Conversion from Parenteral Morphine or Other Opioids (Parenteral or Oral) to MS CONTIN

When converting from parenteral morphine or other non-morphine opioids (parenteral or oral) to MS CONTIN, consider the following general points:

Parenteral to oral morphine ratio: Between 2 to 6 mg of oral morphine may be required to provide analgesia equivalent to 1 mg of parenteral morphine. Typically, a dose of morphine that is approximately three times the previous daily parenteral morphine requirement is sufficient.

Other parenteral or oral non-morphine opioids to oral morphine ratios: Specific recommendations are not available because of a lack of systematic evidence for these types of analgesic substitutions. Published relative potency data are available, but such ratios are approximations. In general, begin with half of the estimated daily morphine requirement as the initial dose, managing inadequate analgesia by supplementation with immediate-release morphine.

Conversion from Methadone to MS CONTIN

Regular evaluation is of particular importance when converting methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.

### A randomized, double-blind, multi-site, crossover, placebo-controlled equivalence study of morning versus evening once-daily sustained-release morphine sulfate in people with pain from advanced cancer [^116NXfwA]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

Diurnal variation in pain perception is recognized. The question of whether opioid prescribing should be adjusted to account for diurnal variation can be tested with the advent of once-daily sustained-release morphine. The study recruited 45 people with opioid-responsive pain on stable doses of analgesics and advanced cancer from five regional palliative care programs in Australia. Each participant took one placebo and a 24-hourly dose of sustained-release morphine daily, 12 hours apart-active dose in the morning for one week and in the evening for the other week. The order of the weeks was randomized in a double-blind manner. The primary outcome from the last two days (steady state) on both arms was averaged four-hourly pain scores while awake on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included VAS and categorical scales for other pain parameters, quality of sleep, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion, and somnolence. Twenty-six of 42 participants completed the study and provided adequate power for analysis. Mean VAS was 16 mm for morning dosing and 14 mm for evening dosing (P = 0.76, difference of adjusted means 2 mm, 95% confidence interval: -2, 6). No differences were found in pain control, pain during the day, pain disturbing sleep, or with breakthrough medication use. This study suggests that any difference between morning and evening dosing of once-daily sustained-release morphine in people with significant opioid-responsive pain and advanced cancer is small and unlikely to be clinically significant for most people.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^114sJTXn]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was not to compare effective titrated doses with doses proportional to the scheduled daily doses, but two fast methods for treating breakthrough pain were compared, using a similar approach that is providing opioids at a dose proportional to the basal regimen.

Some issues gathered by these previous studies should be pointed out. As 66% of the episodes treated with placebo did not require an additional dose of medication, the episodes recorded were possibly short-lived or not too much severe, and possibly spontaneously resolved. This can also explain why minimal doses of oral morphine equivalents (about 20 mg) were effective in patients taking a mean basal dose of 100 μ g per hour of fentanyl (about 240 mg daily of oral morphine doses equivalents). Eligible patients were defined as having their basal pain no more than moderate, and presenting no more than four episodes per day. On the other hand, some patients could not be universally considered (mean intensity of 4.7–4.8 of basal pain, with some patients at the highest extremes) as having well-controlled pain, especially if matched with a pain intensity of breakthrough events of 6.8 on average (with some patients at the lowest extremes). No distinction was made between incident pain, dependent on activity, and other mechanisms, which can have a different temporal pattern. Finally, almost no adverse effects were reported with usual breakthrough medication in comparison with OTFC, which doses were titrated in patients apparently responsive to their usual medication, suggesting that probably most patients were undertreated either with basal or 'as needed' medication.

### Guidelines for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer [^112UwZk3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

The moral imperative to adequately manage pain is being increasingly recognized worldwide. A comprehensive pain management approach that addresses the various presentations of pain in patients with cancer is required, including appropriate management of breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain commonly occurs in patients with advanced cancer and is disabling to the individual and burdensome to society, yet it is often inadequately managed. Because pain is heterogeneous, the best management of an individual's pain, including breakthrough pain in cancer, requires a thorough assessment to tailor the treatment strategies. Recently developed guidelines support this approach and recommend treating breakthrough pain using rapid- or short-acting opioids with pharmacodynamics that mirror the rapid onset and short duration of the presenting pain. This approach should be part of a comprehensive strategy to treat pain within the context of the primary disease trajectory, offering continuity of care and access to specialized palliative care when appropriate.

### Impact of opioid rescue medication for breakthrough pain on the efficacy and tolerability of long-acting opioids in patients with chronic non-malignant pain [^112qsJXG]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

The primary treatment for breakthrough pain in malignant pain is with immediate-release (IR), short-acting opioids on a pre-emptive or as-needed basis, in addition to the usual opioid regimen. This strategy has been adopted for chronic non-malignant pain. However, there is little evidence that using short-acting opioids as rescue medication is an optimal long-term treatment strategy in chronic non-malignant pain.

Evidence is needed for the routine long-term use of short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain in patients with chronic non-malignant pain, particularly as there is a school of thought that exposure to short-acting opioids might increase the risk of abuse, opioid tolerance and the need for dose escalation, or inadequate use of opioids. These are important unknown factors in our understanding of opioid usage in pain relief. In addition, many short-acting opioids are ineffective for certain types of breakthrough pain, as their onset of action is outside the window of maximum pain intensity of the breakthrough pain episode. Rapid onset formulations (e.g. oral transmucosal fentanyl) have been developed to address this. We are not aware of any randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy and tolerability of long-acting opioid treatment in chronic non-malignant pain patients who have access to IR opioids for breakthrough pain and those who do not. We have systematically reviewed the literature to approach this question. We compared the analgesic efficacy and incidence of common opioid side-effects between studies of long-acting opioids in chronic non-malignant pain that did and did not allow the use of IR opioid rescue medication using meta-regression analyses.

### Buprenorphine hydrochloride (Belbuca) [^111kVQKb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Use of BELBUCA as the Initial Opioid Analgesic (opioid-naïve patients) or in Patients who are not Opioid Tolerant (opioid-non-tolerant patients)

Initiate treatment in opioid-naïve and opioid-non-tolerant patients with a 75 mcg film once daily or, if tolerated, every 12 hours (see Table 1) for at least 4 days, then increase dose to 150 mcg every 12 hours. Individual titration to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions should proceed in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours, no more frequently than every 4 days. Doses up to 450 mcg every 12 hours were studied in opioid-naïve patients in the clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Conversion from Other Opioids to BELBUCA

When BELBUCA therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

There is a potential for buprenorphine to precipitate withdrawal in patients who are already on opioids. To reduce the risk of opioid withdrawal, taper patients to no more than 30 mg oral morphine sulfate equivalents (MSE) daily before beginning BELBUCA. Following analgesic taper, base the starting dose on the patient's daily opioid dose prior to taper, as described in Table 1. Patients may require additional short-acting analgesics during the taper period and during titration.

BELBUCA may not provide adequate analgesia for patients requiring greater than 160 mg oral MSE per day. Consider the use of an alternate analgesic.

There is inter-patient variability in the relative potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of BELBUCA. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour oral buprenorphine dosage and provide rescue medication (e.g., immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour buprenorphine dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.

In a BELBUCA clinical trial with an open-label titration period, patients were converted from their prior opioid to BELBUCA using Table 1 as a guide for the initial BELBUCA dose.

BELBUCA doses of 600 mcg, 750 mcg, and 900 mcg are only for use following titration from lower doses of BELBUCA. Individual titration should proceed in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hours, no more frequently than every 4 days.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^115qqRMz]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Using the appropriate route of administration ("by the appropriate route")

The least invasive route of administration, often chosen by the child, should be used, thus making intramuscular administration obsolete. The oral route (or via nasogastric/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube if applicable) is convenient, noninvasive, and usually preferred by children and their care providers. The IV administration of opioids may be feasible, especially when there is central access. PCA/NCA combined with a continuous background analgesic approach often provides excellent pain management. Alternatively, opioid analgesics can be administered subcutaneously in IV-equivalent doses. Transdermal fentanyl patches are not usually indicated for acute pain management, due to their long onset time (it may take over 60 hours to reach peak concentrations in children), inability to rapidly titrate drug delivery, and long elimination half-life (up to 24 hours). In pediatric cancer pain, patches can be applied on intact, healthy skin every 48–72 hours, but they cannot be used with opioid-naïve children (ie, 30–60 mg oral morphine per 24 hours) for safe rotation to a fentanyl patch. The smallest patch delivers 12 μg/hour. A sufficient immediate-release breakthrough (rescue) opioid should also be provided. Transdermal fentanyl has a role in longer-lasting, stable acute pediatric pain. Transmucosal routes (ie, sublingual, buccal, intranasal) offer other options for route of administration, and these are discussed in greater detail.

### Impact of opioid rescue medication for breakthrough pain on the efficacy and tolerability of long-acting opioids in patients with chronic non-malignant pain [^116EwocK]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

There is evidence to support the use of opioids for carefully selected patients with chronic non-malignant pain. An important and controversial issue concerning the management of chronic pain is assessment and treatment of breakthrough pain. Although there is currently no unanimous definition of breakthrough pain in chronic malignant or non-malignant pain, a consensus panel recommendation from 2005 suggested that breakthrough pain should be defined as 'an abrupt, short-lived, and intense pain that "breaks through" the around-the-clock (ATC) analgesia that controls persistent pain'. Subtypes of breakthrough pain include incident (often predictable and precipitated by activity or movement), idiopathic or spontaneous, and end-of-dose pain.

Breakthrough pain is best described in patients with malignant pain, leading to a number of adverse effects including a more severe pain syndrome. However, studies have shown that breakthrough pain is also prevalent among opioid-treated patients with chronic non-malignant pain conditions and impacts negatively on their quality of life. In a recent survey of chronic non-malignant pain, 74% of patients (most commonly, low back pain) with opioid-controlled baseline pain reported breakthrough pain, reaching maximum intensity within a median of 10 min and lasting for a median of 60 min. In these prevalence studies, the majority of cases of breakthrough pain were precipitated (incident pain), although end-of-dose pain was also reported. It was proposed recently that peripheral, central, or both sensitization may be a common component of breakthrough pain in both malignant and non-malignant diseases.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^116SfzaA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

HIVMA–IDSA chronic pain in persons on buprenorphine for opioid use disorder — recommendations are as follows: Clinicians should use adjuvant therapy appropriate to the pain syndrome for mild-to-moderate breakthrough pain (strong, moderate). Based on expert opinion, clinicians might switch from buprenorphine/naloxone to buprenorphine transdermal formulation alone (weak, very low). We recommend that if a maximal dose of buprenorphine is reached, an additional long-acting potent opioid such as fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone should be tried (strong, low). If usual doses of an additional opioid are ineffective for improving chronic pain, we recommend a closely monitored trial of higher doses of an additional opioid (strong, moderate); Buprenorphine's high binding affinity for the μ-opioid receptor may prevent the lower doses of other opioids from accessing the μ-opioid receptor. For patients on buprenorphine maintenance with inadequate analgesia despite the above-mentioned strategies, we recommend transitioning the patient from buprenorphine to methadone maintenance (strong, very low).

### Spinal analgesia in cancer pain management-MASCC general practice recommendations [^1138gMxD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with cancer pain refractory to conventional medical management may benefit from spinal analgesia, although there are some critical points regarding some aspects which cannot be examined by an evidence-based approach. A group of experts was selected by MASSC to provide clinical practice advice on the use of spinal drug delivery in patients with cancer-related pain. Refractory cancer pain should be considered a condition in which a patient has failed to receive adequate analgesia or has developed uncontrolled side effects after comprehensive pain management. The intrathecal route (IT) with an implantable drug delivery system allows the administration of minimal doses of analgesics with significant clinical effects while avoiding major adverse effects and lower risks with prolonged use. Morphine and hydromorphone are the opioids of choice for IT treatment. Local anesthetics are an added value because of their additive-synergic effect on segmental areas. The efficacy of adding small amounts of local anesthetics to an ITDD relies on the positioning of the tip of the catheter close to the dermatome where the origin of the pain comes from. Their use, however, depends on the delivery system, because larger volumes are necessary. Ziconotide requires a slow dose titration, but it can be used in small volumes. In addition, once doses are stabilized, no tolerance occurs. A conversion ratio of 100:1 between oral and IT morphine is suggested for patients who receive high doses of systemic opioids. A higher ratio (300:1) should be used in patients prevalently switched to the IT route for uncontrollable adverse effects, receiving lower doses of systemic opioids. The use of boluses of hydrophilic opioids, like morphine, for treating breakthrough pain may be inadequate, as intrathecal opioids alone may be unable to adequately treat an episode of rapid pain onset and duration. The decision-making process for employing interventional therapies, like spinal analgesia, should be shared, taking into account the actual indications and needs, previous treatments, prognosis, timing, advantages and disadvantages, and complications, in any individual situation, managing all the aspects of care.

### Summary version of the standards, options and recommendations for the use of analgesia for the treatment of nociceptive pain in adults with cancer (update 2002) [^116qd7RG]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Morphine

Except in specific situations, oral morphine is the first-line WHO level 3 opioid of choice (standard, expert agreement). Oral morphine should be given without delay to patients whose pain is uncontrolled by step 1 and 2 treatments (standard, expert agreement).

Morphine should be prescribed in an oral form, either as tablets or capsules of immediate-release morphine sulphate, as tablets or capsules of sustained-release morphine sulphate, or as morphine hydrochloride solution (standard, expert agreement).

In all patients treated previously with another strong opioid, the starting dose for morphine should be calculated using equianalgesic dose ratios (standard, expert agreement).

In patients receiving baseline treatment with opioids, an immediate-release formulation must be prescribed concurrently for the treatment of breakthrough or incident pain (standard, expert agreement).

It is advisable to be cautious by prescribing doses at the lower end of the equianalgesic dose range and providing rescue doses as needed, rather than immediately subjecting the patients to doses at the upper limit of the range (standard, expert agreement).

When oral administration is impossible, the preferred routes are transdermal (e.g. fentanyl), or continuous parenteral administration with patient-controlled analgesia (e.g. morphine) (option, expert agreement). The choice of dose should take into consideration equianalgesic dose ratios (recommendation, expert agreement).

The other routes of administration for morphine and the other opioids are rarely indicated. They should be used taking into consideration the benefit to risk ratio, the training of the personnel involved (including close family and friends), and the constraints of the follow-up, particularly for patients at home (recommendation, expert agreement).

Treatment with opioids (particularly oral morphine) should never be stopped abruptly (standard, expert agreement). No specific protocol for reducing the dose of opioids has been validated. Dose reduction should be in steps of 30–50% over about a week, depending on the clinical situation (reappearance of pain, development of withdrawal symptoms, etc.) (recommendation, expert agreement).

### Optimization of opioid therapy for preventing incident pain associated with bone metastases [^111Dx8R6]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Breakthrough pain is a transitory flare of pain superimposed on an otherwise stable pain pattern in patients treated with opioids. One form of breakthrough pain is incident pain, which is due to movement and is commonly associated with bone metastases. The development of this pain is rapid and no medication, administered "as needed", has such a rapid onset that it parallels this temporal pattern of pain. This study used a construct based on the prevention of this event, and implemented a new experimental paradigm. Specifically, the study determined whether increasing the opioid doses above those sufficient to control pain at rest would reduce the occurrence of these pains. Twenty-five consecutive patients with movement-related episodic pain associated with bone metastases, and no evident fractures, were selected for the study. They received a rapid intravenous titration of the opioid dose to obtain pain relief at rest. Then, opioid doses were increased to challenge the therapeutic window. The dose ceiling was determined by the development of limiting adverse effects, rather than optimal pain control at rest. Opioid dose increases were then stopped, or doses were even reduced, according to patients' satisfaction or development of adverse effects with moderate-severe intensity. Basal pain intensity and pain induced by movement were measured using a numerical scale from 0–10. Opioid-related symptoms were assessed using a scale from 0 to 3 (absent, slight, moderate, severe), and global daily doses of oral morphine and other symptomatic drugs were also recorded at daily intervals, and at time of discharge, when the best balance was presumed to be reached. Basal pain control was achieved after rapid intravenous titration. The day after, pain induced by movement significantly improved using mean doses of oral morphine equivalents of 102 mg. In the following days, the subsequent increase in opioid doses prescribed despite optimal basal pain control allowed an acceptable level of incident pain intensity until patients' discharge. A minority of patients developed adverse effects with an intensity of 2–3 on the scale, requiring symptomatic treatment or decreases in opioid doses. Data from this study suggest that the intensity of incident pain may be reduced by increasing the opioid dose above that effective for controlling pain at rest. This approach is based on experimental bone models showing a hypersensitivity to some innocuous stimuli, such as movement, requiring pre-emptive higher doses of basal opioid medication to reduce the increased pain input.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^114vQ6Fk]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

While diminishing the recruitment power, this method was more selective. Moreover a fixed time for response evaluation was taken into consideration, as this is an acceptable burden and timing for patients. Finally, patients who presented clear characteristics of incident pain due to movement were excluded. The analgesic treatment of this kind of pain is more difficult to assess, owing to the predictability of the event and variability in patients' behaviour, which can confound the outcome.

To evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment of a 50% cutoff point for the percentage of maximum pain relief is considered as a consistent clinical end point of pain half relieved, easily understood by professionals and patients. However, the minimal end point to efficacy has been found to be a decrease in pain intensity of at least > 33%, 15 min after the study medications. This level of change in pain intensity has been best associated with clinically important differences by patients. As expected, OTFC has been found to be more effective and rapid than oral morphine for treating breakthrough pain, producing a > 33% change in about 42% of patients within 15 min after administration (about 32%). In an open-label study, this level was achieved in about 15 min in more than 90% of events treated by IV-MO, despite selection criteria were more strict and included episodes with a high intensity (more of 7/10 on a numerical scale). This finding was confirmed in the present study, as IV-MO provided clinical differences in about 75% of treated episodes 15 min after injection. Of interest, OTFC, used in doses proportional to the basal regimen, was effective in about 57% of treated episodes, a percentage higher than that reported in previous studies.

### Fentanyl citrate (Lazanda) [^111jjKmW]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of Lazanda was evaluated in one clinical trial in opioid tolerant adult patients experiencing breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough cancer pain was defined as a transient flare of moderate-to-severe pain occurring in patients experiencing persistent cancer pain otherwise controlled with maintenance doses of opioid medications including at least 60 mg of oral morphine/day or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid (which could be fentanyl) for a week or longer. All patients were on stable doses of either long-acting oral opioids or transdermal fentanyl for their persistent cancer pain.

The clinical trial included an open-label titration phase where a dose was identified that provided adequate analgesia with tolerable side effects, within the range of 100 to 800 mcg. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the study, patients who were titrated to an adequate dose were randomized to a blinded sequence of 10 treatments with 7 being the identified dose of Lazanda and 3 being placebo.

Of the patients who enrolled in the study, 73% achieved an adequate dose during the titration phase, 6% withdrew for lack of effective pain relief, and 5% withdrew due to adverse events.

The distribution of final titrated doses is shown in Table 4. The final titrated dose of Lazanda for breakthrough pain was not predicted from the daily maintenance dose of opioid used to manage the persistent cancer pain and, therefore, the dose was determined by titration starting at 100 mcg.

The primary outcome measure, the mean sum of the pain intensity difference at 30 minutes (SPID30), was statistically significantly higher for Lazanda than for placebo (see Figure 2).

### A multicenter, primary-care-based, open-label study to assess the success of converting opioid-experienced patients with chronic moderate-to-severe pain to morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended-release capsules using a standardized conversion guide [^1177W8Ej]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Most investigators agreed with the starting dose as calculated by the MSN conversion guide; however, of those who did not agree, nearly all felt the calculated starting dose was too low. Interestingly, while in 72.9% of cases investigators agreed with the starting dose calculated by the MSN conversion guide, only 30.3% of patients received this starting dose. Actual starting dosages of MSN were predominantly greater, but a minority was also lower than those calculated by the MSN conversion guide. The starting dose of MSN in the conversion guide is suggested to be 50% of the calculated equianalgesic dose. The guide recommends a reduced initial dose and upward titration, supplying breakthrough medication to address incomplete analgesia to avoid overestimation requiring management of an AE. This dose adjustment is at the upper end of the suggested 25%–50% safety factor range identified as best practice for opioid rotation. In more than half of patients in this study, clinical judgment determined that a drop of 50% below the equianalgesic dose was not warranted. This variation of the MSN starting dose from the suggested dose merely serves to highlight the critical importance of individualized clinical assessment and physician knowledge of specific patient history and opioid formulation.

Any conversion guide must be an effective tool that prioritizes safe clinical management. The majority of investigators reported satisfaction with the MSN conversion guide, considered it a useful tool to identify an appropriate starting dose, found it easy to use, and provided clarity of instruction; almost all investigators reported they would use it again. One additional consideration to convert to MSN therapy is the possibly reduced abuse potential that is observed when the formulation is tampered,–an important property with the present epidemic of opioid abuse.–

Several limitations to this study must be acknowledged, including the lack of a comparator group. Because of the open-label design of this study, there is a potential bias of the investigators to over-report achievement of stable dose in their patients. Early study termination prevented the enrollment of the anticipated numbers of patients for each opioid, the small sample size thus limiting comparisons of study findings with respect to prior opioid treatments. Instruments to evaluate opioid withdrawal were not utilized in this study; however, two patients experienced AEs of withdrawal syndrome that occurred 1 day and 3 days after converting to MSN and were considered unrelated to study drug. Previous case reports have described opioid withdrawal symptoms in opioid-experienced patients who did not take MSN as directed, either by intentional or inadvertent crushing of the morphine sulfate pellets.

### Breakthrough cancer pain and rational drug use [^115q47Ak]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Recent data indicate that there are large disparities in the use of opioid analgesics to control breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) in Europe and worldwide. While it is clear that affordability is a key factor, it is certainly not the only one, and other factors, such as cultural differences and overall awareness, are undoubtedly responsible. More work remains to be done to overcome barriers in the use of these medications when warranted. When prescribing a medication for BTcP, it must be considered that its time profile is different from chronic persistent pain. The best control of background pain can best be achieved with a low dose of an extended opioid, and managing BTcP with a rapid-onset opioid, providing a good combination of overall pain control and lower opioid exposure. Notwithstanding their efficacy, greater attention needs to be paid to inappropriate use of opioids. It is important to evaluate patients for potential opioid misuse, including assessment of risk factors, and aberrant drug-taking behaviours must be investigated. In our institution, several measures have been adopted in this patient population in order to prevent aberrant opioid-induced behaviours. The adoption of some or all of these principles, depending on the individual patient and treatment setting, can undoubtedly help to reduce the risk of developing an aberrant behaviour related to opioid use as rescue medication for BTcP.

### Oxymorphone hydrochloride (Opana) [^116SZqho]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Selection of patients for treatment with OPANA should be governed by the same principles that apply to the use of similar opioid analgesics [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Physicians should individualize treatment in every case [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], using non-opioid analgesics, opioids on an as needed basis, combination products, and chronic opioid therapy in a progressive plan of pain management such as outlined by the World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the American Pain Society.

OPANA should be administered on an empty stomach, at least one hour prior to or two hours after eating [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.1 Individualization of Dosage

As with any opioid drug product, it is necessary to adjust the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's prior analgesic treatment experience. In the selection of the initial dose of OPANA, attention should be given to the following:

The total daily dose, potency and specific characteristics of the opioid the patient has been taking previously;
The relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent oxymorphone dose needed;
The patient's degree of opioid tolerance;
The age, general condition, and medical status of the patient;
Concurrent non-opioid analgesics and other medications;
The type and severity of the patient's pain;
The balance between pain control and adverse experiences;
Risk factors for abuse or addiction, including a prior history of abuse or addiction.

Once therapy is initiated, frequently assess pain relief and other opioid effects. Titrate dose to adequate pain relief (generally mild or no pain). Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment.

If signs of excessive opioid-related adverse experiences are observed, the next dose may be reduced. Adjust dosing to obtain an appropriate balance between pain relief and opioid-related adverse experiences. If significant adverse events occur before the therapeutic goal of mild or no pain is achieved, the events should be treated aggressively. Once adverse events are adequately managed, continue upward titration to an acceptable level of pain control.

During periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration, frequent contact is recommended between physician, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family. Advise patients and family members of the potential common adverse reactions associated with changing opioid doses.

The dosing recommendations below, therefore, can only be considered as suggested approaches to what is actually a series of clinical decisions over time in the management of the pain of each individual patient.

### Dosing considerations with transdermal formulations of fentanyl and buprenorphine for the treatment of cancer pain [^1145hepL]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

The first step in conversion is to calculate the patient's 24-hour PO morphine usage (mg/day) and then apply the appropriate conversion ratio to determine the TD-O dose. When converting to TD-O pharmacotherapy, the patient is at increased risk of suffering significant breakthrough pain and opioid withdrawal. In order to reduce the chances of opioid withdrawal, patients should be prescribed an instant release (IR) opioid given on a regular schedule every 3 or 4 hours and not as needed (PRN) until the TD-O reaches therapeutic levels. Additionally, supplemental doses of IR opioid PRN for breakthrough pain relief should be given during initiation of TD-O therapy (first 18 hours for TD-Fe and first 48 hours for TD-Bu) followed by every 2–3 hours PRN therafter. During dosage titration of TD-Os, the practitioner should note the daily amount of the IR breakthrough pain medication utilized during the first 48–72 hours after beginning TD-O pharmacotherapy, and consider increasing the TD-O dose if clinically necessary. Moreover, TD-Os are long acting and can take 5–6 days to reach steady state serum concentrations. Steady state concentrations occur during the second patch application of TD-Fe when dosed every 3 days and during the first application of TD-Bu when given every 7 days.TD-Bu for cancer pain is dosed on two fixed days of the week (ie, Tuesday and Saturday).

### Morphine sulfate (Kadian) [^115bZMcf]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

The first dose of KADIAN®may be taken with the last
dose of any immediate-release (short-acting) opioid medication due to the long
delay until the peak effect after administration of KADIAN®.

There has been no evaluation of KADIAN®as
an initial opioid analgesic in the management of pain. Because it may be more
difficult to titrate a patient to adequate analgesia using an extended-release
morphine, it is ordinarily advisable to begin treatment using an
immediate-release morphine formulation.

The best use of opioid analgesics in the management of chronic
malignant and non-malignant pain is challenging, and is well described in
materials published by the World Health Organization and the Agency for Health
Care Policy and. KADIAN®is a third step drug which is
most useful when the patient requires a constant level of opioid analgesia as a
"floor" or "platform" from which to manage breakthrough pain. When a patient
has reached the point where comfort cannot be provided with a combination of
non-opioid medications (NSAIDs and acetaminophen) and intermittent use of
moderate or strong opioids, the patient's total opioid therapy should be
converted into a 24 hour oral morphine equivalent.

KADIAN®should be started by administering one-half of
the estimated total daily oral morphine dose every 12 hours (twice-a-day) or by administering the total daily oral morphine dose every
24 hours (once-a-day). The dose should be titrated no more frequently than
every-other-day to allow the patients to stabilize before escalating the dose.
If breakthrough pain occurs, the dose may be supplemented with a small dose
(less than 20% of the total daily dose) of a short-acting analgesic. Patients
who are excessively sedated after a once-a-day dose or who regularly experience
inadequate analgesia before the next dose should be switched to twice-a-day
dosing.

### The use of instanyl® in the treatment of breakthrough pain in cancer patients: a 3-month observational, prospective, cohort study [^115BfBsn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cancer patients may experience persistent background pain, interspersed with transitory exacerbations of pain that 'breakthrough' the background medication, known as breakthrough pain (BTP). BTP was first defined in 1990 as 'a transitory exacerbation of pain that occurs on a background of otherwise stable pain in a patient receiving chronic opioid therapy'. Many definitions for BTP have since been proposed and are in use but, as yet, no single definition has been widely accepted. The characteristics of individual BTP episodes vary; there are reports of median times to reach peak intensity of 3 and 15 min, median durations of 30 and 60 min, and median frequencies of 3 and 6 times per day. BTCP episodes are usually severe.

BTP may impact on patients' quality of life since it is associated with impairments in daily physical functioning and psychological distress. BTP places a high economic burden on society and healthcare services, and may be a significant predictor of increased pain-related costs. Successful management of BTP is an important unmet need in the treatment of cancer patients.

Oral opioids (morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphine) are commonly used to treat BTP, but can take ~30 min to produce an analgesic effect, which then lasts for ~4 h. While this may be suitable for treating some pain conditions, the majority of BTP episodes require a treatment with a fast onset of action and short duration of effect. To improve the treatment of BTP, a range of fast-acting fentanyl formulations have been developed and are approved in this indication. These agents allow rapid absorption and quick onset of effect, with good levels of acceptability to patients. For optimal BTP management, it is recommended that opioids are titrated on an individual patient basis to a successful dose that produces adequate analgesia, with minimal adverse events.

Instanyl® (intranasal fentanyl spray [INFS]) is a novel treatment option approved for the management of BTP in adult cancer patients already receiving maintenance opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. Clinical studies in cancer patients have shown that INFS provides clinically relevant reductions in pain intensity, with superior efficacy and patient preference, compared to oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC). Previous evaluations of Instanyl® were conducted through controlled clinical trials. The aim of the present study is to explore the actual use of Instanyl® and success of titration in real-life settings, and evaluate the impact of Instanyl® on patients' daily life and treatment satisfaction.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^1141RoJX]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This is a randomised, crossover, controlled study comparing the effectiveness of a fixed dose of OTFC and IV-MO, for the management of breakthrough pain. A consecutive sample of 105 cancer patients, who were admitted to a Pain Relief and Palliative Care unit for a period of 1 year, receiving a stable opioid dose of oral morphine or transdermal fentanyl for their cancer-related pain reporting an acceptable pain relief, was screened for the study. Ethical committee approval was obtained.

Study population

Adult patients with cancer-related pain were eligible if they were receiving opioids regularly at doses of more than 60 mg of oral morphine equivalents, had an acceptable pain relief, and presented no more than two pain flares per day. Patients were excluded from the study if they had important metabolic alterations, cognitive failure, lack of cooperation, or extreme ages (under 18 and over 80 years). Patients with predominant incident pain or with short-lived episodes of neuropathic pain resolving spontaneously in few minutes were also excluded. Finally, patients receiving oral morphine equivalents in a dose range of 270–330 mg (see below), and patients who presented more than two episodes or just one episode during the daily hours (from 0700 to 1900), or pain flares repeating after with short intervals (less than 6 h) were also excluded (see the protocol described below).

Forty patients met the inclusion criteria and gave their informed consent. According to the department policy, an intravenous line was established for emergency treatment of symptoms. Increases of pain intensity were considered only if patients felt that there was a clear difference with basal pain and required a medication as needed. Patients were encouraged to call when their pain got severe.

Procedures

Patients were planned to receive IV-MO and OTFC for each couple of breakthrough pain events. The order of administration was computer-generated to produce equivalent sequence orders, 50–50%, and the wash out period between the pain flares was at least 6 h. Patients who repeated the sequence on another day received the opposite sequence. Only patients presenting a couple of episodes occurring between 0700 and 1900 were taken into consideration. Thus, patients received both treatments, serving as their own control. Patients who presented more than two episodes or just one episode during the daily hours (from 0700 to 1900) were excluded, so that only days in which two episodes occurred within this interval of 12 h were considered, to assure the presence of physicians in the unit, and minimise the occurrence of possible complications.

Other opioids

Although buprenorphine is used in some countries, it cannot be recommended as a WHO level 3 opioid since other opioids have become available (recommendation, expert agreement).

The use of fentanyl patches at 25 μ g h −1 is one therapeutic option for the initiation of opioid treatment in patients with stable pain. This is appropriate for patients who do not need frequent breakthrough doses and do not have intense pain that requires parenteral dosing because of the faster onset of action. It can be useful in the following situations (option, expert agreement):
oral administration impossible because of uncontrolled nausea and vomiting;
risk of bowel obstruction;
poor digestive absorption: fistula; short or irradiated small intestine; gastrointestinal damage following surgery; severe diarrhoea; etc.;
moderate chronic renal failure (fentanyl is mainly metabolised through a hepatic route);
to reduce the number of tablets in patients distressed by a large number of medications.

Hydromorphone is indicated for patients with severe cancer pain when there is resistance or intolerance to morphine (option, expert agreement).

Oxycodone is another alternative to oral morphine for the treatment of severe cancer pain when there is resistance or intolerance to morphine (option, expert agreement).

Pethidine has no place as a WHO level 3 opioid since other opioids have become available (option, expert agreement).

Transmucosal fentanyl should only be used to treat breakthrough pain as a complement to baseline opioid analgesia in patients with chronic cancer pain. The high cost of this treatment should be taken into consideration (option, expert agreement).

There is limited evidence about the response of breakthrough pain (BTP) to the most commonly used oral immediate-release (IR) opioids. Our aim was to determine response rate to oral IR opioids for BTP control in patients with advanced cancer.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective study, palliative care outpatients, with advanced cancer and adequately managed background pain, were asked to complete a self-administered survey. We assessed patients' baseline demographics, pain characteristics, alcoholism (CAGE questionnaire), tobacco and substance abuse, and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scores (ESAS). We determined the effectiveness of oral IR BTP opioids by using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from "very ineffective" to "very effective". "Effective" and "very effective" were defined a priori as a good response to IR opioids for BTP.

Results

Of 592 evaluable patients, 192 (32%) had background pain of ≤ 3 (ESAS pain scale 0–10). Among these 192 patients, 152 (79%) reported BTP, 143/152 (94%) took oral IR opioids for BTP, and 127/143 (89%) responded to a median dose of 10% of the total morphine equivalent daily dose. In univariate logistic regression analysis, younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.94 per year; p = .008), higher ESAS scores for pain (OR, 1.32; p = .012), anxiety (OR, 1.24; p = .017), and dyspnea (OR, 1.31; p = .007) had statistically significant association with poor response to IR opioids for BTP. In multicovariate logistic regression, adjusted for age, a higher ESAS dyspnea score was significantly associated with poor response to oral IR opioids (OR, 1.44; p = .002).

Conclusion

The vast majority of patients with advanced cancer with adequately controlled background pain reported a good response to oral IR opioids for BTP, supporting their use in clinical practice.

Implications For Practice

Oral immediate-release opioids are standard treatment for cancer breakthrough pain. However, information regarding treatment response to these commonly used opioids is limited. This study provides information that the vast majority of patients with advanced cancer, with adequately controlled background pain, reported good response to oral immediate release opioids for managing their breakthrough pain episodes. Results of this study support the use of conventional oral immediate release opioids that are relatively inexpensive and readily available for management of breakthrough pain in patients with advanced cancer.

### Breakthrough cancer pain in patients receiving low doses of opioids for background pain [^1171i5rh]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to assess the characteristics of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) in patients receiving low doses of opioids for background pain in comparison with patients receiving at least 60 mg of oral morphine equivalents (OME).

Materials and Methods

Patients with advanced cancer receiving less than 60 mg/day of OME with episodes of BTcP were included in the analysis (group L). Data were compared with patients receiving doses of opioids ≥ 60 mg of OME (group H). Pain intensity, current analgesic therapy, number of BTcP episodes, intensity of BTcP, its predictability and triggers, onset duration, interference with daily activities, BTcP medications, and time to meaningful pain relief were collected. Adverse effects imputable to a BTcP medication were recorded.

Results

A total of 1,418 and 2,474 patients were included in groups L and H, respectively. A lower number of BTcP episodes (p = .005), a lower BTcP intensity (p = .0001), a faster BTcP onset (p = .024), and a longer time to meaningful pain relief after taking a BTcP medication (p = .009) were found in group L as compared with group H. In group L, BTcP interference on daily activity was less than in group H (p = .009). Patients in group L were less likely to be prescribed an opioid as BTcP medication in comparison with patients in group H (p = .0001). Opioid doses used for BTcP were significantly higher in group H. Patients in group L were more likely to be less satisfied (p = .003) than patients in group H. No adverse effects of severe intensity were reported in both groups.

Conclusion

Patients receiving lower doses of opioids exhibit some differences in BTcP presentation: fewer episodes with lower intensity and a faster onset, a longer time to meaningful pain relief, and less satisfaction with BTcP medication. A relevant percentage of patients was receiving fentanyl preparations normally reserved for patients receiving higher doses of opioids.

Implications For Practice

Breakthrough pain is present in patients receiving low doses of opioids. It has its own peculiarities: less frequent, lower intensity, faster onset, longer time to meaningful pain relief, and less satisfaction with medication. Many patients were prescribed fentanyl preparations, which are normally reserved for patients receiving higher doses of opioids.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^113hicV8]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Of interest, in previous studies of OTFC, up to four episodes per day were treated, suggesting that the treatment was sometime repeated more frequently than every 6 h. Six hours should be a sufficient interval to avoid overlapping of effects between OTFC and IV-MO administration and vice versa. On the other hand, the increase in pain intensity, typical of the breakthrough event, which triggers drug administration, gives evidence that the effect of the previous medication is evanished.

In this study, criteria for selecting breakthrough events were strict. Adequate pain levels (about 3/10 intensity) and severe pain intensity of the episodes (about 7/10 intensity) were chosen to make a clear distinction between basal pain intensity and pain flare intensity. We also selected patients having no more than two episodes per day, to avoid possible inclusion of patients with disputable pain control. Specifically, for inclusion, we have chosen only days when both randomised treatments were used, facilitating also patients' compliance for comparison, but at a distance of at least 6 h, to avoid overlapping effects. Given that the study was not blinded, a learning effect in using OTFC cannot be excluded in subsequent administrations, but this was inevitable. However, no particular differences between subjects who received one or more OTFC treatments were found. When evaluating differential carryover effect and period effect between treatments, there were no statistically significant period or carryover effects. Of interest, previous studies did not take into consideration an acceptable time interval between events, included in the present protocol, and comparison could have paradoxically been inferred by titration to find an adequate dose and previous selection of responsive patients to both previous opioids and OTFC (exclusion of patient owing to adverse effects during open-label titration).

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^1179oybF]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Opioid dosing and titration for adults with cancer pain — initial dosing, formulation choice, and adjustments are specified as follows: The initial opioid dose is "a dose of approximately 30 mg of morphine equivalent (MME) per day", and opioids are "usually initiated during a short course of an immediate-release formulation as needed". In stable pain, "the effective dose can often be determined within a few days", and "The US Food and Drug Administration also recommends this practice of as-needed immediate-release opioids before starting regularly scheduled opioids". After the effective dose is determined, extended-release opioids "can be administered by mouth every 12 or 24 hours, or transdermal every 72 hours (fentanyl) or every 7 days (buprenorphine)", whereas immediate-release opioids "need to be administered every 4 hours". For adjustments, "Dose titration can be done a few days after each dose increase or reduction", with changes "calculated as a percentage of the total daily dose (usually approximately 25%-50%)". A practical method is to "add the total daily dose of the regular plus breakthrough opioids and increase this number by 20%-30%", and "keep each dose [of breakthrough opioid] at about 10% (5%-20%) of the regular daily opioid dose".

### Impact of opioid rescue medication for breakthrough pain on the efficacy and tolerability of long-acting opioids in patients with chronic non-malignant pain [^112RZCME]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Alternatively, it may be that the IR opioids used in these studies are not beneficial because their active effect does not coincide with the peak pain intensity of the breakthrough pain episode. This would be particularly important for unpredictable incident pain, which is not precipitated by a known trigger, and idiopathic or spontaneous pain, for which pre-emptive treatment with short-acting opioids is not possible. The onset of breakthrough pain in opioid-treated patients with chronic non-malignant pain is rapid and peaks within a median of 10 min, whereas the onset of action of most short-acting opioids is between 30 and 60 min. As a consequence, the use of ineffective short-acting opioids may increase their use and lead to needless escalation in the dose of long-acting opioids for baseline pain and associated side-effects, although there is no published literature on this topic to date. Newer rapid-onset formulations of short-acting opioids, including oral trans-mucosal fentanyl citrate and fentanyl buccal tablets, have been shown to be efficacious for the short-term treatment of breakthrough pain and well-tolerated among patients with both chronic non-malignant and malignant pain. These studies specifically looked at the short-term effects of these medications on breakthrough pain (up to 2 h after dosing) and did not address the impact of long-term use of short-acting opioids for breakthrough pain in addition to a long-acting opioid regimen on pain control. We were unable to find any studies in malignant pain that directly addressed the impact of short-acting opioid rescue medication use on the long-term analgesic efficacy of long-acting opioid regimens. This is not unexpected as malignant pain treatment is relatively short term and frequent dose adaptations are necessary owing to the increase in pain.

### Safety and effectiveness of intravenous morphine for episodic (breakthrough) pain using a fixed ratio with the oral daily morphine dose [^116KSdgT]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Breakthrough pain is normally severe in intensity and has a rapid onset. The availability of supplemental doses of opioids (rescue medication) in addition to the continuous analgesic medication is the main treatment suggested to manage these pain flares. The intravenous (i.v.) route may provide analgesia fast enough, but has never been assessed in clinical studies. The aim of this open-label study was to verify the safety and effectiveness of an i.v. dose equal to one-fifth the calculated equianalgesic total daily dose in advanced cancer patients with episodic pain. A consecutive sample of 48 cancer patients treated with oral morphine, who reported an acceptable basal analgesia and reported episodic pains, were selected for the study. The intravenous dose of morphine was one-fifth of the oral daily dose, converted into an i.v. dose using an equianalgesic ratio of 1/3 (i.v./oral). Written orders were given and intravenous morphine (i.v.-M) was administered by nurses. For each episode, pain intensity and opioid-related symptoms were recorded at the start (T0), after achieving maximum pain relief (T1), and one hour after (T2). In five patients, blood samples were taken at the time intervals described for measuring plasma concentrations of morphine and related glucuronated metabolites. One hundred seventy-one breakthrough pains were recorded during admission. In 162 episodes, a reduction of pain intensity of more than 33% was obtained within a mean of 17.7 minutes, from a mean intensity of 7.9 (on a 0–10 numeric scale) to 3. One hundred thirty-six episodes had more than a 50% pain intensity decrease after the i.v.-M within a mean of 16.6 minutes, from a pain intensity of 7.9 to 2.6. No differences in age, sex, pain mechanism, and time of events were found. There was a trend but no statistically significant differences between the groups receiving different basal doses and time to reach the maximum effect. Twenty episodes in ten patients required an additional dose within 2 hours. Adverse effects were uncommon and were significantly related to the basal dose, and as a consequence, with the i.v.-M dose. Morphine concentration significantly increased at the time of pain intensity reduction, and then decreased. These observations suggest that i.v.-M at a dose equivalent to 20% of the basal oral dosage is safe and effective in the majority of patients experiencing pain exacerbation. This treatment is inexpensive and can be used at little risk to patients.

### Management of breakthrough pain in children with cancer [^111xtNc8]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Management of breakthrough pain

Breakthrough pain includes such entities as: 1) incidental pain, which is typically induced by a child's movements (which may require adjustment of the dosing regimen and/or an analgesic dose prior to movement such as during physical therapy, going to the bathroom etc), 2) end-of-dose failure (requiring adjustment of the dosing regimen, such as increasing the dose and/or decreasing the dosing interval), and 3) spontaneous pain, where no obvious pathology is apparent. Breakthrough pain in our experience frequently occurs in children with cancer in conjunction with background pain that is usually well managed by multimodal analgesia.

"Classic" routes of opioid administration: intravenous, oral, and rectal

Calculating a "breakthrough" (or "rescue" or PRN) opioid dose in pediatric cancer pain usually involves administering 10% of the total daily dose (in adults, the WHO recommends up to a sixth of the total daily dose) for the immediate-acting opioids morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone and diamorphine. Fentanyl, due to its short half-life, would be calculated differently.

Example 1 (oral)

A 10-year-old (29 kg) patient receiving immediate-release oxycodone 10 mg orally every 6 hours would receive a total of 40 mg orally per 24 hours. Ten percent of the total daily dose would be 4 mg to be administered every 1–2 hours PRN for breakthrough pain.

Example 2 (IV)

A 1-year-old patient is receiving hydromorphone 0.3 mg IV every 4 hours, which translates into 1.8 mg IV per 24 hours. Ten percent of the total daily dose would be 0.18 mg IV hydromorphone to be administered every 1–2 hours PRN for breakthrough pain.

### Treatment of breakthrough pain with fentanyl buccal tablet in opioid-tolerant patients with chronic pain: appropriate patient selection and management [^115mAEFK]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Opioids can be a safe and effective option for carefully selected patients with a structured treatment program that includes consistent monitoring. However, the benefits and risks of opioid therapy for patients with chronic pain, and society as a whole, have been sharply debated. A key component of this debate has involved the administration of rapid-onset opioids for the management of breakthrough pain.

Objective

Review key aspects of breakthrough pain management with fentanyl buccal tablet, with a focus on minimizing risk to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Recommendations that apply broadly to all rapid-onset opioids are also discussed.

Design

Available fentanyl buccal tablet clinical and post-marketing data were reviewed.

Results

Like other schedule II controlled substances, and because fentanyl buccal tablet is a highly potent opioid, its use is associated with risk of overdose, misuse, and diversion. As with all rapid-onset opioids, particular attention to patient selection and risk assessment is warranted. The inclusion and exclusion criteria in fentanyl buccal tablet clinical studies represent patient selection standards that should be translated to clinical practice, most importantly, that patients are opioid-tolerant before fentanyl buccal tablet initiation. Titration of fentanyl buccal tablet from a low starting dose to a successful dose allows the safe identification of a dose that provides the greatest pain relief without unacceptable adverse events. After initiating fentanyl buccal tablet therapy, all patients should continue to be regularly monitored for response, including analgesia, functioning, tolerability, and aberrant behavior.

Conclusions

Fentanyl buccal tablet can be an effective and generally safe treatment for breakthrough pain when appropriate patient selection, administration, dosing, and monitoring are applied.

### Intravenous morphine for breakthrough (episodic-) pain in an acute palliative care unit: a confirmatory study [^114EeB5w]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this prospective cohort study was to confirm the safety of intravenous morphine (IV-M) used in doses proportional to the basal opioid regimen for the management of breakthrough pain and to record the nurse compliance on regularly recording data regarding breakthrough pain treated by IV-M. Over a one-year period, 99 patients received IV-M for breakthrough pain during 116 admissions. The IV-M dose was 1/5 of the oral daily dose, converted using an equianalgesic ratio of 1/3 (IV/oral). For each episode, nurses were instructed to routinely collect changes in pain intensity and emerging problems when pain became severe (T0), and to reassess the patient 15minutes after IV-M injection (T15). Nurses were unaware of the aim of the study and just followed department policy. In total, 945 breakthrough events treated by IV-M were recorded and the mean number of events per patient per admission was eight (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9–9.5). The mean dose of IV-M was 12mg (95% CI 9–14mg). In the 469 events (49.6%) with a complete assessment, a decrease in pain of more than 33% and 50% was observed in 287 (61.2%) and 115 (24.5%) breakthrough events, respectively. The mean pain intensity decreased from 7.2 (T0) to 2.7 (T15). In eight episodes, no changes in pain intensity were observed and a further dose of IV-M was given. The remaining patients did not require further interventions. No clinical events requiring medical intervention were recorded. In this confirmatory study, IV-M was administered for the management of breakthrough pain in doses proportional to the basal opioid regimen to all patients, including older patients and those requiring relatively large doses. This did not result in life-threatening adverse effects in a large number of patients and was effective in most cases. The role of nurses is of paramount importance in monitoring and collecting data and gathering information for audit purposes on the unit.

### Transmucosal fentanyl vs intravenous morphine in doses proportional to basal opioid regimen for episodic-breakthrough pain [^115zkAdT]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic cancer pain often report wide fluctuations in pain intensity. In the cancer population, breakthrough pain (or episodic pain) is a transitory flare of pain superimposed on an otherwise stable pain pattern in patients treated with opioids. The availability of supplemental doses of opioids (rescue medication) in addition to the continuous analgesic medication is the main treatment suggested to manage these pain flares. Current dosing recommendations for breakthrough pain generally suggest that the effective dose of breakthrough pain medication must be a percentage of a patient's total daily opioid dose. These recommendations, which are based entirely on anecdotal experience, favour the selection of a short-acting opioid at a dose proportionate to the total daily dose. However, an oral dose form can take a longer time to relieve pain. As pain relief is usually required urgently, routes of administration designed to deliver drugs rapidly are often chosen. A short onset of effect is commonly obtainable only with parenteral or transmucosal administration of opioid analgesics.

Intravenous morphine (IV-MO) has been found to be highly effective and safe, as only a low intensity of opioid-induced adverse effects was observed, even when administering large doses. While the intravenous route for morphine administration is feasible in acute units, in some other centres is not favourite, and at home injections are not easily manageable.

On the other hand, studies of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) have shown that this approach produces a faster onset of relief and a greater degree of pain relief than the oral morphine, at 15, 30, and 60 min. A lack of relationship between the effective OTFC dose and the fixed schedule opioid regimen, regardless of the opioid used, was observed suggesting the need to titrate the dose of OTFC. This observation contradicted the anecdotal assumption that the effective dose as needed is a percentage of the opioid daily dose. The reasons for the above finding have not been clearly explained. This makes the practical use of OTFC in the raw clinical setting, or at home, difficult. Moreover, using different pieces of OTFC for treating each episode may be time consuming exceeding the spontaneous duration for breakthrough pain, which can spontaneously subside, as evidenced by placebo-treated patients.
