## Question

87. A patient reports a 2-week history of new-onset headaches that started following a recent chiropractic alignment. The episodes consist of severe, throbbing pain involving the entire head and the upper portion of the neck. The only relief is when lying flat, and the pain is significantly worse when attempting to sit upright or ambulate. The patient denies photosensitivity, phonosensitivity, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, and transient visual loss. Neurologic examination is normal, bedside funduscopic exam shows no optic disc edema, and vital signs are within normal limits. A brain MRI scan is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

migraine without aura
idiopathic intracranial hypertension
vertebral artery dissection
bacterial meningitis
intracranial hypotension

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely in a patient with a holocephalic throbbing headache that is clearly orthostatic, began days after chiropractic cervical manipulation, has a normal neurologic exam, and has an MRI provided for review. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the clinical phenotype matches intracranial hypotension per ICHD-3 working definitions. Then, I should verify how the temporal association with cervical manipulation could mechanistically produce a spinal CSF leak. Next, I should review alternatives on the differential (migraine, IIH, meningitis, cervical artery dissection) and look for discordant features. Finally, I will check the expected brain MRI signs of intracranial hypotension and synthesize a unifying diagnosis, while keeping in mind guideline-based terminology and potential pitfalls in labeling the etiology correctly.

> Let me first confirm the syndrome: the headache is orthostatic, markedly relieved by lying flat and worsened within minutes of sitting or standing, without migrainous accompaniments and with a normal funduscopic and neurologic examination. Hold on, I should verify whether this aligns with the ICHD-3 working definition of orthostatic headache used when considering spontaneous intracranial hypotension; those criteria emphasize onset within hours of becoming upright, improvement within hours of recumbency, and intra-individual consistency, which is precisely what is described here, making intracranial hypotension highly plausible as the core syndrome [^111RwECf] [^114PttqB] [^114PttqB].

> Next, I should review the temporal trigger and mechanism. The onset within days of chiropractic cervical manipulation raises concern for a dural tear or related spinal CSF leak, which is a recognized precipitant of intracranial hypotension; wait, let me verify that this association is documented. Yes, case reports and series describe intracranial hypotension after spinal manipulation with imaging evidence of epidural CSF and diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, and contemporary reviews detail how ventral dural tears, meningeal diverticula, and CSF–venous fistulae produce the same clinical phenotype of orthostatic headache via CSF loss at the spine [^111TZXpX] [^113XC1WL].

> I will now examine the differential and try to rule out competing diagnoses. Migraine without aura would typically include photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and exercise aggravation but is not purely postural, so the absence of migrainous features and the strictly orthostatic pattern argue against migraine, though I should double-check that guidelines list migraine as a differential to be considered in SIH presentations, which they do. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension classically worsens supine and is accompanied by papilledema and visual symptoms, which are not present here, making IIH unlikely. Bacterial meningitis would bring fever, nuchal rigidity, and systemic illness, which are not described. Vertebral artery dissection after manipulation is an important consideration, but the orthostatic pattern with a normal neurologic exam and lack of focal posterior circulation signs makes dissection less likely in this scenario, although I need to remain cautious and correlate with vascular imaging if red flags arise [^111RwECf] [^112Gmhbe] [^112hzPTV] [^114N3xxx].

> Next, I should review what the MRI should show if this is intracranial hypotension. Let me think about the classic intracranial hypotension signs: diffuse gadolinium pachymeningeal enhancement, subdural fluid collections, venous sinus engorgement with pituitary hyperemia, and brain sagging including tonsillar descent and pontine flattening; I should confirm the frequencies. A meta-analysis reports pachymeningeal enhancement in about 73%, subdural collections in 35%, brain sagging in 43%, venous engorgement in 57%, and pituitary enlargement in 38%, and importantly a normal brain MRI can still occur in roughly 19% of patients, so a supportive MRI strengthens but a normal MRI does not exclude the diagnosis. Guidelines and appropriateness criteria further recommend brain MRI with contrast and whole-spine MRI to assess for a spinal CSF leak in suspected intracranial hypotension, which fits the investigative approach implied by the vignette [^111zSWQ8] [^114PttqB] [^114FrCFP].

> Synthesizing this, the orthostatic headache phenotype, the absence of features supporting migraine, IIH, meningitis, or dissection, and the expected MRI pattern together point to intracranial hypotension due to a spinal CSF leak. Wait, I initially started to label this as spontaneous intracranial hypotension; hold on, I should verify the terminology, because the clear temporal relation to cervical manipulation makes this more accurately a secondary (iatrogenic) spinal CSF leak producing intracranial hypotension rather than strictly "spontaneous", even though the clinical and radiographic phenotype overlaps with SIH. I should correct my label: the most likely diagnosis is intracranial hypotension from a post-manipulation spinal CSF leak, consistent with ICHD-3 concepts linking orthostatic headache to CSF loss or low pressure and with reports of manipulation-associated dural injury. If management were considered, guidelines endorse early epidural blood patching as first-line when intracranial hypotension is suspected after appropriate imaging, but the diagnostic conclusion here is the key step [^111RwECf] [^111TZXpX] [^113f3sQD] [^113XC1WL].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **intracranial hypotension** [^113XC1WL] due to a spinal CSF leak, likely precipitated by chiropractic manipulation [^111TZXpX]. The key features are **orthostatic headache** [^111RwECf] (worse upright, relieved supine) [^114PttqB], diffuse/throbbing pain, and MRI showing pachymeningeal enhancement [^111zSWQ8], brain sagging [^113XC1WL], and venous engorgement [^111zSWQ8]. Migraine, IIH, vertebral artery dissection, and bacterial meningitis are excluded by the clinical picture and imaging. Management is conservative measures [^113f3sQD] and epidural blood patching [^114n2osh]; prognosis is favorable with treatment [^114PttqB].

---

## Clinical features supporting intracranial hypotension

The patient's presentation is **highly suggestive of intracranial hypotension**, with the following key features:

- **Orthostatic headache**: Headache worsens upon standing or sitting upright and improves significantly when lying flat, a hallmark of intracranial hypotension [^111RwECf] [^114PttqB].

- **Diffuse, throbbing pain**: The headache involves the entire head and upper neck, consistent with the typical distribution of intracranial hypotension headaches [^114n2osh] [^111PP9dS].

- **Recent chiropractic manipulation**: Chiropractic manipulation [^111TZXpX] is a recognized precipitating factor for spinal CSF leaks, leading to intracranial hypotension.

- **Absence of migraine features**: The patient does not report photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances, which are common in migraine but not typical of intracranial hypotension [^114PttqB] [^111RwECf].

- **Normal neurologic examination and funduscopy**: The absence of neurologic deficits and optic disc edema further supports intracranial hypotension, as these findings are typically absent in this condition [^111RwECf].

---

## MRI findings consistent with intracranial hypotension

Although the specific MRI is not provided, intracranial hypotension [^113XC1WL] typically shows **characteristic MRI** [^114FrCFP] findings, including:

- **Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement**: Uniform enhancement of the dura mater is a hallmark MRI finding in intracranial hypotension [^111zSWQ8].

- **Brain sagging**: Inferior displacement of brain structures, including the cerebellar tonsils and brainstem, is commonly observed [^113XC1WL].

- **Venous engorgement**: Enlargement of venous structures, such as the transverse sinuses, is frequently seen [^111zSWQ8].

- **Subdural fluid collections**: Subdural hygromas or hematomas may be present in some cases [^111zSWQ8].

These MRI findings, combined with the clinical presentation, **strongly support the diagnosis** of intracranial hypotension [^114FrCFP].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other conditions

The following differential diagnoses **can be excluded** based on the clinical presentation and MRI findings [^114PttqB]:

- **Migraine without aura**: Typically associated with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting, which are absent in this patient. Additionally, migraine headaches are not characteristically orthostatic [^111RwECf].

- **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)**: IIH presents with headaches associated with increased intracranial pressure, often accompanied by papilledema and visual disturbances, which are absent in this patient.

- **Vertebral artery dissection**: Typically presents with unilateral neck pain, neurologic deficits, or stroke-like symptoms, none of which are present in this patient [^112hzPTV].

- **Bacterial meningitis**: Characterized by fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status, and CSF abnormalities, none of which are present in this patient [^112mHou6].

---

## Pathophysiology of intracranial hypotension

Intracranial hypotension results from reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure due to a **spinal CSF leak** [^114n2osh]. The leak reduces CSF volume and intracranial pressure, causing brain sagging and traction on pain-sensitive structures, resulting in orthostatic headaches and associated symptoms [^113XC1WL].

---

## Management and prognosis

Management of intracranial hypotension typically includes **conservative measures** such as bed rest, hydration, caffeine, and analgesics [^113f3sQD]. If conservative treatment fails, **epidural blood patching** is highly effective in sealing the CSF leak and relieving symptoms [^111zSWQ8] [^114n2osh]. Prognosis is generally **favorable**, with most patients experiencing significant improvement or complete resolution of symptoms following appropriate treatment [^114PttqB] [^114n2osh].

---

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is **intracranial hypotension** [^113XC1WL] due to a spinal CSF leak, likely precipitated by recent chiropractic manipulation [^111TZXpX]. The clinical presentation, MRI findings, and exclusion of other differential diagnoses strongly support this diagnosis.

### Targeted versus nontargeted epidural blood patch for spontaneous intracranial hypotension: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zSWQ8]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), first described in 1938 by the German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand, is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, resulting in orthostatic headaches and neurological deficits. Often underdiagnosed, SIH can mimic other headache disorders, as patients commonly present with postural headaches that improve when lying down and worsen upon standing. While these postural headaches are the hallmark symptom, they can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, vertigo, photophobia, blurred vision, phonophobia, tinnitus, neck stiffness, and pain with neck flexion.

MRI is the most accurate diagnostic tool for SIH. A recent meta‐analysis of brain MRI findings revealed diffuse gadolinium pachymeningeal enhancement (73%), subdural collections (35%), brain sagging (43%), venous engorgement (57%), and pituitary gland enlargement (38%). Normal MRI results were observed in 19% of patients.

### Headache after sealing of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^115kh5En]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Overall, in SIH patients with long-term persistent headache without improvement after surgery, we found either complicated clinical courses with subdural hematoma and CSF leak relapses or recurrence at another level requiring repeated surgery, persistent headache after sinus venous thrombosis which likely was not caused by the CSF leak in the first place, or multiple nerve root cysts, which cannot be completely surgically removed.

We observed cases with low SIH score before invasive treatment for SIH. This might be due to the inclusion of patients with long clinical courses before treatment. The CSF dynamics might change over the course of the disease, with clear early signs of CSF leak becoming less significant over time. This might translate into fewer indirect signs as assessed by the SIH score in some patients with long-lasting SIH.

The strengths of our study lie in the rigorous headache phenotyping and detailed description of the comorbidities and treatments. Our findings might have been influenced by recall bias, especially given the long latency between surgery and interview, in some patients up to 10 years. For patients, it might be difficult to recall details on headache frequency that occurred, disappeared, or were attenuated years back. Other limitations are the small sample size and the lack of standardized work-up for SIH. Future studies with prospective design and longer follow-up periods may be necessary to assess the headache phenotype, the headache dynamics, and the long-term outcomes in patients with persistent headache after surgery for CSF leak.

### Long-term headache outcome and radiological correlates in patients with intracranial hypotension [^1122PBov]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The study examines the long-term outcomes of headaches in patients suffering from intracranial hypotension and investigates any associated radiological correlates. The analysis involves a detailed examination of patient data and radiological findings to determine any patterns or significant results.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with intracranial hypotension were followed over an extended period to monitor headache severity and frequency. Radiological assessments were conducted to identify any anomalies that could correlate with the patients' clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Findings suggested a tangible link between specific radiological markers and headache severity. Several imaging features frequently appeared in patients with more severe symptoms, providing new insights into potential diagnostic criteria for intracranial hypotension.

The study provides valuable implications for both clinical practice and further research, highlighting the importance of comprehensive diagnostic evaluations in managing intracranial hypotension-associated headaches.

### Clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114WqgTx]. JAMA Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The term spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) defines a clinical condition characterized by debilitating postural headaches secondary to a spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and/or CSF hypotension. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), third edition, SIH is diagnosed when a headache has developed spontaneously and in temporal relation to a CSF leak (evident on imaging) and/or CSF hypotension (lumbar puncture opening pressure < 60 mm CSF).

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a highly misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed disorder. Estimates suggest that SIH is not uncommon, with an annual incidence of 5 per 100,000 individuals every year, half the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite the lack of objective evidence on the effect of SIH on patients' quality of life, the orthostatic headache typical of this condition makes SIH debilitating, affecting patients during their most active hours. The exact pathogenetic mechanism of SIH is unknown, and this lack of knowledge has led to a series of misconceptions. Moreover, the ICHD diagnostic criteria for SIH have changed significantly throughout the last few decades, and alternative diagnostic criteria have been proposed. These factors have probably contributed to the uncertainty on how to reliably diagnose SIH and effectively treat these patients.

Despite the increasing number of publications on SIH throughout the last two decades, this is the first comprehensive systematic review on this condition, to our knowledge. The aim of this study is to summarize the available literature and provide insights into the clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome.

### Radionuclide cisternography in detecting cerebrospinal fluid leak in spontaneous intracranial hypotension: a series of four case reports [^111Wgera]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an infrequent clinical entity characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypovolemia due to a CSF leak. The cause of the leak in SIH, however, is largely unknown, though structural meningeal weakness and mechanical stress factors have been postulated. Patients with SIH typically present with postural headaches, and occasionally with other symptoms such as nausea, emesis, neck stiffness, and photophobia. In this case series, we present four patients who underwent radionuclide cisternography (RNC) for suspected CSF leak. All patients underwent RNC and MR and/or CT for evaluation. We found that RNC accurately detected and localized a CSF abnormality in all four patients, with each patient experiencing symptomatic relief following directed epidural blood patch.

This review was performed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. The PICO framework was used to formulate the research question, focusing on the population with intracranial hypotension syndrome. The intervention under consideration was the targeted blood patch, compared to the nontargeted blood patch, with clinical improvement being the primary outcome (Figure 1).

- **Search strategy**: Two authors (GT and MP) conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases to identify relevant studies comparing TEBP versus NTEBP. The search terms used included: ("blood patch" OR EBP) AND (intracranial hypotension OR SIH OR spontaneous intracranial hypotension OR craniospinal hypotension OR low pressure headache OR low-pressure headache OR cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia OR cerebrospinal fluid hypotension OR cerebro-spinal fluid hypotension OR CSF hypotension OR cerebrospinal fluid hypovolemia OR cerebro-spinal fluid hypovolemia OR CSF hypovolemia). The search was updated to November 28, 2024, with no time limit. A forward search on references of the retrieved articles was also performed to increase the search power.

- **Study selection**: The search was limited to peer-reviewed studies published in English. Only papers containing quantitative data were included. Other inclusion criteria were: papers comparing TEBP versus NTEBP; studies including more than five patients; and follow-up of at least 6 months. Review papers and papers not presenting explicit data for each group (TEBP vs. NTEBP) were excluded.

### Syntalos: A software for precise synchronization of simultaneous multi-modal data acquisition and closed-loop interventions [^111qcaDL]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

When a new module is added to an experiment configuration, it communicates a set of basic information to the Syntalos engine, such as the ports it supports or its threading requirements. Once the experiment is started, the module runs through a series of states:

- **Program behavior during experiment**: First, the Syntalos engine sets up the threading model and basic data structures. Then, an execution order for all modules is planned, ensuring that modules generating data are started before those consuming the data. Modules are then triggered to enter the first 'prepare' stage in which they initialize any hardware, communicate their time synchronization strategy, and set runtime-specific metadata on data streams (such as the expected bit-depth of a camera recording or expected headers of a CSV table). When the module is ready, it transitions into the 'ready' state and communicates this information to the engine. The engine subscribes all input ports at the time of writing streams according to the user's configuration. Once all modules have signaled that they are 'ready', the engine emits a 'start' signal, and modules transition into a 'running' phase where they start to process or emit data. The Master Clock is only available once the 'start' signal has been sent. This strategy ensures that modules start almost simultaneously, within their technical limitations.

The engine continuously monitors the state of all running modules and data queues and provides modules with Master Clock timestamps. Once the user stops the experiment, the engine emits a 'stop' signal.

### Surgical closure of spinal cerebrospinal fluid leaks improves symptoms in patients with superficial siderosis [^111F7ZXC]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks may cause a myriad of symptoms, with the most common being orthostatic headache. In addition, ventral spinal CSF leaks are a possible etiology of superficial siderosis (SS), a rare condition characterized by hemosiderin deposits in the central nervous system (CNS). The classical presentation of SS involves ataxia, bilateral hearing loss, and myelopathy. Unfortunately, treatment options are scarce. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether microsurgical closure of CSF leaks can prevent further clinical deterioration or improve symptoms of SS.

This cohort study was conducted using data from a prospectively maintained database in two large spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) referral centers in Germany and Switzerland. Patients who met the modified International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition criteria for SIH were included. Patients with spinal CSF leaks were screened for the presence of idiopathic infratentorial symmetric SS of the CNS.

Twelve patients were included in the study. The median latency between the onset of orthostatic headaches and symptoms attributed to SS was 9.5 years. After surgical closure of the underlying spinal CSF leak, symptoms attributed to SS improved in seven patients and remained stable in three. Patients who presented within one year after the onset of SS symptoms improved, but those who presented in 8–12 years did not improve. We demonstrated a significant association between patients with spinal longitudinal extrathecal collections and SS.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend considering the assessment of predisposing conditions. These include connective tissue disorders, joint hypermobility disorders, and spinal pathology such as osteophytes, disc herniation, and discogenic microspurs in direct relation to the site of the spinal leak.

### Stroke and death due to spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^112seD78]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension has become a well-recognized cause of headaches, and a wide variety of other manifestations have been reported. Recently, several patients with asymptomatic spontaneous intracranial hypotension were reported. I now report two patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who developed multiple arterial strokes, associated with death in one patient, illustrating the spectrum of disease severity in spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

- **Methods**: Medical records and radiologic imaging of the two patients were reviewed.

- **Results**:

	- **Case 1**: A 45-year-old man presented with an orthostatic headache. Neurologic examination was normal. MRI showed bilateral subdural fluid collections, brain sagging, and pachymeningeal enhancement. At lumbar puncture, the opening pressure was too low to record. He underwent two epidural blood patches with transient improvement of symptoms. His headaches progressed, and a CT-myelogram showed a lower cervical CSF leak. Subsequently, periodic lethargy and confusion were noted, and he then rapidly deteriorated. Examination showed coma (GCS: 4 [E1, M2, V1]), a fixed and dilated right pupil, and decerebrate posturing. Bilateral craniotomies were performed for the evacuation of chronic subdural hematomas. Immediate postoperative CT showed bilateral posterior cerebral artery infarcts and a right subdural hematoma, requiring re-evacuation. Postoperative examination was consistent with brain death, and support was withdrawn.

	- **Case 2**: A 42-year-old man presented with a non-positional headache. Neurologic examination was…

### Severe acute orthostatic headache: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) [^112nmq8Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The most common cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Intracranial hypotension is characterized by diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on cranial MRI features, low CSF pressure, and orthostatic headaches primarily caused by dural puncture. We report a 31-year-old woman who presented with continuous severe bifrontal headache, which increased on sitting up and resolved when lying down. MRI of the cervical and lumbosacral spine showed signs of a CSF leak, leading to a diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache. A CT-guided epidural blood patch was performed at L4–5, with fibrin glue injected at the site of the leak. The patient's signs and symptoms improved following the procedure.

### Pitfalls in the management of headache in the emergency department [^112mHou6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Headache is the fifth most common primary complaint of patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) in the United States. The emergency physician (EP) plays a unique role in the management of these patients, which differs from that of the primary care physician, the neurologist, and other specialists. Diagnostic nomenclature used in the ED is necessarily less specific, as care is more appropriately focused on the relief of symptoms and the identification of life-threatening causes. By seeking a limited number of specific critical features during history taking and physical examination, the EP can minimize the risk of overlooking one of these dangerous causes of headache.

When certain features are present, empirical therapies and diagnostic testing should be initiated in the ED. The most frequently encountered pitfalls in the management of patients with headache in emergency medicine practice, and those with the greatest likelihood to adversely affect patient outcomes, are discussed.

### Methodical history taking may help in timely diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^111FbEbL]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

In the present case, during the initial history taking, the patient mentioned that he could not work due to headache, and that the headache was relieved by lying down. We recognized it as a characteristic of migraine, which is aggravated by activity and causes avoidance of routine physical activity. Consequently, we misdiagnosed the patient with migraine. After two weeks, further history taking indicated orthostatic hypotension (OH) because his headache recurred within ten minutes after rising from the recumbent position.

When taking medical history, OH is suspected if a patient's headache is relieved by lying down and aggravated by standing. However, in several diseases, patients experience headache relief when lying down. Therefore, headache relief on lying down alone may indicate common causes of headache, such as migraine and tension, rather than spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH).

Because OH associated with SIH may show a delayed response to postural change, with worsening after minutes or hours of standing and improvement after minutes or hours of lying down, an optimal history taking of OH has not been reported. In the present case, if headache aggravation upon standing had been identified during the initial assessment, the condition may have been diagnosed earlier.

We reported a patient with SIH who had a delayed diagnosis because we did not identify the patient's feeling of headache relief on lying down as OH. With regard to headache history taking for the diagnosis of SIH, we suggest that it is important to confirm not only headache relief on lying down but also headache aggravation on standing.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^116DMb7W]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension, particularly concerning headache management, the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend evaluating for comorbid primary headache and treating according to the phenotype in patients who do not respond to the initial management of SIH. Patients should be counseled about the risk of medication overuse headache. Use caution with drugs that potentially lower CSF pressure, such as topiramate and indomethacin, and migraine preventives that can reduce BP, such as candesartan and β-blockers, as they may exacerbate the postural symptoms of SIH.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: a cause of severe acute headache [^113XVgaB]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Severe acute headache is a common presenting symptom to an accident and emergency department. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an increasingly recognized cause of these symptoms and has characteristic clinical and imaging findings. SIH is characterized by headache that worsens on standing, low opening cerebrospinal fluid pressures at lumbar puncture, and uniform pachymeningeal enhancement with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, all in the absence of dural trauma. Atypical presentations occur, and severe neurological decline can rarely be associated with this condition. A review of five patients presenting recently to our institution with classical imaging findings, together with a review of the literature, is presented.

### Coma from worsening spontaneous intracranial hypotension after subdural hematoma evacuation [^114gLPK4]. Neurocritical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Low cerebrospinal fluid volume is typically diagnosed in patients presenting with positional headaches. However, severe intracranial hypotension and brain sagging may cause orthostatic coma. We present a case that illustrates this uncommon presentation.

- **Method**: Case report.

- **Results**: A 50-year-old man presented with orthostatic headaches and then developed bilateral subdural hematomas. Following unilateral subdural hematoma evacuation, the patient became gradually drowsier and more confused. Upon transfer to our hospital, he would become comatose each time he was placed in the upright position. Successful epidural patch at the level of a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak, documented by myelography, resulted in complete resolution of his orthostatic symptoms despite reaccumulation of the subdural fluid collection.

- **Conclusions**: Evacuation of subdural fluid collections may be detrimental in patients with low CSF volume by exacerbating the intracranial hypotension. Extreme brain sagging may lead to anatomical distortion of the diencephalon and brainstem resulting in coma.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^114qDPCr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, more specifically with respect to follow-up, the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following during follow-up:

- **Peak headache severity**: On a 0–10 scale.

- **Time to severe headache onset**: After becoming upright.

- **Severity of other symptoms**: Such as audiovestibular and cognitive symptoms.

- **Time able to spend upright**: Before needing to lie down.

- **Cumulative hours able to spend upright per day**: Monitoring is essential.

- **Headache disability and QoL outcome scores**: Note that these are not validated for SIH.

### Case of spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Clinical, neuroimaging and treatment approach [^116bahdH]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A woman in her 40s presented with a 3-month history of intermittent bilateral daily headache of moderate intensity. She experienced severe headaches for almost 1 month prior to presentation. These were aggravated by standing and relieved by lying down. She underwent a non-contrast CT of the head, followed by MRI of the brain and spine. Neuroimaging of the brain showed features of intracranial hypotension, and spine MRI myelography, employing fast imaging with steady state acquisition sequences, confirmed the site of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. An epidural blood patch (EBP) was placed to close the CSF leakage site, leading to significant improvement in her symptoms. Repeat MRI at 4 weeks of follow-up showed resolution of imaging abnormalities, and she became symptom-free without the requirement of additional EBP.

Our report highlights the importance of suspecting and evaluating spontaneous intracranial hypotension in a patient presenting with a typical orthostatic headache. Early intervention and maintaining a low threshold for evaluation, based on a few early clinical and imaging clues, can lead to successful management of such cases.

### Clinical decision rules to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage for acute headache [^112rhMba]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

The Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Rule is a clinical calculator used in the field of emergency medicine to determine the likelihood of a subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients presenting with acute headache. This rule applies specifically to patients who are alert and over 15 years old with a new severe, non-traumatic headache reaching maximum intensity within 1 hour.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to help clinicians decide whether a lumbar puncture or computed tomography scan is necessary to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It is designed to be 100% sensitive for identifying subarachnoid hemorrhage, meaning that if a patient meets none of the criteria, the likelihood of them having a subarachnoid hemorrhage is extremely low.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Rule include patients with new neurological deficits, patients with a history of three or more headaches of the same character and intensity as their headache over a period of six months, and patients with a previous diagnosis of brain tumors or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- **Criteria for SAH evaluation**: The Ottawa Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Rule is a clinical decision tool designed to aid in determining the likelihood of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) based on six specific criteria. Each of these criteria corresponds to a symptom or condition often associated with SAH, and they serve as inputs to the tool.

- **The tool evaluates the following criteria**:
	- Age 40 or older
	- Presence of neck pain or stiffness

### Headache after sealing of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^113dek1c]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a significant cause of headache with a substantial impact on quality of life. The average annual incidence rate is 3.7 per 100,000, slightly more frequent in women than in men, with the mean age of occurrence at 55 years. SIH results from a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dura leak caused by multiple mechanisms, such as dural tear, meningeal diverticula, or CSF-venous fistula (CVF).

Orthostatic headache, which occurs within seconds or minutes after taking an upright position and vanishes within minutes of lying horizontally, is the hallmark symptom of SIH. Despite adequate conservative treatment, many patients are not able to resume their daily activities, and surgery becomes necessary. However, even after technically successful sealing of the spinal CSF leak, recovery can be incomplete. Headache may worsen, change phenotype, or show signs of rebound intracranial hypertension.

To provide guidance for clinicians dealing with patients who have persistent headaches despite the technically successful sealing of the CSF leak, we systematically investigated the following:

- **Clinical presentation**: Examination of how patients present when SIH persists.
- **Factors associated with persistent headache**: Identification of variables linked to ongoing headache issues.
- **Long-term outcomes**: Evaluation of patient recovery and symptom persistence over time.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^115ghJiY]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, particularly in patients with subdural hematoma, SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a brain MRI with IV contrast and a whole-spine MRI to assess for the possibility of a spinal CSF leak in patients with subdural hematoma/hygromas. This is advised if there is a high index of suspicion, such as a supportive history of orthostatic headache or the absence of trauma, coagulopathy, or alcohol misuse.

### Defining the typical characteristics of orthostatic headache in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^112gfZ8Q]. Cephalalgia (2025). Low credibility.

Orthostatic headache (OH) is a common feature of various conditions, including spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), but no precise definition currently exists outlining the typical OH characteristics. This ambiguity risks misdiagnosis with unnecessary investigations and delay in the institution of treatment. The present study aimed to carry out structured phenotyping of OH in patients with SIH with the aim of outlining its typical characteristics.

- **Methods**: Eligible patients with clinico-radiological confirmed SIH underwent a structured interview, after which a specialist interest group utilized the modified Delphi process to analyze the data and achieve consensus on defining the typical characteristics of OH in SIH.

- **Results**: In total, 137 patients were recruited. OH was present in 75.9% of patients. Typical OH characteristics in SIH were defined as having a baseline severity (lying flat) on waking up of ≤ 3 (0–10, verbal response scale), headache onset-time of ≤ 4.5 hours upon becoming upright, time to peak severity of ≤ 7.5 hours, and an offset to baseline severity within 1.5 hours of recumbency. Intra-individual consistency in the onset and offset-time was deemed a necessary characteristic.

- **Conclusions**: Defining typical OH characteristics has the potential to enhance SIH diagnostics and management while minimizing unwarranted invasive procedures.

### Long-term headache outcome and radiological correlates in patients with intracranial hypotension [^117DJGJd]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This study has several strengths, including patients with extended follow-up periods assessed both prospectively and retrospectively. Interviews were conducted by a headache specialist to ensure accurate diagnosis according to ICHD-3 criteria. Additionally, a board-certified radiologist reviewed all imaging exams. Most studies focus primarily on SIH rather than the prognosis of patients and comparisons between SIH and secondary forms of IH. However, the retrospective nature of the study presents intrinsic limitations, including recall bias and skewed data collection, as the data were not originally gathered with research as the primary focus. Another limitation is the relatively small sample size, which limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the significance of imaging findings and their clinical correlations. However, this limitation is partially expected due to the rarity of the disease. Additionally, the precise localization of a CSF leak requires the use of myelographic techniques.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: features, diagnosis and management [^114Pc6Gy]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

One cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage secondary to a CSF–venous fistula. Fistulae can be iatrogenic, for example, after lumbar puncture or spinal surgery, but they can also arise from the spontaneous rupture of a perineural cyst into an adjacent vein, usually near a spinal nerve root. CSF–venous fistulae are most common in the thoracolumbar region, with 68% found between T7 and T12.

This retrospective study identified 44 patients with CSF–venous fistulae at a single tertiary center between 1994 and 2019. Females were affected more commonly than males, with a ratio of approximately 2:1, and symptom onset occurred in middle age (mean onset 52.6 years). Over 95% of patients presented with headache, often with a preceding period of episodic or chronic headaches. Interestingly, the Valsalva maneuver induced or exacerbated the presenting headache in 88% of cases, whereas only 69% reported an orthostatic component. Brain MRI with contrast was abnormal in over 80% of cases, but CSF opening pressure, when measured, was commonly normal (7–20 mm CSF in 84%). Digital subtraction or positive pressure myelography was most effective at identifying fistulae, with conventional CT and MRI myelograms having a poor yield. In contrast with other CSF leaks, extradural CSF is not found on imaging; instead, myelographic contrast can be seen in an epidural vein.

Most fistulae in this series were thoracic, with 76.7% being right-sided for unknown reasons. Forty patients received at least one epidural blood patch (EBP), but the response was…

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^113ZiMQB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, specifically in the context of headache management, the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend evaluating patients with rebound headache after treatment of SIH for secondary intracranial hypertension. If the headache is very severe or continues to worsen after 1–2 weeks, further clinical assessment should be considered. It is important to recognize that rebound headache after treatment for SIH may indicate postprocedural intracranial hypertension, which is self-limiting in most patients and can often be managed without medical treatment.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^111RwECf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

- **Guideline statements**:

	**Q1. What key clinical features should lead to the diagnosis of SIH being considered?**

	- SIH should be considered in any patient presenting with orthostatic headache (other than following iatrogenic dural puncture or major trauma), 'end of the day' or 'second half of the day' headache with improvement on lying flat, thunderclap headache followed by orthostatic headache, and new daily persistent headache with an initial orthostatic quality. The presence of associated symptoms should increase the suspicion of SIH.

	- We recommend a working definition of orthostatic headache as one that meets the following criteria:

	- Absent or only mild (1–3/10 on verbal rating scale (VRS)) on waking or after prolonged lying flat.
	- The onset occurs within 2 hours of becoming upright.
	- After lying flat, there should be 'good' improvement in severity (> 50% on VRS) within 2 hours.
	- The timing of onset and offset is consistent.

- **Q2. What differential diagnoses of SIH should be considered and how should the diagnoses be confirmed?**

	- Differential diagnoses of SIH include postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), orthostatic hypotension, cervicogenic headache, and migraine. PoTS and orthostatic hypotension are diagnosed from a detailed autonomic history and haemodynamic autonomic responses to formal standing tests, documenting objective evidence of postural tachycardia (increase in heart rate by > 30 beats per minute) or orthostatic hypotension.

### A comprehensive update on the treatment and management of postdural puncture headache [^113tDon5]. Current Pain and Headache Reports (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on postdural puncture headache:

- **Definition**: PDPH is a positional headache that occurs following a dural puncture, typically presenting within 48 hours but can be delayed up to 5 days.

- **Pathophysiology**: PDPH is thought to be caused by CSF leakage through the dural puncture site, leading to decreased CSF volume and pressure. This results in compensatory cerebral vasodilation and downward traction on pain-sensitive structures within the brain, contributing to the headache.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of PDPH in the general population undergoing lumbar puncture ranges from 2–40% and can be as high as 50–80% in obstetric patients undergoing spinal anesthesia.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for PDPH include younger age, female sex, lower BMI, low CSF opening pressure, spinal stenosis, and previous PDPH. The size and type of needle used, the number of puncture attempts, and the experience of the practitioner influence the risk of PDPH. Smaller gauge needles and non-cutting needles are associated with a lower incidence of PDPH.

- **Disease course**: PDPH is characterized by a bilateral, frontal-occipital headache that worsens in the upright position and improves when lying down. Associated symptoms may include neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, auditory disturbances, vertigo, and tinnitus.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: PDPH usually resolves spontaneously within one week in most cases, although some may persist longer. Conservative management includes bed rest, hydration, caffeine, and analgesics.

### Headache after sealing of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^1148Peve]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

In the long term, following a median follow-up of 1710 days (IQR 1277–2219), the SIH-related headache disappeared in 4 out of 11 patients (33%), improved in another 4 out of 11 (33%), but remained unchanged compared to the post-treatment headache in 3 out of 11 patients (27%).

- **In one patient (P8)**: An initially unrecognized venous fistula was discovered that had been missed during the initial evaluation. This patient exhibited clear intracranial signs of brain sagging, and surgery was performed to remove nerve root cysts at the Th10 level, concurrent with the location of the unidentified fistula. Ultimately, this patient successfully treated the initially unidentified leak through nerve root cyst surgery.

- **In the second patient (P10)**: The persistent headache was unchanged from the pretreatment SIH headache. This patient had cerebral venous thrombosis approximately two decades before the detection of SIH, necessitating a craniotomy due to intracerebral bleeding. During the workup for cervical radiculopathy, SIH was diagnosed. The patient presented with signs of intracranial hypertension on head MRI and ophthalmologic examination and was treated with acetazolamide.

- **In the third patient (P5)**: This patient experienced a spinal CSF leak and subdural hematomas. Four surgeries were performed during the initial presentation and subsequent relapse of headaches occurring three weeks after the first treatment — two surgeries for sealing the CSF leakage and two for hematoma evacuation.

### Orthostatic headache without CSF leak [^117JJKfF]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the syndrome of orthostatic headache without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and propose potential mechanisms.

The methods involved identifying patients from a pool of 125 individuals referred over a 5-year period for evaluation of orthostatic headache and suspected CSF leak. Patients who exhibited negative head and spine MRI results, normal radioisotope cisternography and CT myelography, and normal recumbent CSF opening pressure were selected for review of their medical records.

Results indicated that six patients met the criteria for absence of a CSF leak, of whom four were men. The mean age at the time of evaluation was 39 years, ranging from 20 to 65 years. The median duration of symptoms before evaluation was 2 years, with a range of 0.5 to 16 years. An inciting event was identified in two patients, and cochleovestibular symptoms were present in five patients. The mean CSF opening pressure was 140.3 mm H2O, ranging from 86 to 186. Two of the patients underwent autonomic reflex screening, which showed no signs of postural tachycardia syndrome. After a mean follow-up of 45.5 months, ranging from 31 to 67 months, one patient experienced a complete spontaneous recovery, while five continued to experience persistent orthostatic headaches.

The conclusions drawn suggest that orthostatic headaches can manifest without evidence of intracranial hypotension or detectable CSF leak, even after extensive diagnostic testing. Clinical features alone may not distinguish between orthostatic headache with or without an identifiable CSF leak. Potential mechanisms include a very slow or intermittent CSF leak that cannot be detected during evaluation or by diagnostic means, or increased compliance of the dura mater.

### Second-half-of-the-day headache as a manifestation of spontaneous CSF leak [^114g17VZ]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Orthostatic headache related to spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak appears within two hours of sitting or standing in most patients. However, longer delays to headache onset have been observed, including some patients who experience headaches only in the afternoon. The objective of this study is to describe second-half-of-the-day headache as a manifestation of spontaneous CSF leak and propose potential mechanisms. From 142 patients evaluated by one of us during a 10-year period for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, those describing headache occurring exclusively in the afternoon accompanied by typical changes of intracranial hypotension on head MRI were retrospectively identified and their medical records reviewed. Five patients met our pre-defined inclusion criteria (5/142, 3.5%; three women; mean age 50 years). Second-half-of-the-day headache was an initial symptom of intracranial hypotension in one patient, spontaneously evolved from prior all-day orthostatic headache in one patient, and was a residual symptom after epidural blood patch in three patients. Head MRI changes due to intracranial hypotension were decreased during second-half-of-the-day headache compared to typical all-day orthostatic headache in three out of four patients. The timing of second-half-of-the-day headache and orthostatic headache in the clinical course of patients with spontaneous CSF leaks and related MRI findings suggest that second-half-of-the-day headache is likely a manifestation of a slowed or slow-flow CSF leak.

### Pituitary pseudo-adenoma from cerebrospinal fluid leak in patient with Marfan syndrome [^113PxsMQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Intracranial hypotension may result in pituitary gland enlargement due to compensatory hyperaemia and venous engorgement. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is frequently associated with connective tissue disorders predisposing patients to dural weakening, including dural ectasia and meningeal diverticula. Symptoms of SIH typically include postural headache, dizziness, and tinnitus. We present a case of a female in her 20s with Marfan syndrome and a history of pituitary adenoma, who reported intractable postural headaches. Hormonal workup revealed no abnormalities, whereas brain MRI showed sequelae of intracranial hypotension. Further MRI studies revealed thoracic and lumbar meningeal diverticula with significant dural sac ectasia at the L4-S2 level. A myelogram confirmed numerous lumbar spine diverticula with a cerebrospinal fluid leak at the L5 and S1 right nerve roots. The patient underwent blood patch administrations at the level of the leak with improvement of symptoms.

### Intracranial hypotensive crisis from an insidious spinal cerebrospinal fluid-venous fistula: A case report [^117MshpK]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

Progressive episodic spells of altered levels of consciousness, often advancing to include paroxysmal autonomic instability, may be indicative of a diencephalic dysfunction underlying spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). A rare and often indolent etiology may be a spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak — an elusive diagnosis, especially in cases of CSF-venous fistula (CVF) that are often missed on routine computed tomography (CT) myelography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

- **Clinical presentation**: We report an unusual case of a 50-year-old woman who presented with rapidly progressive cyclical, self-resolving episodes of altered mentation and decreased arousal later in the day. Scrutiny of serial brain MRIs led to a diagnosis of SIH, with severe downward diencephalic and brain stem displacement resulting in cerebral aqueduct occlusion with obstructive hydrocephalus. Initial clinical improvement occurred with CSF diversion, but the patient quickly deteriorated — developing diencephalic spells, including extensor posturing and severely depressed levels of consciousness. Clinical improvement was seen with stopping CSF diversion and Trendelenburg positioning. After intensive spinal imaging, dynamic CT myelography identified a left T10 nerve root diverticula and CSF-venous fistula. Surgical obliteration resulted in rapid, profound neurological improvement and ultimately full neurological recovery by 1 year.

In our patient, worsening episodes of confusion, postural headaches, and autonomic instability developed due to SIH, which induced…

### Clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114PttqB]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a highly disabling but often misdiagnosed disorder. The best management options for patients with SIH are still uncertain.

The objective of this study is to provide an objective summary of the available evidence on the clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes for SIH.

Data was collected from a systematic review and meta-analysis compliant with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Three databases — PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane — were searched from inception to April 30, 2020. The search terms included spontaneous intracranial hypotension, low CSF syndrome, low CSF pressure syndrome, low CSF volume syndrome, intracranial hypotension, low CSF pressure, low CSF volume, CSF hypovolemia, CSF hypovolaemia, spontaneous spinal CSF leak, spinal CSF leak, and CSF leak syndrome.

Original studies in the English language reporting on 10 or more patients with SIH were selected by consensus. Data on clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes were collected and summarized by multiple observers. Random-effect meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled estimates of means and proportions.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The predetermined main outcomes were the pooled estimate proportions of symptoms of SIH, imaging findings (brain and spinal imaging), and treatment outcomes (conservative, epidural blood patches, and surgical).

Out of 6,878 articles, 14 studies were included in the final analysis.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, especially concerning the noninvasive assessment of fibrosis, the 2024 EASD/EASL/EASO guidelines recommend a multi-step approach for adult patients with MASLD:

- **Blood-based score**: Obtain an established non-patented blood-based score, such as the fibrosis-4 index, as the first step.

- **Imaging techniques**: Use established imaging techniques, such as liver elastography, as the second step to further clarify the fibrosis stage if fibrosis is still suspected or in high-risk groups.

### Outcome after surgical treatment of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in spontaneous intracranial hypotension-a matter of time [^111329Ub]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Of 33 patients with only partial or no symptom resolution: 9 (27.3%) reported the persistence of orthostatic headache, whereas 21 (63.6%) suffered from persistent non-orthostatic headache. Moreover, 25 (75.8%) reported persistence of accompanying complaints, with the most frequent being cephalic pressure-like sensation (24.0%), acoustic/tinnitus (20%), visual (16%), vertigo (12.0%), and back pain (12.0%).

Data pertaining to return to work was available from 63 of all patients. While 30 out of 33 (90.9%) patients with complete resolution of symptoms reported resumption of work to the full extent as before the disease, only 17 out of 30 (56.7%) patients with persistent symptoms did so (p = 0.003).

### Clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kFj1L]. JAMA Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline and was registered on PROSPERO.

- **Search strategy**: Three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched for studies on SIH or spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. The search, which had no start date limit, was most recently updated on April 30, 2020. The search terms included spontaneous intracranial hypotension, low CSF syndrome, low CSF pressure syndrome, low CSF volume syndrome, intracranial hypotension, low CSF pressure, low CSF volume, CSF hypovolemia, CSF hypovolaemia, spontaneous spinal CSF leak, spinal CSF leak, and CSF leak syndrome.

- **Selection criteria**: The studies included were (1) focused on SIH or spontaneous CSF leaks, (2) written in English, (3) original studies, and (4) reported on at least 10 patients. Studies reporting intracranial hypotension or CSF leaks secondary to other causes (traumatic or iatrogenic) were excluded. However, studies involving a mixed population of patients with spontaneous and secondary leaks were included, provided they met the inclusion criteria and allowed for clear distinction of the spontaneous CSF leak group's characteristics. Due to the comprehensive nature of the review and the large volume of articles retrieved, studies in languages other than English were excluded.

In the initial assessment of the headache patient, the emergency physician must consider several dangerous secondary causes of headache. A thorough history and physical examination, along with a comprehensive differential diagnosis, may alert the emergency physician to the diagnosis of a secondary headache, particularly when the history is accompanied by any of the following clinical features: sudden/severe onset, focal neurologic deficits, altered mental status, advanced age, active or recent pregnancy, coagulopathy, malignancy, fever, visual deficits, and/or loss of consciousness.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of suspected intracranial hypotension [^113K5nL3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, specifically concerning brain and spine imaging, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining either dynamic CT or dynamic digital subtraction myelography. This is particularly advised for adult patients with chronic daily headaches from suspected intracranial hypotension who have negative initial brain and spine imaging, but whose history and clinical examination suggest CSF leakage. CSF-venous fistulas and slow meningeal diverticular leaks are often subtle imaging findings not readily detectable using conventional imaging techniques with limited temporal resolution. Therefore, follow-up imaging with more advanced procedures may be required to identify or exclude a more subtle spinal CSF leak source.

### Experiences of discrimination across the transition to parenthood and postpartum depression severity among black women [^114WdDuJ]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In the final step, we included T−2 life stress, alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use as covariates. Model fit improved, but the results were unchanged. Among the childbearing participants, greater discrimination experiences at baseline (T−2; intercept) and increasing experiences of discrimination across the transition to parenthood (T−2 to T+1; slope) predicted higher levels of postpartum depressive symptom severity (T+1; Bᵢ ≥ .616, SE = .079, p < 0.001; Bₛ ≥ 2.29, SE = .740, p < 0.01). This is shown in Table 3. Among non-pregnant participants, greater discrimination at T−2 (intercept) predicted depressive symptom severity at T+1 (Bᵢ ≥ .905, SE = .095, p < 0.001), but changes in discrimination experiences from T−2 to T+1 were unrelated to depressive symptom severity at T+1 (Bₛ ≥ −.194, SE = 1.20, p = .871). The final conditional LGC models are depicted in Figure 1.

### Diffuse non-aneurysmal SAH in spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Sequela of ventral CSF leak [^115pDntV]. Cephalalgia (2016). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension due to a spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak has become a well-recognized cause of headaches. Recently, various unusual neurological syndromes have been described in such patients with chronic ventral CSF leaks, including superficial siderosis and an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like syndrome. The authors now report two patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension due to a chronic ventral CSF leak who suffered a diffuse non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

- **Description of cases**: A 62-year-old woman underwent uneventful microsurgical repair of a ventral thoracic CSF leak that had been present for 13 years. Seventeen months after surgery, she was found unresponsive and CT showed a diffuse intracranial SAH. Cerebral angiography and spine and brain MRI did not reveal a source of the SAH. A 73-year-old woman was found unresponsive and CT showed a diffuse intracranial SAH. Cerebral angiography and brain MRI did not reveal a source of the SAH, although superficial siderosis was detected. Spine MRI showed a ventral thoracic CSF leak that by history had been present for 41 years. She underwent uneventful microsurgical repair of the CSF leak.

- **Discussion**: The authors suggest that patients with a ventral spinal CSF leak of long duration may be at risk of diffuse non-aneurysmal SAH.

### Clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes of spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PP9dS]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a comprehensive summary of the available evidence on demographics, clinical presentation, investigation findings, and treatment outcomes in patients with SIH. This review highlighted a certain variability in the clinical presentation of SIH.

Starting with the demographic characteristics, SIH can occur at any age (range, 2–88 years) and in both sexes with a predilection for female individuals (63%). The variability of SIH is also demonstrated by the great diversity of signs and symptoms at presentation. As expected, headache is the most common symptom. However, the orthostatic headache, once believed to be an essential characteristic of SIH, is not invariably present. In this review, 8% of patients had a non-orthostatic headache and 3% did not experience headaches. These percentages are likely to be underestimations as most authors used the ICHD-2 diagnostic criteria that include the presence of orthostatic headache as an essential criterion. Therefore, a diagnosis of SIH should not be excluded based on the absence of orthostatic headache. The most recent versions of the SIH diagnostic criteria (ICHD-3 beta and ICHD-3) do not use this criterion. Consequently, future studies could clarify what the true frequency of non-orthostatic headache in SIH is.

The more detailed headache description offered by some authors demonstrated a common pattern in the SIH headache phenotype: it is frequently occipital, frontal, or diffuse. The occipital location may be one possible pointer toward this condition.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: A cause of severe acute headache [^115ymhsV]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Severe acute headache is a common presenting symptom in accident and emergency departments. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an increasingly recognized cause of these symptoms, with characteristic clinical and imaging findings. SIH is characterized by headaches that worsen on standing, low opening cerebrospinal fluid pressures during a lumbar puncture, and uniform pachymeningeal enhancement seen on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, all occurring in the absence of dural trauma. Atypical presentations can occur, and severe neurological decline can rarely be associated with this condition. A review of five patients who presented recently to our institution with classical imaging findings, along with a review of the literature, is presented.

### Genital chlamydia trachomatis: an update [^116KSji4]. The Indian Journal of Medical Research (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on *Chlamydia trachomatis* infection:

- **Definition**: *C. trachomatis* infection is a common bacterial STI characterized primarily by urethritis in males and endocervicitis in females.

- **Pathophysiology**: The obligate intracellular bacteria *C. trachomatis* is responsible for the disease and may be transmitted through oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

- **Disease course**: The most common manifestations include urethritis in men and mucopurulent cervicitis, urethritis, and endometritis in women. Disease progression may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which in pregnancy results in premature delivery and puerperal and neonatal infections.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: *C. trachomatis* infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.15–2.94).

Currently used techniques for characterization, such as grid-like parameter sampling scans, become impractical when extended to higher-dimensional input spaces, when complicated measurement constraints are present, or when prior information about the beam response is scarce. In this work, we describe an adaptation of the popular Bayesian optimization algorithm, which enables a turn-key exploration of input parameter spaces. Our algorithm replaces the need for parameter scans while minimizing prior information needed about the measurement's behavior and associated measurement constraints.

We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm autonomously conducts an adaptive, multi-parameter exploration of input parameter space, potentially orders of magnitude faster than conventional grid-like parameter scans. It performs highly constrained, single-shot beam phase-space measurements and accounts for costs associated with changing input parameters. In addition to applications in accelerator-based scientific experiments, this algorithm addresses challenges shared by many scientific disciplines and is thus applicable to autonomously conducting experiments over a broad range of research topics.

### Does this patient with headache have a migraine or need neuroimaging [^114N3xxx]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

In assessing the patient with a headache, clinicians are often faced with two important questions: Is this headache a migraine, and does this patient require neuroimaging? The diagnosis of migraine can direct therapy, and information obtained from the history and physical examination is used by physicians to determine which patients require neuroimaging.

- **Objective**: To determine the usefulness of the history and physical examination in distinguishing patients with migraine from those with other headache types and in identifying those patients who should undergo neuroimaging.

- **Data sources and study selection**: A systematic review was performed using articles from MEDLINE (1966-November 2005) that assessed the performance characteristics of screening questions in diagnosing migraine (with the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria as a gold standard) and addressed the accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting the presence of underlying intracranial pathology (with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard).

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with a third author.

- **Data synthesis**: Four studies of screening questions for migraine (n = 1745 patients) and 11 neuroimaging studies (n = 3725 patients) met inclusion criteria. All four of the migraine studies illustrated high sensitivity and specificity if three or four criteria were met. The best predictors can be summarized…

### First-line steroid treatment for spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^117QxuET]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a syndrome characterized by low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and postural headaches, affecting 1 per 20,000 individuals every year.

We report an otherwise healthy 38‐year‐old man admitted to the hospital with an orthostatic headache that developed 48 hours following a short‐haul flight during which he sustained a neck injury due to turbulence. Neurological examination, blood analysis, and computed tomography scan performed at the emergency service were normal. Brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement and contrast medium egress from the subarachnoid space into the epidural space at the level of C2. The patient was treated with bed rest, hydration, and 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone for 5 days, followed by a gradual withdrawal over the next 7 days. Complete symptomatic relief was observed after 16 days, with resolution of the pathological findings on brain and spinal MRI after 1 month, except for localized pachymeningeal enhancement. Clinical relief was maintained over time until the last follow‐up visit 9 months later.

Successful conservative treatment barely exceeds one quarter of cases of SIH. The clinical benefits of steroids may result from several mechanisms of action, such as improving brain oedema and inflammation, facilitating fluid retention, and promoting reabsorption of the CSF from the extradural space. Despite the fact that an epidural blood patch remains the most successful treatment for SIH, future studies should explore effective therapies further.

### First-line steroid treatment for spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^116EeXsx]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old male presented with an orthostatic headache that developed 48 hours following a short-haul flight during which he sustained a neck injury due to turbulence. He complained of severe headache, nausea, and photophobia, which were exacerbated by an upright position and relieved when lying down. No comorbidities were reported. The patient had a non-complicated COVID-19 infection 10 months before hospital admission. Neurological examination, blood analysis, and a computed tomography scan performed at the emergency department were normal.

Brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), after intravenous gadolinium administration, showed diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement and contrast medium egress from the subarachnoid space into the epidural space at the level of C2. The patient was treated with bed rest, hydration, and 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisone for 5 days, followed by a gradual withdrawal over the next 7 days. Complete symptomatic relief was observed after 16 days, with the resolution of the pathological findings on brain and spinal MRI after 1 month, except for localized pachymeningeal enhancement. Clinical relief has been maintained over time until the last follow-up visit 9 months later.

### Epidemiology and outcome of postural headache management in spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^116YLH5U]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a postural headache syndrome unrelated to dural puncture. Due to the apparent failure of epidural blood patch to relieve headache in spontaneous intracranial hypotension, we investigated the epidemiologic features and treatment outcomes of this condition.

- **Methods**: The clinical findings and management of 22 cases (21 published and 1 reported) of spontaneous intracranial hypotension were analyzed retrospectively. The study population was stratified by age and sex; continuous variables were compared for differences by t-tests, while categorical variables were compared by Fisher exact tests. Significant differences were identified by P-values of .05 or less.

- **Results**: The mean age of the study population was 43 ± 16 years, with a female-to-male ratio of 3.4:1.0. Females with spontaneous intracranial hypotension were younger (P = 0.050) than males. Men presented with tinnitus (P = 0.021) and visual field defects (P = 0.009) more often than women. Meningeal enhancement on contrast magnetic resonance imaging was the most consistent radiographic finding. Radionuclide cisternography showed thoracolumbar dural leaks in 7 of 9 patients. Cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was low in all patients (33.13 ± 31.02 mm H₂O). Epidural blood patch was performed in 8 patients, repeated in 3 patients, failed in 3 patients, and offered only transient improvement in 5 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension was more common in women than men, was not uniformly responsive to epidural blood patch, and had significant comorbidities.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^113f3sQD]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

We aimed to create a multidisciplinary consensus clinical guideline for best practice in the diagnosis, investigation, and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) due to cerebrospinal fluid leak based on evidence and consensus from a multidisciplinary specialist interest group (SIG).

- **Methods**: A 29-member SIG was established, with members from neurology, neuroradiology, anaesthetics, neurosurgery, and patient representatives. The scope and purpose of the guideline were agreed upon by the SIG by consensus. The SIG then developed guideline statements for a series of question topics using a modified Delphi process. This process was supported by a systematic literature review, surveys of patients and healthcare professionals, and review by several international experts on SIH.

- **Results**: SIH and its differential diagnoses should be considered in any patient presenting with orthostatic headache. First-line imaging should be MRI of the brain with contrast and the whole spine. First-line treatment is a non-targeted epidural blood patch (EBP), which should be performed as early as possible. We provide criteria for performing myelography depending on the spine MRI result and response to EBP, and we outline principles of treatments. Recommendations for conservative management, symptomatic treatment of headache, and management of complications of SIH are also provided.

- **Conclusions**: This multidisciplinary consensus clinical guideline has the potential to increase awareness of SIH among healthcare professionals, produce greater consistency in care, and improve diagnosis and management.

### Management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension - Transorbital ultrasound as discriminator [^114bgbmD]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an increasingly recognized syndrome characterized by the hallmark of orthostatic headache (OH). The pathophysiology suggests a spontaneous leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a spinal meningeal fistula. Diagnosis of SIH remains challenging as the criteria of the International Headache Society are evolving. A simple, cost-effective, non-invasive, and repeatable diagnostic tool that aids in diagnosis, follow-up, and understanding of the pathophysiology of SIH would be useful.

High-resolution transorbital sonography of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is increasingly used for the assessment of raised intracranial pressure. Sonographic measurements showing increased ONSD in patients with raised intracerebral pressure (ICP) were confirmed using high-resolution MRI. Literature on ultrasound diagnostics in patients with SIH is sparse and consists only of a case study and an investigation in 10 patients on the effect of an epidural blood patch on ONSD and ophthalmic venous flow. Up to now, all measurements reported in the literature were performed only with patients lying supine, and no measurements were made following a change to the upright position.

Based on pathophysiological considerations, we hypothesized that there is a change in ONSD from the supine to the upright position and that this change should be more pronounced in patients with acute OHs.

In the study, we evaluated the diagnostic value of ONSD by performing two high-resolution orbital ultrasound assessments, in both supine and upright positions, across three groups.

### Targeted epidural patch with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) through a single catheter access site for treatment of a cerebral spinal fluid leak causing spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^116Ao7n3]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) usually occurs due to a spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak. In this report, we describe the first case of SIH caused by a CSF leak, which improved following a targeted epidural patch with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA) at the right T1-T2 level.

An 81-year-old woman presented with an orthostatic headache for six days. MRI of the brain with contrast demonstrated low-lying cerebellar tonsils, an engorged transverse sinus flow void, bifrontal small subdural fluid collections, and diffuse dural enhancement. CT myelography revealed extravasation of intrathecal contrast at the right T1-T2 level. A targeted epidural patch was performed by injecting n-BCA through a catheter at the right T1-T2 level. Following the treatment, the patient's symptoms improved immediately, and she was without a headache at the 1-year follow-up.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, particularly with respect to the noninvasive assessment of fibrosis, the EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend considering the sequential assessment with noninvasive tools. This approach assists in excluding fibrosis progression in adult patients with MASLD.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Searching for the CSF leak [^113XC1WL]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is caused by the loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the level of the spine. The most frequent symptom of this disorder is orthostatic headache, characterized by worsening pain in the upright position and relief after lying down. Neuroimaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring spontaneous intracranial hypotension because it provides objective, albeit often subtle, data despite the variable clinical syndromes and normal lumbar puncture opening pressure associated with this disorder.

- **Spine imaging**: Aims to classify and localize the site of CSF leakage as either (1) a ventral dural leak, (2) a leaking spinal nerve root diverticulum, or (3) a direct CSF-venous fistula.

Searching for a CSF leak can be very difficult; the entire spine must be scrutinized for a dural breach, often the size of a pin. Precisely locating the site of CSF leakage is fundamental to successful treatment, which may include a targeted epidural patch and surgical closure when conservative measures do not provide long-term relief. Increased awareness of spontaneous intracranial hypotension among clinicians underscores the need for dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.

### Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Case report and relevant review of the literature [^1124YUDa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a well-defined clinical entity that is frequently misdiagnosed because little information regarding this type of headache exists in the emergency medicine literature. This report presents a case and relevant review of the literature on SIH. An understanding of the characteristic symptomatology, appropriate evaluation, treatment options, and prognosis is essential if the emergency physician is to provide the most appropriate care to these patients.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^113VuDhn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), specifically in the context of headache management, the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines emphasize focusing primarily on managing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak for headache treatment in SIH, alongside the best symptomatic management. It is crucial to provide appropriate pain relief as part of the symptomatic management.

- **Pain relief**: Consider prescribing acetaminophen and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Opioids may be considered to provide adequate pain relief; however, it is advised to avoid their use in the routine long-term management of headaches in SIH.

### An overview of survey research [^116pP54i]. Respiratory Care (2023). Low credibility.

Surveys provide evidence for the social sciences regarding knowledge, attitudes, and other behaviors, and in health care, they quantify qualitative research and assist in policymaking. A survey-designed research project involves asking questions of individuals. From the responses, the researcher can generalize findings from a sample of respondents to a population. Therefore, this overview can serve as a guide to conducting survey research that can provide answers for practitioners, educators, and leaders, but only if the right questions and methods are used. The main advantage of using surveys is their economical access to participants online. A major disadvantage of survey research is the low response rates in most situations. Online surveys have many limitations that should be addressed before conducting a survey and then described after the survey is complete. Any conclusions and recommendations must be supported by evidence in a clear and objective manner. Presenting evidence in a structured format is crucial, but well-developed reporting guidelines are needed for researchers who conduct survey research.

### Intracranial hypotension induced by cervical spine chiropractic manipulation [^111TZXpX]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case of intracranial hypotension ensuing following a spinal chiropractic manipulation, leading to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isodense effusion in the upper cervical and thoracic spine. The etiology of intracranial hypotension is not fully understood, but CSF leakage from spinal meningeal diverticula or dural tears may be involved.

A 36-year-old woman presented with neck and bilateral shoulder pain 4 days earlier. She underwent a spinal chiropractic manipulation and subsequently complained of a throbbing headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Her headache worsened, with lying down providing only limited relief. A CSF study indicated dry tapping, while a brain MRI showed pachymeningeal gadolinium enhancement. Thoracic spine MRI revealed CSF leakage. Despite being treated with hydration and pain control in the hospital over several days, her headache persisted.

She was eventually treated with an epidural blood patch, which resulted in an improvement of her headache. This is the first case of spontaneous intracranial hypotension in Korea where spinal chiropractic manipulation coincided with the development of symptoms and where CSF collection in the upper cervical and thoracic spine was demonstrated radiographically.

From this case, we gain an understanding of the etiology of intracranial hypotension and consider the complications associated with chiropractic manipulation.
