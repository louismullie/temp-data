## Question

A 10-year-old girl presents with progressive proximal muscle weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and a heliotrope rash. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated muscle enzymes. She is diagnosed with juvenile dermatomyositis. As part of her initial evaluation, her pediatric rheumatologist is considering which assessments and screenings to perform.

Based on current guideline recommendations, which of the following should NOT be routinely performed as part of the initial evaluation for this patient: (A) Assessment for calcinosis, (B) Screening for connective tissue disease overlap, (C) Routine malignancy screening, (D) Assessment of cardiovascular risk factors? Justify your answer according to the guideline.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which initial evaluation element should NOT be routinely performed in a 10-year-old with newly diagnosed juvenile dermatomyositis, choosing among assessment for calcinosis, screening for connective tissue disease overlap, routine malignancy screening, and assessment of cardiovascular risk factors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline source and its pediatric-specific recommendations. Then, I should verify each option against that guideline. Next, I will consider disease-specific pediatric nuances that might change practice. Finally, I will synthesize and confirm the correct answer with direct citations.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative source. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) 2022 guideline on idiopathic inflammatory myopathies is the most comprehensive, pediatric-specific, and high-credibility source for this question, and I should anchor my reasoning to it before considering lower-level evidence or adult-focused guidance [^b4206e8a].

> Now, I will examine calcinosis assessment. Wait, let me verify the exact wording. The BSR explicitly recommends assessing patients with juvenile-onset IIM for calcinosis, and it is a pediatric-specific priority given the higher prevalence in children than adults; thus, assessment for calcinosis should be performed, not avoided, in the initial evaluation [^5f2a46be] [^58254ac7].

> Next, I should review screening for connective tissue disease overlap. Hold on, I should verify whether this is recommended routinely. The BSR advises looking for signs of connective tissue disease overlap in juvenile-onset IIM because overlap is associated with increased mortality; therefore, screening for overlap features is part of routine initial assessment in pediatrics, not something to omit [^45c56674] [^58254ac7].

> I will now examine cardiovascular risk assessment. Let me think about the scope. The BSR recommends assessing and managing cardiovascular risk factors in children with juvenile-onset IIM, and it also advises considering ECG and echocardiography to screen for cardiac involvement; this aligns with pediatric cardiology prevention principles, so cardiovascular risk assessment is appropriate in the initial workup [^238c6821] [^005cf440] [^a6a780c6].

> But wait, what about malignancy screening? I need to check the pediatric-specific guidance carefully. The BSR explicitly states that routine malignancy screening should not be obtained in patients with juvenile-onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, reflecting the lack of association between juvenile IIM and cancer; instead, malignancy workup should be reserved for atypical features or high-risk scenarios, not performed routinely at diagnosis [^b4206e8a] [^6259b783].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if adult dermatomyositis guidance might justify routine cancer screening in children, but that would be a mistake. Adult dermatomyositis carries a recognized malignancy risk and warrants age-appropriate cancer screening, whereas juvenile dermatomyositis does not; conflating adult and pediatric recommendations would lead to unnecessary testing in children, so I should correct that line of thinking and adhere to the pediatric-specific BSR guidance [^5812450e] [^b4206e8a].

> Putting this together, the element that should NOT be routinely performed in a 10-year-old with new JDM is routine malignancy screening, whereas assessment for calcinosis, screening for connective tissue disease overlap, and assessment of cardiovascular risk factors are all recommended parts of the initial evaluation per BSR 2022 [^b4206e8a] [^5f2a46be] [^45c56674] [^238c6821].

---

The correct answer is **C. Routine malignancy screening**. Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is not associated with increased malignancy risk, and current guidelines recommend against routine malignancy screening in children with JDM [^b4206e8a] [^6259b783]. Instead, malignancy workup is reserved for atypical presentations or red flags (e.g. older age, dysphagia, cutaneous necrosis, refractory disease, or specific autoantibodies) [^aebbaf0c]. In contrast, assessment for calcinosis [^5f2a46be], screening for connective tissue disease overlap [^45c56674], and cardiovascular risk assessment [^238c6821] are all recommended parts of the initial evaluation in JDM.

---

## Rationale for not performing routine malignancy screening

- **Lack of association**: JDM is not associated with increased malignancy risk, unlike adult dermatomyositis [^6259b783] [^5812450e].
- **Guideline recommendation**: The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) explicitly advises against routine malignancy screening in pediatric patients with JDM [^b4206e8a].
- **Reserved for select cases**: Malignancy workup is only considered if atypical features or red flags are present, such as older age at onset, dysphagia, cutaneous necrosis, refractory disease, or specific autoantibodies (e.g. anti-TIF1-gamma or anti-NXP2) [^aebbaf0c].

---

## Recommended initial evaluations for juvenile dermatomyositis

According to current guidelines, the following evaluations are recommended as part of the initial assessment for JDM:

| **Evaluation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Assessment for calcinosis | - Common complication in JDM [^5f2a46be] <br/> - Associated with significant morbidity [^58254ac7] <br/> - Early detection and management are essential [^b69cef28] |
| Screening for connective tissue disease overlap | - Overlap syndromes are associated with increased mortality [^45c56674] <br/> - Early identification is critical for management [^58254ac7] |
| Assessment of cardiovascular risk factors | - Cardiac involvement, though often silent, can occur in JDM [^3577122d] <br/> - Early detection and management of cardiovascular risk factors are recommended [^238c6821] [^005cf440] |

---

## Conclusion

Routine malignancy screening is **not recommended** for children with JDM because there is no increased malignancy risk. Instead, evaluations should focus on calcinosis, connective tissue disease overlap, and cardiovascular risk factors, which are integral to optimal management and prognosis [^b4206e8a].

(v) What key prognostic and management factors should be considered for children with IIM?

1 - Paediatric-specific. Juvenile-onset IIM should be managed by paediatric specialists as it differs from adult-onset IIM in several ways, including greater presence of subcutaneous calcification, less disease damage, lack of association with cancer, increased risk of vasculitis, and different autoantibody associations (1, C, 95%).

2 - Paediatric-specific. Shorter time to diagnosis is associated with improved disease outcome, therefore early referral to a specialist service is to be considered (2, C, 100%).

3 - Paediatric-specific. Age-specific considerations should be taken into account when using tools that measure muscle strength, function, and quality of life (1, B, 100%).

4 - Paediatric-specific. Healthcare professionals should look for signs of connective tissue disease overlap, which is associated with increased risk of mortality (1, C, 89%).

5 - Paediatric-specific. Patients with juvenile-onset IIM should be assessed for calcinosis (1, C, 100%).

Age appropriate tools such as the Childhood Myositis Assessment Score, Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, and Juvenile Dermatomyositis Multidimensional Assessment Report should be used to assess muscle strength, function, and quality of life. There is significantly higher mortality in patients with overlapping connective tissue disease features compared with those with JDM. Patients should therefore be carefully screened for overlapping connective tissue disease features and wider organ involvement.

Factors associated with increased risk of calcinosis include younger age at disease onset, particularly disease onset in infancy, delay to diagnosis or delay to treatment initiation, more severe disease, prolonged disease duration, and presence of anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP2) autoantibodies. Clinical examination and plain X-ray radiography can be used to identify calcinosis.

(vi) Is autoantibody testing useful in people with IIM?

1 -Patients should be tested for myositis auto-antibodies (1, B, 100%).

Myositis-specific antibodies and myositis-associated autoantibodies can facilitate diagnosis, inform disease phenotype and prognosis, and may help tailor treatment. Interpretation of immunoblot results should be carried out in the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation. Autoantibody titres should not be used to monitor disease activity.

Discussion

We present a set of consensus clinical treatment plans (CTPs) for children with JDM who have typical skin rashes but no significant muscle weakness, which we call skin predominant JDM.

Skin disease as a component of JDM is important since it reflects disease activity and may contribute to morbidity, including physical disfigurement, calcinosis and lipodystophy. Skin disease is a manifestation of active vasculopathy in JDM that is important to monitor and treat. It has been reported that early severe skin disease activity in JDM may predict cardiac dysfunction better than muscle disease, and persistently active skin disease at 3 and 6 months after diagnosis is predictive of continued active disease. These data support the importance of adequate treatment of JDM-related skin disease, since it may predict worse outcomes. There is limited knowledge of patients with skin predominant JDM and optimal treatment approaches, and studying this rare condition using traditional clinical trials is not possible.

Introduction

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that have in common a chronic autoimmune inflammatory process affecting variably muscle, skin and internal organs. The childhood IIMs include JDM, juvenile PM (JPM) and other, less common, disorders. The incidence of JDM is ∼2–3/millions/year, with some differences between the ethnic groups. The rarity of these conditions means that very few single centres have sufficient patient numbers to adequately power the studies of disease complications, outcomes or response to treatment.

The clinical manifestations of the IIMs differ between children and adults, and the various disease types occur with differing frequencies. In childhood, DM occurs far more frequently than PM, whereas in adults the ratio is more equal. Other forms of myositis, such as IBM, are very rare in the paediatric population. Severe complications of DM, such as vasculopathic ulceration and calcinosis, are more common in juvenile than adult-onset disease, and overlap syndromes with features of other connective tissue disorders occur more commonly.

1. The eyelids and cheeks are erythematous in a butterfly pattern. Figure 2. Typical Gottron papules are present over the knuckles. Figure 3. Periungual telangiectasia, typical of dermatomyositis, are visible without magnification. Juvenile dermatomyositis, an inflammatory illness of unknown cause, primarily affects skin, muscle, and blood vessels. Affected children typically have characteristic skin lesions and muscle weakness. Characteristic dermatologic findings include periorbital and facial erythema often with edema; hyperkeratotic, red-to-pink papules over the knuckles of the hands, known as Gottron papules; and periungual telangiectasia, best seen with the aid of an ophthalmoscope or other form of magnification. The skin often demonstrates photosensitivity with the facial rash resembling a persistent sunburn.

The butterfly pattern of the facial erythema may be mistaken for the malar blush of systemic lupus erythematosus. Amyopathic dermatomyositis is characterized by typical cutaneous features of dermatomyositis in the absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of muscle disease. There is disagreement whether a diagnosis of dermatomyositis can be made without evidence of muscle involvement. 1 Most cases of amyopathic dermatomyositis reported in the literature have been in adults. A review of published studies of patients with dermatomyositis reported that 2% to 11% of patients had this form of the disease. 2 A review of 50 patients with dermatomyositis, aged 2 to 83 years at diagnosis, revealed that the onset of cutaneous lesions ranged from 51 months before to 14 months after muscle weakness onset. 3 Skin involvement was the initial feature in 56% of these patients while only 16% presented with muscle weakness.

Of additional interest, 12% of this group had had cutaneous lesions for longer than 1. 75 years before the onset of muscle weakness, but eventually, all developed evidence of myositis.
3. In another review of patients with dermatomyositis, 6 of 54 met the criteria for the diagnosis of the amyotrophic variety of the disease. 1 The mean duration of skin disease without muscle involvement was 3. 8 years. Five of 6 patients were adults, and all were treated with high-dose steroids. None developed evidence of myositis. The single child in the series, aged 6 years, did not receive steroid therapy and developed evidence of myositis 3 years after the onset of skin disease. In a prospective study of 13 patients with clinicopathologic features of dermatomyositis and normal muscle enzyme serum levels, 4 had no signs of myositis either clinically, by electromyography, or by muscle biopsy after 4 to 11 years of follow-up.

4 Two patients in this series were children aged 7 and 14 years. Both developed clinical myositis, one 3 years and the other 6 months after the onset of cutaneous changes. In a series of children presenting with characteristic cutaneous findings of dermatomyositis without initial symptoms of muscle disease for at least 6 months, all 5 developed myositis as evidenced by clinical weakness, elevations in serum muscle enzymes, and characteristic findings on electromyography and/or muscle biopsy in the subsequent 6 to 24 months. 5 All of the children received an aggressive regimen of pulse, intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. None developed cutaneous calcifications, a complication reported in a much larger percentage of children who had rash preceding muscle involvement by more than 1 year. 3.

Main text

Search strategy

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in July 2024 via MEDLINE/PubMed using the following keywords and their Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms: "juvenile dermatomyositis", "dermatomyositis", "calcinosis", "radiograph", "computed tomography", "magnetic resonance imaging", and "ultrasound". Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used appropriately for each imaging modality. The search was performed in July 2024 and covered the period 1967–2024. Clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports reporting use of imaging modality in assessment of DM or JDM-associated calcinosis were included in the review process. There were over 250 articles initially reviewed, of which those that are not in English or not providing description of the imaging modalities were excluded. Ultimately, 56 articles were selected for this narrative review.

X-ray

X-ray is a widely used imaging modality to diagnose calcifications in autoimmune connective tissue diseases such as IIM or scleroderma. X-ray became a modality to diagnose and monitor calcinosis as clinicians recognized the need to detect subcutaneous and intramuscular calcinosis, often missed on physical exam (Fig. 1). In a retrospective study reviewing 29 JDM related calcinosis cases from 1950–1977, serial radiographs at 1–4-year intervals were able to follow the regression of the subcutaneous calcification in 8 out of 11 children and progression of calcinosis in one child. In another study with 17 patients with dermatomyositis and JDM, radiography was found to be very sensitive and was able to detect calcinosis in all patients.

### Cardiac evaluation of patients with juvenile dermatomyositis [^da64b3aa]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Juvenile dermatomyositis is a multisystemic disease characterized by diffuse inflammation of skin and muscles. Cardiac involvement may occur in the course of the disease, however, remains unrecognized due to the lack of overt clinical manifestations in childhood. When considering that long-term cardiovascular complications seen in patients with JDM have significant effects on morbidity and mortality, early detection of cardiac involvement by cardiac MRI and aggressive treatment of these patients may improve the long-term prognosis of patients with JDM.

### Cardiac findings in children with juvenile dermatomyositis at disease presentation [^6e3f66cc]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, children with new onset JDM have a high frequency of cardiac abnormalities, mostly minor, as determined by ECG and echocardiography. We recommend that a cardiac workup should be considered in the initial workup for every suspected JDM patient.

### Juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^f69c6dcc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIM) are a group of rare, chronic, autoimmune illnesses that affect muscle and, to a lesser extent, skin. The presence of new-onset weakness and, in juvenile dermatomyositis, typical rahes, should lead to consideration of these diagnoses. Careful evaluation to exclude alternative diagnoses is needed. Investigations include a variety of blood tests, imaging, and possibly muscle biopsy. Validated clinical assessments are available for monitoring. Standard treatment includes corticosteroids and methotrexate and often extends beyond 1 year. Outcomes are generally good, but disease persistence remains problematic. Early involvement of providers with expertise in JIIM is essential.

### Childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance consensus clinical treatment plans for juvenile dermatomyositis with skin predominant disease [^a8b72d94]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is the most common form of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in children but is relatively rare, affecting about 1–3 per 1 million children annually in the United States. It is a diffuse vasculopathy with inflammation in skin and muscle, typically associated with weakness and physical limitations.

Classic cutaneous manifestations which are pathognomonic for the diagnosis of JDM include Gottron's papules and heliotrope rash. Malar rash and nailbed capillary changes are also frequently present. JDM patients typically have proximal muscle weakness, but a subset of patients present with skin disease without any significant weakness or muscle inflammation.

General designations for this subset of JDM patients have included: amyopathic dermatomyositis (DM), clinically amyopathic DM, DM sine myositis, and hypomyopathic DM, among others. These generally have intended to describe the subset of DM patients with typical skin disease of DM but without clinically significant weakness. For this publication, we will use the term skin predominant JDM to describe the patient subtype under consideration.

The epidemiology, treatment and outcomes of skin predominant JDM are not well studied. The largest series of clinically amyopathic JDM patients published included 68 cases, of which about 25% progressed to classical JDM. Few patients with clinically amyopathic JDM in this series developed disease-related complications: only 4% developed calcinosis and no patients developed vasculopathy, interstitial lung disease or malignancy.

The best treatments for JDM and skin predominant JDM are not known, and treatments used are extremely variable. Proposed therapy of skin predominant JDM includes recommendations for topical and systemic therapies, without trial data or case experiences to support these approaches.

Presently available retrospective studies in JDM are limited by small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and lack of generalizability. Efforts to conduct a traditional randomized controlled trial to conclusively evaluate the best treatment of skin predominant JDM are associated with many challenges. First, the rarity of skin predominant JDM, which is a subset of an already uncommon condition, limits its successful study due to the inability to accrue sufficient numbers of patients from a reasonable number of sites, over a practical time period. In addition, there are significant cost and logistic issues involved in conducting traditional clinical trials in this uncommon condition.

### Mixed connective tissue disease: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^2efd44b9]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a complex overlap disease with features of different autoimmune connective tissue diseases (CTDs) namely systemic sclerosis, poly/dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematous in patients with antibodies targeting the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle. In this narrative review, we summarise the results of a systematic literature research which was performed as part of the European Reference Network on Rare and Complex Connective Tissue and Musculoskeletal Diseases project, aimed at evaluating existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) or recommendations. Since no specific CPGs on MCTD were found, other CPGs developed for other CTDs were taken into consideration in order to discuss what can be applied to MCTD even if designed for other diseases. Three major objectives were proposed for the future development of CPGs: MCTD diagnosis (diagnostic criteria), MCTD initial and follow-up evaluations, MCTD treatment. Early diagnosis, epidemiological data, assessment of burden of disease and QOL aspects are among the unmet needs identified by patients.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for dermatomyositis and polymyositis, more specifically with respect to surveillance for malignancy, BSR 2022 guidelines recommend to take into account the risk of cancer in all patients and consider screening particularly in patients with the following risk factors:

- older age at onset

- male gender

- dysphagia

- cutaneous necrosis

- resistance to immunosuppressive therapy

- rapid disease onset

- positive anti-TIF-1-gamma autoantibodies

- positive anti-nuclear matrix protein-2 autoantibodies

- negative for known myositis-specific autoantibodies.

### Expert perspective: diagnostic approach to differentiating juvenile dermatomyositis from muscular dystrophy [^4eb986df]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The current classification criteria used for JM are the 2017 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for adult and juvenile IIM. These criteria are composed of a weighted point system for clinical variables, including age at onset, patterns of muscle weakness, skin manifestations, laboratory test findings, and muscle biopsy features; the resultant score leads to a predictive probability of whether or not the patient has IIM. With characteristic rash and muscle findings, one can fairly confidently reach a diagnosis of juvenile IIM; indeed, 97% of patients with JDM were correctly classified without a muscle biopsy. Without a rash, however, biopsy is usually required to fulfill the points for definite IIM. The criteria were developed to include juvenile IIM and so may be used in pediatric patients. For juvenile IIM, though, the criteria only distinguish between (1) JDM and (2) JM other than JDM, because there were too few pediatric patients in the latter category to further delineate their JM classification subgroup. This classification system is an update from the 1975 Bohan and Peter diagnostic criteriaand allows more flexibility in JDM classification for patients with variable phenotypes and who have not had muscle biopsy or electromyography performed.

The myositis community is currently working to update the IIM classification criteria to include further differentiation of IIM subtypes in children, such as antisynthetase syndrome and immune‐mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and to include additional clinical variables with diagnostic utility. An international survey of JDM specialists in 2006 identified additional findings that could be helpful in diagnosis and included muscle MRI and ultrasound scans, NFC abnormalities, calcinosis, and dysphonia. The 2012 Single Hub and Access point for Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) initiative, an evidence‐based guideline out of Europe, also developed 33 diagnostic recommendations for JDM and provided strength‐of‐evidence support for each, including a recommendation that muscle biopsy be performed in patients with JDM who are atypical or lacking classic rash, which was a recommendation based on expert opinion, as were the majority of recommendations.

### Characteristics and outcome of children with juvenile dermatomyositis in cape town: a cross-sectional study [^3a86a860]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is an immune mediated vasculopathic disease of childhood characterized by inflammation of the striated muscles, skin and internal organs. The most common clinical manifestations are proximal muscle weakness and characteristic cutaneous lesions such as heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules and calcinosis. However, disease manifestations may occur in the lungs, heart, gastrointestinal tract and other organs. The pathogenesis of JDM is not fully understood but environmental factors are thought to trigger the disease in genetically predisposed children.

JDM is most commonly diagnosed and classified using the Bohan and Peter criteria published in 1975. The criteria include presence of characteristic rashes with any of symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, elevated serum muscle enzymes, electromyographic changes and features of inflammatory myositis on muscle biopsy. The presence of the skin manifestations together with two of the other features is required for classification of a patient as having probable JDM. The characteristic skin lesions may also occur without apparent muscle involvement and is referred to as amyopathic dermatomyositis.

Data from multicenter patient registries indicate that the average age of onset of JDM is seven years with greater incidence in girls than boys (ratio of 2:1). However, regional differences exist and studies from India and Saudi Arabia have reported higher incidence rates in male children. JDM occurs in all regions of the world though some studies suggest that there could be differences in incidence rates among different racial groups. Mendez et al. reported a lower incidence rate among children of Hispanic ancestry compared to those of African and Caucasian ancestry in the USA. Racial differences have also been noted in the incidence rates of certain disease manifestations with much higher incidence of calcinosis being reported among children of African ancestry compared to other racial groups.

The treatment outcome of JDM has improved over the years with the mortality rate falling significantly from more than 30% before routine use of steroids, to less than 5% in most recent studies. Despite the improvement in mortality rates among JDM patients, disease and treatment related damage remains a major challenge and significantly affect the quality of life of affected individuals. However, data on the characteristics and treatment outcome of JDM patients from Africa is scarce and only one study has been published that specifically described a series of JDM patients from the continent. In that study, a higher rate of calcinosis and vasculitis compared to that from other regions was reported suggesting that the clinical manifestations and outcome of JDM in African patients could be different.

### Protocols for the initial treatment of moderately severe juvenile dermatomyositis: results of a children's arthritis and rheumatology research alliance consensus conference [^bd7ff24f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To use juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) survey data and expert opinion to develop a small number of consensus treatment protocols, which reflect current initial treatment of moderately severe juvenile DM.

Methods

A consensus meeting was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on December 1–2, 2007. Nominal group technique was used to achieve consensus on treatment protocols, which represented typical management of moderately severe juvenile DM. Consensus was also reached as to which patients these protocols would be applicable (inclusion and exclusion criteria), which initial investigations should be done prior to initiating one of these protocols, which data should be collected to evaluate these protocols, and the concomitant interventions required or recommended.

Results

Three protocols that described the first 2 months of treatment were developed. All protocols included corticosteroids and methotrexate. One protocol also included intravenous gamma globulin. Consensus was achieved for all issues that were addressed by conference participants, although there were some areas of controversy.

Conclusion

Despite considerable variation in clinical practice, it is possible to achieve consensus on the initial treatment of juvenile DM. Once these protocols are extended beyond 2 months, these protocols will be available for clinical use. By using methods that account for differences between patients (confounding by indication), the comparative effectiveness of the protocols will be evaluated. In the future, the goal will be to identify the optimal treatment of moderately severe juvenile DM.

### A Brazilian registry of juvenile dermatomyositis: onset features and classification of 189 cases [^5349fe69]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe onset features, classification and treatment of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and juvenile polymyositis (JPM) from a multicentre registry.

Methods

Inclusion criteria were onset age lower than 18 years and a diagnosis of any idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) by attending physician. Bohan & Peter (1975) criteria categorisation was established by a scoring algorithm to define JDM and JPM based on clinical protocol data.

Results

Of the 189 cases included, 178 were classified as JDM, 9 as JPM (19.8: 1) and 2 did not fit the criteria; 6.9% had features of chronic arthritis and connective tissue disease overlap. Diagnosis classification agreement occurred in 66.1%. Median onset age was 7 years, median follow-up duration was 3.6 years. Malignancy was described in 2 (1.1%) cases. Muscle weakness occurred in 95.8%; heliotrope rash 83.5%; Gottron plaques 83.1%; 92% had at least one abnormal muscle enzyme result. Muscle biopsy performed in 74.6% was abnormal in 91.5% and electromyogram performed in 39.2% resulted abnormal in 93.2%. Logistic regression analysis was done in 66 cases with all parameters assessed and only aldolase resulted significant, as independent variable for definite JDM (OR = 5.4, 95%CI 1.2–24.4, p = 0.03). Regarding treatment, 97.9% received steroids; 72% had in addition at least one: methotrexate (75.7%), hydroxychloroquine (64.7%), cyclosporine A (20.6%), IV immunoglobulin (20.6%), azathioprine (10.3%) or cyclophosphamide (9.6%). In this series 24.3% developed calcinosis and mortality rate was 4.2%.

Conclusion

Evaluation of predefined criteria set for a valid diagnosis indicated aldolase as the most important parameter associated with definite JDM category. In practice, prednisone-methotrexate combination was the most indicated treatment.

Juvenile onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) has many similarities and distinct differences from adult-onset disease. This review will focus on recent developments in understanding and treatment of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), the most common disease sub-type of IIM in childhood. JDM is a systemic immune mediated vasculopathy, increasingly recognised as a group of distinct phenotypes with variable presentation and outlook. This overview will describe long-term outlook and disease course including health-related quality of life and emerging treatments.

### Childhood dermatomyositis and polymyositis… [^be608d21]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Childhood dermatomyositis has been recognized as a clinicopathologic entity for approximately two decades. Polymyositis in the pediatric age group, as in adults, is not a singly defined entity, as it may occur with or without evidence of one of the collagen vascular diseases. Because of overlap of some features of both disorders the terms "polymyositis" and "polymyositis — dermatomyositis Complex" have sometimes been used to include both of these disorders. INCIDENCE Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are uncommon disorders; even in a referral center, there may be only two or three cases seen per year. The limited number of epidemiologic studies have included both adults and children and have combined several types of inflammatory myopathy. By this imperfect method, the annual incidence of new cases has varied from 1 to 7. 7 per million persons. There is an increased incidence in the second and seventh decades of life, with a lower incidence in the third decade.

Most reports of dermatomyositis have shown a preponderance of girls. Onset most commonly occurs at school age, but children in their second year of life have been affected. PATHOGENESIS. Studies of muscle biopsies from patients with juvenile dermatomyositis have demonstrated that the basic lesion involves the endothelial cells of intramuscular capillaries, arterioles, and veins.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis in South African children is characterised by frequent dystropic calcification: a cross sectional study [^76775e63]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Results

All the patients were Black Africans and, as shown in Table 1, more than 75% of the 21 patients were female. The mean age at presentation was just under 10 years with a mean follow-up period of 31.6 months. At presentation, the commonest features were skin rashes (Gottron's papules, heliotrope or malar rash or a combination thereof) in 90%, and proximal muscle weakness and arthritis each in 48% of patients. Although 10% of children were not described to have typical rashes at presentation, these were identified during the follow-up course.

Table 1
Demographic and clinical features of South African children with dermatomyositis

As shown in Table 2, patients with global weakness were younger (p = 0.04), had higher baseline acute phase responses, CRP (p = 0.03) and ESR (p = 0.007). Joint Contractures (defined as limited range of movement,) occurred in 8 patients, were associated with a younger age of disease onset (p = 0.003) and higher baseline acute phase responses: CRP (p = 0.01) and ESR (p = 0.04). Two of the 5 patients with global weakness had associated dysphagia necessitating naso-gastric tube feeding, 1 of whom was also in congestive cardiac failure.

Table 2
Clinico-laboratory correlates

A third of the patients had calcinosis at presentation and a further 38% developed this complication during the follow-up period. The subtypes of calcinosis were superficial nodules in 4 (26.6%), deep muscle tumoural calcification in 5, (33.3%), and mixed calcification types in the remaining 6 (40%) including along fascial planes and exoskeleton formation. The mean duration of symptoms of disease prior to presentation in patients with calcinosis (as described by their care-givers) was 9.2, (9.4) months compared to those who did not develop calcinosis at 4.5 months. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.24).

### Clinical features and outcomes of juvenile dermatomyositis and other childhood onset myositis syndromes [^4d120f3d]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The childhood myositis syndromes, primarily JDM, are relatively homogeneous diseases that have a good outcome in most cases, but are chronic, with poor outcomes, in a substantial number of cases. Because of the rarity of childhood myositis, and because there has not yet been a unified evidence-based approach to therapy, optimal treatment remains unknown. In clinic-based series the disease seems to be homogeneous but there are patients with rare clinical features, (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, and neurologic disease), that impact prognosis. Racial, genetic, and other factors may lead to geographic variations in clinical presentations and outcomes, and perhaps further exploration of these influences will lead to a better understanding of the clinical features and outcomes seen in children. Our treatments are based on accumulated experience, but proper clinical trials have not been done. Ongoing registry studies, development of validated activity and damage assessment tools, large clinical trials, and continued investigation into the pathogenesis of the childhood myositis syndromes should lead to improved understanding and better treatments.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis in South African children is characterised by frequent dystropic calcification: a cross sectional study [^a04c9fa0]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

African children and adults with JDM have been described in the context of connective diseases; however, we believe this is the first series of JDM in African children. The typical features of JDM were proximal muscle weakness and characteristic rashes, including vasculitic ulcers, presenting either catastrophically or with slowly progressive symptoms. Other features particularly present in our series included other musculoskeletal features such as arthritis, pulmonary disease, and calcinosis. Even if weakness is not a presenting complaint, in 95% of cases it will be present on objective testing. In this series of African children, 24% of children presented with global rather than proximal weakness. These children were younger at presentation with significantly higher ESR and CRP values and were more likely to develop contractures. This global weakness most likely represents severity in these young patients.

### Plain radiography is effective for the detection of calcinosis cutis occurring in association with autoimmune connective tissue disease [^4b1254e6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Studies on the radiological findings of calcinosis cutis in patients with autoimmune connective tissue disease (ACTD) are limited.

Objectives

To describe imaging findings and radiological patterns of calcinosis cutis occurring with ACTD.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 37 patients with imaging studies assessing for calcinosis cutis associated with ACTD at our institution between 1996 and 2009. A formal blinded review of available images (i.e. radiographs, computed tomography scans) for all 37 patients was performed by radiologists.

Results

Of 37 patients, 30 (81%) were female. The mean age at diagnosis of calcinosis cutis was 43.4 years. Patients had the following ACTDs: dermatomyositis (n = 17) with classic (n = 9), juvenile (n = 7) and amyopathic (n = 1) subtypes; systemic sclerosis with limited cutaneous scleroderma (n = 8); undifferentiated connective tissue disease (n = 4); mixed connective tissue disease (n = 3); systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 2); lupus panniculitis (n = 1); overlap connective tissue disease (n = 1); and polymyositis (n = 1). Plain radiographs detected calcinosis in all 37 patients; a nodular pattern of calcification was most commonly observed (31/37; 84%). Two or more morphological patterns of calcification were present in 19 patients (51%). In general, individual patterns were not specific to a particular ACTD subtype.

Conclusions

Radiography detected calcinosis in all patients and is recommended for initial imaging of calcinosis. Multiple morphological patterns of calcification were observed across ACTD subtypes. Further studies should correlate radiological studies with treatment of calcinosis and underlying ACTD.

Introduction: Cardiopulmonary involvement in connective tissue disease (CTD) manifests in many ways, may be asymptomatic and can have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Investigation of cardiopulmonary symptoms and signs in these patients is therefore important and screening asymptomatic patients may facilitate early recognition and treatment.

Objectives: To describe cardiopulmonary involvement in patients with four CTDs (juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE), juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), juvenile systemic sclerosis (JSSc) and juvenile mixed connective tissue disease (JMCTD), define audit standards and measure performance against them.

Methods: Current patients seen within the last twelve months from four tertiary paediatric rheumatology centres were included. Available guidance was reviewed and both generic and disease-specific audit standards were defined.

Results: 82 patients were included with a median follow-up of 2.8 years. Most patients had JSLE (33) and JDM (32) with smaller numbers of JSSc and JMCTD patients (6 and 11 respectively). Guidance on cardiopulmonary involvement was identified for JSLE (Single Hub and Access Point for Paediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) and British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) guidance), JDM (SHARE) and JSSc (SHARE). No guidelines were identified for JMCTD.

Screening for cardiopulmonary involvement was inconsistent and standards were largely not met (table 1). Abnormal findings did not always lead to further/repeat investigation; HRCT was not performed for all patients with persistently abnormal lung function. Pulmonary involvement was identified in 24.4% and was most frequent in JSSc (83%). Two patients had ILD. Cardiac involvement was less frequent (9.8%) with pericardial effusion the most common manifestation and one patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Conclusion: Guidance for cardiopulmonary screening is limited but cardiopulmonary screening is inconsistently performed for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and standards are not met. Service evaluation and development with multi-disciplinary team engagement is required to increase screening and improve long-term outcomes for patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for dermatomyositis and polymyositis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (corticosteroids and immunosuppressants), BSR 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate a combination of high-dose corticosteroids and methotrexate as first-line therapy in most patients with juvenile-onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. Prefer a combination of prednisolone and methotrexate over prednisolone and cyclosporin.

Objectives: To describe the outcome of IVIG treatment in JDM from the literature and from a longstanding cohort of JDM patients.

Methods: The PubMed database was searched for eligible articles. A retrospective chart review of all JDM patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2023 and treated in Amsterdam was performed. This is a non-biased group, as all children with JDM in our region with an ethnically diverse population of 3000.000 people are referred to our center. Primary outcomes were disease course, attainment of complete remission, cumulative dose of steroids and long-term side effects.

Results: Seventeen eligible articles were reviewed. No RCT were found. In total, 88 JDM patients treated with IVIG therapy had been described, demonstrating favorable results in 92%, with limited side effects. Next, a retrospective chart review of 24 JDM patients treated in our center was performed. All patients received 2g/kg/4 weeks (max 60g) IVIG starting at diagnosis, normally for 6–12 months. Disease remission was reached in 92% patients after a median time of one year. A medication-free complete recovery with no apparent sequelae was achieved in 19/24 (79%) patients, 5/24 (21%) have complaints of subjective long term fatigue, and just 2/24 (8%) developed mild calcinosis.

Conclusion: Upfront additional IVIG therapy next to corticosteroids and weekly methotrexate in JDM patients is effective and outcomes are excellent with few adverse effects. With the lack of RCTs, further research is needed to determine the exact efficacy of this therapy.

### Updates on juvenile dermatomyositis from the last decade: classification to outcomes [^bae364a5]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a heterogeneous disease with new classification criteria and updates in myositis-specific autoantibody and myositis-associated antibody groups. There are many validated assessment tools for assessing disease activity in JDM. Future studies will optimize these tools and improve feasibility in clinical and research contexts. Genetic and environmental risk factors, mechanisms of muscle pathology, role of interferon, vascular markers, and changes in immune cells provide insights to JDM pathogenesis. Outcomes have improved, but chronic disease, damage, and mortality highlight the need for better outcome predictors and treatments. Increased collaboration of stakeholders may help overcome research barriers and improve JDM treatment.

In patients with juvenile dermatomyositis/polymyositis (JDM/PM), malignancy is a rare phenomenon. An extensive workup for neoplastic disease is not routinely indicated, but should be considered if unusual physical findings are noted at JDM/PM diagnosis or during follow-up period. The objective of this literature review was to assess for any association between, and disease profile of, JDM/PM and lymphoma in childhood. Risk determinants of the possible development of lymphoma in the pediatric population with JDM/PM appear to be the degree and duration of inflammatory activity with chronic B-cell activation and/or antigen stimulation; a paraneoplastic relationship is unlikely.

Introduction: Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is the most prevalent subtype of juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy and is characterized by a capillary vasculopathy primarily affecting muscle and cutaneous tissues. The therapeutic efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was initially demonstrated in a controlled clinical trial involving adult patients with dermatomyositis. However, to date, no randomized controlled trials have evaluated IVIG use in the pediatric JDM population.

Objectives: In this multicenter study, we aim to present and evaluate our collective clinical experiences with the use of IVIG in the management of JDM.

Methods: This multicenter retrospective study included patients diagnosed with JDM before age 18 who received IVIG treatment at any point during their disease course in four pediatric rheumatology centers. All patients fulfilled the Bohan and Peter diagnostic criteria and provided informed consent. Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data were collected from medical records. Indications for IVIG included refractoriness to standard therapies, severe skin or organ involvement, or calcinosis. Treatment responses were evaluated using PRINTO/ACR/EULAR juvenile dermatomyositis core set measures, including CMAS, MMT-8, Patient and Physician Global VAS scores, and serum CPK levels.

Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is an uncommon disease in children younger than 3 years of age. The clinical manifestations may be different than in older children, often delaying the diagnosis. We present two patients with early-onset JDM and review the literature describing the unique clinical characteristics in this age group.

### Developing a provisional, international minimal dataset for juvenile dermatomyositis: for use in clinical practice to inform research [^8e4569ff]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

A minimal dataset will provide a framework within which all children with JDM can be monitored in a similar way, including important variables, as a minimum standard of care. The dataset will prompt clinicians to check important clinical features including muscle strength, skin activity and investigations each time a child with JDM is seen. This is important since JDM is a rare disease and some clinicians are not seeing large numbers of patients with the disease. The importance of defining minimal standards of care has been recognized internationally and members of our group are involved in a European effort to produce standards of care within a Single Hub and Access Point for Paediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) for JDM as well as other paediatric rheumatological conditions.

A provisional minimal dataset has been defined by consensus between a group of experts in JDM, representative of the major national and international JDM collaborative efforts. This now needs to be refined and tested for its usefulness and acceptability in a wider international setting. In order to achieve this, a formal consensus-driven methodology is required of all stakeholders. This will include a Delphi process to gain widespread opinion via the established JDM networks that will help to inform a more detailed face-to-face nominal group consensus process by internationally representative JDM experts.

6.8 Outcome

As a result of consideration by the systematic review team, a reduction in calcinosis cutis: importance of outcome 6, inhibition of calcinosis cutis: importance of outcome 5, an improvement in the QOL: importance of outcome 6, and treatment‐related complications: importance of outcome 5 were adopted. The importance of outcome was determined by all guideline‐drafting members' agreement (consistency rate for all imaging procedures: 100%).

6.9 Literature screening

Primary screening was performed, and 80 documents describing the above outcomes were selected. Of these, 13 remained through secondary screening. Finally, 13 articles on SSc‐ or dermatomyositis‐related calcinosis remained. A flow chart of literature search is presented (Figure 12).

6.10 Evaluation of individual references

With respect to the two RCTs selected on secondary screening, the selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attribution bias, and other biases were assessed based on the Minds Manual for Guideline Development 2020 version 3.0.

6.11 Evaluation of the outcome

In one of the two RCTs extracted this time, the effects of warfarin on connective tissue disease (dermatomyositis, SSc)–related calcinosis were examined. The number of patients was limited: warfarin‐treated group (three) and nonwarfarin‐treated group (four). In the other RCT, the effects of rituximab were investigated in 120 patients with dermatomyositis (72 adults [seven with calcinosis], 48 young patients [22 with calcinosis]). Calcinosis was evaluated as a secondary endpoint, but there was no response. In other references, statistical examination was not performed, and it was impossible to perform a meta‐analysis.

6.12 Results

It was difficult to perform a meta‐analysis based on the studies extracted on this screening. When preparing an explanatory text, a broad range of studies, including descriptive research, was introduced, and drugs that may be effective for dermatomyositis‐ and SSc‐related calcinosis were qualitatively evaluated (Figures 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19).

Based on these results, a summary of the results (SoF) was prepared, and presented at a panel meeting.

Introduction: Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects muscles and skin. One of the severe complications associated with JDM is calcinosis, and treating this condition presents significant challenges.

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of local injection of infliximab into calcinosis lesions in patients with JDM.

Methods: In this clinical trial, five patients diagnosed with JDM and calcinosis lesions were enrolled. The primary treatment consisted of weekly infliximab injections for 16 weeks, targeting all four sides of each lesion. Lesion dimensions, including length and width, were documented and monitored weekly. Before the intervention, patients underwent radiographic imaging. After the final injection in week 16, a follow-up radiographic assessment was performed. Data were analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) method.

Results: The lesions' size significantly decreased in both length and width during each visit. On average, the lesion length reduced by 2.66%, and the width shrank by 3.32% per visit. Based on radiographic findings, the average length and width of lesions at the initial visit were 12.09 ± 5.05 mm (range: 6.00–25.50 mm) and 6.35 ± 3.00 mm (range: 2.00–16.00 mm), respectively. The average length and width at the last visit were 5.59 ± 7.05 mm (range: 0–23.00 mm) and 3.41 ± 4.05 mm (range: 0–13.00 mm), respectively. No specific side effects related to the treatment were reported.

Conclusion: The results suggest that the direct administration of infliximab into the calcinosis lesions of patients with JDM could be a safe and effective treatment approach.

A retrospective review of all JDM patients diagnosed and managed by pediatric rheumatologist in tertiary centers in Oman was conducted. Patient demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment modalities, and disease outcomes were analyzed.

Results

A total of 30 children diagnosed with JDM were included. They had an equal female to male distribution, 1:1 ratio. The median age at disease onset was 6.78 years (range: 2–13), with a median diagnostic delay of 8.4 months (range:1–23). The median follow-up period for these patients was 4 years (absolute range: 1 month-16 years). Classic JDM skin manifestations, including heliotrope rash (n = 25; 83%) and Gottron's papules (n = 23; 77%), were common. Proximal muscle weakness was observed in 28 (93%) patients, while 23 (77%) patients exhibited elevated muscle enzymes. MRI findings consistent with myositis were present in 70% (n = 19/27) of the subjects, and muscle biopsy confirmed JDM in 9 cases (30%). Among 25 patients tested for myositis specific antibodies, NXP2 (n = 3), Anti-TIF1 (n = 2), Anti-Mi-2 (n = 1), and MDA5 (n = 1) were detected, showing expected correlations with disease phenotype. Corticosteroids were universally administered, with methotrexate (n = 25; 83%) and IVIG (n = 15; 50%) as common adjuncts. Calcinosis was observed in 8 patients (27%), and was managed with various treatment modalities including pamidronate (n = 3), diltiazem (n = 2), and infliximab (n = 1). At the last follow-up, 18 patients (60%) were in clinical remission, 50% (n = 15) followed a polyphasic or chronic disease course, and 2 patients succumbed to disease-related complications.

Conclusions

This study provides comprehensive characterization of pediatric JDM in Oman. The findings highlight regional variations in disease presentation, autoantibody profiles, and treatment responses, underscoring the need for early diagnosis and individualized management strategies. Continued follow-up is essential to optimize long-term outcomes and improve survival rates in this patient population.

### Is juvenile dermatomyositis a different disease in children up to three years of age at onset than in children above three years at onset? A retrospective review of 23 years of a single center's experience [^9869d5bf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Nationwide Childrens Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained for this study. We identified 85 patients with a medical record diagnosis (ICD-9 coding) of JDM at Nationwide Children's Hospital from January 1988 to July 2010. After a preliminary review of electronic medical records and paper charts, 7 patients were excluded because they developed a rheumatic overlap syndrome or mixed connective tissue disease. We included 78 patients, all younger than 18 years of age at onset of disease. Nineteen were at or below 3 years of age and 59 were above 3 years of age at onset of symptoms of JDM. These charts were reviewed retrospectively to collect information for a period starting at their date of presentation to the last clinic follow-up, or to July 1, 2010. As a part of the rheumatology practice, the standard format of outpatient assessment clinical charts designed for JDM were used in clinics. After initial assessment/admission the patients are seen every 6–12 weeks in most cases depending on their individual needs. We collected information from the patient's charts at various time points such as at the diagnosis, at 6 months post diagnosis, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and then 10 years post-diagnosis. Demographic data was collected from medical record of all the JDM patients. Only 23 patients had race/ethnicity information in medical records; thus information on this variable, although important, could not be included. We examined the raw data from our retrospective chart review and found significant differences in the several disease aspects such as demographic and outcome parameters between those who had onset at three years or below compared to those above three years of age.

### 2017 European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for adult and juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and their major subgroups [^d8fe5d11]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dermatomyositis and polymyositis:

- **Definition**: DM/PM are autoimmune myopathies characterized by subacute or chronic inflammation and weakness of proximal muscles with extra muscular manifestations.
- **Pathophysiology**: Dermatomyositis is mostly caused by humoral immune response whereas polymyositis is caused by T cell-mediated immune response.
- **Disease course**: Autoimmunity results in polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM), which cause clinical manifestations of symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, pain, inflammation, typical rash in DM, fever, non-erosive arthritis, hyperkeratotic lesions along the radial and palmar aspects of fingers. Disease progression may lead to ILD and increased risk of malignancy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The in-hospital mortality rate of DM/PM is 4.58%.

### Development of practice and consensus-based strategies including a Treat-to-target approach for the management of moderate and severe juvenile dermatomyositis in Germany and Austria [^4321f93d]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we have developed consensus-based strategies for the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of JDM by the harmonization of current clinical practice with the overarching goal is to improve the outcome of patients with JDM. Concerning therapy, we are placing an emphasis on a treat-to-target strategy using internationally accepted improvement criteria rather than on individual medications, fitting well into existing frameworks. As others have done previously, we define a minimal dataset to regularly collect in patients with JDM in order to allow comparative effectiveness research. We conclude that, due to the rarity of the condition, international collaboration will be critical in order to improve the outcome of patients with JDM. We believe that this work will add to the armamentarium of providers managing patients with JDM worldwide.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis in a Nigerian girl [^cb450530]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Juvenile dermatomyositis is an autoimmune connective tissue disease occurring in children less than 16 years old. It is part of a heterogeneous group of muscle diseases called idiopathic Iiflammatory myopathies. It had previously been reported in black Africans resident in UK. However, there is no documented case reported from Africa. The index sign of heliotrope rashes is often difficult to visualise in the black skin. An 11-year-old Nigerian girl presenting with clinical, laboratory and histopathological features of juvenile dermatomyositis is presented here. It is hoped that this case will heighten the index of suspicion of this condition among medical practitioners in Africa.

Literature search — scope and search strategy

Using key questions as a basis, a literature search was undertaken using Ovid (see 'Search terms' in Supplementary Material S1, available at Rheumatology online). Search results and additional manually identified references up to October 2020 were included. Evidence published after October 2020 was not included as this was the cut-off for eligibility. A potential limitation of this guideline is that relevant literature may have been published since October 2020; data or information from these studies could not be included in the recommendation formation process.

Eligibility criteria

Published peer reviewed clinical studies relating to any IIM subtype except inclusion body myositis were included. Case reports/series were limited to those describing outcomes for three or more subjects. Review articles, editorials, conference proceedings, and existing clinical guidelines were excluded. Non-English language papers were excluded unless a translation was published. Basic science studies without clear clinical applicability were excluded. Abstracts of papers were reviewed by two authors to determine eligibility against these criteria (PRISMA flow diagram shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online).

Methods used to formulate recommendations

The full text of each eligible paper was reviewed by two assessors using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. Each reference was categorized as high (A), moderate (B) or low/very low (C) quality. A third assessor resolved disagreements.

A total of 213 papers were used to form recommendations. See Supplementary Table S1 (available at Rheumatology online) for details of evidence base contributing to recommendations.

Draft recommendations were created and categorized as applicable to all patients, adult-specific or paediatric-specific. The process outlined by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) was used to summarize the quality of body of evidence for each recommendation: high (A), moderate (B), low (C) or very low (D), according to GRADE methodology.

Content, wording, strength of recommendation (strong = 1, conditional = 2), and quality of supporting evidence for each recommendation were subjected to a formal consensus building process using a combination of face-to-face meetings and online surveys. Strength of agreement (SoA) for finalized recommendations was determined using a simple binary voting system for each voter and is presented as a percentage. Authors were free to abstain from voting on areas where they did not feel clinically competent, with the percentage reflecting voters. Only recommendations with a SoA > 80% were included in the guideline.

### Progressive, refractory macrophage activation syndrome as the initial presentation of anti-MDA5 antibody positive juvenile dermatomyositis: a case report and literature review [^3ad3de4d]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is a subtype of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), a group of diseases characterized by muscle inflammation and resulting weakness. JDM is the most common IIM in children with an estimated incidence in the United States of 2.5–4.1 per one million children between 1995 and 1998. The peak age of onset is approximately 7 years old and is more common in girls than boys. Like many rheumatologic diseases, it is not uncommon for patients to have symptoms for months prior to clinicians making the diagnosis with the median duration from symptom onset to diagnosis being about 4 months.

Classical presentation of JDM includes the pathognomonic dermatologic findings of a heliotrope rash and/or Gottron papules. These findings along with symmetric proximal muscle weakness should raise suspicion of JDM. Previously the only available diagnostic criteria were based on criteria published in 1975 by Bohan and Peter who discussed the following five diagnostic criteria: classical skin rash, elevated muscle enzymes, proximal muscle weakness, as well as characteristic changes seen on electromyogram (EMG) and muscle biopsy. While these criteria defined the basis for diagnosis of JDM, these criteria require invasive testing not always readily available, and with the advancement of antibody testing, we have begun recognizing variable presentations of JDM that may not meet these diagnostic criteria. This was addressed in 2017 when the European League against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology established classification criteria for IIM's and the major subgroups. These criteria attempt to score patients based on whether or not muscle biopsy results are available and account for age of symptom onset, muscle weakness, skin manifestations, dysphagia or esophageal dysmotility, elevated muscle enzymes, and presence of Anti-Jo-1 antibody. These new data-driven, highly specific, and sensitive criteria for IIM and the major subgroups allow clinicians to confidently diagnose myopathies, including JDM, which should allow for earlier diagnosis and management. Earlier treatment is paramount in avoiding potential life-threatening complications of the IIM.

### Clinical features and outcome in a Danish cohort of juvenile dermatomyositis patients [^e3c34d0a]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess disease characteristics and outcome in Danish juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) patients (1977–2007).

Methods

Medical record review of hospital records identified from the National Patient Register.

Results

Fifty-seven JDM patients were identified. Follow-up time was 7 years (range 0.06–30). Female:male ratio was 2.5:1. Mean age at disease onset was 7 years (SD ± 3.7), range 1.5–16.0 years. Diagnostic delay was 0.7 years (SD ± 1.6), range 0.04–9 years. Mean disease duration was 3.7 years (SD ± 3.5), range 0.7–9 years. Thirty-nine patients (70%) were in full remission. Three patients (5%) were deceased. Disease/treatment-induced damage was present in 35 (61%) patients. Decreased pulmonary function occurred early in the disease course (median 10 months), osteoporosis and calcinosis occurred later (median 18 and 22 months). Four patients developed persistent damage within the first 6 months, four developed calcinosis within the first year. Shorter disease duration was associated with less damage (p = 0.004). In a multivariate assessment analysis age > 10 years at disease onset was associated with more damage (p < 0.01), OR 10.96 (CI 1.6–73.6), and disease duration > 4 years was associated with calcinosis (p = 0.01) OR 23.2 (CI 2.6–206.2).

Conclusions

We present a nationwide retrospective study of Danish JDM patients from 1977–2007. Although 70% were in remission, 61% of the patients had clinical signs of damage. Only a few patients developed damage within the first year of the disease. Longer disease duration and higher age at disease onset was correlated with more disease damage.

### The paediatric rheumatology international trials organisation provisional criteria for the evaluation of response to therapy in juvenile dermatomyositis [^34d7c8da]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a provisional definition for the evaluation of response to therapy in juvenile dermatomyositis (DM) based on the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation juvenile DM core set of variables.

Methods

Thirty-seven experienced pediatric rheumatologists from 27 countries achieved consensus on 128 difficult patient profiles as clinically improved or not improved using a stepwise approach (patient's rating, statistical analysis, definition selection). Using the physicians' consensus ratings as the "gold standard measure", chi-square, sensitivity, specificity, false-positive and-negative rates, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and kappa agreement for candidate definitions of improvement were calculated. Definitions with kappa values > 0.8 were multiplied by the face validity score to select the top definitions.

Results

The top definition of improvement was at least 20% improvement from baseline in 3 of 6 core set variables with no more than 1 of the remaining worsening by more than 30%, which cannot be muscle strength. The second-highest scoring definition was at least 20% improvement from baseline in 3 of 6 core set variables with no more than 2 of the remaining worsening by more than 25%, which cannot be muscle strength (definition P1 selected by the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies group). The third is similar to the second with the maximum amount of worsening set to 30%. This indicates convergent validity of the process.

Conclusion

We propose a provisional data-driven definition of improvement that reflects well the consensus rating of experienced clinicians, which incorporates clinically meaningful change in core set variables in a composite end point for the evaluation of global response to therapy in juvenile DM.

### Expert perspective: diagnostic approach to differentiating juvenile dermatomyositis from muscular dystrophy [^b986086c]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Muscle biopsy and histopathology

In a child without a clear diagnosis of JDM or MD after thorough history, examination, laboratory tests, imaging, and possibly genetic testing, it is important to obtain a muscle biopsy (Figure 1). There has been a trend toward a reduced frequency of obtaining muscle biopsies, especially when pathognomonic rash is present; however, it can be a critical step to differentiate JDM from other types of childhood myopathies and may provide prognostic information. Considering continued advances in genetic testing for MD and other congenital myopathies, many practitioners will order genetic testing before or in lieu of muscle biopsy. However, one recent retrospective study highlighted that the diagnostic yield of genetic testing was higher when performed after muscle biopsy. Also of note, the development of the recently approved genetic therapy for DMD was dependent on demonstrating the presence of the microdystrophin protein in muscle biopsy samples from treated patients.

### Defining criteria for disease activity States in juvenile dermatomyositis based on the juvenile dermatomyositis activity index [^e4c7e7a3]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Results of validation analyses

In the routine sample, the percentage of visits in which patients were judged subjectively by the caring physician as being in the state of ID or LDA was greater among patients with JDMAI1 or JDMAI2 scores below the cut-off values for ID or LDA, whereas the percentage of visits in which patients were judged by the caring physician as being in the state of MDA or HDA was greater among patients with a JDMAI1 or JDMAI2 score within the interval corresponding to MDA or above the HDA cut-off (see figure 1 for JDMAI1 and online supplemental figure S1 for JDMAI2). Likewise, the proportion of visits in which the JDMAI1 and JDMAI2 scores were below the cut-off value for ID was higher among patients judged subjectively by their parents as being in the state of ID than as having continued activity or flare (online supplemental figure S2 for JDMAI1, data not shown for JDMAI2). In the same sample, the percentage of visits in which parents were satisfied with their child's disease state was greater among patients with a JDMAI1 or JDMAI2 scores below the cut-off values for ID or LDA, whereas the percentage of visits in which the parents were not satisfied by their child's disease state was greater among patients with a JDMAI1 or JDMAI2 within the interval corresponding to MDA or above the HDA cut-off (see figure 2 for JDMAI1 and online supplemental figure S3 for JDMAI2). Notably, all patients included in the JDM PRINTO trial had a baseline score above the HDA cut-off for both JDMAI1 and JDMAI2.

### Cardiac findings in children with juvenile dermatomyositis at disease presentation [^20d4c9df]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is a pediatric vasculopathy characterized primarily by skin and muscle involvement. Cardiac findings have been reported in children with JDM but have rarely been investigated in detail.

Methods

We aimed to describe the relevant clinical and laboratory cardiac findings of a cohort of patients with JDM, followed at one centre, at disease diagnosis.

Results

We performed a retrospective review of 105 patients with JDM, followed from 1991 to 2007. Six of 70 patients (9%, 6% of the entire cohort) had abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, while 26 of 54 patients (48%, 25% of the entire cohort) had abnormal echocardiographic (echo) findings. Many of these findings were either mild or unlikely to be a result of JDM.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that cardiac abnormalities at JDM disease onset are frequently seen, but are rarely significant findings due to disease; however, JDM patients should be considered for screening for cardiac disease as late cardiac complications are well recognized.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^a6a780c6]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular prevention in pediatrics — The Expert Panel recommends two complementary strategies to reduce future risk for clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), with primordial prevention beginning in infancy and primary prevention requiring screening to identify children at increased risk; specifically, the Expert Panel recommends routine measurement of length/height and weight beginning in infancy, calculation of BMI annually beginning at age 2 years, yearly assessment of blood pressure (BP) from age 3 years, and universal screening for lipid abnormalities by a nonfasting non–HDL–C level at age 10 years; these screening strategies will identify a relatively large number of children for whom the Expert Panel recommends intensified lifestyle intervention, whereas only a small number will require pharmacologic therapy, and recommending these assessments as part of routine pediatric care represents the best current primary prevention strategy to lower lifetime risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

### Methods for analyzing observational longitudinal prognosis studies for rheumatic diseases: a review&worked example using a clinic-based cohort of juvenile dermatomyositis patients [^6fbd8789]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Most outcome studies of rheumatic diseases report outcomes ascertained on a single occasion. While single assessments are sufficient for terminal or irreversible outcomes, they may not be sufficiently informative if outcomes change or fluctuate over time. Consequently, longitudinal studies that measure non-terminal outcomes repeatedly afford a better understanding of disease evolution.

Longitudinal studies require special analytic methods. Newer longitudinal analytic methods have evolved tremendously to deal with common challenges in longitudinal observational studies. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have used longitudinal design. This review aims to help readers understand and apply the findings from longitudinal studies. Using a cohort of children with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), we illustrate how to study evolution of disease activity in JDM using longitudinal methods.

### Dermatomyositis… [^5812450e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Dermatomyositis is a condition affecting the skin and muscles. Cutaneous DM is an inflammatory disease with characteristic skin findings and frequent inflammation of the muscles. Patients may also have internal disease that can affect the lungs, joints, esophagus, and heart. Dermatomyositis can occur in children or adults. This disease in children may result in calcium deposits in the skin. Adults with DM could have an internal cancer. Some patients have only skin disease, which is called amyopathic DM, while others have skin changes and myositis. In some patients, the skin disease may still be active even if the myositis is effectively treated. The cause of DM is not known, but it might be associated with inherited factors, reaction to an infectious agent, a medication, sunlight, or internal cancer.

Symptoms and Manifestations The classic skin changes in DM include a heliotrope rash and Gottron papules. Other characteristic skin findings include red purplish discoloration on the face, exposed surfaces of the arms, forearms and hands, scalp, upper chest, upper back, and the lateral hips in addition to changes around the cuticles of the fingernails. Many patients are sensitive to sunlight. The muscle inflammation tends to affect larger muscles and can present as difficulty raising the arms above the shoulder or trouble rising from a chair or climbing stairs. Sometimes there is muscle tenderness, fatigue, and low-grade fever. Dermatomyositis can also affect the esophagus, lungs, or heart.

Diagnosis and Evaluation A physician will perform a thorough skin examination, test your strength, take a thorough history, order blood tests, perform a skin biopsy, and possibly perform tests or imaging of your muscles. If you are an adult, you will need to be screened for internal cancer at the time of diagnosis, and these tests are usually repeated annually for 3 years. In addition, the function of your esophagus, lungs, and heart will also be evaluated. Treatment Management of DM is aimed at the organs affected. Patients with muscle disease are usually treated with oral corticosteroids initially, with transitioning to use of other systemic medications that lower inflammation. Physical therapy to maintain the full range of motion of the joints and prevent muscle loss is helpful. The skin must be treated with sun-protective measures, including avoidance of sunlight, use of protective clothing, and sunscreens.

Topical therapies, including creams and ointments, may be prescribed, but are unlikely alone to effectively treat skin DM. Most patients need long-term use of systemic medications, including immunosuppressants, or a medication given as an infusion called immune globulin. Response to treatment is assessed by physical examination of the skin and muscles and for muscle disease by repeated blood testing.

### Defining criteria for disease activity States in juvenile dermatomyositis based on the juvenile dermatomyositis activity index [^061e6c58]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient populations used for the validation of JDMAI cut-offs

Two patient samples were used to validate the selected cut-off values. The first sample comprised 213 JDM patients followed in standard clinical care at 13 international paediatric rheumatology centres and evaluated prospectively at baseline and after a median of 5.9 months. The clinical features of these patients have been reported elsewhere. In addition to collecting the traditional physician's centred outcome measures, at the time of the visit the caring physician was asked to rate subjectively the child's disease state as ID, LDA, MDA or HDA. Furthermore, at every visit the parents of the enrolled patients were asked to make a subjective rating of the child's disease state as remission, continued activity or flare. To facilitate understanding of disease states by parents and children, remission was defined as 'complete absence of symptoms', continued disease activity as 'continuing presence of symptoms' and flare as 'recurrence of symptoms after a period of complete well-being'. The parents were also asked to answer a question about satisfaction with the present symptom state. The question, 'Considering all the ways the illness affects your child, would you be satisfied if his/her condition remained stable/unchanged for the next few months?' was to be answered as 'yes' or 'no'.

The second sample was composed of 275 patients with active JDM enrolled in a multinational study aimed to validate prospectively the provisional PRINTO/American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology disease activity core set for the assessment of response to therapy in JDM. For the purposes of the study, only the baseline evaluations were retained.

For sake of brevity, the first dataset will hereafter be named as 'routine sample' and the second dataset as 'PRINTO sample'.

CPGs characteristics

CPGs were written (first and/or last authors) by rheumatologists (n = 3), neurologists (n = 7), dermatologists (n = 3) and pulmonologists (n = 1). In four CPGs, co-workers from different specialties than main authors were also involved. No CPGs involved clinicians from more than two different specialties. No CPGs involved patients.

Five CPGs were dedicated to IIMs, while nine covered a broader spectrum of diseases (including IIMs).

Nine CPGs targeted IIMs as a whole (juvenile and adult) although in four of the latter, authors did not state whether the recommendation applied to adult and/or juvenile IM. One paper targeted specifically juvenile IIMs and four specifically adults IIMs.

The majority of CPGs (n = 13) focused on therapeutic questions including overall treatment, use of intravenous globulin, management of lung and cutaneous disease. Others addressed disease measurements (tools for clinical assessment and improvement definition), associated conditions (cancer, pregnancy) and overall management. In seven CPGs, evidence was systematically searched and discussed (evidence-based CPGs). In the others, the method for evidence search was not provided ('eminence-based' CPGs). There were no specific recommendations focusing on ASSD.

Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnoses assigned to all 275 cases are shown in Table 2. Demographic and baseline clinical data for the 258 patients with a diagnosis of definite or probable JDM, and definite or probable JPM are shown separately. JPM was diagnosed in only seven (2.5%) children in this cohort. Of the cases assigned with a diagnosis of JDM, 35 had features of overlap with either scleroderma (19), lupus (7), MCTD (5) or severe arthritis (4). As these overlap cases were noted at the discretion of the recruiting physician they may not reflect the overall prevalence of overlap features within the registry cohort. We have previously published data outlining the frequency of clinical features such as arthritis (36%) or features suggestive of scleroderma overlap (24%), for patients within the registry. Of the 258 children with a diagnosis of probable or definite JDM or JPM, 182 (70.5%) were girls, giving a female to male ratio of 2.39: 1. The median age of onset was 6.3 years, similar to other large cohorts. At disease onset, 37% patients were ≤ 4 years old. The distribution of age of onset is illustrated in Fig. 1. Median time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 4 months. It is noteworthy that 117 (42%) children had muscle biopsy but only 21 (7.6%) had an EMG during diagnostic work-up. This is in keeping with our previous study, which surveyed 92 centres from 32 countries caring for children with JDM, and showed that 70% of centres had access to muscle MRI, but only 61 and 55%, respectively, used muscle biopsy and EMG in the investigation of children with suspected myositis. This study and our data confirm the need for developing improved diagnostic criteria based on modern methods of diagnosis.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis: novel treatment approaches and outcomes [^706bbf86]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to provide a summary of the recent therapeutic advances and the latest research on outcome measures for juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).

Recent Findings

Several new international studies have developed consensus-based guidelines on diagnosis, outcome measures and treatment of JDM to standardize and improve patient care. Myositis-specific antibodies together with muscle biopsy histopathology may help the clinician to predict disease outcome. A newly developed MRI-based scoring system has been developed to standardize the use of MRI in assessing disease activity in JDM. New data regarding the efficacy and safety of rituximab, especially for skin disease, and cyclophosphamide in JDM support the use of these medications for severe refractory cases.

Summary

International network studies, new biomarkers and outcome measures have led to significant progress in understanding and managing the rare inflammatory myositis conditions such as JDM.

### Rapid improvement in recalcitrant cutaneous juvenile dermatomyositis with anifrolumab treatment… [^3ccadc42]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Juvenile dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy of childhood that manifests with proximal muscle weakness and varying degrees of extramuscular pathologic findings. Although muscle disease is often responsive to first-line systemic corticosteroids and traditional steroid-sparing immunosuppressants, cutaneous involvement in JDM may persist, precluding complete disease remission. 1 Recent transcriptomic analyses have demonstrated striking upregulation of type I interferon –stimulated genes in the peripheral. blood, muscle, and lesional skin of patients with JDM, with higher IFN scores corresponding to increased disease severity. 2 As such, type I IFN has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for patients with dermatomyositis, although US Food and Drug Administration –approved therapies are lacking.

### Recent advances in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^ddf89f86]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ongoing research continues to advance our understanding of the juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIMs). We review the recent contributions from the published literature about the classification, pathogenesis, assessment, and treatment of JIIMs in basic and translational science and clinical research in 2013 through early 2014.

Recent Findings

Large registries, such as the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance registry, are conducting trials to enhance our understanding of JIIMs. Ultraviolet radiation exposure 1 month prior to juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) may trigger the onset of disease. Myositis-specific autoantibodies define clinical phenotypes in JIIMs. MRI is useful in diagnosing JDM and may be used as a disease assessment tool. Type 1 interferon genes and proteins are increasing in use as disease assessment tools, but larger, prospective, validation studies are needed. Moderate-to-intense physical activity is effective in increasing the aerobic capacity of JDM patients in remission. New criteria developed by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization for classifying inactive disease in JDM have practical applicability to the current clinical practice and clinical trials as even after 16.8 years of symptom onset, over half of JDM patients still have active disease.

Summary

There has been significant progress in understanding the clinical characteristics, diagnostic workup, treatment, disease assessment, and prognosis of JIIM patients, but more prospective treatment trials are needed, especially in light of the paucity of the current biologic treatment agents available.

### Chemotherapy induced juvenile dermatomyositis: a novel presentation-a case report [^b6e23e49]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 14-year-old female came to our facility with concerns about difficulty in walking owing to weakness in both lower limbs, an erythematous, pruritic rash that covered her face, neck, axilla, elbows, and knees, and photosensitivity that had been present for eight months. It was unknown if she had any allergies. Patient underwent surgery 1.5 years after being diagnosed with retinoblastoma two years prior. After the enucleation, the patient underwent 40 cycles of radiation therapy and 13 cycles of chemotherapy with the drugs cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carboplatin, vincristine, and dactinomycin. In addition to developing proximal muscular weakness in both the upper and lower body after undergoing chemotherapy for 10 months, the patient also got a rash over their face that progressed.

The patient was brought with these issues to our facility. Indicators of the patient's weakness in the proximal muscles of the upper and lower limbs were difficulty in rising from a sitting position and lifting the arms over the head. Her lower limbs had grade II muscle power and her upper limbs grade III, according to the examination. The CMAS score for childhood myositis was 36. Her vital signs were normal, and she had no underlying systemic issues. On inspection of the joints, there were no indications of active synovitis. At presentation, her neck flexor strength was higher than grade IV. Findings of skin examination showed hallmark manifestations consistent with DM, well defined to ill defined hyperpigmented scaly lichenified plaques over the neck, face, axilla (Fig. 1 A, 1 B), elbows, knees, including the V neck sign/Shawl sign(Fig. 2 A), heliotrope eruption over the face especially on the forehead and periorbital region (Fig. 2 B), Gottron papules over the digits of upper limb on both sides (Fig. 2 C), calcinosis cutis involving the extensor aspect of elbows (Fig. 2 D).

### Erythromelalgia associated with dermatomyositis: a case series [^110d3b38]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Additional evaluation

At a diagnosis of either dermatomyositis or erythromelalgia, regular routine age-appropriate screening, including colonoscopy, Papanicolaou smears, and mammograms, should be encouraged, and a malignancy workup should be considered, including a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a pelvic ultrasound for women. Both dermatomyositis and erythromelalgia are associated with an increased risk of occult malignancy, although the association is less well characterized for patients with erythromelalgia. Given an association with myeloproliferative disorders, a complete blood count with differential should be obtained as part of the patient's initial evaluation. Alternative diagnoses, such as peripheral artery disease, lipodermatosclerosis, cellulitis, and other conditions, should be considered. Raynaud's phenomenon can occur in patients with erythromelalgia, especially in cases with comorbid connective tissue disease. This is important to recognize, as it may preclude treatment with beta-blockers, which are sometimes used to treat erythromelalgia symptoms.

The primary treatment for secondary erythromelalgia is treatment of the underlying disease. Thus, recognizing that erythromelalgia can be due to underlying dermatomyositis is important in developing a treatment approach. Physicians should be aware of this association and develop a treatment plan addressing the underlying dermatomyositis.

In addition to treatment of the underlying condition, there are other therapies recommended for symptomatic treatment of erythromelalgia. Patients should start with nonpharmacologic management, including limb elevation and the use of a fan or exposure of the affected area to cool water for short periods of time. Additionally, avoidance of triggers such as heat should be encouraged when possible. Case series have recommended the use of topical lidocaine patches as well as topical compounded 2% amitriptyline combined with ketamine 0.5% in a lipoderm base, as well as capsaicin. For systemic therapy, the initial treatment is generally aspirin 325 mg daily. Other common treatments with varying degrees of success include gabapentin, pregabalin, venlafaxine, and oral misoprostol. Pain management programs may also be helpful. Additionally, oral corticosteroid use has been thought to benefit some patients with erythromelalgia.

Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is an uncommon inflammatory myopathy with characteristic cutaneous manifestations. Certain clinical features such as cutaneous calcification, lipoatrophy, and generalized hypertrichosis can occur in JDM but are uncommon in the adult form of the disease. We report a young girl who presented with dramatic infrapatellar hypertrichosis along with more classic clinical signs of JDM, including heliotrope periorbital eruption, photosensitivity, and profound proximal muscle weakness. The clinical course was favorable, with improvement of cutaneous and muscular abnormalities after corticosteroid treatment.

### Developing a provisional, international minimal dataset for juvenile dermatomyositis: for use in clinical practice to inform research [^acce844c]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The development of an internationally agreed minimal dataset could have numerous potential benefits. Unification of data collection internationally will significantly enhance collaborative efforts and communication between groups (whilst respecting data protection/ownership) and allow analysis to be undertaken on the largest possible number of JDM patients. This has the potential to improve understanding of disease phenotype and outcome in a way that will define research questions and underpin prioritisation of future clinical trials. Analysis of a large number of JDM patients with international collaboration has the potential to help answer fundamental questions including characteristics of patients who develop JDM, how patients develop the disease, time to diagnosis (and raise awareness leading to quicker diagnosis), which tests are most useful for diagnosis and which features predict a more severe disease course. Increasingly, distinct clinical subtypes are recognised within IIM, associated with myositis specific antibodies, but differences are seen in adults and children. Our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these differences is limited by lack of studies directly comparing adults and children in sufficient numbers. A minimal dataset including disease characteristics and antibody profiling may help to answer these questions with the potential of directing subsequent clinical trials of treatment strategies on disease stratified by serology. It is increasingly recognized that patient reported perspectives reveal disease aspects not covered by traditional outcomes in myositis. A minimal dataset will include patient/parent reported outcome measures and work is ongoing to develop new JDM-specific patient/reported outcome measures (the Juvenile Dermatomyositis Multidimensional Assessment Report, JDMAR). With international collaboration, patient reported outcome measures, such as this, could be evaluated in large numbers of patients, helping to predict effectiveness for their use in future clinical trials.

### Toward a Treat-to-target strategy in juvenile dermatomyositis: what are the suitable targets and optimal timing of their achievement? [^7bf63a8a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare autoimmune condition. The treat-to-target (T2T) strategy has garnered interest in paediatric rheumatology. It is based on defining clear therapeutic targets, with frequent disease activity monitoring, and adjustment of the treatments if targets are not met within a defined time frame. Recently, an international Task Force of experts launched an initiative aimed at the development of recommendations for the adoption of T2T strategy in JDM. This study was done to support those recommendations.

Objectives

We aimed to determine the time to treatment response in patients with JDM, to better inform the development of a T2T strategy in JDM.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of JDM, followed at two tertiary care centres-the IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini (Gaslini), and The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids). Demographic and clinical data were obtained on all patients with JDM during the first two years following diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to determine time to outcome definitions.

Results

187 patients were identified across two sites; the mean age of diagnosis was 8 years. On average, patients with JDM achieved normalization of muscle enzymes and muscle remission 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation, respectively. Skin remission occurred within 12 months after starting treatment. Time to reach inactive disease varied between the sites, with median time 10.3 months (Gaslini) and 8.8 months (SickKids).

Conclusions

This study provides real-world data for potential timelines to target with a T2T strategy for JDM.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: an update on classification and treatment with special focus on juvenile forms [^b03c0d11]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Juvenile inflammatory myopathies represent a heterogeneous group of rare and potentially fatal disorders of unknown aetiology, characterised by inflammation and proximal and symmetric muscle weakness. Beyond many similarities, specific clinical, laboratoristic and histopathologic features underlie different subsets with distinguishing demographic, prognostic and therapeutic peculiarities. Over time, several forms of inflammatory idiopathic myopathies have been described, including macrophagic myofascitis, immune-mediated necrozing myopathy and the spectrum of amyopathic dermatomyositis that include hypomyopathic dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis and cancer-associated myositis occurring almost exclusively in adults. However, juvenile dermatomyositis is the most frequent in childhood, whereas polymyositis is relatively more frequent in adults. The aetiology is nowadays widely unclear; however, current theories contemplate a combination of environmental triggers, immune dysfunction and specific tissue responses involving muscle, skin and small vessels endothelium in genetically susceptible individuals. Myositis-specific autoantibodies, found almost exclusively in patients with myositis and myositis-associated autoantibodies, detectable both among patients with myositis and in subjects suffering from other autoimmune diseases, have an important clinical role because of their relation to specific clinical features, response to therapy and prognosis. The gold standard treatment for juvenile dermatomyositis is represented by corticosteroids, along with adjunctive steroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapies, which are used to counteract disease activity, prevent mortality, and reduce long-term disability. Further treatment approach such as biologic agents and autologous stem cell transplantation are emerging during the last years, in particular in patients difficult to treat and with poor prognosis. Therefore, a highly medical specialised approach is required for diagnosis and management of these conditions. This review comprehensively examines juvenile inflammatory myopathies focusing on clinical and laboratory classifications as well as on the current treatment approaches, referring in particular on biologic agents and latest therapeutic opportunities.

Introduction: Connective tissue disorders in children can overlap in various ways, making diagnosis challenging. Patients may present with complex clinical features of more than one disease without satisfying the diagnostic criteria and fulfilling simultaneously the diagnostic criteria of more diseases.

Objectives: We describe the case of an overlap connective tissue disease in a young patient initially diagnosed as juvenile systemic sclerosis (SSc).

Methods: Case report

Results: A 15-year-old girl originally from Sri-Lanka, was admitted with a 3-month history of sclerodactyly, digital pitting scars, skin sclerosis, fatigue, dysphagia and weight loss, and a Raynaud's phenomenon during the last 3 years. She further developed multiple ulcerative lesions of fingers/forearms/thighs. Skin histopathology showed superficial and deep perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, direct immunofluorescence revealed no C3, IgA, IgG, and IgM deposition. Autoantibody screening revealed positive ANA, anti-Scl-70, anti-SSA, anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies. Anti dsDNA and myositis antibodies panel were negative. Chest CT scan revealed signs of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and multiple adenopathies. An excisional biopsy of an affected lymph node was suggestive of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Capillaroscopy revealed enlarged capillaries, increased tortuosity and avascular areas. A whole-body MRI showed features of proximal inflammatory polymyositis of lower limbs. She was diagnosed with SSc and treated with oral steroids, mycophenolate mofetil and calcium channel blocker with poor response, particularly on the cutaneous features. Antifibrotic agent, antiplatelet and tocilizumab were then added without response. Her features seeming overlapping with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis, she was then treated as an overlapping disease. Tocilizumab was stopped and she was started on hydroxychloroquine, monthly intravenous immunoglobulins, rituximab and tadalafil. She progressively improved with resolution of skin sclerosis and ulcers, remission of joint stiffness and stability of ILD.

Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of increasing awareness of overlap syndromes in young patients. The association should be recognized early for prompt initiation of appropriate treatment that can prevent important morbidity and mortality.

### Development of practice and consensus-based strategies including a Treat-to-target approach for the management of moderate and severe juvenile dermatomyositis in Germany and Austria [^ed7b286d]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Expert panel

The expert status of the panel members is demonstrated by the fact that centers represented in the panel contributed more than half of all patients (for example, in 2016: 72 out of 127 [57%]) with JDM documented within the National Pediatric Rheumatic Disease Database ("Kerndokumentation rheumakranker Kinder und Jugendlicher").

Diagnosis and case definition

Regarding the diagnosis of JDM, there was consensus that the conventional Bohan and Peter criteria should be modified. In particular, there was consensus that typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings represented an important finding for establishing a diagnosis of JDM. Furthermore, electromyography was removed from the list of findings. The finding of symmetric proximal muscle weakness was modified to also include myalgia as a possible criterion (Table 1). Concerning the statements developed and the resulting treatment strategies, the group devised a case definition for moderate and severe JDM, similar to an existing CARRA definition (Table 1). According to the consensus, all patients with active moderate or severe JDM may be treated with strategies outlined here. Regarding this manuscript, we will from now on simply refer to JDM, indicating moderate or severe JDM. Additionally, the group developed a list of diagnostic tests that may be useful in patients with JDM. While some of the tests may be useful for establishing a diagnosis of JDM, others may be useful to rule out alternative diagnoses or to assess for potential organ involvement or complications. Also, myositis-specific antibodies were felt to be an important aspect of the work-up.

Table 1
Diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis and case definitions

Disease monitoring

It was felt to be important to define a minimum dataset that should be routinely collected on all patients with at least moderate JDM (Table 2). The group discussed the various validated parameters, taking into account the familiarity of practitioners in Germany with the respective investigations based on a recently performed online survey among pediatric rheumatologists and neurologists in Germany. The investigations include measurements of global, muscular and extramuscular disease activity, functional impairment, quality of life and disease damage.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis [^bfdde556]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

This guideline was developed according to the British Society for Rheumatology Guidelines Protocol by a Guideline Development Group comprising healthcare professionals with expertise in SSc and people with lived experience, as well as patient organization representatives. It is an update of the previous 2015 SSc guideline. The recommendations were developed and agreed by the group and are underpinned by published evidence, assessed by systematic literature review and reinforced by collective expert opinion of the group. It considers all aspects of SSc including general management, treatment of organ-based complications, including cardiopulmonary, renal and gastrointestinal tract manifestations, as well as broader impact of disease. Whilst it is focused on adults with SSc we expect that the guideline will be relevant to people of all ages and expert input and review by paediatric rheumatologists and other relevant specialists considered where the guideline was, or may not be, applicable to young people with SSc and juvenile-onset disease. In addition to providing guidance on disease assessment and management the full guideline also considers service organization within the National Health Service and future approaches to audit of the guideline.

### Muscle MRI at the time of questionable disease flares in juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) [^a354695a]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study suggested that a muscle MRI might be valuable as a test to inform a physician's decision about whether a child with JDM is having a disease flare when other findings or tests may not be helpful. There was a high concordance with physician decision making and the MRI. Further multicenter studies may be needed to confirm the utility and cost-effectiveness of MRI in detecting muscle flares in patients with JDM.

### Defining criteria for disease activity States in juvenile dermatomyositis based on the juvenile dermatomyositis activity index [^728adb2d]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the JDMAI1 and JDMAI2 scores at baseline and at 6-month visit in the aforementioned JDM PRINTO trial. As expected, the scores of both tools were quite high at study entry as the trial population was composed of newly diagnosed patients. The scores decreased markedly at 6-month evaluation as a result of treatment interventions.

Table 1
JDMAI1 and JDMAI2 scores at baseline and at 6 months (JDM PRINTO trial sample)

Selection of the optimal cut-offs for classification of specific disease activity states

The JDMAI1 and JDMAI2 cut-offs obtained with the different statistical approaches are shown in tables 2 and 3. As expected, the cut-offs for ID were the lowest and the values increased progressively for the states of LDA, MDA and HDA. The following criteria were used to select the final cut-offs: specificity was considered more relevant than sensitivity to identify the cut-offs for the states of ID and LDA, in order to reduce the risk of misclassifying patients whose disease was actually active. However, a minimum sensitivity of 75% was requested to ensure adequate face validity of the criteria. Conversely, in selecting the final cut-off values for HDA we gave more importance to sensitivity, that is, to the proportion of patients with active disease who were correctly classified, in order to reduce the risk of misclassifying patients whose disease was active. However, a minimum specificity of 75% was required to minimise the rate of misclassification of patients with LDA/MDA as having HDA. As stated above, the cut-offs for MDA were set at the interval between the cut-offs for LDA and HDA.

### Assessment of an infectious disease history preceding juvenile dermatomyositis symptom onset [^dd4c7597]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

A number of studies have looked at the role of infectious diseases in triggering juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). Previous studies have found a moderately high frequency of infectious symptoms prior to disease onset; however, no specific pathogens could be identified. We sought to correlate preceding infectious symptoms with onset and outcomes of JDM.

Methods

We studied an inception cohort of all JDM cases diagnosed at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) between 1988 and 2006. Data pertaining to symptoms at onset, diagnosis and disease outcomes were abstracted. Two independent paediatric infectious disease specialists reviewed all records of patients with symptoms or tests suggestive of infection.

Results

A total of 110 patients were reviewed; of these, 78 had sufficient information about disease onset for inclusion. Potential indications of an infectious process prior to JDM onset were found in 55/78 (71%) patients and were further evaluated for evidence of infection temporally associated with symptom onset. Features suggestive of infection prior to JDM symptom onset were found in 40/55 [probable (30/40) or possible (10/40)]. Most children with probable infections had respiratory illnesses [24/30 (80%)]. Fewer patients than expected had disease onset during summer months. The presence of an infection at onset was not found to be associated with differences in characteristics at diagnosis or disease outcomes.

Conclusions

A substantial number of JDM patients have a clinical history consistent with an infection prior to onset. Newly diagnosed patients should undergo a full infectious disease assessment as part of their initial work-up; specific attention should be given to respiratory infections.

### Cardiac involvement in adult and juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^4cb68c6e]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

Similar to other rheumatic diseases, IIM is associated with an increased risk of cardiac disease: however, the prevalence still remains uncertain. The main mechanisms responsible seem to be atherosclerosis and myocarditis. New methods of cardiac imaging with ever increasing sensitivity enable us to detect subtle changes of cardiac function. As physicians, we must use this new insight to give patients with IIM optimal cardiac care and preventive treatment; however, consensus guidelines for this do not yet exist. Also, this new insight challenges us to determine which findings have clinical significance and, perhaps, which have not. Therefore, longitudinal follow-up of patients with IIM with recording of clinical manifestations of heart involvement is needed. Since these are rare diseases, international collaboration is essential. To support such collaboration, the Euromyositis Register has been developed to facilitate longitudinal follow-up of outcome in patients with IIM, including organ-specific morbidity.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis with anti-SAE antibodies in a Moroccan child associated with pseudo-angioedema: a case report [^580e0f38]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

Our patient is a 5-year-3-month-old boy. He presented to the pediatric emergency department with dysphagia that had been evolving for two days preceded two months before by fatigue, lower limb pain, difficulty walking, and progressive inflammatory polyarthralgia facial erythema, but without any tingling, itching, or burning sensation. He had no medical or family history of angioedema and had not taken any medication for months before developing the current symptoms. Vital signs were stable on arrival. The child was afebrile. He had a heliotrope rash with facial swelling predominant on the lips, periungual telangiectasia, and Gottron's papules over the bilateral interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints (Fig. 1). He had more pronounced proximal muscle weakness in the lower limbs (Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale [CMAS] 32/52). He had no urticaria, calcinosis, cutaneous ulcers, or lipodystrophy. Both the joint and the pleuropulmonary examinations were normal.

The electroneuromyography showed myogenic changes in all four limbs. Laboratory findings showed elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (640 IU/L and 1467 IU/L, respectively) and a mild inflammatory syndrome (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] = 35 mm and C-reactive protein [CRP] = 24 mg/l). The electrocardiogram was normal. Only anti-SAE antibodies were positive immunoblot. Anti-Mi2 alpha, anti-Mi2 beta, anti-TIF1 gamma, anti-MDA5 and anti-NXP2 antibodies were negative. Serum C1 esterase inhibitor concentration and serum C4 were not dosed.

The diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis with anti-SAE was retained according to the criteria of EULAR/ACR 2017.

### Local injection of infliximab into calcinosis lesions in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM): a clinical trial [^9bec56a2]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects muscles and skin. One of the severe complications associated with JDM is calcinosis, and treating this condition presents significant challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of local injection of infliximab into calcinosis lesions in patients with JDM.

Methods

In this clinical trial, five patients diagnosed with JDM and calcinosis lesions were enrolled. The primary treatment consisted of weekly infliximab injections for 16 weeks, targeting all four sides of each lesion. Lesion dimensions, including length and width, were documented and monitored weekly. Before the intervention, patients underwent radiographic imaging. After the final injection in week 16, a follow-up radiographic assessment was performed. Data were analyzed using the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) method.

Results

The lesions' size significantly decreased in both length and width during each visit. On average, the lesion length reduced by 2.66%, and the width shrank by 3.32% per visit. Based on radiographic findings, the average length and width of lesions at the initial visit were 12.09 ± 5.05 mm (range: 6.00–25.50 mm) and 6.35 ± 3.00 mm (range: 2.00–16.00 mm), respectively. The average length and width at the last visit were 5.59 ± 7.05 mm (range: 0–23.00 mm) and 3.41 ± 4.05 mm (range: 0–13.00 mm), respectively. No specific side effects related to the treatment were reported.

Conclusions

The results suggest that the direct administration of infliximab into the calcinosis lesions of patients with JDM could be a safe and effective treatment approach.

Correspondence: I. Nikishina

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): P134

Introduction: Establishing the diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis (jDM) in pediatric patients is particularly challenging in the absence of classical manifestations such as Gottron's papules or erythema, heliotrope rash, proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase (CK), or disease-specific autoantibodies. Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) is not currently included in international diagnostic criteria for jDM but may prove useful in clinically ambiguous or atypical presentations.

Objectives: To evaluate the role of NVC within the diagnostic workup of children with suspected onset of a systemic connective tissue disease.

Methods: We present two unrelated female patients aged 2 and 4 years, referred to pediatric rheumatology following dermatological evaluation for persistent facial erythema of unclear origin. Initial working diagnoses included contact or allergic dermatitis. Screening tests revealed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), raising suspicion of a systemic connective tissue disease, prompting referral to rheumatology. Both patients underwent comprehensive laboratory and instrumental evaluation, including NVC.

Results: Clinical examination revealed persistent, slightly elevated, non-pruritic, non-scaling facial erythema in both cases. Classic cutaneous and muscular features of jDM (Gottron's papules/erythema, heliotrope rash, periorbital edema, proximal muscle weakness) were absent. ANA titers exceeded 1:640 in both patients. Immunoblot testing for anti-dsDNA, Sm, RNP, Ro, La, nucleosomes, Scl-70, and centromere antibodies was negative. Complement levels (C3, C4), CBC, urinalysis, ESR, and CRP were within normal ranges. The older patient had mildly elevated CK-MB and LDH, with normal total CK, ALT, and AST. NVC was performed as an additional diagnostic tool. In both cases, capillaroscopic findings showed a non-specific but characteristic pattern frequently seen in inflammatory myopathies, particularly dermatomyositis. Key features included altered loop morphology, reduced capillary density, disorganization, microhemorrhages, giant and bushy capillaries. These findings supported a presumptive diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis and guided further clinical management.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of paediatric, adolescent and adult patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy [^a910badc]. Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dermatomyositis and polymyositis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (management of cutaneous manifestations), BSR 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating systemic immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of ongoing skin disease activity, including reduced nailfold capillary density.

### Periorbital rash and scaly plaques in a 13-year-old boy [^f632f520]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
B. Atopic dermatitis
C. Allergic contact dermatitis
D. Clinically amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis (CAJDM)
E. Systemic sclerosis (SSc)

Answers:
A. Juvenile-onset SLE – Incorrect. Following the 2019 (American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria, a diagnosis of SLE cannot be made without systemic involvement and with normal laboratory data. Moreover, in SLE, facial lesions would present as a red, butterfly-shaped rash over the cheeks and nose and between the interphalangeal joints.
B. Atopic dermatitis – Incorrect. The absence of muscular involvement leads to a differential diagnosis with papulosquamous dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis. However, the clinical distribution of cutaneous lesions and the absence of spongiotic dermatitis in the skin biopsy specimen are against the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.
C. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Eyelid skin is susceptible to the actions of irritating or allergenic agents; therefore, it can frequently be affected in the context of contact dermatitis. However, violaceous color and cutaneous lesions on both hands cannot be related to an exogenous agent. A cutaneous biopsy would show spongiotic dermatitis.
D. CAJDM – Correct. CAJDM is defined by the presence of hallmark skin lesions of dermatomyositis (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, nailfold capillary changes, and poikiloderma involving the "V" of the chest and the upper back), with no clinical evidence of muscle disease. It represents less than 1% of all juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIMs). Cases of CAJDM can be classified as amyopathic (no markers of myositis) or hypomyopathic (laboratory, electrophysiologic, or radiologic evidence of myositis). Based on the 2017 (American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, the diagnosis could be assessed without a muscle biopsy.
E. SSc – Incorrect. Cutaneous involvement in SSc includes skin thickening, digital ulcers, megacapillaries in the proximal nailfold, calcinosis, and Raynaud phenomenon. However, papulosquamous plaques in the context of this connective tissue disorder are not usually found.

### Dermatomyositis in two siblings and a brief review of familial dermatomyositis [^127e0326]. Journal of Child Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Juvenile dermatomyositis is an uncommon autoimmune disease with classic heliotrope discoloration of the eyelids, erythematous skin rash of joints, and proximal muscle weakness. It is most frequently sporadic and only rarely familial. We present juvenile dermatomyositis in a 5-year-old brother and a 3 1/2-year-old sister, both are very responsive to corticosteroids. Familial dermatomyositis can occur in different family members, and even dermatomyositis and polymyositis can coexist in the same family.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^34ac647d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

Screening

We suggest systematic assessment and documentation of the presence or absence of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) and/or interstitial lung disease (ILD) in smokers who are undergoing lung cancer screening with a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Vote: Approved by 38 of 38 (100%).
We suggest a baseline chest CT scan to screen for ILAs/ILD in adults with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) that are associated with an increased risk of ILD. Remarks: CTDs that are associated with an increased risk of ILD include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antisynthetase syndrome, mixed CTD, Sjogren's disease, or overlap syndrome. Vote: Approved by 36 of 37 (97%).
(3a) We suggest chest CT screening for ILAs/ILD in adults ≥ 50 years of age who have a first-degree relative with familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF). Remarks: FPF is defined by at least two genetically related first- or second-degree relatives with fibrotic ILD. Vote: Approved by 34 of 36 (94%). (3b) We are neither in favor nor against chest CT screening for ILAs/ILD in adults ≥ 50 years of age who have a first-degree relative with IPF and no other known family members with ILD. Remarks: The lack of a recommendation reflects a lack of consensus among the committee. Vote: Approved by 20 of 37 (54%), not approved by 17 of 37 (46%).
We suggest not performing MUC5B testing as an initial test before more definitive chest CT screening for ILAs/ILD in adults ≥ 50 years of age who have a first-degree relative with pulmonary fibrosis (regardless of whether the first-degree relative has FPF or IPF and no other family members with ILD). Remarks: MUC5B testing refers to assessment of the MUC5B promoter variant (rs35705950). Vote: Approved by 37 of 37 (100%).
We suggest not performing telomere length measurement as an initial test before more definitive chest CT screening for ILAs/ILD in adults ≥ 50 years of age who have a first-degree relative with pulmonary fibrosis (regardless of whether the first-degree relative has FPF or IPF and no other family members with ILD). Vote: Approved by 37 of 37 (100%).

### 2022 EULAR recommendations for screening and prophylaxis of chronic and opportunistic infections in adults with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases [^dabfedfe]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend to screen for HBV infection in all patients eligible for treatment with conventional synthetic, biological, or targeted synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration).
