## Question

Acute angle glaucoma treatment of choice

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of choice for acute angle-closure glaucoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and why it is an emergency. Then, I should verify the immediate goals of therapy and the standard first-line approach. Next, I will examine the definitive treatment and its timing. After that, I need to consider alternatives when the cornea is too edematous or the attack is refractory. Finally, I should review special scenarios, the fellow eye, and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable conclusion with appropriate caveats and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its urgency. Acute angle-closure glaucoma, also termed acute primary angle closure or acute angle-closure crisis, is an ophthalmic emergency characterized by a rapid rise in intraocular pressure due to pupillary block, with corneal edema, mid-dilated nonreactive pupil, severe pain, and risk of irreversible optic nerve damage within hours if untreated, so I need to ensure we treat this as a time-critical emergency with a goal of rapid IOP reduction and angle reopening [^114UjVgQ] [^1116DC4b] [^1125PxVE].

> I will now examine the immediate goals of therapy. The priorities are to lower IOP quickly to relieve pain and corneal edema, prevent further optic nerve and trabecular meshwork damage, and stabilize the eye so that a definitive procedure can be performed safely. I should double-check that guidelines align with this sequence of medical stabilization followed by definitive laser or surgical intervention [^114UjVgQ] [^1116DC4b] [^11786A62].

> Next, I should review the standard first-line approach. Wait, let me verify the sequence: most authoritative guidelines recommend initiating medical therapy immediately to reduce IOP and clear corneal edema, then proceeding to laser peripheral iridotomy as soon as feasible. Typical medical therapy includes a topical beta-blocker such as timolol, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, and a topical alpha-2 agonist, with hyperosmotic agents added if IOP is very high, and pilocarpine given after other agents to constrict the pupil once the iris sphincter is more likely to respond at lower IOP [^114UjVgQ] [^1116DC4b] [^11786A62] [^11417Nn9] [^112ST8JZ] [^115MPpWY].

> Hold on, I should verify the definitive treatment and its rationale. Laser peripheral iridotomy is the preferred definitive procedure because it relieves pupillary block by creating a permanent bypass of aqueous from posterior to anterior chamber, thereby flattening the iris and opening the angle; it has a favorable risk–benefit profile and should be performed as soon as the cornea is sufficiently clear, ideally within hours of medical stabilization, with attention to post-laser IOP checks and steroid coverage to mitigate inflammation [^114UjVgQ] [^1116DC4b] [^112MaUao] [^112VG3ML].

> But wait, what if the cornea is too edematous to perform iridotomy immediately? I need to check alternatives that can rapidly lower IOP and improve corneal clarity. Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty can mechanically stretch the peripheral iris away from the trabeculum and has randomized data showing faster IOP reduction than systemic medications in the first 1–2 hours when iridotomy is not immediately possible; anterior chamber paracentesis can acutely decompress the eye and clear the cornea to enable iridotomy, though its effect is transient and must be followed by definitive therapy; these should be considered bridges to iridotomy rather than replacements [^113vBTGY] [^117YX4xV] [^116mKd9h] [^115irAs2].

> I should confirm the role of lens extraction, because I recall evolving evidence. Early phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation can be an effective alternative or adjunct, particularly in eyes with coexisting cataract or refractory angle closure. Randomized and systematic review data suggest better IOP control and fewer medications compared with laser iridotomy alone in some settings, but the certainty is low to moderate and the acute setting carries higher technical risk, so lens extraction is reasonable after the attack is broken or in select refractory cases rather than as universal first-line in the acute crisis itself [^113bTziy] [^115kHxfr] [^111dLW7C] [^113hUkMi].

> Let me consider the fellow eye, because I need to ensure we do not miss prophylaxis. Approximately half of fellow eyes with anatomically narrow angles will develop acute angle closure within 5 years, so prophylactic laser iridotomy is indicated in the fellow eye once the acute episode is stabilized, ideally within days to weeks, to prevent future attacks [^1116DC4b] [^1177ahGH].

> I should double-check special scenarios and refractory pathways. If medical therapy and laser fail to break the attack or IOP remains uncontrolled, options include incisional iridectomy, transscleral cyclophotocoagulation as a temporizing or adjunctive measure, and in selected cases early phacoemulsification with goniosynechialysis; trabeculectomy in the acute inflamed eye carries higher complication risk and is generally reserved for refractory cases or when other options are not feasible, with careful attention to malignant glaucoma risk and postoperative shallow chamber [^112MaUao] [^116ZCW6S] [^112s9ebK] [^113hUkMi].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. The treatment of choice for acute angle-closure glaucoma is a two-phase approach: immediate medical therapy to rapidly lower IOP and clear corneal edema, followed as soon as possible by laser peripheral iridotomy to definitively relieve pupillary block. Alternatives such as iridoplasty or paracentesis are used when corneal clarity precludes immediate iridotomy, and lens extraction or filtering surgery are reserved for refractory disease or specific anatomical contexts, with prophylactic iridotomy indicated in the fellow eye to prevent recurrence [^114UjVgQ] [^1116DC4b] [^11786A62].

---

The treatment of choice for acute angle-closure glaucoma is **immediate medical therapy to rapidly lower IOP** [^113STFoK] using topical beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and hyperosmotic agents, followed as soon as possible by **laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI)** [^1116DC4b] to definitively relieve pupillary block and prevent recurrence [^11786A62]. If LPI is not feasible due to corneal edema or unclear cornea, **argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI)** [^113vBTGY] is an effective alternative to break the attack [^117YX4xV]. Early lens extraction may be considered in select cases with coexisting cataract or refractory disease [^113bTziy] [^112MaUao], but LPI remains the standard definitive therapy [^1116DC4b].

---

## Initial medical management

Immediate medical therapy is essential to **rapidly reduce IOP** [^113STFoK], relieve symptoms, and prevent optic nerve damage [^1177ahGH]. The following medications are recommended:

- **Topical beta-blockers**: Timolol 0.5% [^11417Nn9] one drop immediately, repeated in 30 minutes if necessary [^notfound].
- **Topical alpha-agonists**: Apraclonidine 1% or brimonidine 0.2% one drop immediately, repeated in 30 minutes if necessary [^11786A62].
- **Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors**: Acetazolamide 500 mg IV or PO immediately, followed by 250 mg q6h [^111oG967] [^112ST8JZ].
- **Hyperosmotic agents**: Mannitol 1–2 g/kg IV or glycerol 1–1.5 g/kg PO if IOP remains elevated despite initial therapy [^11786A62].
- **Topical miotics**: Pilocarpine 1–2% every 15 minutes for 2 doses once IOP begins to decline [^11417Nn9].

---

## Definitive treatment: laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI)

Once IOP is controlled and corneal edema clears, **LPI is the definitive treatment** [^1116DC4b] because it relieves pupillary block, opens the angle, and prevents recurrence [^112MaUao]. LPI is preferred for its favorable risk–benefit profile and high success rate [^112MaUao].

---

## Alternative laser therapy: argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI)

If LPI is not immediately feasible due to corneal edema or an unclear view, **ALPI is an effective alternative** [^113vBTGY] that rapidly lowers IOP by flattening the peripheral iris and widening the angle [^116mKd9h].

---

## Role of lens extraction

Early phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation may be considered in select cases — particularly with coexisting cataract or refractory disease — and can provide **superior IOP control** [^113bTziy] and reduce medication burden compared with LPI alone [^115kHxfr]. However, LPI remains the standard initial definitive therapy [^1141r6ir].

---

## Summary of treatment protocol

1. **Topical beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, hyperosmotic agents**: Rapidly lower IOP and relieve symptoms [^11786A62]
2. **Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI)**: Definitive treatment to relieve pupillary block and prevent recurrence [^111H9Jhu]
3. **Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI)**: Alternative if LPI is not feasible [^113vBTGY]
4. **Early lens extraction (phacoemulsification)**: Consider in refractory cases or with coexisting cataract [^112MaUao]

---

The treatment of choice for acute angle-closure glaucoma is **immediate medical therapy** [^113STFoK] followed by **LPI** [^1116DC4b] to definitively relieve pupillary block and prevent recurrence. ALPI is an effective alternative when LPI is not immediately feasible [^113vBTGY], and early lens extraction may be considered in select cases [^113bTziy].

### Glaucoma [^1176mQQB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is characterised by progressive optic neuropathy and peripheral visual field loss. It affects 1% to 2% of white people aged over 40 years and accounts for 8% of new blind registrations in the UK. The main risk factor for glaucoma is raised intraocular pressure, but 40% of people with glaucoma have normal intraocular pressure and only 10% of people with raised intraocular pressure are at risk of optic-nerve damage. Glaucoma is more prevalent, presents earlier, and is more difficult to control in black people than in white populations.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for established primary open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or both? What are the effects of lowering intraocular pressure in people with normal-tension glaucoma? What are the effects of treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: laser trabeculoplasty (alone or plus topical medical treatment), topical medical treatments, and surgical trabeculectomy.

### Has the EAGLE landed for the use of clear lens extraction in angle-closure glaucoma? And how should primary angle-closure suspects be treated? [^111dLW7C]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Angle-closure glaucoma is an aggressive condition that causes millions to become blind worldwide. This review explores the use of prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy (PI) in patients classified as primary angle-closure suspects (PACS), and additionally, the use of clear lens exchange as a primary treatment option in established angle-closure disease with or without glaucoma. As PI has a strong prophylactic effect in fellow eyes of patients who have had an acute attack, its use has been widely adopted in those patients classified as PACS, but with limited evidence to support this. A large randomised trial conducted in China has demonstrated that although PI reduces the risk of incident angle-closure disease, the incidence of disease that would threaten vision was much lower than anticipated. This suggests that the benefit of prophylactic PI is very limited. Health services data shows an association between rising cataract surgical rates and of decreasing rates of acute angle-closure. Age-related growth of the lens is a major component of angle-closure disease. Several studies have shown that clear lens extraction (CLE) effectively lowers IOP in angle-closure. The use of CLE as a primary treatment option has been tested against LPI in the EAGLE study, a large RCT that enroled people with angle-closure and an IOP > 30mmHg, and those with angle-closure glaucoma. The trial showed CLE to be superior to PI both for IOP control and patient reported quality of life. On these grounds, CLE should be considered for first-line treatment of more advanced angle-closure disease.

### Trabeculectomy versus stepwise treatment for breaking the attack of acute primary angle closure in patients with long attack duration: study design and protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (LAAAC) [^116CNUYE]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is a common ophthalmic emergency for Chinese patients causing potential visual disabilities. According to current guidelines published by developed countries, a stepwise protocol (medication laser or paracentesis surgery) is recommended for emergency management of APAC. However, patients with APAC in China and developed countries differ in disease characteristics as the Chinese have longer attack duration and lower success rate in breaking the attack with solely medication or laser therapy. It has been proved that long attack duration is a risk factor for failed medical or laser therapies in subsiding APAC. Since prompt and effective treatment is pivotal in preserving visual function as well as avoiding APAC-induced blindness, direct trabeculectomy may largely benefit long-attacking patients with APAC in China.

Purpose

The Long-Attacking Acute Angle Closure study aims to compare long-term visual function and safety after different initial treatment strategies: direct surgery (trabeculectomy) or stepwise protocol for patients with APAC with attack duration longer than 72 hours.

Methods and Analysis

This is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial targeting Chinese patients with APAC duration longer than 72 hours. Eligible participants will be identified at either emergency department or glaucoma clinics, then randomised into stepped treatment group or trabeculectomy group using a computer central randomisation service. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after initial treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome is logMAR BCVA 1 year post initial treatment. Secondary outcomes consist of complete success rate in breaking the attack, intraocular pressure value, mean deviation on Humphrey visual field testing and vision-related quality of life collected using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (25 items) 1 year post initial treatment.

### Diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation followed by phacotrabeculectomy on medically unresponsive acute primary angle closure eyes: the long-term result [^112cRJpM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is a common ophthalmic emergency that requires early treatment. The longer the duration of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), the more irreversible damage there is to the optic nerve head, iris, lens, endothelium, and drainage pathways. Early aggressive management of an acute episode is crucial to prevent development of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) after APAC and to relieve the excruciating symptoms of the patients.

The conventional treatment for APAC is to reduce IOP medically, after which laser peripheral iridoplasty or iridotomy (LPI) is performed. However, in some eyes, the acute attack is severe and often refractory to medical treatment, and the prolonged poor cornea clarity of APAC patients limits the application of LPI. In such cases, trabeculectomy is occasionally performed as an urgent intervention. However, for medically unresponsive APAC cases, trabeculectomy on inflamed 'hot' eyes with high IOP poses a high risk of surgical failure and complications, such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage.

Is there any other method to control the high IOP of medically unresponsive APAC eyes? Diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (DLTSC), initially reserved for eyes with refractory glaucoma and limited visual prognosis, is now being used more widely, even as primary surgical treatment in glaucoma therapy, including primary open-angle and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, chronic angle closure glaucoma, and even eyes with good vision. In this study, we aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of DLTSC followed by phacotrabeculectomy on Chinese medically unresponsive APAC eyes.

We practice medicine in times of exponentially increasing medical knowledge. In 1950, it was estimated that the doubling time was 50 years; by 1980, it was 7 years and by 2010, 3.5 years. In 2020, it was projected to be just 73 days! To continue to practice evidence-based medicine and to provide the best possible care for our patients, clinicians need to adapt their strategies to keep their knowledge up to date. There will always be a role for critical appraisal of individual studies in the field of a clinician's practice, but with such an increase in the volume of published research, it becomes impossible to appraise all relevant material. For this reason, sources of distilled knowledge, such as the EGS Guidelines, become essential references for best practice medicine.
Rigorous methods for evidence synthesis, such as the systematic reviews overseen by Cochrane, provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of knowledge for important clinical questions. However, for many clinical uncertainties, there is little or no high-quality evidence, let alone an evidence synthesis. Where evidence is lacking, practice guidance needs to be built from expert opinion and consensus, while acknowledging the limitations of such an approach. Expert opinion, derived from sound medical knowledge and years of practice experience, also has an important role in understanding the relevance of lines of evidence and the nuances of implementing them in practice. Thus, the expert commentary around the evidence base given in these Guidelines is essential for proper implementation of published evidence. Importantly, the EGS Guidelines also include 'Choosing wisely' elements indicating actions which should be avoided due to insufficient evidence and/or unsubstantiated belief.
Guidelines need regular updating to take account of new knowledge and aspects of clinical care that have not been given sufficient emphasis in the past. This 6th Edition of the EGS Guidelines includes an updated 'evidence based' section with new clinical questions and evidence-based answers. The section 'What matters to patients' has also been updated, recognising that, because Guidelines are typically written by clinicians for clinicians, there have been gaps in understanding the patient perspective. The updated section now has direct input from the Expert by Experience patient advisors in the EGS Patient Involvement Project and includes eight Tips for Doctors in their communication with patients.
The Guidelines team, led by Drs Pazos, Traverso and Viswanathan, is to be congratulated for the 6th Edition of the Guidelines, updating and enhancing the previous edition, while maintaining the highly success format which gives a framework for glaucoma care, based on evidence synthesis and consensus expert opinion, and presented as a 'How to' manual for patient diagnosis and management.

The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Laser parameters should be individualized to each patient and adjusted appropriately during the procedure.

The following parameters are suggested [II, D]:

Complications:

Intraoperative complications Bleeding from the iridotomy site; this can usually be stopped by gentle pressure applied to the eye with the contact lens. With the argon laser corneal epithelial and/ or endothelial burns may develop.
Postoperative Visual disturbances occur in 6–12% (glare, blurring, ghost images, halo, crescent) are less likely to occur when the iridotomy is completely covered by the eyelid. Transient elevation of the IOP is the most common complication in the early period. Elevation of IOP at 1 hour after iridotomy occurs in approximately 10% of primary angle closure suspect eyes. Acute and (chronic) rise in IOP is more likely to occur in eyes with peripheral anterior synechiae in whom the small amount of trabecular meshwork not closed is likely to have compromised outflow function (and is secondarily closed by the iris pigment and tissue generated by the iridotomy). Postoperative inflammation is transient and mild, rarely resulting in posterior synechiae. Closure of the iridotomy may occur during the first few weeks after the procedure, due to accumulation of debris and pigment granules. Rare complications include sterile hypopyon, cystoid macular oedema, retinal haemorrhages and malignant glaucoma.

Postoperative management:

Check the IOP after 1–3 hours [II, D].

Topical corticosteroids for 4–7 days instilled 3–4 times a day.

Check the angle regularly with gonioscopy, and the patency of peripheral iridotomy.

If the patency is uncertain check with gonioscopy, reconsider the mechanism, perform ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) / anterior segment-optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) if available and/or repeat the iridotomy.

Retroillumination alone for judging the patency is insufficient.

### Glaucoma summary benchmarks – 2024 [^1116DC4b]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Primary angle-closure disease (management plan and indications) — in patients with Primary Angle-Closure Suspect (PACS), iridotomy may be considered to reduce the risk of developing angle closure, and in acute angle-closure crisis (AACC), use medical therapy first to lower the IOP to reduce pain and to clear corneal edema; iridotomy should then be performed as soon as possible. Laser iridotomy is the preferred surgical treatment for AACC because it has a favorable risk-benefit ratio; but patients with PACS who have not had an iridotomy should be warned of potential risk for AACC and certain medicines could cause pupil dilation and induce AAC. The fellow eye should be scheduled for a prophylactic iridotomy if the chamber angle is anatomically narrow, since approximately half of fellow eyes can develop AACC within 5 years. Given the lack of convincing evidence for prophylactic use of iridoplasty in patients with plateau iris, and since iridoplasty can be painful and may cause inflammation, the decision of whether to observe or treat these eyes is left to the judgment of the testing ophthalmologist.

### Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty versus conventional systemic medical therapy in treatment of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial [^113vBTGY]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To study whether argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI) is as effective and safe as conventional systemic medications in treatment of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) when immediate laser peripheral iridotomy is neither possible nor safe.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Participants

Seventy-three eyes of 64 consecutive patients with their first presentation of acute PACG, with intraocular pressure (IOP) levels of 40 mmHg or more, were recruited into the study.

Intervention

The acute PACG eye of each consenting patient received topical pilocarpine (4%) and topical timolol (0.5%). The patients were then randomized into one of two treatment groups. The ALPI group received immediate ALPI under topical anesthesia. The medical treatment group was given 500 mg of intravenous acetazolamide, followed by oral acetazolamide 250 mg four times daily, and an oral potassium supplement until IOP levels normalized. Intravenous mannitol also was administered to the latter group if the presenting IOP was higher than 60 mmHg. The acute PACG eye of both groups continued to receive topical pilocarpine (1%) until peripheral iridotomy could be performed.

Main Outcome Measures

Intraocular pressure profile, corneal clarity, symptoms, visual acuity, angle status by indentation gonioscopy, and complications of treatment.

Results

Thirty-three acute PACG eyes of 32 patients were randomized to receive immediate ALPI, whereas 40 acute PACG eyes of 32 patients had conventional systemic medical therapy. Both treatment groups were matched for age, duration of attack, and IOP at presentation. The ALPI-treated group had lower IOP levels than the medically treated group at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour after the start of treatment. The differences were statistically significant. The difference in IOP levels became statistically insignificant from 2 hours onward. The duration of attack did not affect the efficacy of ALPI in reducing IOP in acute PACG. No serious laser complications occurred, at least in the early postlaser period.

Conclusions

Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty significantly is more effective than conventional systemic medications in reducing IOP levels in acute PACG in eyes not suitable for immediate laser peripheral iridotomy within the first 2 hours from the initiation of treatment. Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty is a safe and more effective alternative to conventional systemic medications in the management of acute PACG not amenable to immediate laser peripheral iridotomy.

Evidence-based clinical guidelines — definitions and trustworthiness criteria are outlined, emphasizing that evidence-based clinical practice guidelines provide for the use of current best evidence in conjunction with clinical expertise and patient values to guide health care decisions. In Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, clinical practice guidelines are defined as statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. The report states that to be trustworthy, guidelines should be based on a systematic review of existing evidence, be developed by a knowledgeable, multidisciplinary panel of experts and key stakeholders, consider important patient subgroups and preferences, as appropriate, be based on a transparent process that minimizes conflicts of interest and biases, provide a clear explanation of the logical relationships between alternative care options and health outcomes, provide a grading of both the quality of evidence and the strength of the clinical recommendation, and be revised as appropriate when new evidence warrants modifications of recommendations. Based on the IOM/NASEM reports, the AOA Evidence-based Optometry (EBO) Committee developed a 14-step process to meet the new evidence-based recommendations for trustworthy guidelines.

### Conventional and emerging treatments in the management of acute primary angle closure [^116P3qCh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

The management of acute primary angle closure is directed at lowering the intraocular pressure and relieving pupil block. Conventional treatment involves the use of medical treatment and laser peripheral iridotomy, respectively, as a means for achieving these aims. Newer therapeutic strategies have been described that are potentially useful adjuncts or alternatives to conventional treatment. Emerging strategies that lower intraocular pressure include anterior chamber paracentesis, as well as laser procedures such as iridoplasty and pupilloplasty. A possible alternative to relieving pupil block is lens extraction, and may be combined with adjunctive measures such as goniosynechiolysis and viscogoniosynechiolysis. Trabeculectomy has a limited role in the acute setting. This review paper reviews the current evidence regarding conventional and newer treatment modalities for acute primary angle closure.

Strength of Clinical Recommendation Levels — definitions and clinician guidance are as follows: Strong Recommendation states that the benefits clearly exceed the harms and the quality of evidence is excellent (Grade A or B), and "This recommendation should be followed unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". Recommendation indicates benefits exceed harms but the evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C), and "This recommendation should generally be followed but remain alert for new information". Discretional notes that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms, and "There should be an awareness of this recommendation but a flexibility in clinical decision-making, as well as remaining alert for new information".

### Identifying new drugs and targets to treat rapidly elevated intraocular pressure for angle closure and secondary glaucomas to curb visual impairment and prevent blindness [^116fSsFV]. Experimental Eye Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A multitude of pharmacological compounds have been shown to lower and control intraocular pressure (IOP) in numerous species of animals and human subjects after topical ocular dosing or via other routes of administration. Most researchers have been interested in finding drug candidates that exhibit a relatively long duration of action from a chronic therapeutic use perspective, for example to treat ocular hypertension (OHT), primary open-angle glaucoma and even normotensive glaucoma. However, it is equally important to seek and characterize treatment modalities which offer a rapid onset of action to help provide fast relief from quickly rising IOP that occurs in certain eye diseases. These include acute angle-closure glaucoma, primary angle-closure glaucoma, uveitic and inflammatory glaucoma, medication-induced OHT, and other secondary glaucomas induced by eye injury or infection which can cause partial or complete loss of eyesight. Such fast-acting agents can delay or prevent the need for ocular surgery which is often used to lower the dangerously raised IOP. This research survey was therefore directed at identifying agents from the literature that demonstrated ocular hypotensive activity, normalizing and unifying the data, determining their onset of action and rank ordering them on the basis of rapidity of action starting within 30–60 min and lasting up to at least 3–4 h post topical ocular dosing in different animal species. This research revealed a few health authority-approved drugs and some investigational compounds that appear to meet the necessary criteria of fast onset of action coupled with significant efficacy to reduce elevated IOP (by ≥ 20%, preferably by > 30%). However, translation of the novel animal-based findings to the human conditions remains to be demonstrated but represent viable targets, especially EP 2 -receptor agonists (e.g. omidenepag isopropyl; AL-6598; butaprost), mixed activity serotonin/dopamine receptor agonists (e.g. cabergoline), rho kinase inhibitors (e.g. AMA0076, Y39983), CACNA2D1-gene product inhibitors (e.g. pregabalin), melatonin receptor agonists, and certain K + -channel openers (e.g. nicorandil, pinacidil). Other drug candidates and targets were also identified and will be discussed.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^114VahRE]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma management — goals and treatment modalities focus on control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in the target range, stable optic nerve/retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) status, and stable visual fields; ophthalmologists can lower IOP with medications, laser therapy, or incisional surgery, and randomized controlled trials provide evidence that these treatments reduce IOP and decrease the rate and incidence of progressive primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Additional considerations are that primary open-angle glaucoma is a chronic and usually asymptomatic condition in early stages; medical treatment requires adherence to single or multiple topical medications that can be expensive and may cause local or systemic side effects; laser or incisional surgery may also be indicated; visual field loss is associated with decreased quality of life; the effects of treatment, patient quality of life, comorbidities, and life expectancy are to be considered, and the diagnosis, severity, prognosis, management plan, and likelihood of long-term therapy should be discussed with the patient.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^115gUR5W]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Additional treatment after iridotomy for primary angle closure (PAC) or primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) — after alleviating pupillary block — is directed at lowering IOP to prevent or retard pressure-induced optic nerve damage and is similar to primary open-angle glaucoma care; reopening an appositionally closed angle by laser iridoplasty or a synechially closed angle with goniosynechialysis may improve aqueous outflow, especially when performed within 6 to 12 months of an acute angle-closure crisis (AACC). For elevated IOP threatening the optic nerve, management includes chronic topical ocular hypotensive agents, incisional surgery, and, rarely, laser trabeculoplasty if sufficiently open trabecular meshwork exists following LPI to expect a reasonable IOP reduction, and cataract extraction alone may lead to substantial IOP lowering in some PAC and PACG patients and can be considered as an option for treatment.

### To compare argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI) against systemic medications in treatment of acute primary angle-closure: mid-term results [^11796cpK]. Eye (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the clinical outcome of argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI) against systemic medications in treatment of acute primary angle-closure (APAC).

Methods

Consecutive patients with APAC were recruited and randomized to receive one of two treatment options: immediate ALPI or systemic acetazolamide ± mannitol. All eyes were followed up for at least 6 months after laser iridotomy. Main outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP) and requirement for glaucoma medications.

Results

A total of 41 eyes (39 patients) were randomized into the ALPI group, and 38 eyes (32 patients) into the medical treatment group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in sex, age, presenting IOP, and duration of attack. Mean follow-up duration ± SD was 15.7 ± 5.8 months. There were no significant differences between the two groups in mean final IOP and requirement for glaucoma medications.

Conclusions

There were no statistically significant differences in mean IOP and requirement for glaucoma drugs between APAC eyes treated with ALPI and systemic medications.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^112MaUao]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Acute angle-closure crisis — laser and surgical management: Laser iridotomy is the preferred surgical treatment because it has a favorable risk-benefit ratio; it relieves pupillary block and can prevent or retard the formation of PAS and can also result in significant angle widening and iris-profile flattening, and timely treatment may prevent damage to the optic nerve, trabecular meshwork, iris, lens, and cornea. If an iridotomy cannot be performed due to iris congestion or corneal edema, the cornea may sometimes be cleared with topical hyperosmotic agents, anterior chamber paracentesis, or iridoplasty, and once the attack is broken, it is usually possible to perform a definitive laser iridotomy immediately or soon afterward. When laser iridotomy is not possible or if the AACC cannot be medically broken, LPI, paracentesis, and incisional iridectomy remain effective alternatives; when incisional iridectomy is required and extensive synechial closure is recognized or suspected, simultaneous primary filtering surgery may be considered, and when concurrent glaucomatous cupping indicates a prolonged chronic course with considerable PAS on gonioscopy, filtering surgery can be considered, although in eyes with unbroken AACC filtering surgery has a high risk of anterior chamber shallowing postoperatively related to aqueous misdirection, choroidal effusions, or aqueous hyposecretion. Other options for AACC unresponsive to conventional treatment include primary phacoemulsification and cyclophotocoagulation, but a 2019 Cochrane Systematic Review identified only one ongoing study and no completed studies; thus, the selection of cyclophotocoagulation over other procedures should be left to the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist, in consultation with the individual patient, rated as I, Insufficient Quality, Discretionary Recommendation.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG) — recognition, initial treatment, and evacuation: AACG is caused by blockage of aqueous outflow with increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and signs include a nonreactive pupil that is mid-dilated (4 mm to 6 mm) with a taut globe on gentle closed‑lid palpation indicating elevated IOP; AACG is a medical emergency and requires emergent evacuation, with definitive treatment being surgical. If available, the guideline states "we recommend" initiating medical treatment using a beta‑adrenergic antagonist (timolol 0.5%, 1 drop in affected eye 2 times daily), an oral or intravenous carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide, 500 mg 2 times daily), and a topical alpha2‑adrenergic agonist, followed by a topical miotic (pilocarpine 1% to 2%, 1 drop every 15 min for 2 doses) given 1 h after other treatments, and patients should lie flat for at least 1 h. Recommendation ratings are: Medical management — Strong recommendation, moderate‑quality evidence; Surgical management — Strong recommendation, high‑quality evidence; Emergent evacuation — Strong recommendation, low‑quality evidence.

3.2.1.1 Setting the Target IOP

There is little evidence base to support any particular algorithm to set the Target IOP, but data from clinical trials may be used as a guide. As clinical trials have shown that progression occurs in eyes that have an IOP within the statistically normal range (< 21 mmHg), older recommendations that treated IOP should be simply within the statistically normal range are no longer regarded as sufficiently ambitious.

In newly diagnosed patients, the Target IOP is initially determined according to stage of disease and the starting IOP, with the treatment goal being a specific IOP level or a percentage reduction, whichever is the lower[II, D]. For instance, in early glaucoma, an IOP of < 21 mmHg with a reduction of at least 20% may be sufficient. In moderate glaucoma, an IOP < 18 mmHg with a reduction of at least 30% may be required [II, D]. Lower Target pressures may be needed in more advanced disease [I, D]. The Target IOP based on stage of disease and IOP then needs to be refined according to the presence of other risk factors, expected longevity of the patient, the burden of therapy and the patient preferences (See FC X)[II, D].

3.2.1.2 Achieving the Target IOP

Initial therapy may be with topical medication or laser trabeculoplasty [I, A]. The principles of adjusting therapy to achieve treatment targets are shown in Flow Charts IX - X - XI. To minimize side effects, the least amount of medication required to achieve the desired therapeutic response should be given. If a patient fails to attain the Target IOP during follow-up, and additional therapy is being considered, then the Target IOP should be reaffirmed to ensure that it is still appropriate [II, D].

### Trabeculectomy versus stepwise treatment for breaking the attack of acute primary angle closure in patients with long attack duration: study design and protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (LAAAC) [^112zYVT7]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Recruitment procedure

Potential eligible patients will be identified at the first medical visit for APAC at either the emergency department or glaucoma outpatient clinics. Recruitment will be performed by ophthalmologists.

After being assessed for eligibility and informed consent is given, basic medical treatment will start immediately. Those who declined participation will be asked for a reason for refusal. In the meantime, they will be randomised for subsequent treatment accordingly (figure 1). If the first APAC consultation were at the emergency departments, patients will be referred to glaucoma clinic at the latest in time (defined as the baseline visit) at the same centre for further evaluation and start preparation for surgery if applicable. On the other hand, if the first APAC consultation were at the glaucoma clinics, all baseline information would be acquired during this visit.

Figure 1
Patient flow. ALPI, argon laser peripheral iridoplasty; IOP, intraocular pressure; LPI, laser peripheral iridotomy.

Interventions

On first medical consultation, medical treatment will be initiated immediately regardless of randomisation. Medical therapies include IOP-lowering eye drops, as well as oral acetazolamide and intravenous mannitol if the presenting IOP exceeds 40 mm Hg. Patients will be monitored for 2–6 hours (based on the clinicians' judgement) to determine the effectiveness of treatment. IOP > 21 mm Hg indicates an escalation of treatment. All interventions will be performed following a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) among centres.

For those who remain unresponsive to medical or laser treatment while awaiting surgery, the performance of paracentesis can be done based on clinicians' judgement.

Stepped treatment

After initial medical treatment, patients with uncontrolled IOP in the stepped treatment group will go on to receive laser therapies (LPI or ALPI depending on the mechanism of angle closure and corneal status). When laser therapy is unavailable, AC paracentesis can be performed instead to temporarily reduce IOP, and then the patients will go on to receive laser treatment as soon as there is access. IOP will be measured at 1 hour, 2 hours and 24 hours after the completion of the procedure. IOP over 21 mm Hg after observation for 24 hours warrants surgery (trabeculectomy). Besides, achieving short-term abortion of the attack yet elevation of IOP > 21 mm Hg seen during follow-up visits (with maximum medication) is also an indication for trabeculectomy.

### Eliciting preferences in glaucoma management-a systematic review of stated-preference studies [^113b5m2i]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Preference research into the treatment of glaucoma is particularly interesting, as some treatments are associated with higher efficacy but can also lead to more side effects. Patients often have to decide whether a reduced probability of the disease worsening outweighs the risk of potential (serious) adverse events. Moreover, clinical endpoints that measure the efficacy of treatments, such as IOP, can be difficult to reflect on the patient's perspective. As the European Glaucoma Society guidelines state "The goal of care for people with glaucoma is to promote their well-being and quality of life, and patient preferences should be taken into account". For this reason, decisions should consider all aspects that impact their daily life, including disease-related health states, the process of care, and treatment preferences.

Whilst general reviews of stated-preference studies in health care have been carried out, none of these has specifically investigated glaucoma. Given the interest in preference studies, the increased number of relevant studies, and the new opportunities and challenges of managing glaucoma, a review that focuses on glaucoma is timely. Therefore, the purpose of our systematic review is to provide an overview and synthesis of all stated-preference experiments eliciting preferences of glaucoma patients and their healthcare professionals, to assess their quality, and to determine which attributes are valued as most important.

### Gold standard medical therapy for glaucoma: defining the criteria identifying measures for an evidence-based analysis [^111rGKW5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decade, several new medical therapies have become available for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). A systematic evidence-based approach for identifying an optimal therapeutic agent is lacking.

Objectives

The aims of this review were to critically evaluate published treatment recommendations for POAG and, based on a systematic review of the literature, to develop criteria that would define a "gold standard" medical therapy that reflects new treatment advances and established therapeutic goals.

Methods

A MEDLINE search spanning the years 1966 to 2002 and using the search terms gold standard, drug of choice, agent of choice, benchmark, ophthalmology, eye, and glaucoma was conducted and the results reviewed by a panel of 15 experts in the field of glaucoma. Published treatment recommendations for POAG were discussed. Criteria, anchored to medical evidence, for distinguishing a standard of medical therapy for POAG were defined.

Results

The terms connoting a gold standard therapy were found in only 258 of approximately 368,000 ophthalmology-related citations and 53 of almost 23,000 glaucoma citations, validating the need to define therapeutic standards. The lack of recommendations for the use of new classes of ocular hypotensive agents was acknowledged. Criteria identified to evaluate intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering agents as gold standards included the following: efficacy in reducing IOP consistently over a 24-hour period to a level that will preserve the visual field and protect the optic nerve without inducing tachyphylaxis and tolerance, paucity of local and systemic adverse effects, promotion of patient compliance, and applicability in diverse patient populations.

Conclusions

These criteria should be employed as measures for evidence-based analyses to evaluate available and future IOP-lowering medical therapies for POAG. The conceptual framework presented may be applicable to other therapeutic areas.

### Treatment choices for newly diagnosed primary open angle and ocular hypertension patients [^116ZYv72]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in our knowledge of the aetiology and pathophysiology of glaucoma, the sole proven, effective intervention for treating primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT) remains lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent further progression and visual loss. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the treatment choices available to newly diagnosed POAG and OHT patients. We review the existing literature on treatments currently available to newly diagnosed POAG and OHT patients and discuss their role in the treatment paradigm of POAG and OHT. We consider different factors that may be important when offering a choice of treatment to newly diagnosed POAG and OHT patients as well as describing new glaucoma treatments in development and future directions for treatment.

### Glaucoma: diagnosis and management [^111uTAm5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma is a group of eye disorders characterized by progressive deterioration of the optic nerve that can lead to vision loss. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form in the United States. The risk of POAG increases with age, family history of glaucoma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypotension, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, and myopia. Up to one-half of patients are undiagnosed because a diagnosis often requires monitoring over years to document changes suggesting POAG. These include a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 or greater, intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg on tonometry, nerve fiber layer defects identified on optical coherence tomography, and reproducible visual field defects. Topical intraocular pressure-lowering medications and selective laser trabeculoplasty are first-line treatments for POAG. Although POAG screening in the general adult population is not recommended, primary care physicians can help decrease POAG-related vision loss by identifying patients with risk factors and referring them for evaluation by an eye specialist. Medicare covers evaluations in patients at high risk. Primary care physicians should encourage medication adherence and identify barriers to treatment. The other type of glaucoma is angle-closure glaucoma, in which the flow of aqueous humor is obstructed. Angle-closure glaucoma can occur acutely with pupillary dilation and is an ophthalmologic emergency. The goal of treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma is to reduce intraocular pressure quickly with medications or surgery, then prevent the recurrence of the obstruction to aqueous flow by a definitive ophthalmologic procedure.

D: Lens extraction See FC VII

Clinical reports of phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in the treatment of acute, chronic, and secondary angle-closure ± glaucoma describe very favourable results. The appropriate role for lensectomy in the management of primary angle closure, however, still remains unproven. The first case-series study showed that cataract extraction was associated with a good reduction in IOP and a reduction in the number of medications required to control IOP.

A few prospective case series or randomized clinical trials have been performedor are ongoingto determine the value and comparative risks and efficacy of lens surgery, both clear lens extraction and cataract surgery, versus medical therapy, laser peripheral iridotomy, laser iridoplasty, and filtration procedures for the treatment of acute and chronic primary angle closure and for the prevention of chronic angle-closure glaucoma, both after and instead of laser peripheral iridotomy. Cataract surgery in PACG is generally more challenging and prone to complications than in normal eyes or eyes with POAG because of the shallow AC, larger lens, corneal oedema, poorly dilated or miotic pupil, extensive posterior synechiae, lower endothelial cell count, weaker zonules, especially after an acute angle closure attack.

In an eye with a clear lens: laser PI first. If the angle does not open and IOP not well controlled with unquestionable glaucomatous damage, consider to proceed with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation [I, D].

E: Trabeculectomy

Trabeculectomy in chronic PACG is also associated with higher risk of postoperative anterior chamber shallowing, malignant glaucoma, and a significant rate of cataract formation compared to POAG. Even when filtration surgery has successfully reduced the IOP, the ailing trabecular meshwork does not regain its function, and so the disease is not cured.

Combined lens extraction and trabeculectomy

In a study in CACG eyes with coexisting cataract, combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in significantly more surgical complications than phacoemulsification alone. Visual acuity or disease progression did not differ between the 2 treatment groups.

### Small-incision phacotrabeculectomy versus phacoemulsification in refractory acute primary angle closure with cataract [^116W7s23]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The timely management of acute PAC is important for reducing the risk of irreversible damage to the optic nerve head and preventing recurrent attacks and chronic angle closure glaucoma (CACG) progression. The retinal fiber layer thickness may decrease significantly within 16 weeks after the attack. Delay in presentation and the time needed to terminate the attack have been found to have a detrimental effect on the final outcome. Conventional options involve the use of medical treatment, paracentesis and laser peripheral iridotomy. In hospital clinics a few patients may be refractory to these treatments and the attack may remain unbroken. Operative options should be considered to lower IOP as soon as possible, but the timing of operations in an acute setting is controversial.

Recently, cyclodiode laser has been described as a safe and effective alternative in the management of medically uncontrolled acute PAC, and the authors demonstrate a good result in five patients only. Most ophthalmologists would consider that lensectomy or trabeculectomy is suboptimal in such situation because of greater risk of operative complications due to the small dimensions of the chamber and the tendency for choroidaleffusion. The complications of lensectomy are: corneal edema, posterior capsular rupture, bleeding, fibrinous inflammatory reaction, and posterior capsular opacification. The complications of trabeculectomy are: shallow anterior chamber, transient IOP elevation, hyphaema, and aqueous misdirection. In medically unresponsive cases of acute PAC, higher risk of surgical failure and complications make trabeculectomy not a preferred choice. In recent times, technological advances in phacoemulsification and small-incision trabeculectomy (SIT) make this option much more viable.

In cases of acute PAC or acute angle-closure glaucoma, phacoemulsification alone has been shown to achieve good IOP control. But IOP-spikes may appear in the early postoperative period and pose a potential threat. Phacotrabeculectomy plus intraocular lens implantation has been shown superior than trabeculectomy which is also superior than phacoemulsification in decreasing IOP for primary angle closure-glaucoma (PACG). Phacotrabeculectomy is more effective than phacoemulsification alone in controlling IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes with coexisting cataract. In eyes with synechial angle closure and cataract, the preferred option is to perform phacotrabeculectomy. With the progress of surgical technique, able to skillfully handle intraoperative and postoperative complications, more and more doctors tend to solve the two problems in combination.

### Lens extraction for chronic angle-closure glaucoma [^115kHxfr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is characterized by a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) secondary to aqueous outflow obstruction, with relative pupillary block being the most common underlying mechanism. There is increasing evidence that lens extraction may relieve pupillary block and thereby improve IOP control. As such, comparing the effectiveness of lens extraction against other commonly used treatment modalities can help inform the decision-making process.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of lens extraction compared with other interventions in the treatment of chronic PACG in people without previous acute angle-closure attacks.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trials registers (December 2019). We also screened the reference lists of included studies and the Science Citation Index database. We had no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lens extraction with other treatment modalities for chronic PACG.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs with 914 eyes. We obtained data for participants meeting our inclusion criteria for these studies (PACG only, no previous acute angle-closure attacks), resulting in 513 eyes included in this review. The participants were recruited from a diverse range of countries. We were unable to conduct meta-analyses due to different follow-up periods and insufficient data. One study compared phacoemulsification with laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) as standard care. Participants in the phacoemulsification group were less likely to experience progression of visual field loss (odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13 to 0.91; 216 eyes; moderate certainty evidence), and required fewer IOP-lowering medications (mean difference [MD] -0.70, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.51; 263 eyes; moderate certainty evidence) compared with standard care at 12 months. Moderate certainty evidence also suggested that phacoemulsification improved gonioscopic findings at 12 months or later (MD -84.93, 95% CI -131.25 to -38.61; 106 eyes). There was little to no difference in health-related quality of life measures (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.24; 254 eyes; moderate certainty evidence), and visual acuity (VA) (MD 2.03 ETDRS letter, 95% CI -0.77 to 4.84; 242 eyes) at 12 months, and no observable difference in mean IOP (MD -0.03mmHg, 95% CI -2.34 to 2.32; 257 eyes; moderate certainty evidence) compared to standard care. Irreversible loss of vision was observed in one participant in the phacoemulsification group, and three participants in standard care at 36 months (moderate-certainty evidence). One study (91 eyes) compared phacoemulsification with phaco-viscogonioplasty (phaco-VGP). Low-certainty evidence suggested that fewer IOP-lowering medications were needed at 12 months with phacoemulsification (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.05). Low-certainty evidence also suggested that phacoemulsification may have improved gonioscopic findings at 12 months or later compared to phaco-VGP (angle grading MD -0.60, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.29; TISA500 MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; TISA750 MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; 91 eyes). Phacoemulsification may result in little to no difference in best corrected VA at 12 months (MD -0.01 log MAR units, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.08; low certainty evidence), and the evidence is very uncertain about its effect on IOP at 12 months (MD 0.50 mmHg, 95% CI -2.64 to 3.64; very low certainty evidence). Postoperative fibrin reaction was observed in two participants in the phacoemulsification group and four in the phaco-VGP group. Three participants in the phaco-VGP group experienced hyphema. No data were available for progression of visual field loss and quality of life measurements at 12 months. Two studies compared phacoemulsification with phaco-goniosynechialysis (phaco-GSL). Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be little to no difference in mean IOP at 12 months (MD -0.12 mmHg, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.48; 1 study, 32 eyes) between the interventions. Phacoemulsification did not reduce the number of IOP-lowering medications compared to phaco-GSL at 12 months (MD -0.38, 95% CI -1.23 to 0.47; 1 study, 32 eyes; moderate certainty evidence). Three eyes in the phaco-GSL group developed hyphemas. No data were available at 12 months for progression of visual field loss, gonioscopic findings, visual acuity, and quality of life measures. Three studies compared phacoemulsification with combined phaco-trabeculectomy, but the data were only available for one study (63 eyes). In this study, low-certainty evidence suggested that there was little to no difference between groups in mean change in IOP from baseline (MD -0.60 mmHg, 95% CI -1.99 to 0.79), number of IOP-lowering medications at 12 months (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.42), and VA measured by the Snellen chart (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.12). Participants in the phacoemulsification group had fewer complications (risk ratio [RR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.04), and the phaco-trabeculectomy group required more IOP-lowering procedures (RR 5.81, 95% CI 1.41 to 23.88), but the evidence was very uncertain. No data were available for other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate certainty evidence showed that lens extraction has an advantage over LPI in treating chronic PACG with clear crystalline lenses over three years of follow-up; ultimately, the decision for intervention should be part of a shared decision-making process between the clinician and the patient. For people with chronic PACG and visually significant cataracts, low certainty evidence suggested that combining phacoemulsification with either viscogonioplasty or goniosynechialysis does not confer any additional benefit over phacoemulsification alone. There was insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding phacoemulsification versus trabeculectomy. Low certainty evidence suggested that combining phacoemulsification with trabeculectomy does not confer any additional benefit over phacoemulsification alone, and may cause more complications instead. These conclusions only apply to short- to medium-term outcomes; studies with longer follow-up periods can help assess whether these effects persist in the long term.

### Phacoemulsification combined with goniosynechialysis for acute angle-closure glaucoma: impact of preoperative IOP status [^1162uCoJ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is an irreversible, rapidly progressive blinding eye disease characterized by acute onset. Acute angle-closure glaucoma(AACG) constitutes the predominant form of PACG. Research has demonstrated that the incidence of PACG is closely associated with anatomical factors, such as microcornea, shallow anterior chamber, narrow anterior chamber angle, short axial length, thick and anteriorly positioned lens, prominent iris fold, and elevated choroidal intravascular pressure — all established risk factors. Age progression is another significant contributor to PACG development. The primary goal in glaucoma management is maintaining intraocular pressure (IOP) at near-normal levels. However, in clinical practice, some AACG patients exhibit persistently elevated IOP despite maximal medical therapy (systemic and topical treatments). For these cases, aggressive IOP reduction before surgery is essential to optimize subsequent treatment outcomes. Laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPIP) is a well-established first-line treatment for AACG. Additionally, anterior chamber paracentesis has been consistently shown to facilitate rapid IOP reduction. In pupillary block cases, lens extraction remains a gold-standard approach to relieve obstruction and control IOP. Evidence further suggests that phacoemulsification combined with goniosynechialysis achieves superior IOP control compared to cataract extraction alone.

To provide a stronger theoretical basis for AACG treatment, we compared anterior segment structures between normotensive and hypertensive groups, while also analyzing postoperative changes in visual acuity (VA), IOP, and surgical complications.

2.4.1.7.5 Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma (CACG) (See FC VIII)

Etiology:

Permanent synechial closure of any extent of the chamber angle as confirmed by indentation gonioscopy.

Pathomechanism: See Ch. 2.4.1.5

Features:

Signs:

Peripheral anterior synechiae of any degree at gonioscopy
IOP elevated to a variable degree depending on the extent of iridotrabecular contact, above 21 mmHg
Visual acuity according to functional status (may be normal)
Damage of optic nerve head compatible with glaucoma
Visual field defects "typical" of glaucoma may be present
Superimposed intermittent or acute iridotrabecular contact possible

Symptoms:

Visual disturbances according to functional states.
Usually no pain; sometimes discomfort
Transient "halos" when intermittent closure of the total circumference causes acute IOP elevations

Treatment:

Medical treatment alone is contraindicated as all patients require relief of pupil block by iridotomy, iridectomy or lens extraction [I, D]. If the synechial closure is less than half the circumference, iridectomy/iridotomy may be sufficient.

Since complications of iridotomy are uncommon, its use as the initial procedure is justified in practically every case [I, D].

Argon laser trabeculoplasty is contraindicated as it may increase synechial angle-closure [I, D]. Lens removal may be considered at all stages and can lead to relief of pupil block and sufficient IOP control [II, D].

If IOP cannot be controlled medically after breaking pupil block (with or without lens extraction), a filtering procedure is indicated [II, D].

These eyes are more frequently prone to develop posterior aqueous misdirection and the necessary precautions must be taken when considering surgery.

### Trabeculectomy versus stepwise treatment for breaking the attack of acute primary angle closure in patients with long attack duration: study design and protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (LAAAC) [^114Xkjdq]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Abstract:

Introduction

Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is a common ophthalmic emergency for Chinese patients causing potential visual disabilities. According to current guidelines published by developed countries, a stepwise protocol (medication laser or paracentesis surgery) is recommended for emergency management of APAC. However, patients with APAC in China and developed countries differ in disease characteristics as the Chinese have longer attack duration and lower success rate in breaking the attack with solely medication or laser therapy. It has been proved that long attack duration is a risk factor for failed medical or laser therapies in subsiding APAC. Since prompt and effective treatment is pivotal in preserving visual function as well as avoiding APAC-induced blindness, direct trabeculectomy may largely benefit long-attacking patients with APAC in China.

Purpose

The Long-Attacking Acute Angle Closure study aims to compare long-term visual function and safety after different initial treatment strategies: direct surgery (trabeculectomy) or stepwise protocol for patients with APAC with attack duration longer than 72 hours.

Methods and analysis

This is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial targeting Chinese patients with APAC duration longer than 72 hours. Eligible participants will be identified at either emergency department or glaucoma clinics, then randomised into stepped treatment group or trabeculectomy group using a computer central randomisation service. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after initial treatment.

Main outcomes and measures

The primary outcome is logMAR BCVA 1 year post initial treatment. Secondary outcomes consist of complete success rate in breaking the attack, intraocular pressure value, mean deviation on Humphrey visual field testing and vision-related quality of life collected using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (25 items) 1 year post initial treatment.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^115XUXVU]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect — medication adjustment and regimen planning emphasize that if a drug fails to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) sufficiently, switching to an alternative monotherapy or adding another medication is appropriate until the desired IOP level is attained, and fixed combination therapy may improve patient adherence even though it is not recommended for initial treatment in most circumstances. The patient and the ophthalmologist together decide on a practical regimen considering dosing, cost, adherence, age, and preferences; the ophthalmologist should assess local ocular and systemic side effects and toxicity, including interactions and potential life-threatening adverse reactions, and patients can be educated about eyelid closure or nasolacrimal occlusion to reduce systemic absorption after instillation.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^115xvoZr]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Acute angle-closure crisis (AACC) — algorithm for initial and definitive management specifies the following pathway: begin with "Medical therapy to break attack and prepare patient for laser iridotomy". If the view is not clear, use "Topical glycerin, compression, paracentesis, or iridoplasty to clear the view". Once the view is adequate, determine etiology: for "Evidence for secondary cause of acute IOP elevation (e.g. NVI, intraocular tumor, ICE syndrome, etc.)", proceed to "Treat pathology of secondary acute IOP elevation and lower IOP medically or surgically". For "Definite evidence for PACD mechanism of AACC", perform "Prompt laser iridotomy". After iridotomy, the algorithm bifurcates by pressure status into "IOP controlled", leading to "Follow-up with dark-room gonioscopy to assess adequacy of angle opening", versus "IOP uncontrolled", which directs "Dark-room gonioscopy to assess other mechanisms of angle closure", "Ascertain continued patency of iridotomy", and "Medical and surgical treatment (incisional iridotomy or cataract surgery + goniosynechiolysis or trabeculectomy) to lower IOP".

Implications

Anesthesia may acutely reveal angle-closure glaucoma. This complication is an ophthalmologic emergency. However, symptoms of acute glaucoma may be overlooked or misinterpreted in a sedated or comatose patient, and this may result in delayed treatment. Immediate diagnosis and appropriate treatment should be done to prevent visual loss.

B: Surgical Treatment

Neodymium YAG laser iridotomy Laser iridotomy should be attempted if the cornea is sufficiently clear [I, C]. Argon laser iridotomy is rarely performed nowadays but thermal laser pre-treatment (e.g. argon) of dark irides reduces total YAG energy required[II, B]
Surgical iridectomy Transcorneal approach. Advantages: – No conjunctival scarring – A water-tight self-sealing incision is possible Disadvantages: – Technically more difficult in dilated fixed pupil and flat anterior chamber – More traction an iris with increased risk of haemorrhage
Corneoscleral approach Advantages: – Iridectomy can be basal Disadvantages: – Conjunctival wound may lead to scarring compromising the outcome of a filtering procedure which may become necessary at a later stage insufficient wound closure and aqueous misdirection may occur in rare cases
General advantages of surgical iridectomy: – It can be performed even when the cornea is cloudy – It allows deepening of the anterior chamber, breaking freshly formed PAS
– General disadvantages of surgical iridectomy: – All the potential risks of any intraocular procedure in an eye with angle closure

C: Argon Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty (ALPI)

There is now some evidence from randomised controlled trials that ALPI can break an attack of acute angle closure as or more swiftly than medical therapy. Many glaucoma specialists now routinely use ALPI if topical treatment + acetazolamide have not broken an attack within an hour, prior to considering hyper-osmotics. ALPI is also a useful procedure to eliminate appositional angle closure resulting from mechanisms other than pupillary block (i.e.: plateau iris configuration).

Diode Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty has greater penetration of an oedematous cornea but has been less extensively studied.

Anterior chamber paracentesis is being evaluated to break the attack in cases that are refractory to medical management.

3.4.5 Improving Adherence

There are different ways for improving the adherence of patients. The most important measures are informing the patient about his/her disease and finding a therapeutic regimen which fits into the patient's life-style[I, D].

Other factors which should improve adherence [I, D]:

– The therapy should be simple i.e. not more than two bottles and an application not more than twice a day
– The patient should be instructed how to apply the drops correctly. If necessary, hints reminders should be given like a daily routine which the patient can connect to the application of the drops. If a patient has physical problems applying the drops as arthritis of the fingers, the therapy should be adjusted accordingly or switched to laser/surgery
– The doctor should inquire at every visit if the patient has side effects of the medication and switch if necessary. A patient who complains about side effects is usually not adherent to therapy.

The patient's cooperation, described as adherence and persistence, with the prescribed glaucoma management is mandatory to obtain effective IOP lowering and to prevent glaucoma progression. No drug can work unless it is taken.

3.5 - Laser Surgery

3.5.1 Laser Iridotomy >

Indications: [I, C]

Clinically relevant or suspected pupillary block.

Potential prevention of acute and chronic angle closure (See FC X and XI).

Preoperative preparation:

To reduce iris thickness and facilitate perforation instil 1 drop of Pilocarpine 2%-4% [I, D]. If the cornea is edematous, like acute angle closure, use topical glycerin 10% if available, systemic acetazolamide, intravenous mannitol or oral hyperosmotic agents (See FC XI). For prevention of IOP spikes use topical alpha 2 agonist 1 hour prior to the procedure and immediately afterwards [I, B].

Procedure:

After instillation of topical anesthetic a contact lens with contact lens fluid is placed onto the cornea. The lens keeps the eyelids open, stabilizes the eye, provides additional magnification, focuses the laser beam and acts as a heat sink.

Field measurement of IOP is often not possible, but "gentle palpation of the globe through a closed lid may reveal a taut globe indicating elevated IOP". AACG "requires emergent evacuation, as the definitive treatment is surgical".

### Small-incision phacotrabeculectomy versus phacoemulsification in refractory acute primary angle closure with cataract [^112Av2r5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute primary angle closure (PAC) is one of the most common ophthalmic emergencies. Many ocular risk factors have been shown to lead to acute PAC, including hyperopia, shallow anterior chamber depth (ACD), thick crystalline lens and short axial length. Without treatment patients may develop primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) and progressive vision loss. Higher rates are reported in Asian populations compared to other races. Prompt and effective intervention is required to control intraocular pressure (IOP), relieve pupil block, reopen the anterior angle, avoid further attacks and prevent damage to the optic nerve. The initial treatment of acute PAC include medications, paracentesis, laser peripheral iridotomy and etc. The role for surgical iridectomy and emergency trabeculectomy in the modern management of acute PAC is diminishing. But in practice, some cases in Asian eyes are refractory to conventional treatment and IOP is beyond control. Surgical intervention may be required. In the study we defined "refractory" as conventional management did not achieve IOP control or relieve symptoms despite maximally tolerated medications or other non- surgically methods.

Primary lens extraction as treatment for acute PAC has been proved to relieve pupil block and result in good IOP control. Because primary trabeculectomy early in acute PAC has a greater failure rate and higher incidence of complications, including shallow anterior chamber, malignant glaucoma, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and endophthalmitis, trabeculectomy alone or combined lens extraction is occasionally used as the final step in the management of acute PAC, when all other modalities of treatment is failed. While, with the development of new surgical technique and shift in views, it has been shown that trabeculectomy is safe and effective for PACG with persistent ocular hypertension. The purpose of the current study was to compare primary small-incision phacotrabeculectomy (phacotrab) with phacoemulsification (phaco) on visual acuity (VA), IOP, ACD, glaucoma medications and complications in patients with refractory acute PAC and coexisting cataract.

### Laser peripheral iridoplasty for angle-closure [^114suacH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Treatment is aimed at opening the anterior chamber angle and lowering the IOP with medical and/or surgical treatment (e.g. trabeculectomy, lens extraction). Laser iridotomy works by eliminating pupillary block and widens the anterior chamber angle in the majority of patients. When laser iridotomy fails to open the anterior chamber angle, laser iridoplasty may be recommended as one of the options in current standard treatment for angle-closure. Laser peripheral iridoplasty works by shrinking and pulling the peripheral iris tissue away from the trabecular meshwork. Laser peripheral iridoplasty can be used for crisis of acute angle-closure and also in non-acute situations.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of laser peripheral iridoplasty in the treatment of narrow angles (i.e. primary angle-closure suspect), primary angle-closure (PAC) or primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in non-acute situations when compared with any other intervention. In this review, angle-closure will refer to patients with narrow angles (PACs), PAC and PACG.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 5 January 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this review. Patients with narrow angles, PAC or PACG were eligible. We excluded studies that included only patients with acute presentations, using laser peripheral iridoplasty to break acute crisis.

Data Collection and Analysis

No analysis was carried out as only one trial was included in the review.

Main Results

We included one RCT with 158 participants. The trial reported laser peripheral iridoplasty as an adjunct to laser peripheral iridotomy compared to iridotomy alone. The authors report no superiority in using iridoplasty as an adjunct to iridotomy for IOP, number of medications or need for surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no strong evidence for laser peripheral iridoplasty's use in treating angle-closure.

### Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation in refractory acute and chronic angle closure glaucoma [^116ZCW6S]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Angle closure glaucoma, both acute and chronic, is a major cause of blindness worldwide. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCP) is conventionally undertaken non-urgently in patients with advanced glaucoma and poor visual potential with poor control of intraocular pressure (IOP). We describe a case of a patient with refractory acute angle closure glaucoma and severe pain in whom emergency TSCP was undertaken 12h after presentation, reducing the IOP from 68 to 10mmHg. Further, a patient with chronic angle closure glaucoma underwent TSCP, reducing the IOP from 78 to 14mmHg. Both patients consequently underwent uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery with preservation of visual acuity and long-term IOP control. TSCP may achieve prompt IOP control and symptomatic relief in the acute setting in patients with acute and chronic forms of angle closure glaucoma refractory to medical therapy. TSCP may reduce the risk of definitive surgical intervention by temporising phacoemulsification or trabeculectomy surgery until the IOP is well controlled.

Study endpoints

For those completing a 1-year follow-up, the study reaches its endpoint at 1 year after the initial treatment.

Participants automatically withdraw from the study when:

Missing three consecutive follow-ups or more.
With poor treatment compliance.
Death or suffering from newly diagnosed systemic diseases impeding regular follow-up.

Study endpoint is defined as the last follow-up before withdrawal. However, if any patient violates treatment protocol or lacks essential information which hinders the judgement of efficacy and safety of the trial, they will be excluded from final data analysis.

Outcome measurements and data collection

Outcomes and adverse events will be recorded on a trial-specific case report form. Demographic information, along with medical history of each recruited participant, will be documented at baseline. Extensive ophthalmological examinations of BCVA, IOP and slit-lamp examination will be performed as well if the patients are first presented at the emergency department. Subsequent examination will be completed after referral at glaucoma clinics including gonioscopy, ultrasound biomicroscopy, anterior segment photography, fundus photography, Humphrey visual field (VF), a visual quality questionnaire, optical coherence tomography, specular microscopy and IOL master. Of note, we attach great significance to recording a precise TST (hours), time from presentation to the subsidence of the attack and (if the cornea is oedematous due to the attack) time from symptoms to cornea restoring transparency will also be recorded. During follow-up, we intend to document any related adverse events, poorly controlled IOP needing treatment upgrade and cataract surgeries.

Primary outcomes

The primary outcome of this study is BCVA measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR E visual acuity (VA) charts1 year post initial treatment. Notably, resolved attack or controlled IOP do not completely equal good visual outcome, considering that patients' attack duration in different groups may considerably vary due to waiting treatment elevation. Also, since VA most directly reflects one's visual function and concerns patients with glaucoma the most, it would be the most appropriate option for the primary outcome of this study.

ETDRS VA is designed to inspect visual impairment in clinical trials. If no letter could be read on the chart, vision of finger count, hand movement, light perception and no light perception will be recorded accordingly. VA examiners are all verified ophthalmologists, have undergone unified training and masked from treatment assignment.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^1177ahGH]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary angle closure disease (PACD) — treatment rationale and care process state that pupillary block is involved in the pathogenesis of PACD in most cases and is resolved with laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI); patients experiencing acute angle-closure crisis (AACC) should receive medical treatment to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP), and LPI should subsequently be performed in both eyes. Lens extraction has also been shown to be an effective treatment in some patients with primary angle closure and primary angle closure glaucoma. The goals of managing PACD are to reverse or prevent angle closure and to control IOP to prevent glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and dark-room dynamic gonioscopy should be performed to diagnose PACD and verify improvement in angle configuration following treatment; ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography can also aid in the diagnosis of PACD.

2.4.1.2 Staging of Primary Angle-closure123

Primary Angle-closure Suspect (PACS) Two or more quadrants of iridotrabecular contact (lTC), normal IOP, no PAS, no evidence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON).
Primary Angle-closure (PAC) Iridotrabecular contact resulting in PAS and/or raised IOP. No evidence of GON.
Primary Angle-closure Glaucoma (PACG) Iridotrabecular contact causing GON; PAS and raised IOP may be absent at the time of initial examination.

2.4.1.3 Ocular Damage in Angle-closure

Primary angle-closure (PAC) may cause ocular tissue damage in many ways. Corneal endothelial cell loss occurs after symptomatic "acute" angle-closure. With very high IOP values the iris may suffer ischaemic damage to musculature causing iris whirling (distortion of radially orientated fibres) and/or a dilated, unresponsive pupil. The lens epithelium may suffer focal necrosis causing anterior sub-capsular or capsular opacity of the lens associated with focal epithelial infarct called "Glaukomflecken". The trabecular meshwork can be damaged by the formation of PAS, or as the result of long- standing appositional closure. Optic neuropathy in angle-closure may manifest in at least 2 ways. After an "acute" symptomatic episode, the disc may become pale but flat, suggesting an anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Typical glaucomatous optic neuropathy manifests in with an excavated surface and a pattern of visual field loss indistinguishable from open-angle glaucoma. Angle-closure accounts for 50% of all glaucoma blindness worldwide, and is probably the most visually destructive form of glaucoma.

2.4.1.4 Outcome following treatment

In asymptomatic ("chronic") angle-closure, a high presenting pressure (> 35 mmHg), more than 6 clock hours of peripheral anterior synechiae and/or established glaucomatous optic neuropathy are signs that a case of angle-closure will not respond fully to a laser iridotomy, and that a trabeculectomy may be needed to control pressure" [II, D].

### Laser peripheral iridoplasty for chronic angle closure [^114nN9Ug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In at least a third of primary angle closure cases, appositional angle closure persists after laser peripheral iridotomy, and further intervention may be considered. Laser peripheral iridoplasty (LPIp) can be used in treating chronic angle closure when angle closure persists after laser peripheral iridotomy. Previous reviews have found insufficient data to determine its clinical effectiveness, compared to other interventions. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008 and updated in 2012. It examines all studies to date to establish whether LPIp shows any effectiveness over other available treatment options.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of laser peripheral iridoplasty in the treatment of people with chronic angle closure, when compared to laser peripheral iridotomy, medical therapy or no further treatment.

Search Methods

We searched various electronic databases. The date of the search was 20 December 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the use of LPIp in cases of suspected primary angle closure (PACS), confirmed primary angle closure (PAC), or primary chronic angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). We applied no restrictions with respect to gender, age or ethnicity of participants. Trials evaluating LPIp for acute attacks of angle closure were not eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently assessed studies for risk of bias using Cochrane's 'risk of bias' tool. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.

Main Results

We included four RCTs involving 252 participants (276 eyes). In total, three different methods of intervention were used and 15 outcomes reported, with different time points. We used narrative synthesis to describe the majority of the findings, as meta-analysis was only possible for a limited number of outcomes due to the variation in study design and outcomes assessed. Study Characteristics Participants were adults recruited from outpatient settings in the UK, Singapore, China and Korea with either PACS, PAC or PACG. All studies compared argon LPIp (as either a primary or secondary procedure) to an alternative intervention or no further treatment. Three studies were of parallel group design, and one within-person, randomised by eye. All studies showed elements of high risk of bias. Due to the nature of the intervention assessed, a lack of masking of both participants and assessors was noted in all trials. Findings Laser peripheral iridoplasty with iridotomy versus iridotomy alone as a primary procedure Two RCTs assessed the use of argon LPIp as a primary procedure with peripheral iridotomy, compared with peripheral iridotomy alone. However, neither study reported data for the primary outcome, disease progression. Argon LPIp showed no evidence of effect on: final mean intraocular pressure (IOP) at 3 months and 12 months (mean difference (MD) 0.39 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.07 to 1.85; I² = 38%; 2 studies, 174 participants; low-certainty evidence); further surgical or laser intervention at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.21; 1 study, 126 participants; low-certainty evidence); or mean number of additional medications required at 12 months (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.54; 1 study, 126 participants; low-certainty evidence). Complications were assessed at 3 to 12 months (2 studies, 206 participants; low-certainty evidence) and found to be mild and uncommon, with comparable levels between groups. The only severe complication encountered was one case of malignant glaucoma in one study's argon LPIp group. Quality of life measures were not assessed. In the other study, investigators found that argon LPIp showed no evidence of effect on final mean anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) measurements, including anterior chamber depth (MD 0.00 mm, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10; 24 participants, 48 eyes; very low-certainty evidence). Laser peripheral iridoplasty as a secondary procedure versus no treatment One RCT assessed the use of argon LPIp as a secondary procedure compared with no further treatment in 22 participants over three months. Disease progression, additional medications required, complications, further surgical or laser intervention, and quality of life outcomes were not assessed. There was only very low-certainty evidence regarding final maximum IOP value (MD -1.81 mmHg, 95% CI -3.11 to -0.51; very low-certainty evidence), with no evidence of effect on final minimum IOP values (MD -0.31 mmHg, 95% CI -1.93 to 1.31; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of argon LPIp on AS-OCT parameters. The trial did not report AS-OCT measurements for the control group. Laser peripheral iridoplasty as a secondary procedure versus medication One RCT assessed the use of argon LPIp as a secondary procedure compared with travoprost 0.004% in 80 participants over 12 months. The primary outcome of disease progression was reported for this method: argon LPIp showed no evidence of effect on mean final cup/disk ratio (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.05; low-certainty evidence). Argon LPIp showed no evidence of effect for: mean change in IOP (MD -1.20 mmHg, 95% CI -2.87 to 0.47; low-certainty evidence) or mean number of additional medications (MD 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; low-certainty evidence). Further surgical intervention was required by one participant in the intervention group alone, with none in the control group (low-certainty evidence). No serious adverse events were reported, with mild complications consisting of two cases of 'post-laser IOP spike' in the argon LPIp group. Quality of life measures were not assessed. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of argon LPIp on AS-OCT parameters. The trial did not report AS-OCT measurements for the control group. Adverse events Availability of data were limited for adverse effects. Similar rates were observed in control and intervention groups, where reported. Serious adverse events were rare.

After reviewing the outcomes of four RCTs, argon LPIp as an intervention may be no more clinically effective than comparators in the management of people with chronic angle closure. Despite a potential positive impact on anterior chamber morphology, its use in clinical practice in treating people with chronic angle closure is not supported by the results of trials published to date. Given these results, further research into LPIp is unlikely to be worthwhile.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^114BoAAZ]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Primary angle-closure disease — management when iridotomy is indicated states that in Primary Angle-Closure Suspect (PACS) patients, iridotomy may be considered to reduce risk of angle closure; in acute angle-closure crisis (AACC), use medical therapy first to lower IOP and clear corneal edema, and iridotomy should then be performed as soon as possible; laser iridotomy is the preferred surgical treatment for AACC and PACS patients without prior iridotomy should be warned of potential AACC risk and medicine-induced pupil dilation; selection of cyclophotocoagulation over other procedures should be left to the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist with the individual patient.

### Efficacy and safety of immediate anterior chamber paracentesis in the treatment of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma: a pilot study [^115irAs2]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the safety and effectiveness of immediate anterior chamber paracentesis, combined with antiglaucomatous medications, in the intraocular pressure control and relief of symptoms of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG).

Design

Prospective noncomparative case series.

Participants

Eight consecutive patients with their first attack of acute PACG, with intraocular pressure ≥ 50 mmHg, were recruited into the study.

Intervention

On presentation, each patient received topical pilocarpine (4%) and timolol (0.5%), immediate anterior chamber paracentesis, and systemic acetazolamide and mannitol as primary treatment. The intraocular pressures at 15 and 30 minutes, and then at 1, 2, 3, 12, and 24 hours, were documented by applanation tonometry.

Main Outcome Measures

Symptoms, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, corneal edema, angle status on gonioscopy, pupillary size, and reaction.

Results

Ten eyes of eight patients seen with acute PACG were recruited. The mean intraocular pressure was reduced from 66.6 ± 9.1 mmHg to 15.1 ± 3.5 mmHg immediately after paracentesis, and then to 17.1 ± 7.0 mmHg at 15 minutes, 21.7 ± 10.2 mmHg at 30 minutes, 22.7 ± 11.0 mmHg at 1 hour, and 20.1 ± 14.6 mmHg at 2 hours after paracentesis. The mean intraocular pressure was less than 21 mmHg at 2 hours and beyond. There was instant symptomatic relief for all patients. No complications from the paracentesis were encountered.

Conclusions

From this preliminary study, immediate paracentesis seems to be safe and effective in controlling the intraocular pressure and eliminating symptoms in acute PACG.

### Family practice international… [^114SyxpJ]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Treating Patients with Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma When the trabecular mesh-work is blocked at the junction of the cornea and iris, the resulting rise in intraocular pressure can reach dangerously high levels and damage the optic nerve. Acute closed-angle glaucoma occurs most frequently in eyes that are structurally predisposed to pupillary blockage. With age, the lens enlarges and the anterior chamber of the eye becomes narrower, setting the stage for blockage of aqueous humor circulation. Acute attacks of glaucoma are usually precipitated by dilation of the pupil by medications or dark environments. Pain is initially restricted to the eye but can become generalized throughout the head. Blurred vision and rainbow lights may result from corneal edema. In severe attacks, patients develop nausea and vomiting. Pilocarpine drops may be used to constrict the pupil and reestablish circulation of aqueous humor.

Surgery remains the definitive choice to treat the condition and prevent recurrence. The most common symptom is nasal obstruction, but rhinorrhea, loss of smell and taste, and respiratory infections are also likely. Polyps are visualized as pale, grapelike structures prolapsing into the nasal cavity from the middle meatus. First-line treatment is usually with topical nasal steroid drops, which should be applied in the "head-down and forward" position. After one month of treatment, or after symptoms have been controlled, intranasal steroid spray is used for maintenance treatment. Systemic steroids are used for polyps that are too large for topical therapy. Surgery is reserved for cases refractory to medical therapy. Unilateral limb tremor is reported to improve in nearly 90 percent of patients following thalamotomy or thalamic stimulation. Resting and postural tremor may be ablated. Kinetic tremors may not respond as dramatically to surgery.

The greatest benefit from pallidotomy is reported to be in patients with bradykinesia. In approximately one third of patients, the benefits are dramatic. The benefits of thalamectomy and pallidotomy appear to last for several years. Even with stereotactic techniques, the risk of serious adverse effects from surgery is about 2 percent. The risks of adverse outcomes are higher with older patients and bilateral procedures. Patients may experience seizures, cognitive dysfunction and neurologic problems following surgery.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes consist of complete success rate in breaking the attack, IOP, mean deviation on Humphrey VF testing and vision-related QoL collected from the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (25 items) (NEI-VFQ25) 1 year post initial treatment.

Complete success in breaking the attack is defined as IOP < 21 mm Hg without the aid of IOP-lowering medication. If IOP can only be controlled with the assistance of medication, the success should be defined as partial rather than complete.

An NCT will be employed for the measurement of IOP, taking several facts into consideration since many patients with APAC are present in an emergency context and that not all centres allow access to Goldmann tonometry. Three measurements will be taken for each eye by a masked examiner, and the mean values will be used.

VF testing will be performed on Humphrey 24–2 automated perimetry. Reliable VF results are defined as fixation loss < 20%, with both positive and negative false < 33%.

To further evaluate visual outcomes in patients with APAC, we adopted the NEI-VFQ25 questionnaire, which is a vision-specific health profile measure. Since the original questionnaire was designed for English speakers, our study adopted the Chinese version, which had been tested for good reliability and validity.

Ancillary measurements

The data presented in Box 1 will also be recorded.

Box 1
Ancillary information and examinations required

Time from syndrome to presentation, time from presentation to the subsidence of the attack and time from symptoms to cornea restoring transparency.

Further lens extraction surgery or other antiglaucoma surgeries during the follow-up period.
Gonioscopy.
Ultrasound biomicroscopy.
Fundus photography.
Specular microscopy.
Optical coherence tomography.
Other examinations required for the preparation of surgeries.

Any ancillary examinations that demand direct contact with the cornea will only be performed when the IOP is maximally controlled and when corneal oedema has resolved so that safety is guaranteed.

Safety and adverse events

We intend to report all serious adverse events, along with complications and unexpected events from each step of intervention.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^11786A62]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Acute angle-closure crisis (AACC) — initial management and medications: Most patients are treated acutely with medications, and medical therapy is usually initiated first to lower the IOP to reduce pain and to clear corneal edema; iridotomy should then be performed as soon as possible because iridotomy (or iridectomy) allows aqueous to bypass the pupillary block and eliminates the pressure gradient between the posterior and anterior chambers. Medical therapy includes topical beta-adrenergic antagonists, topical alpha2-adrenergic agonists, topical, oral, or intravenous carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, topical parasympathomimetics, and oral or intravenous hyperosmotic agents; agents that suppress aqueous humor formation may be ineffective initially if the ciliary body is ischemic, parasympathomimetics may open the angle but the pupil can be unresponsive to miotic therapy when the IOP is markedly elevated, parasympathomimetic treatment may be ineffective in secondary pupillary block from intraocular gas, oil, vitreous, or a blocking intraocular or crystalline lens (in which case mydriatics may be more effective), systemic hyperosmotic agents may need to be used to achieve a rapid decrease in IOP in AACC, and corneal indentation with a four-mirror gonioscopic lens, cotton-tipped applicator, or the tip of a muscle hook may help break pupillary block.

Introduction

Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is a common ophthalmic emergency for Chinese, where intraocular pressure (IOP) rises dramatically (in some cases even over 50 mm Hg). If left untreated, it inevitably leads to glaucomatous optic neuropathy and visual impairment, or even blindness.

Studies have shown that the prevalence of APAC in Chinese descendants significantly outruns any other ethnic groups. In mainland China alone, the reported rate of blindness after APAC lies shockingly between 12.54% and 60.77%. Therefore, this blinding emergency causes great concern in China. Our previous work had proposed a critical time window of 4.6 hours for APAC treatment, within which the blindness rate can be controlled under 1%. Attack duration, being the most modifiable risk factor for APAC-related blindness, is crucial. Thus, effective and prompt treatment is of paramount significance to avert poor visual outcomes as it frees the optic nerve from lethal pressure-induced compression.

F: Anterior Chamber Paracentesis,

Rapidly lowers IOP in APAC
Instantaneous relief of symptoms
Prevention of further optic nerve and trabecular meshwork damage secondary to the acutely elevated IOP
The IOP-lowering benefit may decrease by 1 hour after the procedure
Anti-glaucoma medications are necessary to maintain IOP control.

Paracentesis will not directly break the pupillary block but can allow the cornea to clear permitting to perform LPI

Possible complications include

Excessive shallowing of the anterior chamber
Puncture of iris, lens
Choroidal effusion
Haemorrhage due to the sudden decompression

G: Goniosynechialysis

Often performed with other procedures such as lens extraction, to detach synechia from the angle, in eyes with minimal to moderate optic nerve damage.

The procedure may be complicated by:

2.4.1.7.3 Acute Angle-Closure (AAC) with plateau iris configuration (See FC VII)

In plateau iris configuration the iris plane is flat and the anterior chamber is not shallow axially. (See above under Staging of Primary Angle-closure).

Medical treatment [II, D]:

Pupillary constriction to pull the peripheral iris centripetally
In plateau iris configuration, a modest pupillary constriction may prevent further angle- closure – pilocarpine 1%, aceclidine 2%, carbachol 0.75% – dapiprazole 0.5%

Surgical treatment [I, D]:

Iridotomy is essential to confirm the diagnosis because it eliminates any pupillary block component
Argon Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty (ALPI) stretches the iris and widens the chamber angle.

"Plateau iris syndrome" refers to a post-laser iridotomy condition in which a patent iridotomy has removed the relative pupillary block, but gonioscopically confirmed angle closure recurs without central shallowing of the anterior chamber. Isolated plateau iris syndrome is rare compared to the plateau configuration, which itself is not common. It usually occurs in a younger age group than pupillary-block angle-closure. The treatment is laser iridoplasty or the long-term use of pilocarpine postoperatively [II, D]. This condition must be considered in the differential diagnosis when the intraocular pressure rises unexpectedly following an adequate peripheral iridectomy procedure for angle-closure glaucoma.

### General principles of… [^112vVGUp]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

General Principles of Glaucoma Therapy When glaucoma is diagnosed, whether in the presence of normal or elevated IOP, it is treated. In the United States, medications are typically first-line therapy. Elsewhere in the world, notably in Great Britain, initial treatment with surgery is becoming increasingly common. 15 The agents currently used to treat glaucoma are designed to decrease IOP. These drugs limit aqueous humor production in the ciliary body and/or enhance aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork or uveoscleral pathways. When a topical medication is chosen as first-line therapy in a patient with primary open-angle glaucoma, a stepped approach is used. Thus, a single topical agent is given up to its maximum dosage, as tolerated, before another agent is added or a different agent is tried. Additional medications are selected based on their potential complementary contribution to IOP reduction and the tolerability of their side effects.

The patient who is receiving maximal medical therapy may be applying up to four different classes of topical medications. Several combination drops have been marketed or are undergoing trials that will simplify dosage regimens and thereby increase patient compliance. CARBONIC ANHYDRASE INHIBITORS Orally administered carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have long been used in the management of primary open-angle glaucoma refractory to other forms of medical therapy. Agents such as acetazolamide and methazolamide decrease aqueous humor secretion by the ciliary epithelium. Dorzolamide and brinzolamide are the first topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors labeled by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma. Each drug is used two to three times daily. Dorzolamide is also marketed in combination with timolol.

These agents are favored over oral agents because of their greater site specificity and markedly fewer systemic side effects. The FDA has labeled apraclonidine for use in the management of transient IOP elevations after ocular surgery. This agent is associated with a high incidence of tachyphylaxis and clonidine-like central nervous system effects such as somnolence and orthostasis. Ocular allergic side effects are common. Thus, apraclonidine has only limited use in the chronic management of primary open-angle glaucoma.

### Interventions for angle-closure glaucoma: an evidence-based update [^117LBor5]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the interventions to treat acute angle closure (AAC) and primary angle closure (PAC) with or without glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Clinical Relevance

Primary angle closure is one of the leading causes of blindness in East Asia. At present, there are few clinical guidelines on the optimal treatment of AAC or PAC in the affected or contralateral eye.

Methods

All randomized clinical trials, prospective controlled clinical trials, nonprospective controlled clinical trials, and retrospective case series with > 50 cases that evaluated treatments for AAC or PAC were included. Studies published in the English language were identified from MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaborations, as well as by a hand search of the reference lists of important articles.

Results

Nine randomized clinical trials and 24 nonrandomized clinical trials and large case series were evaluated. Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) has been found to be as effective as surgical peripheral iridectomy in randomized clinical trials of the affected and contralateral eyes of AAC or PAC patients with or without evidence of glaucoma. In another randomized clinical trial, latanoprost was found to decrease intraocular pressure (IOP) more than timolol for PAC in patients for whom LPI alone failed.

Conclusions

This review suggests that LPI should be recommended for the treatment of affected and contralateral eyes of AAC patients. In patients with PAC and insufficient treatment with LPI, latanoprost eye drops may decrease IOP more than timolol. There is still insufficient evidence about other interventions for the treatment of AAC and PAC.

### Primary trabeculectomy for advanced glaucoma: pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial (TAGS) [^114doR5Q]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is a chronic progressive eye disease with substantial and detrimental effects on many aspects of daily living. It is the second most common cause of irreversible blindness in the UK, North America, and Europe. The number of patients with glaucoma is predicted to increase substantially as the result of an ageing population.

Open angle glaucoma initially affects the peripheral vision. Severe visual field loss occurs in people with advanced open angle glaucoma, which encroaches on central vision and eventually reduces visual acuity. Severe restriction of the visual field reduces quality of life and increases the risk of falls and fractures. People with advanced open angle glaucoma in both eyes, even with good visual acuity, may be eligible for certification as severely sight impaired.

The primary risk factor for blindness due to glaucoma is advanced vision loss at presentation. In the UK, guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggest that patients presenting with advanced disease should be offered trabeculectomy as a primary intervention but cite poor evidence to support this recommendation. This guidance is generally not followed owing to concerns about potential sight threatening surgical complications and lack of evidence supporting primary surgery. Most patients are treated medically with escalating topical drug therapy, only undergoing trabeculectomy if medical management is not successful. In North America, no specific guidance exists for treatment of patients with advanced glaucoma at diagnosis. In Europe, guidance suggests that glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy) can be offered. In the UK, 10–39% of patients with glaucoma present with advanced disease in at least one eye, with late presentation being associated with socioeconomic deprivation. The management of advanced glaucoma is associated with significant costs for healthcare systems.

Effective treatment can control the disease, prevent further sight loss, and so prevent blindness. Reducing intraocular pressure is the only proven effective treatment for glaucoma. Better control of intraocular pressure at the initial stage following diagnosis reduces the risk of further progression.

In a Cochrane systematic review comparing primary medical treatment and surgical treatment for open angle glaucoma, the authors concluded that trabeculectomy lowers intraocular pressure more than drugs do but also that previous trials excluded patients with advanced disease and did not reflect current medical and surgical practice. They identified comparison of current medical options and modern trabeculectomy in people with advanced open angle glaucoma as a research priority. The Public Health Outcomes Framework for England 2013–16 has also made reducing the number of people living with preventable sight loss a priority, and identifying the most effective treatment for glaucoma is a priority of the James Lind Alliance.

3.2.1.3 Re-evaluating Target IOP

If the visual field is worsening at a rate that may threaten Quality of Life during the patient's expected lifetime, then the Target IOP, if previously met, should be lowered; a further 20% reduction has been shown to be effective. If the Target IOP had not previously been met, then additional therapy should be considered, in consultation with the patient, weighing the risks and benefits of the additional intervention (See FC XI) [I, D].

If there are sufficient visual fields to judge the rate of progression, and this rate is sufficiently slow not to impact on the patient's quality of life, then the Target IOP may be revised upward if the Target IOP has not been met or if the patient is on excessive therapy or is experiencing side effects [II, D].

If there are insufficient visual fields to judge the rate of progression and the Target IOP has not been met, then additional therapy should be considered, as above [II, D].

3.3 - Antiglaucoma Drugs

Several prospective randomized multi-centre controlled clinical studies have clearly established the benefits of IOP reduction in managing POAG at various stages of the disease whether of the 'high pressure' or "normal pressure' variety as well as reducing the conversion of OHT to POAG,[I, A].

Most forms of open-angle glaucoma and many types of chronic angle-closure glaucoma are initially treated with topical and occasionally orally administrated agents that act either on the reduction of aqueous humour production or enhancement of the aqueous outflow or on both. An uncommon exception to initiating treatment with medical therapy is for eyes with a very high level of IOP at presentation causing an immediate threat to sight. Additionally many forms of childhood glaucoma are managed with early surgery [I, D].

Although acute angle closure with or without glaucoma needs rapid laser or incisional surgery, medical treatment usually will be initiated as a first step in most cases.

Laser treatment may be a suitable first option for patients with known intolerance or allergy to topical agents or suspected poor compliance [I, A].

When initially selecting medical therapy it is important to consider some relevant patient's characteristics as well as features related to the drug (See FC XII and XIII).

### Priorities and treatment preferences among surgery-naive patients with moderate to severe open-angle glaucoma [^116ZUvrx]. Ophthalmology: Glaucoma (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To explore patients' perspectives and experiences living with moderate to severe glaucoma through qualitative, semistructured interviews and to identify important benefits and risks that patients consider when choosing glaucoma treatments.

Design

Semistructured, in-person qualitative interviews with a convenience sample of patients seen at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute.

Participants

Surgery-naive patients 21 years of age or older with moderate to severe open-angle glaucoma seeking treatment at the Wilmer Eye Institute's Glaucoma Center of Excellence between August and December 2018.

Methods

We conducted semistructured interviews with patients diagnosed with moderate to severe open-angle glaucoma, focusing on outcomes they prioritize when considering various treatment options. We used Atlas.ti software version 7.5.12 (Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany) to process interview transcripts and the framework approach to analyze the qualitative data.

Main Outcome Measures

Patients' descriptions of outcomes important to them in management of moderate to severe open-angle glaucoma.

Results

Thirteen men and 15 women with a median age 67 years participated in the study. Compared with the mild-to-moderate glaucoma patients interviewed previously, these participants similarly emphasized (1) activities of daily living, (2) visual symptoms, (3) treatment burden, and (4) intraocular pressure (IOP) control, but unlike patients with milder disease, most related IOP control directly to (5) avoiding disease progression. Almost all (27/28) had also given significant thought to (6) surgical decision making and could describe how they would decide for or against a particular procedure. Finally, two thirds (18/28) expressed (7) significant fear and worry related to their glaucoma diagnosis.

Conclusions

We identified outcomes that matter to patients who are undergoing treatment for moderate to severe glaucoma, many of which may serve as end points in clinical trials, such as functional independence in vision-dependent activities of daily living, avoidance of visual symptoms, and disease progression via maintenance of IOP control. We also observed that these patients have varied and nuanced perspectives on surgical management and its outcomes. It behooves providers and trial designers to consider these in future evaluations of new treatments for moderate to severe glaucoma.

### Reasons for choice of glaucoma surgery in eyes not treated with anti-glaucoma medications [^116fF7s2]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In the real world, some glaucoma patients can undergo an incisional glaucoma surgery without using medication. The rate of cases with no medication treatment at the time of surgery among those that underwent incisional glaucoma surgeries performed in our department was reported.

Methods

The department database of Shimane University Hospital for eyes that underwent incisional surgeries to manage glaucoma at the hospital between April 2018 and September 2020 were searched. By reviewing the medical charts of 1,417 consecutive eyes listed, 90 (6.4%) eyes of 67 subjects (mean age of 72 ± 16 years; 22 men, 29 eyes; 45 women, 61 eyes) who underwent a surgery without use of antiglaucoma medication were identified. The types of glaucoma, glaucoma procedures, and reasons for choosing the glaucoma surgeries rather than medical therapy were collected for the 90 eyes.

Results

Among the 90 eyes, primary angle-closure disease (PACD) (60%) was the most frequent type of glaucoma followed by EXG (17%), POAG (16%), and others (8%). Among the reasons for the choice of incisional surgery, relief of angle closure (64%) was the most frequent, the second most frequent was the incidental diagnosis of glaucoma during the ocular examinations both for that eye's cataract surgery or the contralateral glaucoma surgery (13%). Other reasons included poor medication adherence (10%), dementia (6%), multiple medication allergy (3%), and acute IOP elevation other than PACD (3%). Cataract extraction (CE) alone (33%) was the most frequent glaucoma procedures performed in these eyes, followed by CE combined with goniosynechialysis (27%), CE + iStent (16%), CE + goniotomy by Tanito microhook ab interno trabeculotomy or using the Kahook Dual Blade (11%), Ahmed Glaucoma valve implantation (11%), and trabeculectomy (2%).

Conclusion

In the real-world, 6.4% of incisional glaucoma surgeries were performed in the absence of medication use; of them, 32 eyes (2.3%) were with open angle glaucoma. In open angle glaucoma, the reasons can be classified into; 1) patients' inability to instill the medication, 2) incidental diagnosis of glaucoma during the pre-surgical examinations, and 3) the eyes with acute IOP rise.

### Lens extraction versus laser peripheral iridotomy for acute primary angle closure [^113bTziy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is a potentially blinding condition. It is one of the few ophthalmic emergencies and carries high rates of visual morbidity in the absence of timely intervention. Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) has been the standard of care thus far. However, LPI does not eliminate the long-term risk of chronic angle closure glaucoma and other associated sequelae. There has been increasing interest in lens extraction as the primary treatment for the spectrum of primary angle closure disease, and it is as yet unclear whether these results can be extrapolated to APAC, and whether lens extraction provides better long-term outcomes. We therefore sought to evaluate the effectiveness of lens extraction in APAC to help inform the decision-making process. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of lens extraction compared to LPI in the treatment of APAC.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE E-pub Ahead of Print, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily (January 1946 to 10 January 2022), Embase (January 1947 to 10 January 2022), PubMed (1946 to 10 January 2022), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (1982 to 10 January 2022), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 10 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled clinical trials comparing lens extraction against LPI in adult participants (≥ 35 years) with APAC in one or both eyes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for prespecified outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included two studies conducted in Hong Kong and Singapore, comprising 99 eyes (99 participants) of predominantly Chinese origin. The two studies compared LPI with phacoemulsification performed by experienced surgeons. We assessed that both studies were at high risk of bias. There were no studies evaluating other types of lens extraction procedures. Phacoemulsification may result in an increased proportion of participants with intraocular pressure (IOP) control compared with LPI at 18 to 24 months (risk ratio (RR) 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 2.15; 2 studies, n = 97; low certainty evidence) and may reduce the need for further IOP-lowering surgery within 24 months (RR 0.07, 96% CI 0.01 to 0.51; 2 studies, n = 99; very low certainty evidence). Phacoemulsification may result in a lower mean IOP at 12 months compared to LPI (mean difference (MD) -3.20, 95% CI -4.79 to -1.61; 1 study, n = 62; low certainty evidence) and a slightly lower mean number of IOP-lowering medications at 18 months (MD -0.87, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.46; 1 study, n = 60; low certainty evidence), but this may not be clinically significant. Phacoemulsification may have little to no effect on the proportion of participants with one or more recurrent APAC episodes in the same eye (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.30; 1 study, n = 37; very low certainty evidence). Phacoemulsification may result in a wider iridocorneal angle assessed by Shaffer grading at six months (MD 1.15, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.47; 1 study, n = 62; very low certainty evidence). Phacoemulsification may have little to no effect on logMAR best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at six months (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.02; 2 studies, n = 94; very low certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the extent of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) (clock hours) between intervention arms at 6 months (MD -1.86, 95% CI -7.03 to 3.32; 2 studies, n = 94; very low certainty evidence), although the phacoemulsification group may have less PAS (degrees) at 12 months (MD -94.20, 95% CI -140.37 to -48.03; 1 study, n = 62) and 18 months (MD -127.30, 95% CI -168.91 to -85.69; 1 study, n = 60). In one study, there were 26 adverse events in the phacoemulsification group: intraoperative corneal edema (n = 12), posterior capsular rupture (n = 1), intraoperative bleeding from iris root (n = 1), postoperative fibrinous anterior chamber reaction (n = 7), and visually significant posterior capsular opacification (n = 5), and no cases of suprachoroidal hemorrhage or endophthalmitis. There were four adverse events in the LPI group: closed iridotomy (n = 1) and small iridotomies that required supplementary laser (n = 3). In the other study, there was one adverse event in the phacoemulsification group (IOP > 30 mmHg on day 1 postoperatively (n = 1)), and no intraoperative complications. There were five adverse events in the LPI group: transient hemorrhage (n = 1), corneal burn (n = 1), and repeated LPI because of non-patency (n = 3). Neither study reported health- or vision-related quality of life measures.

Authors' Conclusions

Low certainty evidence suggests that early lens extraction may produce more favorable outcomes compared to initial LPI in terms of IOP control. Evidence for other outcomes is less clear. Future high-quality and longer-term studies evaluating the effects of either intervention on the development of glaucomatous damage and visual field changes as well as health-related quality of life measures would be helpful.

### Low-dose transscleral cyclophotocoagulation with subsequent phacoemulsification in the treatment of prolonged acute primary angle closure [^112s9ebK]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is a leading cause of blindness in East Asian people, and timely management of the acute attack is important not only for preventing visual loss from the high-pressure episode but also for preventing progression to chronic angle closure glaucoma. Regarding the current ophthalmic care in China, the average time from symptom to treatment was much longer than what we would expect in the western world. Typical emergency treatment options for those with prolonged APAC, including topical and systemic intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications, anterior chamber paracentesis, followed by laser peripheral iridoplasty and/or iridotomy, may not always be possible due to corneal oedema and fixed dilated pupil, and is not effective in the prolonged cases with extensive synechial angle closure. Urgent surgical intervention such as cataract removal with or without an additional glaucoma procedure may be required. Of note, performing intraocular surgery on an inflamed eye with prolonged high IOP and corneal oedema poses a high risk of surgical failure and complications. In addition, these surgeries may be delayed due to the lack of availability of an operating room or experienced surgeon, particularly for those in rural areas. All these factors lead to increased rates of blindness in patients with prolonged APAC.

Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCP) is a non-incisional laser procedure which can be performed easily by junior surgeons. TSCP has been described as a safe and effective treatment to provide some degree of IOP control in patients with APAC refractory to medical therapies before lens extraction in order to avoid emergent surgery in inflamed eyes and achieve a more favourable outcome. The treatment protocols reported in these studies vary widely, though evaluating the specific treatment parameters is important to maximise IOP control and minimise the risk of vision-threatening complications. Additionally, the mechanism of TSCP IOP lowering in APAC is not well understood. In this study, we performed fixed low-dose transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (LDTSCP) prior to phacoemulsification in patients with prolonged APAC and report the outcomes and mechanism of IOP control using this new surgical paradigm.

### Reasons for choice of glaucoma surgery in eyes not treated with anti-glaucoma medications [^111WJGUz]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our department, 6.4% of incisional glaucoma surgeries were performed in the absence of medication use or because of the patients' inability to instill the medication. To our best knowledge, this information is unique in the literature. Based on the glaucoma type, the study eyes can be classified into two groups; the one group is PACD and the other group is open angle glaucoma. Based on the reasons for choice of surgery, most of the eyes in the latter group can be further classified into three groups; 1) the eyes of the patients with poor tolerance/adherence to medication therapy, 2) the eyes of the patients with incidental diagnosis of glaucoma during the pre-surgical examinations for cataract or opposite eye's glaucoma surgery, and 3) the eyes with acute IOP rise that required immediate IOP lowering surgery such as secondary open angle glaucoma due to inflammation.

In this study, the most frequent types of glaucoma and surgical procedure were the PACD and CE alone, respectively. CE has been considered a first-line treatment in PACD, and the combination of GSL and CE may be more effective than CE alone for lowering IOP in PACD. Accordingly, the high frequencies of relief of angle closure as the surgical indication and CE + GSL/CE alone as surgical procedures reflect the current treatment recommendations. The reasons for choice of CE alone, CE + GSL, or CE + minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) would be interesting to know and is needed to be clarified in the future.

Previous studies have reported that poor medication adherence and drug-induced side effects, e.g. ocular surface diseases and drug allergy, were related to poor visual prognosis in glaucoma. Conditions associated with older age were anticipated to reduce medication adherence due to difficulty instilling eye drops (e.g. tremor), difficulty in accessing educational resources (e.g. lack of internet access), and reduced treatment motivation (e.g. dementia and depression). In the current study, 17 eyes (19%) underwent glaucoma surgery due to poor adherence or intolerance to medication; these were the major reasons for glaucoma surgery in OAG. With this scenario, to provide adherence-independent reduction of IOP, filtration surgeries such as tube shunt surgery or trabeculectomy tended to be performed (Table 1).

Systemic drugs and angle-closure

Systemic drugs which may induce angle-closure in pre-disposed individuals are: nebulised bronchodilators (ipratropium bromide and/or salbutamol), selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI's), tricyclic antidepressants, proprietary cold and flu medications, muscle relaxants, anti-epileptics (topiramate) and other agents with a parasympatholytic and sympathomimetic action.

### Setting priorities for comparative effectiveness research on management of primary angle closure: a survey of Asia-Pacific clinicians [^111PtoRT]. Journal of Glaucoma (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To set priorities for new systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized clinical trials on the management of primary angle closure (PAC) using clinical practice guidelines and a survey of Asia-Pacific clinicians.

Methods

We restated the American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Patterns recommendations for management of PAC into answerable clinical questions. We asked participants at the Asia-Pacific Joint Glaucoma Congress 2010 in Taipei to rate the importance of having an answer to each question for providing effective patient care, using a Likert-type scale and scoring from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (highly important). We identified relevant SRs and mapped the evidence to clinical questions to identify evidence gaps.

Results

We generated 42 clinical questions. One hundred seventy-five individuals agreed to participate in the survey, 132 responded (75.4% response rate) and 96 completed the questionnaire (54.9% usable response rate). Questions rated important include laser iridotomy for the prevention of angle closure in primary angle-closure suspects, further therapies in eyes with plateau iris syndrome after laser iridotomy, and evaluation of the fellow eye in acute angle-closure patients for improving prognosis. Up-to-date and conclusive SR evidence was not available for any of the 42 clinical questions.

Conclusions

We identified high priority clinical questions on the management of PAC, none of which had reliable SR evidence available. New SRs and randomized clinical trials can be initiated to address these evidence gaps.

### Acute primary angle closure-treatment strategies, evidences and economical considerations [^113qCvVq]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute primary angle closure requires emergency management that involves a rapid lowering of the intraocular pressure and resolution of relative pupil block - the most common mechanism of angle closure. Emergency strategies for lowering intraocular pressure include medical treatment and argon laser peripheral iridoplasty. Anterior chamber paracentesis and diode laser transcleral cyclophotocoagulation may be considered in special situations. Relative pupil block can be relieved by peripheral laser iridotomy and primary lens extraction; the latter is a more effective treatment according to the results of clinical trials. However, primary lens extraction can be technically demanding in the acute setting. Peripheral laser iridotomy has a role in relieving pupil block and should also be considered in most cases. Lens extraction may be combined with procedures such as goniosynechialysis, trabeculectomy or endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation. In this review, we aim to discuss the available evidence regarding the different treatment modalities. We also discuss the economic consideration, including cost-effectiveness and life expectancy, in the management of acute primary angle closure.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^1125PxVE]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary angle-closure disease natural history — glaucomatous optic neuropathy can develop rapidly if patients with high intraocular pressure (IOP) from unilateral AACC do not receive treatment, and untreated fellow phakic eyes are at increased risk for developing acute angle closure. Following AACC, the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness increases in the first few days, returns to an average thickness at approximately 1 month, and develops decreased thickness at 3 months. In one study examining patients for 4 to 10 years following an AACC event, 18% of eyes were blind, of which 50% were blind from glaucoma. Fifty-eight percent of eyes had visual acuity worse than 20/40. Thus, AACC (and subsequent PACG) creates significant visual morbidity with progressive vision loss that may result in unilateral and bilateral blindness.

Introduction

Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is typically caused by a sudden blockage of the trabecular meshwork, which is in the anterior chamber angle of the eye. This blockage leads to a rapid increase in the pressure inside the eye. High intraocular pressure (IOP) can cause irreversible damage to the optic nerve. If the elevated pressure persists for hours or days, it can lead to blindness. Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness worldwide. In 2013, it was estimated that there were 64.3 million individuals between the ages of 40 and 80 who had glaucoma globally. By 2020, this number had risen to 76.0 million, and it is projected to increase to 111.8 million by 2040.PACG may lead to emergencies that require urgent treatment, but it can be managed and controlled if the angle closure process is diagnosed early.

The primary objective of treating primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is to rapidly lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) to alleviate pain, reduce corneal edema, and prevent optic nerve damage. Lowering IOP can typically be achieved using topical or oral medications, and this can enable more definitive treatments such as laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) or lens removal. Laser iridotomy (LI) is a well-established procedure for treating and preventing acute primary angle closure glaucoma (APACG). By equalizing the pressure gradient between the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye, LI reduces the risk of angle closure and subsequent elevation of intraocular pressure. However, the role of the crystalline lens in the onset of PACG is significant, and some experts propose that early removal of the lens through Phacoemulsification may improve IOP management and potentially reduce the need for medication and subsequent glaucoma surgery. These procedures have demonstrated effectiveness in controlling IOP elevation and widening the angle. Recently, several RCTs comparing the efficacy of LPI and Phacoemulsification in managing PACG have been published in the literature.
