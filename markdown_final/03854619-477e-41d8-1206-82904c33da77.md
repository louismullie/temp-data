## Question

45 yo F with well-controlled epilepsy (lamotrigine 150 mg BID), recently started on oral combined hormonal contraceptive (ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel), presents for management of tension-type headaches. Neurology consult recommends switching from lamotrigine to valproic acid not for seizures, but for migraine prophylaxis. Is it safe to initiate valproic acid for headache prevention in this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is safe to initiate valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis in a 45-year-old woman with well-controlled epilepsy on lamotrigine who recently started a combined oral contraceptive, and what the evidence-based risks, benefits, and alternatives are in this scenario. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and whether valproate is effective for migraine prevention. Then, I should verify the teratogenic and regulatory risks in women of childbearing potential. Next, I will examine drug–drug interactions, especially with lamotrigine and combined oral contraceptives. After that, I need to check guideline positions and whether any recommend valproate as first-line in this context. Finally, I will consider safer alternatives and outline a practical, risk-mitigated plan with monitoring and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the indication and efficacy. Valproate (valproic acid or divalproex) is effective for episodic migraine prevention, with randomized trials and meta-analyses showing reductions in monthly headache frequency and increased odds of ≥ 50% responder rates, and it is included as a first-line option in several guidelines, though often with strong cautions in women who could become pregnant [^92e674aa] [^584f4b49] [^eb8f1fee] [^dd12985f].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory and teratogenic risk signal before anything else. Multiple high-quality sources and regulatory labels consistently state that valproate is contraindicated for migraine prophylaxis in pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception due to dose-dependent risks of neural tube defects, other major congenital malformations, and neurodevelopmental impairment; pregnancy rates during valproate use have not declined despite warnings, and contraception use remains suboptimal in real-world cohorts, underscoring persistent exposure risk [^b6b1e222] [^2dd3f428] [^deb552af] [^0b3d220c] [^983ff30c].

> Hold on, I should verify the specific risk magnitude to anchor counseling. The absolute risk of major congenital malformations with valproate is about 10% and the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders is about 30–40%, with no established safe dose in pregnancy; importantly, these risks extend beyond epilepsy to migraine prophylaxis, where alternatives exist and regulatory bodies have moved toward contraindication or highly restrictive use [^92726973] [^deb552af] [^2dd3f428].

> I need to check drug–drug interactions next. Lamotrigine is metabolized by glucuronidation and its serum levels are reduced by about 50% with ethinyl estradiol–containing contraceptives, which can worsen seizure control; conversely, valproate inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation and can raise lamotrigine levels, increasing toxicity risk, so switching to valproate while on lamotrigine complicates pharmacokinetics and safety and requires careful dose adjustments and monitoring [^bf2c6052] [^c2adc1ad] [^7fc51fe1] [^56f8f9ff].

> Let me consider guideline positioning to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. The AAN/AHS guideline lists divalproex/valproate as effective for migraine prevention but does not recommend it for women of childbearing potential without effective contraception; the FDA labeling contraindicates valproate for migraine prophylaxis in pregnancy and in those not using effective contraception; and contemporary primary care and VA/DoD guidelines still include valproate among options but emphasize teratogenic risk and the need for reliable contraception, which this patient is not using consistently with a new COC start [^584f4b49] [^b6b1e222] [^eb8f1fee] [^dd12985f].

> But wait, what if the headache phenotype is actually migraine with aura rather than tension-type headache; would that change the calculus? Even if the headaches are migrainous, the teratogenic risk of valproate remains unacceptable for prophylaxis in a 45-year-old who could become pregnant, and safer, evidence-based alternatives should be prioritized; valproate is not indicated for tension-type headache, and its use here would expose the patient to significant fetal risk without a compelling indication [^b6b1e222] [^deb552af].

> I should double-check safer pharmacologic options with supportive evidence. Topiramate, beta-blockers such as propranolol or metoprolol, venlafaxine, and amitriptyline are all first-line options for episodic migraine prevention; levetiracetam has emerging but limited evidence and may be considered when first-line agents are unsuitable; importantly, none of these carry the same magnitude of teratogenic risk as valproate, though topiramate has its own pregnancy cautions and can reduce contraceptive efficacy at higher doses, which still leaves several safer choices here [^eb8f1fee] [^9a69061c] [^a39a10cd] [^6d918727].

> Let me reconsider the lamotrigine issue pragmatically. Given that lamotrigine levels drop with ethinyl estradiol and the patient has well-controlled epilepsy, the priority should be to stabilize seizure control and manage headaches with agents that do not add teratogenic risk; if lamotrigine dose needs adjustment due to the COC, that should be done with neurology input rather than replacing it with valproate, which introduces new safety concerns and does not address the COC interaction [^bf2c6052] [^c2adc1ad].

> I should confirm a concrete, risk-mitigated plan. I would not initiate valproate for migraine prophylaxis in this patient; instead, I would optimize lamotrigine dosing in the context of the COC, consider a safer migraine preventive such as topiramate, a beta-blocker, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline based on comorbidities and preferences, and ensure reliable contraception if any teratogenic medication is contemplated; if valproate were ever considered, it would require a documented pregnancy prevention program and specialist oversight, which is not justified here given alternatives [^eb8f1fee] [^deb552af] [^92726973].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. Initiating valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis in a 45-year-old woman of childbearing potential who is not using highly effective, consistent contraception is unsafe due to substantial teratogenic and neurodevelopmental risks; the balance of benefit to risk is unfavorable for migraine prophylaxis, and safer, effective alternatives should be chosen instead [^b6b1e222] [^deb552af] [^eb8f1fee].

---

It is **not safe** to initiate valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis in a 45-year-old woman of childbearing potential who is not using highly effective contraception, given valproate's **significant teratogenic risks** (neural tube defects, neurodevelopmental disorders) and the FDA's **contraindication** for migraine prophylaxis in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception [^b6b1e222] [^2dd3f428]. If migraine prophylaxis is needed, use **alternatives such as topiramate, beta-blockers, or CGRP monoclonal antibodies**, and ensure reliable contraception if any teratogenic drug is considered [^eb8f1fee] [^23faa4a3]. If valproate is absolutely necessary, implement a strict pregnancy prevention program with specialist oversight [^92726973].

---

## Teratogenic risks of valproic acid

Valproic acid is associated with **significant teratogenic risks**, including:

- **Neural tube defects**: Spina bifida and other neural tube defects occur in approximately 1–2% of exposed pregnancies, which is 10–20 times higher than the general population.

- **Major congenital malformations**: Increased risk of craniofacial, cardiovascular, and limb malformations.

- **Neurodevelopmental disorders**: Increased risk of autism spectrum disorders, cognitive impairment, and decreased IQ in offspring exposed in utero.

- **Fetal valproate syndrome**: Characterized by facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and limb defects.

These risks are **dose-dependent** and occur even at therapeutic doses used for migraine prophylaxis [^2dd3f428].

---

## Regulatory guidelines and recommendations

Regulatory authorities have issued **strict guidelines** regarding valproic acid use in women of childbearing potential:

- **FDA contraindication**: Valproic acid is contraindicated for migraine prophylaxis in women who are pregnant or of childbearing potential not using effective contraception [^b6b1e222] [^2dd3f428].

- **Pregnancy prevention programs**: Implementation of pregnancy prevention programs is recommended, including counseling, pregnancy testing, and use of highly effective contraception [^92726973].

- **Specialist oversight**: Valproic acid should only be considered in women of childbearing potential if no suitable alternatives exist and under specialist supervision [^deb552af].

---

## Interaction with combined hormonal contraceptives

Valproic acid **does not significantly interact** with combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) in a way that reduces contraceptive efficacy. Unlike enzyme-inducing antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin), valproic acid does not increase the metabolism of estrogen or progestin components of CHCs, so contraceptive efficacy is generally maintained. However, valproic acid is highly protein-bound and may interact with other medications metabolized by the liver, necessitating careful monitoring and dose adjustments.

---

## Alternative migraine prophylaxis options

Given the significant risks associated with valproic acid, **alternative medications** should be considered for migraine prophylaxis:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Anticonvulsants | Topiramate | Effective for migraine prophylaxis | - Teratogenic risk <br/> - Cognitive side effects <br/> - Contraindicated in pregnancy |
| Beta-blockers | - Propranolol <br/> - Metoprolol | Effective for migraine prophylaxis | - Generally safe in pregnancy <br/> - Caution in asthma and cardiovascular disease |
| CGRP monoclonal antibodies | - Erenumab <br/> - Fremanezumab <br/> - Galcanezumab | Effective for migraine prophylaxis | - Limited pregnancy data <br/> - Generally considered safe |
| Antidepressants | - Amitriptyline <br/> - Venlafaxine | Effective for migraine prophylaxis | - Caution in pregnancy <br/> - Monitor for mood changes |

---

## Clinical recommendations

Given the patient's age and potential for pregnancy, the following **clinical recommendations** are advised:

- **Avoid valproic acid**: Do not initiate valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis unless no suitable alternatives exist and the patient is using highly effective contraception [^b6b1e222].

- **Consider alternatives**: Use topiramate, beta-blockers, or CGRP monoclonal antibodies for migraine prophylaxis, considering patient-specific factors and comorbidities [^eb8f1fee] [^23faa4a3].

- **Contraception counseling**: Ensure the patient receives comprehensive contraception counseling and uses highly effective contraception if any teratogenic medication is considered [^3e1e13b1].

- **Specialist referral**: Refer to a neurologist or headache specialist for further evaluation and management of migraine prophylaxis [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Initiating valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis in a 45-year-old woman of childbearing potential who is not using highly effective contraception is **not safe** due to significant teratogenic risks and regulatory contraindications. Alternative migraine prophylaxis options should be considered, and if valproic acid is absolutely necessary, strict pregnancy prevention measures must be implemented under specialist supervision [^b6b1e222] [^deb552af].

Counseling for patients of childbearing potential — risk counseling notes that topiramate and valproate have well-demonstrated teratogenic effects, especially when used in polytherapy, and valproate use during pregnancy is also associated with developmental disorders in offspring; an FDA black box warning regarding fetal risk from valproate use exists as of the time of this guideline. It further states that topiramate at a daily dose of 200 mg or less does not interact with oral combined hormonal contraceptives; however, at higher doses it can have drug interactions that decrease their effectiveness, and that the risk of major congenital malformation in offspring of women with epilepsy taking antiepileptics is possibly decreased by folic acid supplementation. Clinically, clinicians must consider the teratogenic effect of topiramate and valproate in their choice of migraine prevention therapy recommendations to patients of childbearing potential (Level A).

Key Points

Question

Are US Food and Drug Administration warnings to prevent prenatal exposure to valproic acid associated with changes in pregnancy risk and contraceptive use across indications?

Findings

In this cohort study of 165 772 valproic acid treatment episodes among 69 390 women, pregnancy rates during treatment remained unchanged during the 15-year study and were more than doubled among users with mood disorder or migraine compared with epilepsy. Contraception use among users was uncommon, with only 22.3% of treatment episodes having a 1-day overlap of valproic acid and contraception use.

Meaning

These findings suggest a need to review efforts to mitigate prenatal exposure to valproic acid, especially for clinical indications where risk of use during pregnancy outweighs therapeutic benefit and safer alternatives are available.

### Valproate pregnancy prevention scheme: what are the barriers to enrolling patients and how do we meet them? [^92726973]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

The UK Medicines Health products Regulation Agency (MHRA) in April 2018 stated that 10% of babies born to women treated with valproate will have birth defects and 30%–40% of children will have some learning difficulties in development. The MHRA, therefore, issued guidance to primary and secondary care physicians in the UK that the use of valproate should be restricted in women of childbearing age unless they consented to the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP). They should be referred by primary care to secondary care clinicians specialising in the management of epilepsy, migraine or psychiatry to review the continued need for valproate treatment, discuss other potential treatment options, complete the PPP consent documentation or confirm they met the exclusion criteria. The PPP mandated the use of highly effective long-term contraception including coils (copper intrauterine device or levonorgestrel intrauterine systems), the contraceptive implant (progesterone-only implant) or sterilisation. MRHA survey data in April 2019 indicated that clinicians had not adequately completed valproate PPP, necessitating the need to create a national registry for women of childbearing age taking valproate. The authors suggested that the major issue may have been a lack of clinician engagement with the process. Recently, the MHRA through the independent Commission on Human Medicines reviewed the available data and advised that no patient ≤ 55 years either men or women should be started on valproate unless two specialists independently confirm no other effective or tolerated treatment is available or the risks do not apply. Having established a local registry from available secondary care data, we assessed potential primary and secondary care barriers to enrolling patients into the PPP.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^727dd7dc]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Our study is the first to compare the efficacy of lamotrigine and topiramate in solely patients suffering from migraine with aura. Both treatments showed to equally reduce monthly frequency of migraine attacks at 6 months of follow-up. Consequently, our results suggest a similar efficacy of both treatments within the clinical setting of migraine with aura. Interestingly, the majority of lamotrigine-treated patients included in our study had been previously treated with at least another migraine prophylactic agent, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of lamotrigine was certainly not obtained in a population of less resistant patients. Additionally, despite a well-established tolerability profile, discontinuation rates due to adverse events associated with topiramate are higher in patients with migraine compared with patients with epilepsy. Although the small number of patients included in our study, our tolerability data showed a significantly higher rate of adverse events within topiramate group compared with lamotrigine-treated patients.

Discussion

Our study had 4 key findings that deserve discussion. First, consistent with previous findings, epilepsy played a minor role as an indication for valproic acid use among women of childbearing age, while mood disorders were the most common indication. Second, pregnancy incidence rates varied across indications, with epilepsy having the lowest rate, even after age standardization. This implies that use of valproic acid for epilepsy has the smallest contribution to prenatal exposure and ultimately, adverse pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy incidence rates for migraine or headache and mood disorder treatment episodes were more than double the risk identified for epilepsy treatment episodes, with both indications carrying a contraindication for use during pregnancy in the European Union and use for migraine contraindicated in the US. Third, despite several safety communications and labeling changes focused on enhanced warnings to not use valproic acid during pregnancy, pregnancy risk among users did not decline over our 15-year study period. Finally, prescription contraception use among women of childbearing age who use valproic acid improved only slightly during the study period and remained generally limited regardless of indication.

With epilepsy providing the strongest favorable benefit to risk for use during pregnancy, the discovered lower pregnancy rates may seem surprising. We speculate that because most studies that demonstrate fetal risks were conducted in patients with epilepsy and typically published in neurology-centric journals, perhaps neurologists may be more informed than other specialties about the risks. Pregnancy complications associated with epilepsy itself may also emphasize the need for careful pregnancy planning, including preemptive switches to other anticonvulsants if pregnancy is desired.

We found the highest age-standardized pregnancy rates among patients using valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis and mood disorders. Compared with epilepsy, migraine prophylaxis has multiple other viable medications other than valproic acid, resulting in agreement among the US and European regulatory agencies regarding an absolute contraindication for use during pregnancy. Although opinions diverge about the treatment of mood disorders, it would be relevant to explore whether treatment modifications were considered as part of prepregnancy care, or whether exposure was mostly accidental.

### Prenatal exposure to valproic acid across various indications for use [^34f7158c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Both the FDA and European Medicines Agency recommend contraception in persons of childbearing potential using valproic acid regardless of indication. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 14.0% of women of childbearing age (15–49 years) use oral contraceptives, 10.4% use reversible long-acting contraception, and 3.1% use injections, rings, or patches. We found lower use of contraception for valproic acid users, with an overall 22.3% of treatment episodes having at least 1 day of contraception coverage. Patients with epilepsy had less contraception use, which could be due to different pregnancy prevention behaviors. However, age may play a role since patients with epilepsy are younger than patients with migraine or mood disorders. While contraception use increased over the study period to 24.5% in 2019, this proportion is likely not representative of all women in the study population who were sexually active. One study assessing contraception use among patients with epilepsy who used medications associated with teratogenic outcomesfound that 26% had prescription contraception use (ie, oral contraception, IUD, or injection). While there are other contraception methods available to persons of childbearing potential that do not require a prescription or medical intervention (eg, barrier methods), they are not recommended due to lower efficacy.

Importance

Teratogenic outcomes associated with valproic acid use represent a substantial concern for persons of childbearing age. Regulatory agencies worldwide have enhanced warnings or implemented risk minimization programs to reduce exposure during pregnancy.

Objectives

To determine pregnancy rates during valproic acid use and concomitant contraception use across indications.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used data from the Merative MarketScan commercial claims databases from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2020, to identify female patients aged 12 to 44 years who initiated valproic acid treatment and had continuous insurance enrollment 6 months before initiation and 9 months after treatment end. A treatment episode included consecutive prescription fills that occurred within 7 days from the end of the days' supply of the previous dispensing. Data were analyzed from March 1 to September 10, 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment episodes were categorized by inferred indication using diagnoses preceding treatment initiation, including epilepsy, migraine or headache, mood disorders, and unknown or off-label uses. Pregnancy incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated and were adjusted for age and calendar year. Contraceptive use (prescription contraceptives, intrauterine devices, and implants) during treatment was examined.

Results

The cohort included 165 772 valproic acid treatment episodes among 69 390 women (mean [SD] age, 29.8 [10.0] years). Mood disorders (42.5%) were the most common indication, followed by migraine or headache (20.1%), with epilepsy playing a minor role (14.9%). Pregnancy incidence rates during valproic acid use remained unchanged, with a rate of 1.74 (95% CI, 1.14–2.53) per 100 person-years in 2005 and a rate of 1.90 (95% CI, 1.16–3.12) per 100 person-years in 2019. Compared with epilepsy, pregnancy rates were more than double for mood disorder (IRR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.93–2.42]) and migraine or headache (IRR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.92–2.09]). Few treatment episodes coincided with contraceptive use (37 012 [22.3%]), and oral dosage forms were the most common (27 069 [73.1%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of patients of childbearing age who used valproic acid, pregnancy rates during valproic acid use did not decrease despite enhanced US Food and Drug Administration safety communications, and contraception use remained low. Patients with migraine and mood disorders accounted for the largest proportion of valproic acid use and had the highest pregnancy rates, while patients with epilepsy had the lowest. These findings suggest a need to enhance efforts to mitigate prenatal exposure to valproic acid, especially for indications where the risk of use during pregnancy outweighs the benefit.

### Prenatal exposure to valproic acid across various indications for use [^eeb329d4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Although pregnancy rates were lower than in the general population (1.88 per 100 person-years among valproic acid users compared with 8.7), prenatal exposure to valproic acid does occur. When considering the risk and benefit of valproic acid use during pregnancy, one must consider the impact on the fetus and mother. Hence, risk mitigation considerations for valproic acid have initially weighed the risk of uncontrolled epilepsy against the teratogenic risk of valproic acid use. With the broadened indications, this equation has now been changed to include predominantly scenarios where risk of use during pregnancy outweighs benefit and hence, prenatal exposure should be avoided. This finding, coupled with the observation that although valproic acid use has decreased, pregnancy risk has not, suggests that current risk mitigation approaches should be reevaluated and place greater emphasis on prevention of prenatal exposure among persons of childbearing age who use valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis and bipolar disorder, for which alternative medications could reasonably be used. Perhaps indication-specific risk mitigation approaches focusing on migraine prophylaxis and mood disorders are needed. Such enhanced efforts to prevent pregnancy during valproic acid treatment are particularly relevant in light of recent changes in abortion laws, limiting options for pregnancy termination if unintended prenatal exposure occurs. There is a need to assess causes of such exposure to aid in the development and implementation of risk mitigation measures. Likewise, there is a need to understand barriers to the use of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, our data did not provide the exact clinical indication for use. Therefore, we inferred the indications based on diagnoses from outpatient medical claims preceding treatment episodes. Given the consistency of our findings with those of the literature (eg, minimal valproic acid use for epilepsy), our approach has likely had reasonable accuracy. Second, in our main analysis, we only included contraception use indicated by claims during our 6-month look-back period, which might have missed implants and IUDs that were placed previously. In a sensitivity analysis, we included patients with 3 years of continuous enrollment prior to valproic acid treatment to assess contraception use and found similarly low rates. Nonprescription contraception accounts for approximately 14% of all contraception use. Therefore, we likely underestimated contraception use in our study, but the magnitude of these missing data may not fully justify the risk mitigation gap.

### Prenatal exposure to valproic acid across various indications for use [^6a88a172]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, patients with migraine or headache and mood disorders accounted for the largest proportion of valproic users and had the highest pregnancy rates during use, while patients with epilepsy had the lowest. Despite a variety of safety communications and label changes issued by the FDA, pregnancy rates during valproic acid use did not decrease during the study period. Contraception use among valproic acid users remained low. Our findings indicate a need to enhance efforts to mitigate prenatal exposure to valproic acid, especially for indications where risk of use during pregnancy outweighs benefit.

### Valproic acid (valproic) [^b6b1e222]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Valproic Acid is an anti-epileptic drug indicated for:

Monotherapy and adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures; sole and adjunctive therapy of simple and complex absence seizures; adjunctive therapy in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures (1)

1.1 Epilepsy

Valproic Acid is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Valproic Acid is indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types which include absence seizures.

Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.

See Warnings and Precaution (5.1) for statement regarding fatal hepatic dysfunction.

1.2 Important Limitations

Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopment disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.

Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)].

### Valproate-is withdrawal worth it? [^61d28bca]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Valproate has been approved for use in epilepsy since 1983, and was later approved for the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder (1995) and for migraine prevention (1996). It is considered the gold standard for treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. That said, it is used with extreme caution in women of childbearing potential, largely due to its association with teratogenicity and implications for neurodevelopment. New guidance put forth by medical regulators in the UK, limits the use of valproate in both women and men < 55 years of age. Cautions in use were extended to men after identification of a 5.6% to 6.3% risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and for transgenerational gene expression alterations in the offspring of men taking valproate. In addition, reduced male fertility was reported and noted to be reversible upon valproate discontinuation. However, there are also consequences to stopping valproate. Previous studies have demonstrated worsening seizure control when valproate was withdrawn, regardless of whether or not patients were switched to another ASM. Taking this into account, more information and guidance is needed to help direct clinical decision making regarding the potential risks of withdrawal of valproate as well as the implications for alternative therapy.

The article highlighted in this commentary is the largest known study assessing the risks and implications of valproate withdrawal in people with epilepsy (PWE), looking at associated risk of increased morbidity and mortality in both men and women, regardless of whether or not they were switched to another ASM. It was an international cohort study that consisted of 14 412 PWE, aged 16 to 54 years (mean age 27 years), on valproate that was drawn from a pool of 112 healthcare organizations globally between 2008 and 2023. The participants had a predominant diagnosis of generalized epilepsy. Of the 14 412 PWE on valproate, 4436 13 (31%) were subsequently withdrawn from treatment and 9976 (69%) remained on treatment; 6501 (72%) men remained on treatment and 3363 (64%) women remained on treatment. Of the 107 women taking valproate who subsequently became pregnant during recruitment, 63% (68) were withdrawn from treatment and 36% (39) remained on valproate. Outcomes were collected for 5 years, starting a day after the first epilepsy disease/symptom code appeared without and with co-prescribed valproate.

### Valproic acid [^8de99234]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Valproic acid oral solution is indicated for:

Monotherapy and adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures; sole and adjunctive therapy of simple and complex absence seizures; adjunctive therapy in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures (1)

1.1 Epilepsy

Valproic acid oral solution is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of patients with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Valproic acid oral solution is indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures, and adjunctively in patients with multiple seizure types which include absence seizures.

Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.

See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) for statement regarding fatal hepatic dysfunction.

1.2 Important Limitations

Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)].

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^b9fb4da7]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Finally, according to the North American Antiepileptic Drug pregnancy registry, topiramate showed a dose independent threefold higher risk of congenital malformations and child developmental retardation in women exposed to the drug, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy. On the other hand, teratogenic activity of lamotrigine is dose-dependent and exerted at higher dosage than that used for migraine prophylaxis. Based on our findings, lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice for patients having migraine with aura reporting unresponsiveness to topiramate treatment or who discontinue the drug due to side effects. Moreover, lamotrigine could be safely offered to patients who have contraindications to topiramate, especially migraine with aura women planning to have pregnancy.

Regarding the effects on aura frequency and duration, our results showed a trend towards a better efficacy of lamotrigine compared with topiramate. Responder rates for monthly aura frequency were similar between the two treatment groups. However, approximately half of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of aura at 6-month follow-up. Additionally, lamotrigine determined a reduction of aura duration per episode of approximately 15 min. In line with previous findings, lamotrigine should then be considered in clinical practice for the treatment of prolonged or disturbing migraine with aura. We are aware of several limitations of this study. A possible bias in patients' selection, the small number of patients recruited, the absence of a placebo controlled group and the retrospective nature of our study may have indicated a higher efficacy of both drugs than observed in other studies. Although results similar to ours for lamotrigine have been previously reported by Pascual et al with a retrospective, non-placebo-controlledì analysis, we think that the main result of our study was not the demonstration of the effectiveness of any specific drug, rather the evidence of a similar effectiveness of lamotrigine compared with topiramate. This could open new therapeutic possibilities, especially in patients for whom topiramate is contraindicated or who are intolerant to this drug. We hope that our observation may stimulate further prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials to prove the role of lamotrigine in the prophylaxis of migraine with aura.

Discussion

The aim of our study was to explore the role of lamotrigine for the prevention of episodic migraine with aura. For this purpose, we decided to compare lamotrigine to topiramate, an antiepileptic drug established to be highly effective for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. Pooled data from three large multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated a clinically relevant response of monthly migraine frequency in patients treated with topiramate compared with placebo and led to topiramate approval as first-line drug for migraine prophylaxis. Further studies confirmed a similar efficacy of topiramate compared with other first-line prophylactic drugs such as propranolol and valproate. Real-world experience with topiramate proved its efficacy in reducing migraine frequency, improving patient quality of life and social functioning as well as reducing healthcare resources allocation to headache, making topiramate one of the most used migraine preventive drug in clinical practice nowadays. Moreover, due to its mechanism of action, topiramate is also believed to affect migraine aura initiation. In an experimental model of CSD, topiramate showed to inhibit the propagation of induced CSD in a dose-dependent manner. However, its clinical efficacy in preventing migraine aura is not clear. In an open longitudinal, pilot study involving patients affected by migraine with aura, topiramate failed to reduce aura frequency and duration at 6-month follow-up. Additionally, a posthoc analysis of the PROMPT trial, a well-designed study consisting of an open label phase in which patients were treated with topiramate for 26 weeks, followed by a double-blind phase in which patients were randomized to receive placebo or continue to receive topiramate, showed a significant reduction in migraine aura frequency at the end of the open label phase which was maintained throughout the double-blind phase. However, no significant change in number of auras between topiramate and placebo were found at the end of the follow-up period.

### Prenatal exposure to valproic acid across various indications for use [^57101834]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Since its approval for the treatment of seizure disorders decades ago, the clinical indications for valproic acid have evolved to include migraine prophylaxis, treatment of bipolar disorder, and many off-label uses. Along with the expanding use, increasing evidence has demonstrated fetal risk. Compared with other antiepileptic medications, valproic acid carries the highest risk of any malformation, with estimates ranging from a 2- to 7-fold increase. Beyond malformations, prenatal exposure has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and decreased cognitive abilities, including lower IQ scores.

In the US, prevention of prenatal exposure to valproic acid relies on a black box warning and a medication guide. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also issued multiple warnings, drug safety communications, and label changes related to valproic acid use during pregnancy and childbearing age. These warnings emphasize the risk of neural tube defects, cognitive impairment, and hearing loss. In the most recent regulatory action, a contraindication was added to the label for use during pregnancy for migraine prophylaxis. In a 2013 Drug Safety Communication, the FDA had stated valproic acid should only be used during pregnancy for epilepsy and bipolar disorder if there is no other viable medication for a patient.

The European Medicines Agency has issued contraindications for use of valproic acid during pregnancy for both migraine and bipolar disorder and recommends its use during pregnancy for epilepsy only if there is no other viable treatment. To further prevent exposure, a pregnancy prevention program was implemented in 2018, including visual warnings of pregnancy risks on drug packaging and a patient alert card provided at dispensing. Such risk mitigation strategies are not indication specific, although the adherence to safe use behaviors and risk for unintended pregnancies may vary across the patient populations who represent each indication. Similarly, the World Health Organization has recommended against the use of valproic acid in women of childbearing potential and recommended the use of contraception if valproic acid is used.

Several studies in the US and Europe, have shown a decreasing trend in valproic acid use among persons of childbearing potential after the implementation of enhanced risk minimization efforts. In recent work, Al-Bahou et alnoted that the rate of decrease appears to vary across indications for valproic acid use. However, whether these indication-specific differences also translate into differences in pregnancy prevention or risk for unintended pregnancy is unclear. Therefore, this study evaluated the risk for pregnancy onset during valproic acid treatment across indications and assessed the use of contraception during treatment.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^ed346ca5]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Contrary to topiramate, the role of lamotrigine in the prevention of migraine is more controversial.

The North American guidelines for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine included lamotrigine among medications established to be ineffective. This low level of grading is essentially based on the results of two prospective, randomized, controlled trials, involving migraineurs both with and without aura. Both studies failed to demonstrate the efficacy of lamotrigine in migraine prophylaxis compare to placebo and topiramate respectively. However, posthoc analysis from the abovementioned studies, exploring the role of lamotrigine in reducing migraine aura frequency, was not conducted due to the small number of patients suffering from migraine with auraincluded. Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug that exerts its function by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels, indirectly leading to the inhibition of neuronal release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved in the development and propagation of CSD. Evidence suggests that chronic intraperitoneal administration of lamotrigine determine a strong suppression of CSD propagation in rats compared with placebo and valproate. More than a decade ago, several pilot, open label studies exploring the role of lamotrigine in the prophylaxis of migraine aura were conducted and pointed to a great efficacy of the drug in reducing both frequency and duration of aura episodes. Based on these findings, a prospective open study including 59 patients suffering from migraine with aura treated with lamotrigine showed a sustained reduction of aura frequency and duration. Additionally, more than three quarters of the aura responder patients also reported a significance reduction of migraine attacks frequency during the treatment period, suggesting a potential efficacy of lamotrigine for the prophylaxis of migraine headache as well. Based on these results, lamotrigine is largely used in clinical practice for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura especially in patients for whom other preventive treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, although clear evidence supporting the non-inferiority of lamotrigine compared with other approved migraine prophylactic agents is still lacking.

Combined hormonal contraception with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) — use, efficacy, and counseling are described as follows: combination hormonal contraception in women using enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs is a USMEC category 3; potent inducers include carbamazepine, primidone, phenobarbital, and phenytoin. For topiramate, therapy at dosages less than 200 mg daily does not affect pharmacokinetic levels of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) that contain 35 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol, and typical migraine doses of 25–50 mg are not considered to decrease contraceptive efficacy. Historically suggested strategies to mitigate decreased contraceptive efficacy have included prescribing high-dose OCPs (greater than 35 micrograms), prescribing extended cycle OCPs, and decreasing the hormone-free interval to less than 7 days, but none of these recommendations are evidence-based. When enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs cannot be avoided, patients should be counseled to simultaneously use barrier methods (eg, condoms) with combination hormonal contraceptives to decrease the risk of contraceptive failure.

### Valproate (valproic acid or sodium valproate or a combination of the two) for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^92e674aa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some antiepileptic drugs but not others are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of valproate (valproic acid or sodium valproate or a combination of the two) for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013) and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of valproate taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between valproate and comparator (placebo, active control, or valproate in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and, in select cases, risk ratios (RRs); we also calculated numbers needed to treat (NNTs). We calculated MDs for Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) scores. We also summarised data on adverse events from placebo-controlled trials and calculated risk differences (RDs) and numbers needed to harm (NNHs).

Main Results

Ten papers describing 10 unique trials met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of data from two trials (63 participants) showed that sodium valproate reduced headache frequency by approximately four headaches per 28 days as compared to placebo (MD -4.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.32 to -0.30). Data from four trials (542 participants) showed that divalproex sodium (a stable combination of sodium valproate and valproic acid in a 1:1 molar ratio) more than doubled the proportion of responders relative to placebo (RR 2.18; 95% CI 1.28 to 3.72; NNT 4; 95% CI 2 to 11). One study of sodium valproate (34 participants) versus placebo supported the latter findings (RR for responders 2.83; 95% CI 1.27 to 6.31; NNT 3; 95% CI 2 to 9). There was no significant difference in the proportion of responders between sodium valproate versus flunarizine (one trial, 41 participants) or between divalproex sodium versus propranolol (one trial, 32 participants). Pooled analysis of post-treatment mean headache frequencies in two trials (88 participants) demonstrates a slight but significant advantage for topiramate 50 mg over valproate 400 mg (MD -0.90; 95% CI -1.58 to -0.22). For placebo-controlled trials of sodium valproate and divalproex sodium, NNHs for clinically important adverse events ranged from 7 to 14.

Authors' Conclusions

Valproate is effective in reducing headache frequency and is reasonably well tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^02b1cc2b]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic, sodium channel blocking drug able to induce an indirect inhibition of neuronal glutamate release thus blocking CSD propagation throughout the cerebral cortex as shown by experimental model of CSD. The role of lamotrigine for the preventive treatment of migraine has been previously investigated. A double-blind, randomised, controlled, crossover study involving suffering from migraine with and without aura, concluded that lamotrigine was ineffective in reducing migraine frequency and intensity compared with topiramate, another antiepileptic drug approved as first-line agent for migraine prophylaxis, although efficacy outcomes of patients solely affected by migraine with aura were not reported at the end of the abovementioned study. On the other hand, evidence suggests that lamotrigine could be effective within the migraine aura clinical setting. To our best knowledge, studies comparing lamotrigine to others, first-line prophylactic migraine agents involving a population of patients solely suffering from migraine with aura are still lacking. For this reason, we conducted a retrospective analysis in order to assess the efficacy of lamotrigine compared with topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura.

Regarding the use of valproic acid PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: do not use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. The use of valproic acid during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, other structural abnormalities (craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations), neurodevelopmental disorders, and decreased IQ. Do not use valproic acid for epilepsy or bipolar disorder in pregnant patients or patients contemplating pregnancy unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. Do not use valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis in pregnant patients and in female patients of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. Do not use valproic acid in females of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. The drug valproic acid PO is classified under category D in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has caused, is suspected to have caused, or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.

### Anticonvulsants in migraine prophylaxis: a cochrane review [^da39c57d]. Cephalalgia (2008). Low credibility.

Several trials have asserted that some anticonvulsant drugs seem to be useful for the prophylaxis of migraine, but systematic reviews are sparse. We independently searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until 2005, as well as Headache and Cephalalgia through April 2006, for prospective, controlled trials of anticonvulsant drugs. Data were calculated and pooled across studies and expressed as standardized mean differences, odds ratios and numbers-needed-to-treat. Anticonvulsants, considered as a class, reduce migraine frequency by about 1.3 attacks per 28 days compared with placebo, and more than double the number of patients for whom migraine frequency is reduced by ≥ 50% relative to placebo. Sodium valproate/divalproex sodium and topiramate were better than placebo, whereas acetazolamide, clonazepam, lamotrigine and vigabatrin were not; gabapentin, in particular, needs further evaluation. Trials designed with sufficient power to compare different drugs are also necessary.

### Second-line medications for women aged 10 to 50 years with idiopathic generalized epilepsy [^b48d5530]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study provides valuable evidence to the ongoing debate regarding the optimal management of IGE in women who might become pregnant, particularly after the failure of first-line ASM therapy. Our findings support the use of either substitution monotherapy or add-on therapy as effective second-line options, with the choice best guided by individual patient characteristics. The combination of levetiracetam and lamotrigine emerges as a promising alternative for add-on therapy, offering a balance between efficacy and safety. However, when considering individual agents, valproic acid was confirmed as the most effective ASM even in this specific scenario. These findings aid in developing more informed and evidence-based treatment decisions in this challenging clinical context, offering clinicians valuable information for counseling their patients. Future research should aim to confirm these findings in RCTs, which would provide higher-level evidence and potentially uncover subtler differences between treatment strategies.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including valproic acid oral solution, during pregnancy.

This must be done by the patient herself.

Risk Summary

For use in prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)].

For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.

Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects including oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). This risk is dose-dependent; however, a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. In utero exposure to valproate may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss. Valproate polytherapy with other AEDs has been associated with an increased frequency of congenital malformations compared with AED monotherapy. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other anti-seizure monotherapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Data (Human)].

For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat of life.

Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects including oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). This risk is dose-dependent; however, a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. In utero exposure to valproate may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss. Valproate polytherapy with other AEDs has been associated with an increased frequency of congenital malformations compared with AED monotherapy. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who use other anti-seizure monotherapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and (Data Human)].

### Antiepileptics other than gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate, and valproate for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^8ad16940]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some antiepileptic drugs but not others are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of antiepileptic drugs other than gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate, and valproate (which are the subjects of separate Cochrane reviews) for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013) and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of antiepileptic drugs other than gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate, and valproate taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between antiepileptic drugs and comparators (placebo, active control, or same drug in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs). We also summarised data on adverse events from placebo-controlled trials and calculated risk differences (RDs) and numbers needed to harm (NNHs).

Main Results

Eleven papers describing 10 unique trials met the inclusion criteria. The 10 trials reported results for nine antiepileptic drugs other than gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate, and valproate. Six of the eight drugs investigated in placebo-controlled trials were not better than placebo in reducing headache frequency per 28-day period during treatment (clonazepam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and vigabatrin) and/or in the proportion of responders (acetazolamide, carisbamate, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine). One prospective, randomised, double-blind, single cross-over trial of 48 patients demonstrated a significant superiority of carbamazepine over placebo in the proportion of responders (OR 11.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.92 to 35.32). The NNT was 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). In a small prospective, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial, levetiracetam 1000 mg was significantly superior to placebo in reducing headache frequency per 28-day period during treatment (MD -2.40; 95% CI -4.52 to -0.28; 26 patients), as well as in the proportion of responders (OR 26.07; 95% CI 1.30 to 521.91; 26 patients). The NNT was 2 (95% CI 1 to 4). The same trial examined levetiracetam 1000 mg versus topiramate 100 mg and found a small but significant difference favouring topiramate in headache frequency per 28-day period during treatment (MD 1.40; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.66; 28 patients). There was no significant difference between levetiracetam and topiramate in the proportion of responders (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.16 to 3.23; 28 patients). Finally, one trial with 75 participants examined zonisamide versus topiramate (200 and 100 mg, respectively) and found no significant difference between them in reduction of headache frequency from baseline during the third month of treatment. Adverse events for active treatment versus placebo were available for all investigated drugs except levetiracetam, vigabatrin, and zonisamide. A high prevalence of adverse events was noted for carbamazepine, with a NNH of only 2 (95% CI 2 to 4).

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence does not allow robust conclusions regarding the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs other than gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate, and valproate in the prophylaxis of episodic migraine among adults. Acetazolamide, carisbamate, clonazepam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and vigabatrin were not more effective than placebo in reducing headache frequency. In one trial each, carbamazepine and levetiracetam were significantly superior to placebo in reducing headache frequency, and there was no significant difference in proportion of responders between zonisamide and active comparator. These three positive studies suffer from considerable methodological limitations.

### Study details | Lamotrigine and oral contraceptives… [^7fc51fe1]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine and Oral ContraceptivesClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Lamotrigine is widely used as an antiepileptic drug in the treatment of newly onset as well as refractory epilepsy. Lamotrigine is unique among the antiepileptic drug since the major route of elimination is conjugation with glucuronic acid. This conjugation reaction is catalyzed by the uridine 5'-diphosphate -glucuronosyltransferases; of which the isoform UGT1A4 probably is the major route of metabolism in humans. The pathway is inhibited by valproate and induced by other anticonvulsants, and explains the effect of these drugs on lamotrgine metabolism. Other drugs that are metabolized via direct glucoronidation may interfere with the metabolism of lamotrigine e.g. acetaminophen. Estrogeneous substrates are metabolized via glucuronidation and may potentially interact with the metabolism of lamotrigine.

In the development of lamotrigine for use in epilepsy patients the effect on the oral contraceptive pill was studied. In contrast to other commonly used antiepileptic drugs e.g. carbamazepine and phenytoin, lamotrigine did not significantly influence the constituents of the oral contraceptive pill. In addition, it was initially assumed from population pharmacokinetic studies, that oral contraceptives did not influence the metabolism of lamotrigine. However, recent retrospective studies indicate that oral contraceptives may increase the metabolism of lamotrigine resulting in a significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine when given with oral contraceptives. This effect is probably related to the ethinyl estradiol content of the combined contracetive pill and no the progesterone content.

To confirm and further extend these findings, the present study evaluates the effect of oral contraceptives on lamotrigine plasma concentrations in a double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study in patients with epilepsy. Reference List.

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^f0c65e06]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.4 Important Limitations

Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, Depakote is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)].

### Anticonvulsant drugs for migraine prophylaxis [^79a46b2b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Anticonvulsant drugs seem to be useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by a variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system that are probably relevant to the pathophysiology of migraine.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of anticonvulsants for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with migraine.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (from 1966 on) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Date of most recent search: April 2003. Additional information was gained from hand-searching specialist headache journals; correspondence with pharmaceutical companies, authors of reports, and experts in the field; and a wide variety of review articles and book chapters.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of self-administered drug treatments taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks and/or to reduce the intensity of those attacks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were selected and data extracted by two independent reviewers. For migraine frequency data, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for individual studies and pooled across studies. For dichotomous data on significant reduction in migraine frequency, odds ratios (ORs) and numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) were similarly calculated. Adverse events were analyzed by calculating numbers-needed-to-harm (NNHs) for studies using similar agents.

Main Results

Fifteen papers were included in the review. Of these, 14 reported trials comparing anticonvulsants with placebo, as follows: four trials of divalproex sodium, three trials of topiramate, two trials of sodium valproate, two trials of gabapentin, and one trial each of carbamazepine, clonazepam, and lamotrigine. One paper reported a trial of sodium valproate versus an active comparator, flunarizine, and one trial of divalproex sodium versus placebo included a comparison against propranolol, also an active comparator. Data from 2024 patients were considered. Analysis of data from eight trials (n = 841) demonstrates that anticonvulsants, considered as a class, reduce migraine frequency by about 1.4 attacks per 28 days as compared to placebo (SMD -0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.93 to -0.26). Data from 10 trials (n = 1341) show that anticonvulsants, considered as a class, also more than double the number of patients for whom migraine frequency is reduced by 50% or more, relative to placebo (OR 3.90; 95% CI 2.61 to 5.82; NNT 3.8; 95% CI 3.2 to 4.6). For seven trials of sodium valproate and divalproex sodium, NNHs for five clinically important adverse events ranged from 6.6 to 16.3. For the three trials of topiramate, NNHs for eight adverse events (100-mg dose) ranged from 2.4 to 32.9.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Anticonvulsants appear to be both effective in reducing migraine frequency and reasonably well tolerated. There is noticeable variation among individual agents, but there are insufficient data to know whether this is due to chance or variation in true efficacy. Neither clonazepam nor lamotrigine was superior to placebo (one trial each). Relatively few robust trials are available for agents other than sodium valproate/divalproex sodium. Two recently published and large trials of topiramate demonstrated reasonable efficacy, and one further trial of this agent is anticipated in the near future.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^425db46a]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the preventive treatment of migraine headache. The clinical question addressed was: What pharmacologic therapies are proven effective for migraine prevention?

Methods

The authors analyzed published studies from June 1999 to May 2009 using a structured review process to classify the evidence relative to the efficacy of various medications available in the United States for migraine prevention.

Results and Recommendations

The author panel reviewed 284 abstracts, which ultimately yielded 29 Class I or Class II articles that are reviewed herein. Divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, topiramate, metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity (Level A). Frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine (Level A). Lamotrigine is ineffective for migraine prevention (Level A).

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodiumDelayed-release) [^049b44a9]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Valproate is therefore contraindicated in pregnant women treated for prophylaxis of migraine [see Contraindications (4)]. Valproate should only be used to treat pregnant women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder if other medications have failed to control their symptoms or are otherwise unacceptable.

Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Women should use effective contraception while using valproate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].

A Medication Guide describing the risks of valproate is available for patients [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Pancreatitis Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Menstrual management for adolescents with disabilities [^4e0485b6]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Anticonvulsant therapy and hormonal contraception — For enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents, the CDC medical eligibility criteria categorize estrogen-containing methods and the progesterone-only pill as category 3 for contraception; lamotrigine can have decreased efficacy when combined with a combined oral contraceptive (COC), and the lamotrigine dose may need to be adjusted with discussion with the prescribing physician when starting a COC. Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs), injectables, and implants are recommended for patients on anticonvulsant medication. For medroxyprogesterone acetate injectables, some experts recommend dosing on an every-10-week schedule if irregular bleeding continues, and suppression of hormone fluctuations can be helpful for cyclical or catamenial epilepsy.

### Prenatal exposure to valproic acid across various indications for use [^4b8368f3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

We identified 165 772 valproic acid treatment episodes among 69 390 women of childbearing age (Table 1). Most treatment episodes were associated with diagnoses of mood disorders (70 376 [42.5%]) and migraine (32 303 [19.5%]). Epilepsy contributed the smallest proportion of treatment episodes (24 638 [14.9%]). A significant portion of treatment episodes were classified as unknown conditions (38 455 [23.2%]). Age varied across indication subgroups, with epilepsy treatment episodes attributed to patients who were commonly younger (aged 12–24 years, 12 475 [50.6%]) compared with migraine treatment users, who were predominately older (aged 35–44 years, 16 267 [50.4%]). The mean (SD) duration of treatment episodes was 84.7 (134.3) days in the overall cohort, with epilepsy treatment episodes having a slightly longer duration (106.0 [189.7] days) compared with other subgroups.

### New valproate regulations, informed choice and seizure risk [^4670cf91]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Valproate is the most effective medication for generalised epilepsies, and several specific epilepsy syndromes. For some people, it will be the only medication to establish seizure remission, and withdrawing it carries risks of seizure recurrence and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). It is also of proven efficacy for bipolar disorder and migraine prevention. Guidelines based on observational and epidemiological studies stress that maternal valproate related teratogenicity and neurodevelopmental effects are significantly higher than for other antiseizure medications (ASMs). It should, therefore, only be used if other medications are ineffective and after balancing the teratogenicity risk. Regulatory restrictions have changed prescribing practices and reduced valproate use. The number of other medications that must be trialled in the different conditions for which valproate has effectiveness and the consequences of the lack of efficacy of those drugs leading to significant harm including death remains unexplored. Risk minimisation measures (RMMs) for valproate, chiefly Pregnancy Prevention practices (PPP), consider foetal risk and not risk to people living with epilepsy. In the United Kingdom (UK), limitations relating to valproate use in all people < 55 years commenced in January 2024. While the evidence in child-bearing women is not disputed, the data in males are based on animal models, case reports, and one commissioned, unpublished, non-peer reviewed report unavailable to the UK public, stakeholder charities or professionals. Evidence suggests that 30–40% of people switching from valproate have breakthrough seizures. Thus, an estimated 21,000–28000 people in the UK will imminently be exposed to the potential hazards of breakthrough seizures, including death. There is little government investment in monitoring the effects of these changes to valproate prescribing on patient health and quality of life. This review summarises the history of valproate regulation, evidence underpinning it and argues how the latest regulations in the UK do not align with the country's medical regulatory bodies ethical principles nor with the Montgomery principles of informed patient choice and autonomy. It dissects how such regulations infringe Common Law principles, nor give due regard for patient outcomes beyond reproduction. The paper looks to provide recommendations to redress these concerns while appreciating the core need for such governance to emerge in the first place.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^78d40bab]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

Of the 53 patients recruited, 25 (3 male/22 female) were treated with topiramate and 28 (3 male/25 female) with lamotrigine. Among the two treatment groups, only one patient affected by aura without migraine was included, who had been treated with topiramate. Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics of both treatment groups are detailed in table 1.

Table 1
Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics of study population

Clinical features and distribution of migraine aura within the study population are reported in table 2.

Table 2
Clinical characteristics and distribution of migraine aura within the two treatment groups

Groups were sex- but not age-matched, since lamotrigine-treated patients were younger than those treated with topiramate (median age 37 and 46 years, respectively). There was no difference in age of migraine onset between the two groups. Interestingly, among lamotrigine-treated patients, 71% (20/28) had been previously treated with at least another migraine prophylactic agent compared with 48% (12/25) of those within the topiramate group, although this difference was not statistical significant, as shown in table 1.

Median prescribed dosage was 50 mg two times a day for both lamotrigine and topiramate (range 25 mg two times a day to 100 mg two times a day). Two patients treated with lamotrigine and one patient treated with topiramate discontinued treatment after few days due to severe side effects and were therefore excluded from outcome analysis.

Responder rates and optimal responder rates for monthly aura frequency, aura duration per episode and monthly migraine frequency are detailed in table 3.

Table 3
RRs and ORRs at the end of the follow-up period

Both lamotrigine and topiramate were highly effective in reducing monthly migraine frequency of at least 50% at the end of the follow-up period and no substantial difference between the two treatment groups was reported. Responder rates for aura frequency and duration were higher in the lamotrigine group compared with the topiramate group (88% vs 79% and 73% vs 54%, respectively), although these differences failed to reach statistical significance.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^a8c838c2]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that lamotrigine could be effective in reducing aura frequency and duration. However, studies comparing lamotrigine to other, first-line prophylactic agents solely involving patients suffering from migraine with aura are still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of lamotrigine and topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura.

Methods

Fifty-three patients suffering from migraine with aura treated with lamotrigine or topiramate for at least 6 months were included. Pre- and post-treatment clinical data regarding monthly aura frequency and duration, monthly migraine frequency, days of headache and rescue medication used per month were collected.

Results

Responder rates were similar between the two treatment groups at 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, responder rates for aura frequency and duration were higher in the lamotrigine group compared with the topiramate group (88% vs 79% and 73% vs 54%). Moreover, 50% of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of migraine aura compared with 37% of topiramate-treated patients. Side effects were more frequent in topiramate group compared with lamotrigine group (p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura especially for patients reporting prolonged aura and who do not respond, have contraindications or discontinue topiramate treatment due to side effects.

A MEDLINE (1967-June 2007) and bibliographic search of the English-language literature was conducted using the search terms valproic acid and migraine disorders.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles identified through the search were included.

Data Synthesis

Divalproex sodium is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of migraine headaches. The use of intravenous valproic acid has been studied as a possible treatment for acute migraine. Available studies are small, mostly open-label and non-placebo-controlled, and used variable doses. Valproic acid has not been shown to be superior to comparator drugs and was inferior to prochlorperazine in one trial.

Conclusions

Intravenous valproic acid has not been proven effective for acute migraine treatment. Future trials should be larger, placebo-controlled, and use a standardized dose and outcome measures.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^81518077]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for migraine, more specifically with respect to migraine prophylaxis, anticonvulsants, ACP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering monotherapy with topiramate for the prevention of episodic migraine in nonpregnant adults in outpatient settings not tolerating or inadequately responding to a first trial or trials of a β-blocker (metoprolol or propranolol), valproate, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline and a further trial with a CGRP antagonist (atogepant or rimegepant) or a CGRP monoclonal antibody (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab).

### Optimizing therapy of seizures in women who use oral contraceptives [^3575c3e3]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

There is no evidence that oral contraceptives (OCs) increase seizure activity, and OC use in the setting of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment provides pregnancy prevention at among the highest rates of any available contraceptive method. One concern, however, is the increased risk for OC failure with the use of cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme-inducing AEDs, such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, felbamate, topiramate, and oxcarbazepine. Felbamate induces metabolism of only the progestogenic component, whereas topiramate induces metabolism of only the estrogenic component. There is preliminary evidence that lamotrigine induces the metabolism of a progestin, levonorgestrel. It is unclear whether the estrogenic or the progestogenic component is more clinically important in preventing pregnancy. To ensure maximal pregnancy prevention, it is therefore recommended that women taking enzyme-inducing AEDs should receive OCs containing at least 50 mug of ethinyl estradiol and that low-dose formulations in general should not be used. AEDs that do not induce cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes, including valproic acid, gabapentin, levetiracetam, tiagabine, vigabatrin, zonisamide, and pregabalin, do not interact with OCs. There are no concerns regarding the treatment of seizures or increased pregnancy risk with the use of OCs and these non-enzyme-inducing AEDs. Lamotrigine levels, however, are reduced by 50% in the setting of OC use. Therefore, women with epilepsy taking lamotrigine need to be monitored carefully for seizures when OCs are started and for toxicity when OCs are discontinued. Dose adjustment to maintain clinical stability may be necessary in these settings. The placebo or pill-free week of the OC regimen may also be a period when clinical toxicity can occur. Even with the considerations discussed in this review, OCs are a reasonable contraceptive option for women with epilepsy taking AEDs.

### Valproate pregnancy prevention scheme: what are the barriers to enrolling patients and how do we meet them? [^8cef69c2]. BMJ Neurology Open (2023). High credibility.

Comparing this with our second smaller cohort (80 women), fewer patients stopped or did not have documentation; however, 21 (25.9%) meet PPP, 27 (33.33%) stopped valproate and 33 (40.7%) did not meet PPP.

The prospective data confirmed 24 new patients with epilepsy being well enrolled on PPP (online supplemental table 3). Despite our efforts, two patients fell pregnant while on treatment with valproate. Both patients had undertaken consultant reviews and completed PPP documentation. The first had become pregnant soon after the removal of her coil in the intervening period before her annual follow-up. The coil was removed by gynaecology colleagues, with no contact with neurology services. The second patient became pregnant while awaiting sterilisation; she had agreed to use two forms of contraception pending the procedure, having had a negative pregnancy test on initiation of treatment for highly refractory epilepsy. For the patients with migraine (18), a significant number had short periods of treatment with valproate, often for a few months and 4 had this treatment initiated in primary care with no secondary care involvement. This was also true of the seven patients in which there was insufficient secondary care data to know the indication for commencing valproate treatment. We identified that these patients' treatment was initiated by either primary care or private clinicians with no secondary care involvement. Four of the psychiatry cases had valproate treatment initiated by private psychiatrists and two had treatment initiated in other countries before moving to the region.

### Combined oral anticonceptives and the pill-free week in two bipolar patients treated with lamotrigine [^70ae10cc]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Lamotrigine (LTG) is a level 1 treatment option for bipolar disorder, as both treatment and prophylaxis of depressive symptoms. It is generally safe and well tolerated, with the rare but serious side effect of Stevens‐Johnsons syndrome. This occurs when dose titration is done too fast; hence, a titration phase of 5‐6 weeks is recommended. Since valproic acid is no longer recommended as a first‐line mood stabilizer in fertile women, LTG is often used in these patients. For birth control, these women often use combined oral anticonceptives (COC) containing ethinyl estradiol and progestins. However, estrogens interact with LTG and potentially lower the plasma concentration up to 60%. 1 Estrogen‐induced glucuronidation is responsible for the drop in lamotrigine levels during active COC use. This drug interaction is well documented and is also seen with other ethinyl estradiol containing anticonceptives (eg, vaginal ring), hormonal replacement therapy, and during pregnancy. 1, 2 For use as an anticonvulsant in epilepsy, guidelines recommend the use of a different anticonceptive strategy or to skip the pill‐free week. Often, women do not prefer to continuously skip the pill‐free week, since this can lead to more breakthrough bleeding (spotting).

When used as a mood stabilizer, it is unclear what effect a pill‐free week (and thus variable LTG‐concentrations) may have on mood symptoms. Some evidence exists for a plasma concentration‐response association, with a therapeutic range between 1‐6 µg/mL. 3 The evidence for a clinically relevant therapeutic window is sparse, and therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring is not recommended. However, in theory, patients have a higher LTG blood level during the pill‐free week, which could improve mood or induce more side effects/toxicity, which was reported in a case‐report series. 4 On starting with a new COC strip, lowering of the plasma concentration might induce depressive symptoms. Although no randomized controlled trials have been done to confirm or reject these hypotheses, our clinical experience is that Dutch pharmacies may advise bipolar patients to skip the pill‐free week.

### Divalproex sodium (divalproex sodiumDelayed-release) [^7ad0f3aa]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Simple and Complex Absence Seizures

The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day. If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.

A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentrations for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As the divalproex sodium dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.

In epileptic patients previously receiving valproic acid therapy, divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets should be initiated at the same daily dose and dosing schedule. After the patient is stabilized on divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets, a dosing schedule of two or three times a day may be elected in selected patients.

2.3 Migraine

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults.

Divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets are administered orally. The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily. Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1,000 mg/day. In the clinical trials, there was no evidence that higher doses led to greater efficacy.

### Valproate teratogenicity: a moving target [^e6d4eb9f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Within several years after receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the late 1970s, valproate was shown to increase the risk for major congenital malformations and learning disabilities in the offspring of women who used the drug during pregnancy. Nonetheless, its use in pregnant women has persisted for more than four decades, recently resulting in numerous lawsuits and, in countries other than the United States, criminal indictments of the manufacturers of valproate. The use of valproate in pregnancy persisted and extended beyond its original indication for the treatment of epilepsy. Several recent studies indicate that the drug is more often prescribed to treat pregnant women with bipolar depression and migraine than for seizure control. Especially concerning is the absence of valproate from the list of more than 60 drugs for which the FDA has implemented Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies to prevent or limit untoward consequences associated with specific drugs. Until this step is taken, avoidance of the teratogenic effects of valproate will rely on the vigilance of those caring for women and people with the potential to get pregnant.

### Prenatal exposure to valproic acid across various indications for use [^9ad53fb8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Data Source and Study Population

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Merative MarketScan commercial claims databases from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2020. MarketScan contains longitudinal health care data for a nationwide sample of privately insured patients in the US, including insurance claims for inpatient and outpatient visits as well as outpatient pharmacy claims for dispensed prescriptions. Pharmacy claims data offer details on days of supply, strength, quantity, and route of administration. This study was considered exempt from review and informed consent by the University of Florida Institutional Review Board due to the use of deidentified data. Race and ethnicity data are not collected in MarketScan. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

We identified female patients aged 12 to 44 years with valproic acid prescription fills between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2019. We excluded any invalid valproic acid pharmacy claims (ie, negative days' supply or price). Since patients are unlikely to receive a prescription with a supply greater than 180 days, we truncated the days' supply to the median of 37 days for any dispensing greater than 180 days. Treatment episodes were constructed by combining subsequent dispensing, allowing up to 7-day gaps between the end of the dispensed days' supply of a fill and the dispensing date of the subsequent fill. We required treatment episodes to be at least 30 days long. Women could contribute multiple treatment episodes if all other inclusion criteria were met. To ascertain the likely indication for valproic acid use, we required 6 months of continuous enrollment for medical and prescription benefits prior to the start of each treatment episode. Moreover, we required continuous enrollment through 9 months after the end of each treatment episode to ascertain pregnancy occurrence.

Indication Determination

Probable indications for valproic acid use were based on International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes recorded on outpatient visits in the 6 months prior to the treatment episode. We grouped these codes into 4 categories: epilepsy (defined based on Clinical Classifications Software [CCS] category 83), headaches (including migraine; CCS category 84), mood disorders (CCS category 657), and unknown. The unknown classification was used if a patient did not have a corresponding diagnosis for any labeled indication categories. For patients with diagnoses in multiple categories, we assigned the indication based on the diagnosis closest to treatment episode start, resulting in mutually exclusive indication groups.

### Teratogenesis, perinatal, and neurodevelopmental outcomes after in utero exposure to antiseizure medication: practice guideline from the AAN, AES, and SMFM [^6ec0f67b]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of valproate sodium IV in pregnant patients for all trimesters: do not use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. The use of valproate sodium during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, other structural abnormalities (craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations), neurodevelopmental disorders, and decreased IQ. Do not use valproate sodium for epilepsy or bipolar disorder in pregnant patients or patients contemplating pregnancy unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. Do not use valproate sodium for migraine prophylaxis in pregnant patients and in female patients of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. Do not use valproate sodium in females of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. The drug valproate sodium IV is classified under category D in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has caused, is suspected to have caused, or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.

### Gynecologic management of adolescents and young women with seizure disorders: ACOG committee opinion, number 806 [^bf2c6052]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Lamotrigine and combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) co-use — pharmacokinetic and clinical considerations include that lamotrigine is metabolized by hepatic uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes that are inducible by ethinyl estradiol, and combined OCPs have been shown to reduce lamotrigine concentrations by 50%, increasing the risk of seizures. Lamotrigine levels rise during the pill-free interval, which could contribute to adverse effects. When the use of lamotrigine and combination hormonal contraceptives cannot be avoided, dose adjustments with lamotrigine may be needed or extended cycle use of contraception can be considered, or both, and management requires close collaboration with a neurologist.

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^4ca0799b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Depakote is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults.

Depakote tablets are administered orally. The recommended starting dose is 250 mg twice daily. Some patients may benefit from doses up to 1,000 mg/day. In the clinical trials, there was no evidence that higher doses led to greater efficacy.

### Divalproex sodium (Depakote) [^6e4c85ad]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Migraine

The results of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials established the effectiveness of Depakote in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache.

Both studies employed essentially identical designs and recruited patients with a history of migraine with or without aura (of at least 6 months in duration) who were experiencing at least 2 migraine headaches a month during the 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients with cluster headaches were excluded. Women of childbearing potential were excluded entirely from one study, but were permitted in the other if they were deemed to be practicing an effective method of contraception.

In each study following a 4-week single-blind placebo baseline period, patients were randomized, under double blind conditions, to Depakote or placebo for a 12-week treatment phase, comprised of a 4-week dose titration period followed by an 8-week maintenance period. Treatment outcome was assessed on the basis of 4-week migraine headache rates during the treatment phase.

In the first study, a total of 107 patients (24 M, 83 F), ranging in age from 26 to 73 were randomized 2:1, Depakote to placebo. Ninety patients completed the 8-week maintenance period. Drug dose titration, using 250 mg tablets, was individualized at the investigator's discretion. Adjustments were guided by actual/sham trough total serum valproate levels in order to maintain the study blind. In patients on Depakote doses ranged from 500 to 2,500 mg a day. Doses over 500 mg were given in three divided doses (TID). The mean dose during the treatment phase was 1,087 mg/day resulting in a mean trough total valproate level of 72.5 mcg/mL, with a range of 31 to 133 mcg/mL.

### Valproate in pregnancy: recent research and regulatory responses [^b668d249]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Valproate and formulations thereof are approved for the management of seizure disorders, bipolar disorder, and migraine. Valproate is also used for many off-label indications. Unfortunately, data from observational studies indicate that valproate is perhaps the most teratogenic drug in the neuropsychiatric pharmacopeia. It is significantly more teratogenic than many other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In observational studies, gestational exposure to valproate is also associated with higher risks of cognitive, language, and psychomotor delay during early childhood and possibly with an increased risk of autism, as well. Although untreated epilepsy is itself associated with many adverse gestational and neonatal outcomes, confounding by indication is an unlikely explanation for the adverse outcomes observed with valproate. This is because of the range of the adverse outcomes, the magnitude of the risks, the dose-dependent nature of the risks, the consistency of findings across studies, the specificity of outcomes for valproate exposure, and the greater risks with valproate relative to other AEDs. Despite the existence of a large body of literature that documents these risks, valproate continues to be prescribed to a substantial proportion of women of childbearing potential. As a result, many regulatory bodies across the world have discouraged and even banned the use of valproate during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential unless no satisfactory alternatives exist or unless a pregnancy prevention program is implemented.

### An evidence-based approach to hormonal contraception and headaches [^2f97b1d1]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Some controversy exists regarding contraceptive management in women with migraines, particularly migraines with aura. The available scientific literature indicates that combined hormonal contraception is safe with most headache subtypes. However, it should be avoided in women with migraine with aura and women with simple migraines who have other risk factors for stroke. Progestin only contraceptives as well as the copper intrauterine device can be safely used in women with migraines. Accurate classification of a patient's headache type can avoid unnecessary restriction of effective contraceptive methods, particularly those containing estrogen.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Valproate Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking Valproate Sodium Injection during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling toll-free 1-888-233-2334 or visiting the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This must be done by the patient herself.

Risk Summary

For use in prophylaxis of migraine headaches, valproate is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4)].

For use in epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate should not be used to treat women who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Women with epilepsy who become pregnant while taking valproate should not discontinue valproate abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.

Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for any indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects including spina bifida, but also malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects including oral clefts, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). This risk is dose-dependent; however, a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. In utero exposure to valproate may also result in hearing impairment or hearing loss. Valproate polytherapy with other AEDs has been associated with an increased frequency of congenital malformations compared with AED monotherapy. The risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has been shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who used other anti-seizure monotherapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Data (Human)].

### Antiepileptics in migraine prophylaxis: an updated cochrane review [^21dc9c65]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy of several antiepileptics in the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults has been systematically reviewed. Because many trial reports have been published since then, an updated systematic review was warranted.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to January 15, 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, January 15, 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to January 15, 2013) and hand-searched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013. Prospective, controlled trials of antiepileptics taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both, were selected.

Results

Mean headache frequency on topiramate and sodium valproate is significantly lower than placebo. Likewise, topiramate and divalproex demonstrated favorable results for the proportion of subjects with ≥ 50% reduction of migraine attacks. For topiramate, 100 mg and 200 mg outperformed 50 mg, but this was paralleled by a higher adverse event rate. For valproate/divalproex, a dose-effect correlation could not be established. There was no unequivocal evidence of efficacy for any of the other antiepileptics.

Conclusion

Topiramate, sodium valproate and divalproex are effective prophylactic treatments for episodic migraine in adults. In contrast to previous reports, there is insufficient evidence to further support the use of gabapentin.

### "In the name of the father: risk to the offspring from paternal exposure to valproate during conception" [^2ade00b1]. Epilepsy Currents (2025). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Epilepsy frequently starts early in life and, hence, it is likely to afflict individuals throughout reproductive age. The anatomic and behavioral impact of antiseizure medications (ASMs) to the fetus through the mother during pregnancy and lactation has been extensively studied. Yet, the impact of ASMs to the offspring through the father during spermatogenesis has drawn much less attention. -

In addition to women of child-bearing age, Valproate (VPA) has been under the spotlight also for men with epilepsy. The same question is posed for a host of male patients without epilepsy, who are nevertheless prescribed ASMs for other indications (eg, migraines, mood stabilization, peripheral neuropathy, etc). After retrospective observational data derived from Scandinavian registries raised concerns for a heightened risk of neurodevelopmental disorders to children whose fathers used VPA around the time of conception, governing organizations, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, have placed the issue under scrutiny. So, should all these men use contraception to avoid fathering a child while on this medication or stop the medication during the time of spermatogenesis (ie, 3 months prior to conception) if they decide to become parents?

Table 2.
Crude and Age-Standardized Pregnancy Incidence Rates Among Female Patients Using Valproic Acid by Indication

Abbreviations: IRR, incidence rate ratio; NA, not applicable.

Figure 1.
Pregnancy Incidence Rate Among Female Patients Using Valproic Acid

The shaded area indicates 95% CIs.

Overall, only 445 pregnancies (61.5%) ended in a live birth (eTable in Supplement 1). Use with migraine or headache (87 of 129 [67.4%]) and unknown indication (83 of 130 [63.8%]) had a higher proportion of live births compared with those with epilepsy (49 of 88 [55.7%]) and mood disorders (226 of 376 [60.1%]). Unknown pregnancy outcomes across indications were rare, ranging from 3.1% to 6.8%.

Limited contraceptive use was identified among valproic acid users, with 128 760 treatment episodes (77.7%) having no overlap with contraception use periods and 37 012 (22.3%) having at least 1 day of contraception coverage. Most contraception coverage consisted of oral forms (27 069 [73.1%]). Overall, there was a slight increase in identified contraception use with at least 1 day of overlap with a treatment episode from 2005 to 2019 (1167 [19.3%] to 999 [24.5%]; P < .001) (Figure 2). Among episodes that overlapped with contraceptive use, the most commonly identified contraceptive method included oral contraceptives (27 069 treatment episodes [16.3%]) followed by injectable contraception (4717 [2.8%]) and IUDs (1498 [0.9%]). Use of multiple contraception types accounted for 3314 episodes (2.0%). Contraception use varied slightly by indication, with higher percentages of contraceptive use among treatment episodes attributed to migraine or headache (8056 [24.9%]) and mood disorder (17 182 [24.4%]) (Table 3) when requiring at least 1 day overlap of contraception and valproic acid use. Among those using oral contraception, a median of 35.5% of the valproic acid treatment episodes was covered by contraception. This median varied slightly by indication. Median concomitant coverage was higher (100%) for users of IUDs. Overall, regardless of route or indication, there was limited contraceptive use that could be captured via pharmacy prescription fills or billed medical procedures.

### Levetiracetam in the prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine: a prospective open label study [^a39a10cd]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The prophylactic treatment of migraine includes anticonvulsant drugs such as valproic acid and topiramate. However, these substances are often poorly tolerated by migraine patients. So far levetiracetam has hardly been studied as an episodic migraine prophylactic agent in adults.

Objective

To perform a prospective pilot study for the evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam in the prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine.

Methods

Fifty patients with episodic migraine were enrolled in this prospective, open label study. After a baseline period of four weeks, patients received 1,000mg (starting dose 500mg) bid levetiracetam for 12 weeks. Migraine frequency and accompanying symptoms were recorded in a headache diary. The primary endpoint was the comparison of attack frequency during the baseline with attack frequency during the last four weeks of treatment (treatment period 3).

Results

In the Intent-To-Treat analysis, 46% of the patients had a migraine reduction of more than 50% in the third period as compared to the baseline period. The mean number of migraine attacks decreased from 5.2 ± 2.1 (baseline) to 3.4 ± 2.7 (period 3). The most frequently reported side effects were somnolence, nausea, and weight gain; all were mild and transient. In a post-hoc comparison, responders to levetiracetam had significantly less migraine attacks at baseline and had significantly more often migraine with aura.

Conclusion

The data suggest that levetiracetam has some potential in the prophylactic treatment of episodic migraine which seems, however, to be not superior to that of other anticonvulsant drugs. Levetiracetam was well tolerated and showed better efficacy in patients with migraine with aura and in less affected migraine patients. A larger placebo-controlled, double-blind study in adults seems justified on the basis of these data.

### New CNS-active drugs which are second-generation valproic acid: can they lead to the development of a magic bullet? [^f82c2988]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Valproic acid (VPA) is one of the four first line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). VPA is also an effective drug in migraine prophylaxis and in treatment of bipolar disorders. The use of VPA is limited by its two rare but potentially life-threatening side effects, teratogenicity and hepatotoxicity, and it is the least potent of the established AEDs. Consequently, there is an incentive to develop a second-generation VPA. A successful, second-generation VPA would need to possess the following characteristics: broad-spectrum antiepileptic activity; better potency than VPA; and lack of teratogenicity and hepatotoxicity. These characteristics would give such a drug the potential to be utilized in epilepsy and other CNS disorders.

Recent Findings

Intensive research has been carried out in order to develop a second-generation VPA that would be more potent and safer than VPA. Amide derivatives of VPA have shown particular value as potential follow-up compounds and have better in-vivo performance than VPA. Several CNS-active valproylamides are more potent as antiepileptics than VPA, they possess broad-spectrum antiepileptic activity, and have been found to be nonteratogenic in animal models. The amide analogues of VPA that emerged from structure-pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship studies as promising second-generation compounds are: N-methyl-tetramethylcyclopropane carboxamide, (2S,3S)-valnoctamide, (R)-propylisopropyl acetamide and valproyl glycinamide.

Summary

At present there are three compounds in clinical trials in patients with epilepsy that can be regarded as second-generation VPA: valproyl glycinamide, 3-methylbutanamide or isovaleramide and SPD421 (DP-VPA). For any one of these second-generation valproic acids to become a successful follow-up compound to VPA, it has to fulfil the above criteria and also possess favorable pharmacokinetics.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^3dbf46a6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — anticonvulsant therapy: Certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, primidone, topiramate, oxcarbazepine) are category 3; Clarification: Although the interaction of certain anticonvulsants with CHCs is not harmful, it is likely to reduce the effectiveness of CHCs. Use of other contraceptives should be encouraged for persons who are long-term users of any of these drugs. When a combined oral contraceptive (COC) is chosen, a preparation containing a minimum of 30 μg ethinyl estradiol should be used. Evidence: Use of certain anticonvulsants might decrease the effectiveness of COCs (284–288). Lamotrigine is category 3; Clarification: The recommendation for lamotrigine applies only for situations where lamotrigine is taken as monotherapy, and Evidence notes pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate decreased lamotrigine concentrations during COC use and that certain women who used both COCs and lamotrigine experienced increased seizure activity in one trial.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^60668aea]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic drugs

There were studies of lamotrigine, topiramate and sodium valproate in VM. Vestibular symptoms in VM were thought to be a form of migraine aura in previous pathophysiological models, which led to some interest in lamotrigine for VM prophylaxis due to its role in treatment of migraine aura, which may be mediated through inhibition of cortical spreading depression. There has been one small retrospective, uncontrolled before-and-after study of lamotrigine, where 19 patients received 100 mg daily for between 3 and 4 months. Mean vertigo frequency reduced from 18.2 to 5.4 attacks per month (P < 0.001) and monthly headache frequency reduced from 8.7 to 4.4 (reported as 'not significant') over the course of the study. No side effects were reported by the participants, which is concordant with our clinical experience that lamotrigine is generally well-tolerated.

Sodium valproate is an established preventative treatment for migraine headacheand acts on multiple neurotransmitters that may have relevance in migraine. It has only been examined in multiple-arm studies in VM. In one study, 25 patients receiving sodium valproate 500 mg twice daily were compared to groups of the same size receiving flunarizine and venlafaxine. A before-and-after analysis of the sodium valproate group found that monthly vertigo frequency improved from 5.1 to 2.4 attacks per month (P < 0.05) and there was also an improvement in DHI (46.8–38.6, P = 0.02), although a VAS for vertigo symptoms was similar pre- and post-treatment (5.8–5.3, P = 0.27). Sixteen percent of patients reported non-serious side effects (nausea, insomnia, palpitations, lethargy and indigestion). Sodium valproate can cause weight gain, a reason why many patients may choose to avoid or stop the drug. Moreover, sodium valproate is known to be teratogenic, and appropriate caution must accordingly be used when prescribing to young women, although not all studies of valproate in VM have excluded women of childbearing age.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^6d918727]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Topiramate for migraine prevention — recommendation and safety: We suggest topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine. It is categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. The benefits of topiramate in improving monthly migraine days in patients with chronic and episodic migraines slightly outweighed the potential harm of adverse events. Safety cautions include the reduced efficacy of contraception at topiramate doses > 200 mg and an increased risk of teratogenicity with use during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester; cognitive side effects can be extremely bothersome, especially in patients with TBI or PTH, and should be used cautiously or avoided.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^c1ebd6a4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Headaches in pregnancy — antiepileptic drugs for prevention carry distinct risks and recommendations. For topiramate, risks include "stillbirth or spontaneous abortion (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.12–5.49), major congenital anomalies (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.17–2.97), and fetal growth restriction (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.41–4.63)", so "its use in pregnancy or the prepregnancy period for headache prevention is not recommended". For valproic acid, risks include "stillbirth or spontaneous abortion (combined) (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.04–3.45)" and "neural tube defects (RR 5.30; 95% CI 1.05–26.70)", and "The use of valproic acid in pregnancy or the prepregnancy period for headache prevention is not recommended". Although carbamazepine also has risk signals, "its overall risk is considered more acceptable than valproic acid and topiramate if an antiepileptic is to be considered for headache prevention".

### Valproate effects on kinetics of lamotrigine in pregnancy and treatment with oral contraceptives [^56f8f9ff]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In eight women treated with lamotrigine monotherapy, the lamotrigine dose/plasma concentration (D/C) ratio increased by 295% from baseline outside pregnancy to midgestation, whereas in six women treated with lamotrigine in combination with valproate, the increase was only 60%. No difference in lamotrigine D/C ratio was found between users and nonusers of oral contraceptives comedicated with valproate. Valproate seems to reduce the induction of lamotrigine metabolism associated with pregnancy or use of contraceptives.

### Exposure to medication for neurological disease in pregnancy-time to consider the long-term implications? [^86e6cef1]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A range of long-term neurological conditions may be diagnosed in young adulthood. These conditions are generally not curable, and most people need to take ongoing treatment for symptom control and/or disease modification. When chronic diseases are diagnosed before people have completed their families, there is a need to balance the potential benefits of treatment for the mother against potential risk(s) to the fetus from exposure to medications during pregnancy. Whilst available data regarding short-term fetal outcomes following treatment exposures during pregnancy is rapidly increasing, information regarding longer-term outcomes is more limited. The association of fetal exposure to valproate with serious long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes has highlighted the importance of capturing and evaluating long-term data. In this review we examine available evidence around the long-term effects of treatments used for the most common long-term neurological conditions diagnosed in early adulthood, namely epilepsy, migraine and neuroinflammatory disorders. We draw from existing literature across a range of diseases and discuss strategies to improve future knowledge.
