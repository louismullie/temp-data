## Question

A 31-year-old man is diagnosed with ocular syphilis. He has no other symptoms or abnormal physical examination findings. He has a positive serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test with a titer of 1:128. He does not have any antibiotic allergies.
What treatment should be recommended for this man?

Doxycycline orally 100 mg twice daily for 28 days

Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total divided into three weekly intramuscular injections of 2.4 million units with each dose

Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV twice daily for 7 days

Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18–24 million units per day, administered as 3–4 million units IV every 4 hours or continuous infusion, for 10–14 days

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which treatment should be recommended for ocular syphilis in a patient without penicillin allergy from the provided options, and how the listed alternatives stack up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether ocular syphilis is managed as neurosyphilis. Then, I should verify the guideline-recommended first-line agent, dose, route, and duration. Next, I will cross-check acceptable alternatives and their exact dosing when IV penicillin is not feasible or when allergy is present. Finally, I will evaluate each proposed option, preserve any initial missteps, and confirm the correct choice with a clear conclusion aligned to major guidelines [^114Ma81C] [^116zMPYm].

> Let me first confirm the categorization, because that determines the entire treatment approach. Ocular syphilis is treated as neurosyphilis regardless of CSF findings, so therapy must achieve sustained treponemicidal levels in the CNS and ocular compartments; treatment should not be delayed while arranging additional diagnostics, although CSF evaluation can be considered to support differential diagnosis and for follow-up if abnormal, especially per European guidance [^114Ma81C] [^114UmpCR] [^111LuBwz].

> Now, I need to verify the first-line regimen and its parameters. The consensus first-line therapy for neurosyphilis and ocular syphilis is aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18–24 million units per day, administered as 3–4 million units IV every 4 hours or continuous infusion for 10–14 days; the key is uninterrupted CNS treponemicidal levels throughout the entire course, and if therapy is interrupted for more than 24 hours, some guidelines advise restarting the course to maintain efficacy [^114Ma81C] [^116zMPYm] [^111KEsxd] [^114oySjU].

> Hold on, I should review acceptable alternatives and when they apply. When IV benzylpenicillin cannot be given, options include ceftriaxone 2 g IV or IM once daily for 10–14 days, or procaine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM daily plus probenecid 500 mg PO QID for 10–14 days, with a strong preference for penicillin desensitization whenever feasible because penicillin remains the preferred agent; some guidelines also list doxycycline-based regimens for neurosyphilis only when first-line therapy is not possible, and these require higher dosing and longer duration than early-syphilis regimens [^112oswF8] [^1146e6aH] [^116EvmZm] [^114bChmN].

> I will now examine each proposed option against the evidence, and I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. For doxycycline, I initially thought 100 mg PO BID for 28 days might be acceptable, but wait, let me verify the dose; guidelines that include doxycycline for neurosyphilis specify 200 mg PO BID for 28 days as an off-label alternative only when IV penicillin or ceftriaxone is not feasible, so 100 mg BID is underdosed and not first-line, and even at 200 mg BID it remains a second-line fallback rather than preferred therapy [^114bChmN]. For benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM weekly for three weeks, I need to ensure I am not mixing up regimens; that schedule is for early syphilis or late latent disease without CNS involvement and does not achieve adequate CNS or ocular levels, so it is inappropriate for ocular syphilis and specifically not recommended for neurosyphilis indications [^114Ma81C]. For ceftriaxone 1 g IV BID for 7 days, let me double-check the recommended dose and duration; the alternative supported regimen is 2 g daily for 10–14 days, so both the proposed dose and the 7-day duration are inadequate for neurosyphilis or ocular syphilis treatment [^1146e6aH] [^112oswF8]. For aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18–24 million units per day IV for 10–14 days, this precisely matches the first-line standard endorsed across CDC and European guidance for ocular syphilis and is the correct choice in a non-allergic patient [^114Ma81C] [^116zMPYm].

> But wait, what about adjunct considerations and sequencing that might influence the plan. Some HIV-focused guidance suggests considering an additional benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM dose after completion of the IV course in selected scenarios, although this is not required for ocular disease per se; in all cases, management should include close ophthalmology and infectious diseases follow-up, evaluation for HIV and other STIs, counseling on Jarisch–Herxheimer reactions, and serologic monitoring, with therapy started promptly and not delayed for further testing [^112oBc9j] [^114Ma81C].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final recommendation clearly and succinctly. The guideline-concordant first-line therapy for this patient with ocular syphilis and no penicillin allergy is aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18–24 million units per day, given as 3–4 million units IV every 4 hours or continuous infusion, for 10–14 days, ensuring uninterrupted CNS treponemicidal exposure throughout the course and prioritizing timely initiation of treatment [^114Ma81C] [^116zMPYm] [^111KEsxd].

---

The recommended treatment for ocular syphilis in a patient without antibiotic allergies is **aqueous crystalline penicillin G** 18–24 million units per day IV every 4 hours or continuous infusion for **10–14 days** [^114Ma81C]. This regimen is first-line because it achieves treponemicidal levels in the CNS and ocular tissues [^111KEsxd]. Benzathine penicillin G is **not appropriate for ocular syphilis** because it does not reach adequate CNS/ocular levels. If penicillin is contraindicated, **ceftriaxone 2 g IV/IM daily for 10–14 days is an alternative** [^1146e6aH]; doxycycline is not recommended for ocular syphilis.

---

## Recommended treatment regimen

The **first-line therapy** for ocular syphilis is aqueous crystalline penicillin G [^116zMPYm], which achieves treponemicidal levels in the CNS and ocular tissues [^111KEsxd]. The **dosage** is 18–24 million units per day, given as 3–4 million units IV every 4 hours or by continuous infusion [^114Ma81C], for a **duration** of 10–14 days. This regimen is **supported by CDC and DHHS guidelines** for neurosyphilis and for ocular and auricular syphilis in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients (CDC [^114Ma81C]) (DHHS guidelines [^112oBc9j]).

---

## Alternative treatment options

If penicillin is contraindicated, **ceftriaxone** 2 g IV or IM once daily [^114bChmN] for 10–14 days is an alternative [^112oswF8]. Doxycycline is **not recommended** for ocular syphilis due to insufficient CNS/ocular penetration and limited evidence.

---

## Rationale for recommended treatment

The **rationale** for aqueous crystalline penicillin G is its proven efficacy [^116zMPYm], CNS/ocular penetration [^111KEsxd], and strong guideline support [^112oBc9j]. Early treatment helps prevent irreversible vision loss and other complications [^114Ma81C].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients should have **regular follow-up** with ophthalmology and infectious disease specialists [^114Ma81C], and clinicians should monitor for a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction [^1166Z4KT] and ensure clinical and serologic response.

---

## Summary table of treatment options

| **Treatment option** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aqueous crystalline penicillin G | 18–24 million units/day IV every 4 hours or continuous infusion | 10–14 days | First-line [^114Ma81C] |
| Ceftriaxone | 2 g IV/IM once daily | 10–14 days | Alternative [^1146e6aH] |
| Doxycycline | 200 mg PO BID | 28 days | Not recommended [^114Ma81C] |

---

Bottom line: For ocular syphilis without antibiotic allergy, use **intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G** for 10–14 days [^114Ma81C]; benzathine penicillin G is inadequate. If penicillin cannot be used, ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 10–14 days is acceptable [^1146e6aH]; **doxycycline is not recommended** [^112oswF8].

Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies of MYDAYIS 25 mg/day (Study 3) and 50 mg/day (Study 2) were conducted in adult patients who met DSM-IV TR criteria for ADHD. The efficacy was determined using the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP), a skill-adjusted math test that measures attention in ADHD. The PERMP total score results from the sum of the number of math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly.

Efficacy assessments were conducted at 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, and 16 hours post-dose using the PERMP. MYDAYIS treatment, compared to placebo, reached statistical significance at either 2 hours (Study 2) or 4 hours (Study 3) post-dose to 16 hours post-dose in both studies. In a prespecified supplementary analysis for Study 2, the maximum approved dose of MYDAYIS (50 mg) demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect compared with placebo beginning at 2 to 16 hours post-dose.

### Doxy 100 [^117DyEWz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Note that rapid administration is to be avoided. Parenteral therapy is indicated only when oral therapy is not feasible. Oral therapy should commence as soon as possible. If intravenous therapy is administered over prolonged periods, thrombophlebitis may result.

The usual dosage and frequency of administration of doxycycline for injection (100 to 200 mg/day) differs from that of other tetracyclines (1 to 2 g/day). Exceeding the recommended dosage may increase the incidence of side effects. Studies indicate that doxycycline hyclate at usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of the antibiotic in patients with renal impairment.

For adults, the usual dosage of doxycycline for injection is 200 mg on the first day of treatment, administered in one or two infusions. Subsequent daily dosage ranges from 100 to 200 mg depending on the severity of the infection, with 200 mg typically given in one or two infusions.

In treating primary and secondary syphilis, the recommended dosage is 300 mg daily for a minimum of 10 days. For inhalational anthrax (post-exposure), the recommended dose is 100 mg of doxycycline, twice daily. Parenteral therapy should be used only when oral therapy is not indicated and should not be prolonged. Oral therapy should begin as soon as feasible, with treatment continuing for a total of 60 days.

### Hepatocyte growth factor is increased in the aqueous humor of glaucomatous eyes [^115NobCp]. Journal of Glaucoma (2001). Low credibility.

To assess the concentrations of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the aqueous humor of eyes with glaucoma compared with control eyes with cataract only, concentrations of HGF were measured in aqueous humor aspirates taken during anterior segment surgery from 84 patients. Among these patients, 72 had glaucoma (38 cases of primary open-angle glaucoma, 17 angle-closure glaucoma, and 17 exfoliative glaucoma) and 12 had cataract only. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used for the measurements.

Hepatocyte growth factor was detected in all samples. In eyes with cataract only, the concentration was 563.3 ± 178.8 pg/mL (mean ± standard deviation), which was significantly lower than in eyes with glaucoma (967.1 ± 514.7 pg/mL, P < 0.05). Aqueous humor and plasma HGF concentrations were measured and compared in 28 patients. The aqueous humor HGF concentration (908 ± 586.2 pg/mL) was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the plasma concentration (521.3 ± 183.1 pg/mL). No significant correlation could be found between aqueous humor and plasma HGF concentrations.

The relatively high concentration of HGF in human aqueous humor suggests that HGF may play an important role in ocular physiology.

### Feasibility of a paediatric radiology escape room for undergraduate education [^114XFing]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The number of correct answers on a per-question level amongst the students is outlined in Table 3. Prior to the teaching session, the fewest correct responses were provided for questions about the silhouette sign on radiography (3/19, 15.8%), naming a stochastic effect of ionising radiation (1/19, 5.3%), and recognizing the radiographic sign for pneumomediastinum (4/19, 21.1%).

After the teaching session, there was an improvement in the number of correct responses for all questions, although the question regarding the silhouette sign was still the least correctly answered (14/19, 73.7% correct). At 2 weeks post-teaching, the questions with the least correct responses concerned the definition of a greenstick fracture and the explanation of the silhouette sign (both 11/13, 81.8%).

The only question to show a reduction in the overall percentage of correct answers between pre-teaching and 2 weeks later was the definition of a greenstick fracture (89.5% correct pre-teaching versus 85% at 2 weeks). This was mainly due to two students choosing the incorrect answer at the post-2 weeks test — one selected the correct response immediately after teaching but gave wrong responses both pre- and 2 weeks post-teaching. Another appeared to get the correct answer before and immediately after teaching, but presumably forgot or accidentally selected the incorrect answer at the 2-week test.

### Adequacy of exchanging the content of the anterior chamber [^115usGJw]. Experimental Eye Research (2010). Low credibility.

Perfusion studies of the anterior segment of the eye frequently involve an exchange of the contents of the anterior chamber. In this study, we determined how much fluid was necessary to pass through the upstream tubing and anterior chamber to ensure adequate exchange of its contents. We utilized fluorescein dextran (500 kD) to assess the exchange adequacy in enucleated porcine eyes that were washed out with varying volumes of buffer. The results were compared with two theoretical models: one accounted for the convective dispersion occurring in the upstream tubing, while the other simpler model assumed that the upstream tubing and anterior chamber behaved as a well-mixed chamber. The experimental results were bounded by these two models, with the well-mixed model providing a lower bound on the rate at which the anterior chamber could be cleared. We found that exchanging the anterior chamber to reduce the concentration of a drug or tracer by 20-fold required a perfused volume three times the combined volume of the upstream tubing and anterior chamber.

### European glaucoma society - A guide on surgical innovation for glaucoma [^114JvxKa]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Glaucoma surgery has, for many decades, been dominated by the universal gold standard: trabeculectomy augmented with antimetabolites. Tubes also came into the scene to complement what we used to call conventional or traditional glaucoma surgery. More recently, we have experienced a changing glaucoma surgery environment with the "advent" of what we have become used to calling Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS).

- **The unmet need**: What is the gap that these newcomers aim to fill? Hippocrates taught us "bring benefit, not harm". New glaucoma techniques and devices aim to provide safer surgery compared to conventional surgery.

- **The importance of safety**: For the patient, but also for the clinician, safety is important. Is more safety achieved with new glaucoma surgery and, if so, is it associated with better, equivalent, or worse efficacy?

- **Surgical intent**: Is new glaucoma surgery intended to replace conventional surgery or to complement it as an 'add-on' to what clinicians already have to manage glaucoma?

- **Choosing the right surgery**: Which surgery should be chosen for which patient? What are the options? Are they equivalent? These are many questions for the clinician! What are the answers to the questions? What is the evidence to support answers? Do we need more evidence, and how can we produce high-quality evidence?

This EGS Guide explores the changing and challenging glaucoma surgery environment, aiming to provide answers to these questions. The EGS uses four words to highlight a continuum: Innovation, Education, Communication, and Implementation. Translating innovation to successful implementation is crucial.

### Designer liquid-liquid interfaces made from transient double emulsions [^1178qAwW]. Nature Communications (2018). High credibility.

Transient double emulsions are explored using a microfluidic chip with inlets for the outer (white), middle (red), and inner (beige) phases, which indicate positions where droplets were imaged. The study involves the observation of transient droplets at various positions along the channel. This is demonstrated for a system similar to Fig. 1 with false-colored images for clarity, and a particle concentration of 12 mg/ml. Quantification of the middle droplet phase volume is shown as a function of residence time in the channel, considering different particle loadings in the middle phase. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the shell volume calculation.

Fig. 2b specifically shows a sequence for an oil-in-water emulsion similar to Fig. 2a. Initially, an inert inner fluorinated oil phase (Fluorinert FC40, 3M Company, flow rate \(Q_i = 500 \, \mu l/h \)) contacts the future middle phase. This phase contains 12 mg/ml 1% ODTMS-treated fluorescent silica particles (diameter = 600 nm) dispersed in a mixture of ethylacetate (75 mole%) and ethanol (25 mole%). Subsequently, a droplet is generated using pure water as the outer phase. The relative flow rates between the outer water phase (\(Q_o = 7000 \, \mu l/h \)) and the middle phase (\(Q_m = 500 \, \mu l/h \)) determine the sizes of the droplet and shell. Along with the phase equilibrium at 293.15 K (shown in Fig. 1), they dictate both the pathway and the composition of the final emulsion. As a result, several degrees of freedom (such as chemicals used, composition, flow rates, phase equilibrium, and temperature) render this method flexible.

### A protective layer approach to solvatochromic sensors [^111AiNQo]. Nature Communications (2013). High credibility.

A challenging task in chemistry has been the development of a solvatochromic sensor responsive to a specific solvent. Various organic, organometallic, metal-organic framework, and hybrid materials have been investigated to determine their solvatochromic properties in diverse solvents. Conventional colorimetric sensors, however, inevitably display changes in absorption and emission peaks that are indiscriminate in their response to organic solvents. This phenomenon is a consequence of the fact that the probe molecules are designed to undergo spectral shifts that depend solely on the polarity of the surrounding medium. Because of this limitation, visual differentiation of solvents with similar polarities has been very difficult.

In this study, we devise a new approach to designing a system for colorimetric differentiation of common organic solvents. The new tailor-made colorimetric and fluorescence turn-on type solvent sensor system enables facile naked eye identification of one among several solvents. The key strategy employed for the sensor system is schematically described in Fig. 1a. A solvatochromic material is first coated on a solid substrate and then covered with a thin protective layer. As a result, the solvatochromic sensor molecules are protected from direct exposure to organic solvents unless the solvent disrupts the protective layer by either dissolution or swelling. In the latter event, the solvatochromic molecules are exposed to the solvent and undergo an observable colorimetric transition.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern® [^111T3M9X]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of blepharitis, specifically for differential diagnosis, the AAO 2019 guidelines recommend distinguishing blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction from aqueous deficient dry eye in patients with ocular surface disease. It is important to recognize that worsening of symptoms in the morning is typical of blepharitis, whereas worsening of symptoms later in the day is typical of aqueous deficient dry eye.

### Effect of a new graphically modified Nutri-Score on the objective understanding of foods' nutrient profile and ultraprocessing: A randomised controlled trial [^1124keYR]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2023). High credibility.

For the primary outcomes, standardized scores of correct answers (/100) for both nutritional quality and ultraprocessing in the two arms were calculated and compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The effect size was evaluated using Cohen's d statistic. Given the discrete nature of the scores and the absence of a linearity assumption, correct answers were categorized into three classes:

- **Nutritional quality dimension**: 0–2 correct answers, 3–6 correct answers, 7–9 correct answers.

- **Ultraprocessing dimension**: 0–12 correct answers, 13–19 correct answers, 20–22 correct answers.

Subgroup analyses were conducted by considering the correct answers for each food category separately. To assess the impact of the Nutri-Score V.2.0 on understanding both dimensions, multinomial logistic regression models were employed using the three score categories as outcomes, with the lowest category as reference. These models adjusted for potential residual confounding factors such as:

- **Demographics**: age, sex
- **Occupational status**: active, inactive (unemployed, student, retired)
- **Education level**: less than high school, < 3 years after high school, ≥ 3 years after high school
- **Household monthly income**: less than 1100 euros, 1100–2330 euros, 2330–3780 euros, more than 3780 euros, prefer not to answer
- **Area of residence**: rural, urban

Interactions with educational level and self-reported nutrition knowledge were tested in secondary analyses.

### Knowledge acquisition is governed by striatal prediction errors [^111DocWf]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

During Test 1, all trials had the potential to display either correct or false feedback, with the latter being a plausible yet significantly different answer to the question. As there was only one possible correct feedback answer which could be displayed, each question was associated with one possible false-feedback answer. Participants needed to be naïve to the manipulation, so false feedback was not provided for any questions answered with confidence above 70, a threshold determined by pilot testing. Participants who became aware of the manipulation were excluded from the study.

Using a pseudo-random number generator, questions answered with a confidence rating below 60 displayed false feedback on 75% of trials. For those with a confidence rating between 60 and 70, false feedback appeared on 60% of trials. The large proportion of false-feedback trials was necessary because the accuracy of recall answers could only be determined post testing; therefore, false feedback could not be provided solely after correct answers. Furthermore, there were fewer correct than incorrect answers, averaging 36%, and these were often expressed with higher confidence. The average confidence for correct answers was 70.5, with confidence exceeding the cutoff of 70 in 56% of correct trials. To generate sufficient trials where participants received false feedback following correct answers of low and medium confidence, a high proportion of false feedback was provided within these confidence ranges.

### Impact of improper approach to identify lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) [^112QaHqF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

In a strictly clinical observation of the lid wiper, the line of Marx has to be distinguished from LWE. This naturally occurring line appears to be the interface between lipids secreted from the meibomian glands and the aqueous, the leading edge of the lacrimal lake, and its size has been likely linked to meibomian gland dysfunction. The line of Marx can shift as a factor of age and dry eye and remains a reasonable landmark on the lid margin as it takes up vital dye in nearly all patients. Despite any line of Marx displacement, any vital dye staining proximal to the line of Marx is indicative of LWE.

In the present analysis, epitheliopathy was generally very obvious when comparing the methodologies. To further illustrate this, examples of the false negatives for both dyes were shown in Figures 2 and 3. The margins in the photographs are starkly different. The initial image clearly outlines the line of Marx, whereas the adjacent image displays LWE. The overall mean for the line of Marx area was measured as 2.06 mm². It is acknowledged that the line of Marx can vary from one individual to another. A more precise assessment of false negatives might be to quantify each participant's line of Marx staining area individually in order to establish a unique anatomic baseline for later comparison.

Challenges arise in attempting such an investigation in the precise identification of the full extent of the line of Marx, given the expected variability in terms of width and location among subjects. Therefore, in line with previous studies using alternative semi-automated methodologies, this approach is considered necessary.

### Penicillin G potassium [^116P68yF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Intramuscular injection**: Keep the total volume of injection small. The intramuscular route is the preferred route of administration. Solutions containing up to 100,000 units of penicillin per mL of diluent may be used with a minimum of discomfort. Greater concentrations of penicillin G per mL are physically possible and may be employed where therapy demands it. When large dosages are required, it may be advisable to administer aqueous solutions of penicillin via continuous intravenous drip.

- **Continuous intravenous drip**: Determine the volume of fluid and rate of administration required by the patient over a 24-hour period in the usual manner for fluid therapy, and add the appropriate daily dosage of penicillin to this fluid. For example, if an adult patient requires 2 liters of fluid in 24 hours and a daily dosage of 10 million units of penicillin, add 5 million units to 1 liter and adjust the rate of flow so that the liter will be infused in 12 hours.

- **Intrapleural or other local infusion**: If fluid is aspirated, administer the infusion in a volume equal to ¼ or ½ the amount of fluid aspirated; otherwise, prepare as for intramuscular injection.

- **Intrathecal use**: The intrathecal use of penicillin in meningitis must be highly individualized. It should be employed only with full consideration of the possible irritating effects of penicillin when used via this route. The preferred route of therapy in bacterial meningitis is intravenous, supplemented by intramuscular injection.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use.

### Variability of replicates of intraocular inflammatory biomarkers in ocular fluid samples analyzed with multiplex assays [^112HAJYp]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

A CV threshold of 20% was deemed appropriate for this study; however, it is important to note that this threshold should vary depending on the specific application and goals of the analysis. Our sensitivity analysis, with an increased CV threshold of 25%, demonstrated that 6.5% of biomarker replicate assays had high variability, as compared to 4% of cases with high variability associated with a 20% CV cut-off value. Studies have demonstrated the potential of inflammatory biomarker analysis for diagnostics and clinical decision-making. In these types of applications, a CV threshold of 20% may be inappropriate, and clinical applications utilizing ophthalmic biomarker analysis must adjust their statistical parameters accordingly.

Similarly, the acceptability for sampling errors will depend on the specific application in question. In our study, the proportion of sampling errors was relatively small for samples from aqueous humor compared to those from vitreous humor (6% and 23%, respectively). This may be due to the difference in viscosities between the aqueous and vitreous humors, which may limit the ability of the assay beads to mix evenly, leading to inconsistencies. Additionally, with 23 of the 27 analytes having a lower mean concentration in the vitreous humor compared to the aqueous humor, there may be an increased probability of sampling errors in the vitreous, since these generally had lower mean concentrations in our study. A study evaluating reproducibility and correlations of multiplex cytokine levels in serum found suboptimal reproducibility of a cytokine panel.

### Aqueous humor polymerase chain reaction in uveitis - utility and safety [^115N4u49]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Aqueous PCR analysis is easy to perform, safe, and valuable, establishing a correct etiologic diagnosis and change in treatment in about a third of selected uveitis cases. We consider aqueous PCR most useful for uveitis with atypical clinical appearance, severe uveitis of uncertain etiology, and treatment-resistant cases. In suspected infectious uveitis where retinal examination may be limited by vitreous opacification, prompt intraocular fluid sampling is necessary and important in reaching a preliminary diagnosis and administering therapy. Regardless, empiric treatment should be initiated based on the clinical picture in severe, sight-threatening uveitis cases with no delay; this can be further adjusted depending on PCR results. Negative results can be useful in excluding infectious etiology. In the future, a larger battery of PCR tests for infectious agents will probably become routine for diagnosing infectious uveitis with even better accuracy.

### Ophthalmic statistics note 5: Diagnostic tests — sensitivity and specificity [^115D6YAo]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

A typical question facing an ophthalmologist in a clinic is: 'How good is a particular test at diagnosing a particular pathology?' For example, how useful are the results from a Visual Field Analyser (VFA) in diagnosing glaucoma? Although a positive test result can indicate the presence of a symptom, such as visual field loss, full clinical diagnosis of a disease or condition is considerably more complicated. For instance, in glaucoma, a full clinical examination involving a battery of tests evaluating visual field loss, intraocular pressure, the optic nerve, and functional tests such as standard automated perimetry are necessary to make a diagnosis. Performing each test is costly and time-consuming, and in some countries, only a single test may be available for a particular condition. Where multiple tests are available, it is desirable, therefore, to compare their performance in a quantitative way through assessing their diagnostic utility by examining the sensitivity and specificity with their respective confidence intervals (CIs).

Suppose, for example, I have 200 individuals referred for assessment in my glaucoma clinic. One hundred of the subjects are assessed using a VFA, while the other 100 are assessed using a new imaging technology. Individuals are classed as positive or negative according to whether their test result is positive or negative. The terms positive and negative refer to the presence of an abnormality in the visual field or optic disc, rather than the outlook for the patient. This can be counterintuitive, as a positive test result might actually indicate something concerning.

### Treatment of dry eye disease [^116sEVJe]. The Consultant Pharmacist (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dry eye disease:

- **Definition**: DED, also known as dry eye syndrome or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a chronic, multifactorial condition characterized by a deficiency in tear production or excessive evaporation, leading to ocular surface inflammation and discomfort.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of DED involves two main mechanisms: aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative dry eye. Aqueous tear deficiency is due to decreased tear production, often associated with age, autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome, or certain medications. Evaporative dry eye is primarily due to meibomian gland dysfunction, which results in an unstable tear film and increased tear evaporation.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of DED varies widely globally, depending on the geographic region and the diagnostic criteria used, ranging from 5% to 50%. In the US, the prevalence of DED in adults is estimated at 5–7%, with rates 2–3 times higher in females.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for DED include older age, female sex, contact lens wear, screen time, environmental factors such as pollution and low humidity, hormonal changes such as menopause, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome, and certain medications including antihistamines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and some antihypertensives.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of DED is characterized by symptoms of ocular discomfort, irritation, pain, foreign body sensation, burning, and visual disturbances. Signs of DED include conjunctival injection.

### Ammonia N 13 [^111yF1cK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Ammonia N 13 Injection USP is a positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The active ingredient, [13N] ammonia, has the molecular formula of 13NH3 with a molecular weight of 16.02.

Ammonia N 13 Injection USP is provided as a ready-to-use sterile, pyrogen-free, clear, and colorless solution. Each mL of the solution contains between 0.138 GBq to 1.387 GBq (3.75 mCi to 37.5 mCi) of [13N] ammonia at the end of synthesis (EOS) reference time, in 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride. The pH of the solution is between 4.5 to 7.5. The recommended dose of radioactivity (10 mCi-20 mCi) is associated with a theoretical mass dose of 0.5–1.0 picomoles (8.47 picograms-16.94 picograms) of ammonia.

- **Physical characteristics**: Nitrogen N13 decays by emitting a positron to Carbon C13 (stable) and has a physical half-life of 9.96 minutes. The principal photons useful for imaging are the dual 511 keV gamma photons that are produced and emitted simultaneously in opposite directions when the positron interacts with an electron.

The specific gamma ray constant (point source air kerma coefficient) for nitrogen N13 is 5.9 R/hr/mCi (1.39 x 10^-6 Gy/hr/kBq) at 1 cm. The half-value layer (HVL) of lead (Pb) for 511 keV photons is 4 mm. Selected coefficients of attenuation are listed in Table 3 as a function of lead shield thickness.

### The ins and outs of aqueous humour secretion [^116xUvuh]. Experimental Eye Research (2004). Low credibility.

The intraocular pressure (IOP) reflects a balance between the inflow and outflow of aqueous humour. A major strategy in the medical treatment of glaucoma is to reduce inflow and thereby decrease IOP. Understanding the mechanisms and regulation of inflow is thus of clear clinical relevance. Many mechanisms underlying inflow have been identified; however, the integration and regulation of these mechanisms are less clear.

Aqueous humour is secreted across the ciliary epithelium by transferring solutes, chiefly NaCl, from the stroma to the posterior chamber of the eye, with water passively following. The epithelium consists of two layers: the pigmented ciliary epithelial (PE) cells abutting the stroma and the non-pigmented ciliary epithelial (NPE) cells facing the aqueous humour. Gap junctions link adjacent cells within and between these layers.

- **Secretion proceeds in three steps**: (1) uptake of NaCl from the stroma to PE cells by electroneutral transporters, (2) passage of NaCl from PE to NPE cells through gap junctions, and (3) release of Na+ and Cl- through Na+, K+-activated ATPase and Cl- channels, respectively.

Most of our understanding of inflow mechanisms has been obtained by studying in vitro preparations at subcellular, cellular, and tissue levels. A particularly productive approach has been the electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) of the elemental composition of excised ciliary epithelium. This technique permits analysis of adjacent cells within different regions of the ciliary epithelium. EPMA of rabbit preparations has supported the idea that paired activity of Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO3- antiports promotes inflow.

### Accuracy and precision of intraocular injection volume [^112jd4az]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy and precision of methods in clinical use for intraocular drug injection.

- **Design**: Experimental laboratory investigation.

- **Methods**: A total of 800 injections were performed using 20 different 1-ml syringes at intended volumes of 0.10 mL and 0.05 ml. The volume of each injection was calculated from the mass of water delivered onto an analytic balance.

- **Results**: The mean measured volume delivered was less than the intended volume for every syringe (P < 0.001 for each syringe at each volume). A total of 7% and 22% of injections differed by 20% or more from the intended volumes of 0.10 mL and 0.05 ml, respectively. Overdelivery of volume was uncommon.

The conclusion of the study noted that clinically relevant materials and methods used for intraocular injection of drugs systematically underdelivered the intended volume.

### Cortifoam [^114j2hGM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.

### Ceretec [^1132vps7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Cautionary notes for all preparations: 0.37 GBq up to 2.00 GBq (10 mCi up to 54 mCi) technetium Tc99m may be added to the vial. Before reconstitution, the technetium Tc99m generator eluate may be adjusted to the correct radioactive concentration to a volume of 5 mL by dilution with preservative-free, non-bacteriostatic saline for injection. Use only eluate from a technetium Tc99m generator which was previously eluted within 24 hours. Generator eluate more than 2 hours old should not be used. For the highest radiochemical purity, reconstitute with freshly eluted technetium Tc99m generator eluate. When reconstituting a vial of Ceretec with 31 to 54 mCi, generator eluate more than 30 minutes old should not be used. Radiochemical purity testing must be performed prior to patient administration. A radiochemical purity greater than 80% is necessary for product acceptance. Do not use the final radiopharmaceutical preparation more than 30 minutes after the time of reconstitution. Discard any unused material.

- **Quality control**: Radiochemical purity determination must be performed before administration to the patient. Three potential radiochemical impurities may be present in the prepared injection of the lipophilic technetium Tc99m exametazime complex. These are a secondary technetium Tc99m exametazime complex, free pertechnetate, and reduced-hydrolyzed-technetium Tc99m. A combination of three chromatographic systems is necessary for the complete definition of the radiochemical composition of the injection. The following protocol has been designed to enable analysis of the radiochemical composition.

### Early onset diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease patients via amyloid-β oligomers-sensing probe in cerebrospinal fluid [^1164eh54]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

- **Aβ-species preparation**:

- **Aβ 1–42 monomer**: To prepare a stock solution of Aβ 1–42 (5 mM), 44.3 μL of DMSO was added into the purchased Aβ 1–42 peptide kit (or 1 mg of synthesized Aβ 1–42) and treated with a vortex to be evenly dissolved. Before each experiment, the prepared stock solution was diluted to experimental concentrations with PBS (10 mM, pH = 7.4).

- **Aβ 1–42 oligomers**: A previously reported procedure was optimized in this work as follows. Prepared DMSO stock solution of Aβ 1–42 (5 mM) was added to the 4.4 mL of 20 mM PBS (pH = 7.4) and then incubated with an orbital shaker (300 rpm) at 37 °C for 2 h. The incubated solution was mildly pipetted, and the filtrate was collected using polytetrafluoroethylene polymer (PTFE) membrane syringe filters (Whatman GD/X, pore size 0.2 μm, diameter 13 mm). The filtrate was centrifuged (14,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was diluted to experimental concentrations with PBS (10 mM, pH = 7.4) before each experiment.

- **Aβ 1–42 fibrils**: Prepared DMSO stock solution of Aβ 1–42 (5 mM) was added to the 4.4 mL of 20 mM PBS (pH = 7.4) and then incubated with an orbital shaker (300 rpm) at 37 °C for 72 h.

### Knowledge acquisition is governed by striatal prediction errors [^1131ynZi]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

We calculated the overall updating effect (Fig. 2c) by summing the confidence level of each correct answer in Test2 — assigning 0 to those remaining incorrect — and dividing by the total number of incorrect answers for each unique Test1 PE value. In other words, an overall score of 100 would indicate that all incorrect Test1 trials for a given PE value were answered correctly and with a confidence of 100 in Test2. If only half the trials were answered correctly, and with an average confidence of 50, the overall updating value would be 25. In the recognition study, significance of the relationship between overall updating and PE (Fig. 2c) was determined by performing a one-sample t-test on the β values of the single-subject regressions to show that the parameter significantly differed from zero, as well as testing the significance of the group-level regression model.

In the recall study, certain trial types — which occurred very infrequently — were excluded from analyses. These were instances of incorrect Test1 answers in the false-feedback condition where (a) the incorrect answer matched the ensuing false feedback (leading to a false sense of having answered correctly), or (b) the answer provided in Test2 was correct with respect to the original text (i.e. provided the correct answer despite initially failing to do so and receiving false feedback). We also excluded rare instances where correct Test1 answers were stated with a confidence rating of zero (for the false-feedback analyses), and in the imaging analyses — hence there were no +100 PE events.

### Increased aqueous humor levels of endothelin-1 in patients with open angle glaucoma [^112DYLxv]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

There are some limitations to this study. First, our study cohorts are relatively small, which may impede the detection of an association between aqueous ET-1 level and glaucoma. This increases susceptibility to biased results, especially for the smallest cohort of XFG patients. Second, our cohorts are representative of the homogeneous population in Iowa, which is primarily non-Hispanic white, and may not be generalizable to other populations.

Third, we preferentially enrolled POAG patients with higher IOP to facilitate comparisons with the NTG cohort, as described in the Methods section. Consequently, there was a bias in selecting samples from patients with greater maximum IOP and potentially higher aqueous ET-1 levels, since aqueous ET-1 levels have been shown to correlate with IOP. Thus, our findings may be more representative of POAG patients with relatively higher IOP.

Fourth, although our glaucoma and control cohorts were well-matched for race and ethnicity, there were differences in the age at enrollment and sex of patients between cohorts. For example, patients in the XFG cohort were older at the time of enrollment than controls. This finding may be partly explained by the known late onset of disease in XFG, but it nonetheless makes age-matching for controls and avoiding age bias more challenging. Additionally, the proportion of females in the NTG and control cohorts was greater than in the POAG and XFG cohorts. However, these potential biases have been addressed.

### Xhance [^114pUveY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Xhance (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray is supplied as a non-removable amber glass bottle fitted with a metered-dose manual spray pump. This unit is housed inside the white Xhance device with a nasal applicator, valve mechanism, asymmetrical cone-shaped nosepiece, flexible mouthpiece, base, and orange cap. It comes in a box of one (NDC 71143–375–01) with FDA-approved patient labeling [see Instructions for Use].

Each bottle contains a net fill content of 16 mL, and after priming, it will provide 120 metered sprays. Each metered spray delivers 93 mcg of fluticasone propionate in an aqueous suspension through the cone-shaped nosepiece. The correct amount of medication in each metered spray cannot be assured after 120 metered sprays, even though the bottle is not completely empty. The bottle should be discarded when the labeled number of metered sprays has been used.

Store at room temperature (between 15°C and 25°C; 59°F and 77°F), with excursions permitted from 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Avoid exposure to extreme heat, cold, or light. Shake Xhance before each use.

Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.

- **Physical examination and follow-up**: It is good medical practice for all women to have annual history and physical examinations, including those using oral contraceptives. However, the physical examination may be deferred until after the initiation of oral contraceptives, if requested by the woman and deemed appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include a special focus on blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In cases of undiagnosed, persistent, or abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be taken to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.

- **Lipid disorders**: Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they choose to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may make the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.

- **Liver function**: If jaundice develops in any woman receiving oral contraceptives, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

- **Fluid retention**: Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution and only with careful monitoring in patients with conditions that might be aggravated by fluid retention.

### Use of a control test to aid pH assessment of chemical eye injuries [^115wK8DS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Chemical burns of the eye represent 7.0%–9.9% of all ocular trauma. Initial management of ocular chemical injuries involves irrigation of the eye and conjunctival sac until neutralization of the tear surface pH is achieved. We present a case of alkali injury in which the raised tear film pH seemed unresponsive to irrigation treatment. Suspicion arose concerning the accuracy of the litmus paper used to test the tear film pH. The error was confirmed by using a control litmus pH test on the examining doctor's eyes.

Errors in litmus paper pH measurement can occur due to difficulty in matching the paper with scale colors and drying of the paper, which produces a darker color. A small tear film sample can also create difficulty in color matching, whereas too large a sample can wash away pigment from the litmus paper. Samples measured too quickly after irrigation can result in a falsely neutral pH measurement. Use of faulty or inappropriate materials can also result in errors. We advocate the use of a control litmus pH test in all patients. This would highlight errors in pH measurements and aid in detecting the endpoint of irrigation.
