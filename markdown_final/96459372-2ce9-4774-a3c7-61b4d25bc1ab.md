## Question

LDL goals

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about LDL-C goals across guidelines and how to apply them in practice, including thresholds, targets, percent reductions, and considerations for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of "lower for longer" and whether there is a lower bound to LDL-C benefit. Then, I should verify how different societies frame risk categories and whether they use targets versus thresholds. Next, I will extract concrete LDL-C goals by risk tier from major guidelines, reconcile differences, and clarify percent-reduction requirements. After that, I need to check special populations like FH, CKD, and older adults. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, unified approach and ensure the monitoring cadence and escalation steps are clear and evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle. The National Lipid Association's 2025 guidance emphasizes that LDL-C lowering reduces ASCVD events in proportion to the absolute reduction and that benefit accrues with sustained low levels, supporting a "lower for longer" strategy without a defined lower bound of harm down to very low levels, even into the 10–40 mg/dL range in some contexts, which reassures me that aggressive lowering is safe when clinically indicated [^111CHAQ7] [^11549Uar]. Hold on, I should verify the dose–response claim; the NLA cites that each ~39 mg/dL LDL-C reduction yields about a 22% relative risk reduction in major vascular events, reinforcing the linear relationship between LDL-C lowering and outcomes [^117XuUuN].

> Next, I should review how guidelines diverge in philosophy. The ESC/EAS 2019/2020 guidelines explicitly adopt LDL-C treatment targets by risk category, including very aggressive goals for very high-risk patients, whereas the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline moved away from numeric LDL-C targets and emphasized percent LDL-C reduction and statin intensity, a shift that caused confusion and unintended de-emphasis of on-treatment LDL-C measurement in some systems [^1147iChS] [^113wVuy7] [^111FxykU]. Wait, let me verify the 2018 ACC/AHA update; it partially reintroduced LDL-C thresholds (for example, adding nonstatins at ≥ 70 mg/dL in very high-risk ASCVD) while still anchoring therapy to percent reduction and statin intensity, which functionally re-establishes goals without always labeling them as such [^114mpP3Y] [^112pfcZN].

> I will now examine concrete LDL-C goals by risk tier, starting with low risk. For low-risk primary prevention, the NLA recommends LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL, and the ESC/EAS suggests < 116 mg/dL for low risk, which are aligned in practice and achievable with lifestyle-first strategies in most patients [^116QtWRK] [^116Bfjt6]. Hold on, I should verify that these are indeed the most conservative baselines; yes, both societies treat these as foundational thresholds for primary prevention counseling and therapy consideration when exceeded [^116QtWRK] [^116Bfjt6].

> For moderate risk, I need to ensure consistency. The NLA maintains LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL, and the ESC/EAS recommends < 100 mg/dL, while the ACC/AHA emphasizes at least a 30% LDL-C reduction in intermediate-risk primary prevention, which operationally pushes many patients below 100 mg/dL depending on baseline [^116QtWRK] [^113U5npo] [^112pfcZN]. Wait, let me verify the percent-reduction anchor; yes, the ACC/AHA uses 30–49% for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% for high intensity, which functionally guides whether patients reach < 100 mg/dL in many cases [^112pfcZN].

> For high risk, I should confirm both absolute goals and percent reductions. The NLA sets LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL, while the ESC/EAS recommends < 70 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline, and the ACC/AHA emphasizes ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for secondary prevention and high-risk primary prevention, with addition of nonstatins considered when LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statins in very high-risk ASCVD [^116QtWRK] [^1147iChS] [^112pfcZN]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the ACC/AHA might endorse a hard < 70 mg/dL target. Hold on, I should verify — no, they use a threshold to trigger add-on therapy rather than a universal numeric target, which is a subtle but important distinction [^112mFCb6].

> For very high risk, I should double-check the most aggressive goals. The NLA recommends LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and the ESC/EAS recommends < 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction; in select patients with rapid recurrent events, some European guidance even supports < 40 mg/dL, and the NLA notes safety down to 10–40 mg/dL in appropriate contexts, which is consistent with the "lower for longer" paradigm [^116QtWRK] [^1147iChS] [^11549Uar]. I need to ensure I capture the ACC/AHA stance; they endorse adding ezetimibe and/or a PCSK9 inhibitor when LDL-C is ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statins in very high-risk ASCVD, which again functions as a de facto target pathway even if not framed as a numeric goal [^114mpP3Y] [^1138QxsW].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with familial hypercholesterolemia. The ESC/EAS recommends ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and < 55 mg/dL for very high-risk FH with ASCVD, and < 70 mg/dL for high-risk FH without ASCVD, which reflects both the genetic burden and the need for early, aggressive, and often combination therapy [^113eVBYo] [^114jJwm2]. I should confirm that this aligns with broader risk-based intensification; yes, it dovetails with the principle that absolute risk and baseline LDL-C magnitude justify earlier use of high-intensity statins plus ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors when needed [^1147iChS].

> For chronic kidney disease, I need to check whether goals differ by stage. The NLA notes that stage 5 CKD is a very high-risk state but that randomized trials have not consistently shown benefit, so goals are individualized. Practically, many clinicians still apply high-risk targets while recognizing uncertainty and competing risks, and they avoid over-treatment in dialysis where evidence is limited [^113iixsU]. Hold on, I should verify that this nuance is not overgeneralized; yes, the NLA explicitly calls for clinical judgment in advanced CKD rather than rigid targets [^113iixsU].

> Regarding older adults, I should confirm that age alone does not negate benefit. The NLA and ACC/AHA support statin therapy based on risk through age 75, with shared decision-making beyond 75, and the ESC/EAS similarly risk-stratifies without an upper age cutoff, emphasizing life expectancy and comorbidity rather than age per se [^116QtWRK] [^114mpP3Y] [^1147iChS]. But wait, what if frailty or polypharmacy complicate therapy? That is where individualized risk–benefit discussions and potential de-intensification may be appropriate, consistent with patient-centered care principles [^112pfcZN].

> Next, I should review the percent-reduction framework and its relationship to absolute goals. The ACC/AHA operationalizes 30–49% reduction with moderate-intensity statins and ≥ 50% with high-intensity statins, and the ESC/EAS requires ≥ 50% reduction plus absolute targets for very high-risk patients. The NLA quantifies that each ~39 mg/dL reduction yields about a 22% relative risk reduction, which helps translate percent change into expected event reduction at a given baseline risk [^112pfcZN] [^1147iChS] [^117XuUuN]. Hold on, I should verify that this holds across risk strata; the relative risk reduction is consistent, but the absolute benefit is larger at higher baseline risk, reinforcing the need to intensify therapy in those patients [^117XuUuN].

> I will now examine the "thresholds versus targets" debate to ensure I am not overcommitting to numeric goals. The ESC/EAS explicitly uses targets, the ACC/AHA uses thresholds to trigger add-on therapy, and the NLA synthesizes both by endorsing numeric goals while reminding clinicians that the clinical aim is sustained LDL-C lowering proportional to risk; importantly, removal of explicit targets in 2013 led to under-measurement and under-treatment in some systems, which the NLA and preventive cardiology societies have worked to correct [^1147iChS] [^112mFCb6] [^111FxykU]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that this correction is reflected in recent US guidance; yes, the 2018 ACC/AHA update re-emphasizes on-treatment LDL-C assessment and percent reduction, which mitigates the earlier gap [^112pfcZN].

> Let me synthesize a unified, practical approach. For low risk, aim for LDL-C < 100–116 mg/dL using lifestyle first and consider pharmacotherapy if LDL-C is ≥ 160 mg/dL or non–HDL-C is ≥ 190 mg/dL after lifestyle efforts. For moderate risk, target < 100 mg/dL and ensure at least a 30% reduction. For high risk, target < 70–100 mg/dL depending on society and baseline, and achieve ≥ 50% reduction. For very high risk, target < 55–70 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction, and in select recurrent-event patients consider < 40 mg/dL, escalating to ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor if thresholds or goals are not met on maximally tolerated statins [^116QtWRK] [^1147iChS] [^112pfcZN]. I should double-check that this escalation pathway matches high-quality guidance; the BMJ 2022 guideline supports adding ezetimibe first, then a PCSK9 inhibitor in very high- and high-risk patients, with shared decision-making given modest absolute benefits and injection burdens [^112SYNSK].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up to ensure durability of control. The NLA recommends periodic lipid panels to assess adherence and response, with more frequent checks after therapy changes and at least annually once stable; nonfasting samples are acceptable in many settings, and when LDL-C is very low or triglycerides are high, non–HDL-C or apoB can help adjudicate residual atherogenic particle burden and guide add-on therapy [^111CHAQ7] [^1138QxsW] [^114EB8LN]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with performance guidance; yes, recent NLA/ASPC statements emphasize LDL-C measurement as a quality metric to close care gaps [^111FxykU].

> Finally, I need to ensure the implementation details are clear. Use high-intensity statins for very high-risk patients when tolerated, add ezetimibe if LDL-C remains above goal or threshold, and add a PCSK9 inhibitor if still above threshold or goal after ezetimibe. Throughout, incorporate shared decision-making, address adherence barriers, and consider referral to lipid specialists for complex cases such as refractory hypercholesterolemia, statin intolerance, or multifactorial high-risk phenotypes [^112pfcZN] [^112SYNSK] [^111CHAQ7]. I should confirm that this pathway is consistent with contemporary reviews. Yes, multiple sources converge on statin→ezetimibe→PCSK9 inhibitor sequencing with risk-aligned intensity and early combination in very high-risk patients to achieve both absolute targets and percent reductions [^1147iChS] [^112mFCb6].

LDL goals are risk-based: **< 55 mg/dL for very high risk** (ASCVD with recent events, or FH with ASCVD) [^1147iChS] [^113eVBYo], **< 70 mg/dL for high risk** (clinical ASCVD, or diabetes with multiple risk factors) [^114jJwm2] [^113A6taB], and **< 100 mg/dL for moderate risk** (≥ 2 risk factors) [^113U5npo] [^116QtWRK]. For low risk, aim for **< 116 mg/dL** [^116Bfjt6] [^111FVB5t]. These targets reflect the "lower for longer" principle [^111CHAQ7] [^1118q1vi], with greater absolute risk reduction at higher baseline risk and no established lower safety limit [^112mFCb6]. Therapy should be escalated to achieve both relative (≥ 50%) and absolute LDL-C reductions when goals are not met [^1147iChS] [^113A6taB].

---

## Rationale for LDL-C goals

LDL-C is a **causal driver of atherosclerosis** [^111onMi6]; lowering LDL-C reduces ASCVD events in proportion to the absolute reduction, with benefit continuing at very low levels [^117XuUuN] [^1118q1vi]. This underpins the "lower for longer" strategy [^111CHAQ7] and supports progressively lower targets as risk increases [^11549Uar].

---

## Current LDL-C goals by risk category

| **Risk category** | **LDL-C goal (mg/dL)** | **Clinical characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Very high risk | < 55 | - ASCVD with recent events <br/> - FH with ASCVD [^114jJwm2] [^113eVBYo] |
| High risk | < 70 | - Clinical ASCVD <br/> - Diabetes with multiple risk factors [^notfound] |
| Moderate risk | < 100 | ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors [^113U5npo] [^116QtWRK] |
| Low risk | < 116 | 0–1 major risk factors [^116Bfjt6] [^114Qu8J7] |

---

These goals align with major guidelines and reflect the **risk-based approach** to LDL-C lowering [^112pfcZN] [^1147iChS].

---

## Evidence supporting LDL-C goals

- **Very high risk**: IMPROVE-IT and FOURIER show further event reduction with LDL-C < 55 mg/dL [^notfound].
- **High risk**: Multiple trials support < 70 mg/dL to reduce recurrent events [^114jJwm2].
- **Moderate/low risk**: < 100–116 mg/dL balances benefit and safety in lower-risk populations [^113U5npo] [^116Bfjt6].

---

## Clinical implications of achieving LDL-C goals

Achieving LDL-C goals yields **substantial reductions in ASCVD events** [^117XuUuN], with greater absolute benefit at higher baseline risk [^1147H4Bj]. Sustained low LDL-C also promotes plaque regression and improves long-term outcomes [^115xWnpu].

---

## Challenges in achieving LDL-C goals

- **Adherence**: Poor adherence limits goal attainment [^112uARWX].
- **Statin intolerance**: Requires alternative therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) [^112SYNSK].
- **Therapy access**: Cost and coverage barriers impede use of effective agents [^notfound].

---

## Strategies to achieve LDL-C goals

- **Lifestyle**: Diet, exercise, and weight loss are foundational [^1178KwtC].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Statins first-line; add ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors as needed [^111onMi6] [^112SYNSK].
- **Monitoring**: Regular lipid panels guide therapy adjustments [^111CHAQ7].

---

## Controversies and debates

Controversies include the **use of LDL-C targets vs percent reductions** [^113C6sUg], with some guidelines favoring thresholds and others explicit targets [^115NGTSw] [^1147iChS]. Very low LDL-C levels appear safe in trials, but long-term data are still being collected [^1118q1vi] [^112mFCb6].

---

LDL-C goals are risk-based: **< 55 mg/dL for very high risk**, **< 70 mg/dL for high risk**, **< 100 mg/dL for moderate risk**, and **< 116 mg/dL for low risk**. These targets reflect the "lower for longer" principle, with greater absolute risk reduction at higher baseline risk and no established lower safety limit [^111CHAQ7] [^111FVB5t].

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Rationale for targeting multiple lipid pathways for optimal cardiovascular risk reduction [^112Keb3S]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of statin therapy have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in coronary artery disease (CAD) events, yet statin-treated patients remain at risk for CAD despite substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Recent evidence from clinical trials supports reduction of LDL cholesterol to lower targets, and the updated treatment guidelines include optional, more aggressive LDL cholesterol goals for patients at very high and moderately high risk. Achievement of these lower goals will require enhanced treatment strategies. Targeting multiple lipid pathways can provide greater reductions in LDL cholesterol as well as improvements in other lipid parameters. Clinical trials are needed to determine which treatment strategies provide optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.

The 2013 guidelines eliminated LDL-C goals, followed patients by the percentage reduction in LDL-C, defined high-risk groups requiring lipid-lowering medication without assessment of the 10-year ASCVD risk score, and defined primary prevention groups based on the 10-year risk of ASCVD. Statins were grouped by intensity, and high-intensity statins, which reduced LDL-C by 50% or more, were recommended for the highest risk patients.

ASCVD risk-reduction therapy — absolute risk–aligned intensity and lifestyle versus drug therapy: The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event. Lifestyle therapy is considered to be first-line intervention, with LDL-C (and non–HDL-C) reductions with lifestyle changes most often in the range of 5% to 15%, but in individuals at moderate to higher risk for ASCVD, a larger magnitude of atherogenic cholesterol lowering than can be achieved with lifestyle changes alone is generally warranted; decisions regarding adding atherogenic cholesterol– lowering drug therapy should include an investigation of the patient's absolute risk for ASCVD, including long-term risk.

### Identifying patients for aggressive cholesterol lowering: the risk curve concept [^115yWvQd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program's 2004 report identified more aggressive optional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol treatment goals of < 70 mg/dl for secondary prevention patients and < 100 mg/dl for moderately high risk, primary prevention patients. Although LDL cholesterol reduction is the first step in reducing cardiovascular risk, it may be difficult for clinicians to visualize the risk reduction benefit for patients from various risk interventions. The concept of a "risk curve", or the absolute risk of a patient for subsequent cardiovascular events over a range of LDL cholesterol values, is proposed. In conclusion, placing a patient on the appropriate risk curve may facilitate an individualized clinical management strategy that takes into account the patient's absolute benefit from further LDL cholesterol reduction as well as from shifting the risk curve downward through non-LDL cholesterol interventions.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^113qL1Ed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^115dFvXB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, a personalized approach, identifying patients at risk of ASCVD earlier in the risk continuum and optimizing the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies in combination with statins, will enable more patients to achieve LDL‐C targets and help to address the current high global burden of ASCVD.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^113MJKs8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116QtWRK]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association — ASCVD risk categories and atherogenic cholesterol targets are organized as follows: For low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors), treatment goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL; for moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors), goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL; for high risk (criteria include ≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold), goals are Non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL; for very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage), goals are Non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### Two approaches of coronary risk assessment – do they work? [^113hTea5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The risk assessment method reported by the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III, is used as a guide to define low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals and cutpoints for intervention. Two approaches of this method are described by National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III and were used to compute coronary heart disease risk among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2002. In conclusion, the low-density lipoprotein goals were not clear for a sizable proportion of participants, especially using the second approach, and may lead to less intensive intervention.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults > 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered. A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥ 50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of < 55 mg/dL are not achieved.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^113iixsU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Very high risk — population, goals, and therapy — includes patients with clinical evidence of ASCVD and those with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 and ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage, who have aggressive atherogenic cholesterol goals of non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL; for those at very high risk, pharmacotherapy is recommended when atherogenic cholesterol levels are above goal, and pharmacotherapy with a moderate- or high-intensity statin is considered a therapeutic option even at lower pretreatment levels, with use of a moderate- or high-intensity statin stated as something that should be considered in patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels; end-stage (stage 5) chronic kidney disease is associated with very high risk for ASCVD events, randomized controlled trials of lipid-altering therapies have not consistently shown benefits in this group, and goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels in stage 5 CKD have not been defined and are instead considered a matter of clinical judgment.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113C6sUg]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment "targets" vs "thresholds".

Cholesterol recommendations from major guideline organizations differ in several aspects, despite each committee being composed of lipid experts, and evaluating essentially the same evidence. A major difference is the LDL-C level at which treatment intensification is recommended. Some guideline organizations (ie, European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology) have opted for a treatment "target", which varies based on guideline organization, and some for a treatment "intensification threshold" (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society). The difference is subtle but important. A target level implies that maximal benefit is obtained once the target is attained and may lead to providers possibly back-titrating the dose or even deprescribing medication if the attained level is far below the target. However, most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering agents were performed by selecting patients with LDL-C exceeding a threshold value, and did not aim for a specific target level: some on-treatment patients attained extremely low LDL-C levels and yet continued to show benefit with respect to ASCVD risk reduction. Advocates for thresholds suggest that these closely approximate the approach used in the clinical trials, and are thus consistent with "evidence-based medicine".

### Frequency of obtaining national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III goals for all major serum lipoproteins after initiation of lipid altering therapy [^117DkTZj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Statin treatment targeting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is widely used for cardiovascular risk reduction, but many statin users still face greatly elevated risks. Some experts advocate additional therapy that targets high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the size of the patient group that could benefit from HDL cholesterol or triglyceride therapy has not been reported. Using observational data from a large health maintenance organization, 5,158 patients were identified who initiated dyslipidemia pharmacotherapy from July 2004 to June 2006, continued therapy for 1 year, and had full lipid panels within 6 months before and 9 to 15 months after therapy initiation. Therapy (primarily statins) reduced the proportion of patients not at LDL cholesterol goals from 77% to 22% and the proportion with high triglyceride levels from 34% to 20%. HDL cholesterol levels were unchanged (49% and 50% were less than normal levels before and after therapy, respectively) in the aggregate and in high-risk subgroups (patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and 10-year heart disease risk > 20%). After therapy, 29% of high-risk patients still had multiple lipid abnormalities. In conclusion, current dyslipidemia therapy substantially improved LDL cholesterol goal attainment in this cohort, but low HDL cholesterol levels were unaffected. About half the patients starting statins could be candidates for additional therapy targeting non-LDL cholesterol lipid fractions.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^116TSrVY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA Part 1 recommendations — ASCVD risk categories define atherogenic cholesterol goals and thresholds to consider drug therapy as follows: Low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors; consider other risk indicators) targets Non–HDL-C < 130 and LDL-C < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 or LDL-C ≥ 160. Moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors; consider quantitative risk scoring and other risk indicators) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 or LDL-C ≥ 130. High risk (≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or a quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 or LDL-C ≥ 100. Very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage) sets goals Non–HDL-C < 100 and LDL-C < 70, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 or LDL-C ≥ 70. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### A look to the future: new treatment guidelines and a perspective on statins [^115FcyUb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

New National Cholesterol Education Program treatment guidelines incorporate a global measure of coronary heart disease (CHD) that alters risk categorization in primary prevention by identifying individuals with CHD risk equivalence on the basis of estimated absolute CHD risk. Increasing recognition of the association of on-treatment non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels with risk of CHD events is also reflected in the new guidelines by incorporation of secondary non-HDL cholesterol goals. The increased complexity of the guidelines and the likelihood of more individuals being assigned to higher risk groups with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals is of some concern, because most patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy do not achieve current guideline LDL cholesterol goals. Increased potency of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs would be of value in enabling more patients to achieve goals.

### New features of the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III lipid-lowering guidelines [^113UoKbU]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk contain a number of features that distinguish them from the previous ATP guidelines. These new features include modifications in lipid/lipoprotein levels considered optimal, abnormal, or reflective of risk; increased focus on primary prevention through use of Framingham risk scoring to define risk in persons with multiple lipid/nonlipid risk factors; and increased focus on the association of the metabolic syndrome with CHD risk. The introduction of the category of CHD risk equivalents-including persons with atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, or 10-year CHD risk > 20% based on Framingham scoring-results in an increase over previous guidelines in the proportion of patients categorized as being at high risk and therefore eligible for more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapy. Use of the new secondary therapeutic target of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol should improve management of lipid risk factors in patients who have elevated triglyceride levels after LDL-C goals have been met. These new features of the NCEP ATP III guidelines should improve identification and treatment of patients with dyslipidemias associated with CHD risk.

### JCL roundtable: lipid treatment targets [^113u6dLJ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). Medium credibility.

This Roundtable discussion concerns atherogenic risk markers and treatment targets used by clinical lipidologists in daily practice. Our purpose is to understand the risk marker framework that supports and enables the new ACC/AHA/Multisociety Cholesterol Guidelines. Some biomarkers are highly associated with atherogenic risk but fail to qualify as treatment targets. Prominent examples are high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, for which targeted treatment has failed to reduce cardiovascular risk, and lipoprotein(a), which currently lacks a highly effective mode of treatment. As a consequence, guidelines have focused consistently on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and more recently on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We discuss a new calculation for LDL-C that shows greater accuracy than the commonly performed Friedewald calculation. LDL-C treatment goals have renewed prominence in the 2018 Guidelines. Thresholds for treatment initiation or intensification inherently establish goals of reducing atherogenic cholesterol levels below the thresholds. Treatment goals may be absolute, such as less than 70 mg/dL for LDL-C in very high-risk secondary prevention or relative, such as 50% or greater reduction of LDL-C. The timeframe of treatment is another consideration because milder treatment started earlier may sometimes be preferred over stronger treatment given late in the course of atherosclerotic progression. Advanced lipid testing and vascular imaging, particularly coronary artery calcium, also have their place in risk assessment to guide clinical lipid practice.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112mFCb6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL‐C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), without associated safety concerns/adverse events, even when LDL‐C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL‐C in a risk‐stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very‐high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL‐C levels in groups at very‐high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction from baseline for very high‐risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high‐intensity or maximal statin therapy, with addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL‐C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

SCORE2 cardiovascular risk categories — lipid goal achievement levels are detailed, and no patients were categorized as low risk. For low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 1.01% (n = 7/687) were in the very high-risk category, 1.51% (n = 6/397) were in the high-risk category, and 20.97% (n = 39/186) were in the moderate category. For non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), 3.78% (n = 26/687) were in the category of very high risk, 5.54% (n = 22/397) of patients were in the high-risk category, and 39.78% (n = 74/186) of patients were in the moderate-risk category. For triglycerides (TG) under SCORE2, 54.88% (n = 377) of patients were in the very-high-risk category, 54.41% (n = 216) were in the high-risk category, and 64.51% (n = 120) were in the moderate-risk category.

Clinical practice impact of removing LDL-C targets — Removal of the LDL-C treatment goal in the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline led to widespread and unanticipated impacts across clinical practice and organizations. The elimination of LDL-C treatment goals and the classification of certain statins as "high intensity" led the medical community to assume incorrectly that on-treatment LDL-C measurement and monitoring were unnecessary, despite the fact that LDL-C measurement was a Class IA recommendation in the 2013 guideline, and elimination of LDL-C measurement and specific LDL-C goals was widespread and affected most guidelines related to ASCVD over the ensuing decade.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^114EB8LN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Risk assessment markers for ASCVD — Primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD require an accurate estimation of risk of both future and recurrent cardiovascular events, and the LDL-C level is the focus of this article and is a highly relevant biomarker (indicator) of ASCVD risk, with high LDL-C generally indicative of high ASCVD risk and very low LDL-C levels generally indicative of low ASCVD risk (in the absence of other major risk factors). In individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) offer superior risk assessment by accounting for all atherogenic particles, and the National Lipid Association (NLA) and other major guidelines recommend consideration of apo B or non–HDL-C as secondary targets, particularly in high-risk patients or when triglyceride levels are elevated; the level of ASCVD risk should inform intensity of treatment to lower LDL-C.

### Hit or miss: the new cholesterol targets [^111HmLvz]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Drug treatment to reduce cholesterol to new target levels is now recommended in four moderate- to high-risk patient populations: patients who have already sustained a cardiovascular event, adult diabetic patients, individuals with low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥ 190mg/dL and individuals with an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥ 7.5%. Achieving these cholesterol target levels did not confer any additional benefit in a systematic review of 35 randomised controlled trials. Recommending cholesterol lowering treatment based on estimated cardiovascular risk fails to identify many high-risk patients and may lead to unnecessary treatment of low-risk individuals. The negative results of numerous cholesterol lowering randomised controlled trials call into question the validity of using low density lipoprotein cholesterol as a surrogate target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^114jJwm2]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

All clinicians attest to the fact that guidelines, although helpful, do not match day-to-day practice. Many patients do not fit neatly into the categorised recommendations, and judgement must be made on the most prudent course of action. The recently updated guidelines for management of dyslipidaemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) present a further challenge since they recommend aggressive goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering: < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) for patients at very high risk or with clinically evident ASCVD; and < 1.0 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) for very high-risk patients who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years. The ESC/EAS approach of recommending these very low goals for LDL-C is in distinction to the recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines where a threshold of 70 mg/dL was identified as a level at which addition of non-statin to maximally tolerated statin therapy could be considered, but no lower goal was set. The European guideline writers believe that the science is strong enough to state that 'no level of LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm occurs has been defined'. This approach prompts a number of questions — how do we translate this into clinical practice? Should it be applied universally or selectively? This review briefly lays out the evidence that led the writers to recommend the most aggressive goals yet for LDL-C lowering, and explores a case-based interpretation of the practicality of intensive LDL-C lowering.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^1117sjhM]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol were updated in the past year in the United States and Europe, reflecting a more intensive approach to lowering low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guideline released the 2018 guideline on the management of blood cholesterol on behalf of several American societies. Approximately 9 months later, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society published their 2019 guideline for the management of dyslipidemias. Both guidelines have similarities for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Both emphasize risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy; those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease have a greater clinical benefit of LDL‐C reduction by at least 50%. Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL‐C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high‐intensity statin for further reduction of LDL‐C levels. However, the guidelines have differences in the concepts of treatment thresholds (≥ 70 mg/dL in the United States) vs treatment goals (< 55 mg/dL in Europe), in the definition of very high‐risk category and in the classes for recommendation for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Pharmacological strategies for lowering LDL cholesterol: statins and beyond [^114jMY6d]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

A continuous, graded relationship exists between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This finding has been confirmed at progressively lower levels of LDL-C by results from clinical trials of therapies, particularly high-potency statins, which provide increasingly greater reductions in LDL-C levels. On the basis of this clinical trial evidence, progressively lower LDL-C goals for increasing numbers of patients, stratified by absolute CVD risk, have been recommended in guidelines for cholesterol management and CVD prevention. Some notable exceptions have been made, however, such as patients with end-stage renal disease or heart failure. To achieve low LDL-C goals, statins are first-line pharmacological therapy and can be combined with other agents to provide additional reductions in LDL-C levels as well as improvements in other lipoprotein fractions. Investigational agents that reduce LDL-C levels by other mechanisms are under development and could provide additional therapeutic strategies to achieve optimal LDL-C levels. These agents could be particularly appropriate for patients with severely elevated LDL-C levels, such as those with genetic dyslipidemia, for whom maximal drug therapy is insufficient to reduce LDL-C concentrations to recommended levels.

### Should an LDL-cholesterol target-based approach Be readopted? [^113nWZ9b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical trials driving the evolution of hyperlipidemic guidelines, discuss whether low-density lipoprotein (LDL) targets and adjunctive therapy on top of statins should be used, and summarize the pharmacist's role in helping achieve LDL goals.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search (1/1980–5/2017) using terms including LDL, lipid, and statin, with forward and backward citation tracking.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language studies and guidelines assessing LDL-lowering therapy were included.

Data Synthesis

In 2013, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) hyperlipidemic guideline stepped back from LDL goals opting for statin monotherapy with an intensity of dosing predicated on baseline risk. This was driven by abundant clinical trial evidence for the statins, with adjunctive therapy on top of statins failing to show substantial benefit. However, recent evidence suggests that returning to LDL goals is warranted and adjuvant ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may further reduce cardiovascular events. This is reflected in some society guidelines but not from the AHA/ACC. Pharmacists are well positioned to help achieve LDL goals, as they have positively affected LDL goal attainment across a multitude of settings.

Conclusions

Statins are the mainstay of therapy but patients should have LDL targets, and if patients on maximally tolerated statin doses are not at goal, adjunctive therapy with ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors may improve outcomes. In the emerging LDL goal paradigm, the pharmacist has a critical role to play.

### The 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society cholesterol guidelines: looking at past, present and future [^111tz2gY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors review more than three decades of progress in providing clinicians and patients with guidance on risk assessment, patient evaluation and cholesterol management. Beginning with the National Cholesterol Education Program's Initial Adult Treatment Panel report, the cholesterol guidelines increasingly reflect the progress made in understanding the benefits of improved lifestyle and nutrition to improve lipid profiles, major risk factors and reduce ASCVD risk. Moreover, they now provide qualitative and quantitative assessment tools to guide appropriate risk reduction LDL-C lowering therapy. Use of the Pooled Cohort Equations to determine Low, Borderline, Intermediate and High 10-year ASCVD risk is now joined by recognition of conditions and biomarkers that enhance ASCVD risk. This personalizes the risk discussion for the patient. An important addition is the selective use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to reclassify risk in patients at borderline or intermediate risk, but for whom a risk decision regarding statin therapy is uncertain. In secondary prevention, current guidelines provide criteria for determining a "very high" risk group in whom risk is especially high and in whom aggressive LDL-C lowering can be shown to provide increased absolute benefit. Current guidelines provide a comprehensive look at children and adolescents, young adults, elderly, women and issues specific to women through the life course. They provide guidance for those adults at risk due to severe hypercholesterolemia, persistent hypertriglyceridemia after secondary causes have been addressed, those with inflammatory disorders and HIV, those adults with chronic kidney disease, and those affected by issues of race/ethnicity. They conclude with a brief summary of recommendations emphasizing important concepts for providing safety with LDL-C lowering therapy. This combination of best external evidence and clinical expertise from the expert panel should provide a solid foundation for lipid management of patients at risk for or with clinical ASCVD.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^117XuUuN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia recommendations — atherogenic cholesterol lowering and ASCVD risk: For statin therapy, every 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduced major vascular events by 22% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76–0.80; P < .001) after approximately 5 years; reductions in LDL-C of 77.4 and 116.1 mg/dL would be expected to reduce the risk of a major vascular event by 40% and 53%, respectively. Over approximately 5 years, each 1% reduction in LDL-C or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is associated with an approximately 1% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) event risk. With high intensity statin therapy, the best average LDL-C reduction (~50%) would be associated with ~50% reduction in CHD events or ~40% reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events assuming a mean untreated LDL-C of 150 mg/dL and a 75 mg/dL reduction. Lifelong genetic evidence suggests that ASCVD risk reduction per 1% atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be greater, with reductions of ~3% per 1% lower LDL-C concentration over decades.

### Achieving greater reductions in cardiovascular risk: lessons from statin therapy on risk measures and risk reduction [^116B2PCL]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with statins have been shown to significantly reduce risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the primary- and secondary-prevention settings. Benefit has been observed even in high-risk patients whose baseline LDL cholesterol levels were below the drug initiation levels recommended by current treatment guidelines. Levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total apolipoprotein B more accurately reflect circulating levels of atherogenic particles than does LDL cholesterol concentration, and may provide a surrogate marker that correlates better to CHD event reduction after statin therapy than LDL cholesterol level. More effective lipid-lowering therapy than that currently practiced may be needed in many patients to achieve optimal CHD risk reduction.

### Achievement of 2011 European low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of either [^111Pg96d]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of high-risk patients from the VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis treated with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg or simvastatin 10–80 mg who achieved this goal.

Methods

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

National Lipid Association LDL-C management — The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk; reducing LDL-C improves ASCVD outcomes, and with treatment, ASCVD events are reduced proportionately to the degree of LDL-C lowering. Evidence shows that achieving LDL-C levels as low as 10 to 40 mg/dL is safe for patients, lipid panel testing should be done regularly in adults to evaluate ASCVD risk and to monitor effectiveness and adherence to LDL-C lowering treatment, and referrals to lipid specialists should be considered for care of the complex patient.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

Statin medicines — categories by intensity and anticipated % low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction include low-intensity statins (Simvastatin 10 mg, Pravastatin 10–20 mg, Lovastatin 20 mg, Fluvastatin 20–40 mg) with anticipated LDL-C reduction < 30%; moderate-intensity options include Atorvastatin 10–20 mg and Rosuvastatin 5–10 mg with 30–49%; and high-intensity statins (Atorvastatin 40–80 mg and Rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) with ≥ 50%.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^113A6taB]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In assessing progress towards goals, it should be noted that laboratory measurement of LDL-C at very low levels can present challenges especially when lipoprotein (a) or plasma triglyceride levels are elevated. In this context, secondary goals relating to non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B can be useful when judging whether to prescribe add-on therapy.

Figure 4 summarises the types of conditions that would lead to intensification of LDL-C-lowering therapy, that is, combination of statins with ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors. Identification of an individual with elevated risk of ASCVD, based on risk factor screening and evaluation of their SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Estimation), or the presence of disorders that predispose to the development of ASCVD, such as type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease, would place them in the 'high risk' category with goals of LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L and at least a 50% reduction from baseline. Among individuals with established ASCVD (on imaging or clinical presentation) and comorbidities (chronic kidney disease or history of diabetes with organ damage, proteinuria, hypertension), vascular imaging can aid in judging the most appropriate LDL-C goal. Where it is clear that a patient has atherosclerotic disease that is following an aggressive course, as indicated by serial events within 2 years, a goal of < 1.0 mmol/L is warranted.

Schematic showing rationale for intensive LDL-C lowering. The outer circle represents patients at 'high risk' with an LDL-C goal of below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Evidence of established disease, comorbidities, cardiometabolic disorders and multiple risk factors moves patients into the 'very high' risk middle circle, with a more ambitious target of below 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL). The most stringent goal of below 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) is recommended for those with a particularly aggressive disease course(see online supplemental figure 2 for the mg/dL (mmol/L) version).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111onMi6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association recommendations — patient-centered dyslipidemia management: An Expert Panel developed a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. Major conclusions include that an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, and that reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies. The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event, and because atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting in a clinical ASCVD event, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies. For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) risk–reduction magnitude — within the studied range, there was no evidence of an LDL-C threshold; larger LDL-C reductions, for example 2 to 3 mmol/L (77.4–116.1 mg/dL), could yield up to 40% to 50% relative risk reduction for ASCVD.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^115NGTSw]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol were updated in the past year in the United States and Europe, reflecting a more intensive approach to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guideline released the 2018 guideline on the management of blood cholesterol on behalf of several American societies. Approximately 9 months later, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society published their 2019 guideline for the management of dyslipidemias. Both guidelines have similarities for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Both emphasize risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy; those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease have a greater clinical benefit of LDL-C reduction by at least 50%. Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL-C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high-intensity statin for further reduction of LDL-C levels. However, the guidelines have differences in the concepts of treatment thresholds (≥ 70mg/dL in the United States) vs treatment goals (< 55mg/dL in Europe), in the definition of very high-risk category and in the classes for recommendation for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Utilization of lipid-modifying therapy and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment in patients at high and very-high cardiovascular risk: real-world evidence from Germany [^116yZ2gf]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a causal risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) events. European guidelines recommend reducing LDL-C as the primary lipid target to reduce CV risk, using lifestyle modifications and lipid-lowering therapy (LLT). Many European patients do not achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C levels. The present database analysis aimed to assess LLT treatment patterns and LDL-C threshold attainment in Germany in a large, real-world cohort of patients.

Methods

Patients from the Cegedim Longitudinal Practice Database in Germany who met selection criteria were included: (a) LDL-C measurement in 2013; (b) ≥ 20 years of age; (c) high or very-high CV risk conditions: recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), other coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD]) or diabetes mellitus (DM) (non-ASCVD). LDL-C threshold attainment was assessed based on LDL-C targets from 2011 European guidelines.

Results

42,767 patients met the inclusion criteria; 35% received current statin treatment, and 30% achieved guideline-recommended LDL-C targets. Attainment of LDL-C goals among ASCVD hierarchical categories was 46.7% for recent ACS, 35.8% for ischemic stroke, 34.9% for other CHD, and 26.9% for PAD. Among patients in the non-ASCVD group with DM, 23.6% achieved LDL-C goals. Similar results were observed when patients were grouped by prevalence (patients assigned to every risk group for which they qualified).

Conclusions

In this high/very-high CV risk population in Germany, statin utilization was low; suggesting that LLTs are not prescribed as per European guidelines. These results highlight the need to increase LLT use among high-risk patients.

### The 2013 ACC / AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a new paradigm supported by more evidence [^113BK1pT]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline was a major paradigm shift and heavily criticized by some experts. A better understanding of the methodology used to develop the guideline, the guideline recommendations, and the evidence supporting them addresses many of criticisms.

Methods and Results

An extensive body of evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the new risk-based approach. The emphasis is on the appropriate intensity of statin therapy in patients most likely to benefit. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines have taken a similar approach. Recent studies have found the 2013 guideline outperforms earlier cholesterol guidelines recommending low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment thresholds and targets. The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred. Ezetimibe has now been shown to meet this standard.

Conclusions

The concept of net benefit introduced in the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk. Net benefit, incorporating the absolute ASCVD risk of a patient and the relative reduction in ASCVD risk based on the magnitude of LDL-C reduction from the addition of a non-statin, can be used when considering whether to add ezetimibe or another LDL-C lowering drug.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1-executive summary [^113snnT8]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Various organizations and agencies have issued recommendations for the management of dyslipidemia. Although many commonalities exist among them, material differences are present as well. The leadership of the National Lipid Association (NLA) convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. The current Executive Summary highlights the major conclusions in Part 1 of the recommendations report of the NLA Expert Panel and includes: (1) background and conceptual framework for formulation of the NLA Expert Panel recommendations; (2) screening and classification of lipoprotein lipid levels in adults; (3) targets for intervention in dyslipidemia management; (4) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment and treatment goals based on risk category; (5) atherogenic cholesterol-non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-as the primary targets of therapy; and (6) lifestyle and drug therapies intended to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with dyslipidemia.

High- or very high–risk patient groups (Table 9) — Quantitative risk scoring is not necessary for initial risk assessment in patients with the following conditions: diabetes mellitus, type 1 or 2; chronic kidney disease, stage ≥ 3B; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dL: severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype, which includes familial hypercholesterolemia (FH); or ASCVD, and patients in these categories are at "high" or "very high" risk for an ASCVD event and should be treated accordingly.

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^111PbaPQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### Pushing the limits of LDL cholesterol: emerging paradigms in cardiovascular risk reduction [^111WCQaW]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) has long been recognized as a primary contributor to cardiovascular disease. Over time, guideline-recommended LDL-C targets have varied considerably, trending toward progressively more aggressive therapeutic goals. The focus on residual risk reduction and development of novel therapies-including PCSK9 inhibitors, siRNA-based treatments, and ANGPTL3 inhibitors-have significantly expanded the options for achieving unprecedentedly low LDL-C levels. Given the fundamental role of cholesterol in cellular function, it has been long been postulated that very low cholesterol could be associated with adverse events. In this review, we dissect the benefits and potential risks of very low LDL-C levels. We begin by providing an overview of the evolution of LDL-C targets in previous guidelines and highlighting therapies-including newer agents-used for aggressive LDL-C lowering. Drawing on clinical and genetic evidence, we then examine the benefits and risks associated with achieving very low LDL-C levels. Finally, we present a practical framework for balancing the potential risks and benefits of intensive LDL-C reduction in patient care.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112UD3pm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Candidates for statin combination therapy — indications and decision factors: More intensive atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be indicated in high or very high risk patients with a less-than-desirable response to moderate or high intensity statin therapy; in patients who have recurrent ASCVD events or progressive atherosclerotic vascular symptoms in spite of high intensity statin therapy; in patients with FH, especially with ASCVD or poorly controlled non-lipid risk factors and less than optimal non-HDL-C or LDL-C levels; and in patients after acute coronary syndromes on at least moderate intensity statin therapy. Generally, if a patient in the categories above at high or very high ASCVD risk is not at non-HDL-C and LDL-C goals, strong consideration should be given to statin combination therapy (i.e., a statin with an additional lipid-altering agent). Clinical ASCVD event benefits of combination therapy were demonstrated in a recent clinical trial of ezetimibe added to statin therapy and with investigational PCSK9 inhibitors added to statin therapy. The clinician should determine whether statin combination therapies are indicated based on re-evaluation of the patient's risk factor status and quantitative risk scoring, reconsideration of the nature of the patient's history of vascular events, reconsideration of possible genetic dyslipidemias, examination of affordability and polypharmacy risks, and consideration of the patient's preferences.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^111sySEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

For moderate risk, the non–HDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL and the LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^1118q1vi]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) were updated in late 2019 in light of recent intervention trials involving the use of innovative lipid-lowering agents in combination with statins. The new guidelines advocate achieving very low LDL-C levels in individuals at highest risk, within the paradigm of 'lower is better'. With the advent of combination therapy using ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in addition to statins, the routine attainment of extremely low LDL-C levels in the clinic has become a reality. Moreover, clinical trials in this setting have shown that, over the 5–7 years of treatment experience to date, profound LDL-C lowering leads to further reduction in cardiovascular events compared with more moderate lipid lowering, with no associated safety concerns. These reassuring findings are bolstered by genetic studies showing lifelong very low LDL-C levels (< 1.4 mmol/L; < 55 mg/dL) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk than in the general population, with no known detrimental health effects. Nevertheless, long-term safety studies are required to consolidate the present evidence base. This review summarises key data supporting the ESC/EAS recommendation to reduce markedly LDL-C levels, with aggressive goals for LDL-C in patients at highest risk, and provides expert opinion on its significance for clinical practice.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To simplify monitoring, nonfasting lipid measurements are allowed.

3.4 Additional lowering of‐C

Current guidelines for management of dyslipidemia indicate that despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, high‐risk patients with clinical ASCVD, HeFH, or HoFH may not achieve anticipated lowering of LDL‐C, or non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), or may have unacceptably high residual levels of atherogenic lipoproteins. 32, 33, 34, 35 The 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline defines adequacy of statin therapy based on anticipated percent reduction in LDL‐C as calculated from RCTs included in the meta‐analysis conducted by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists in 2010, in which statin therapy reduced ASCVD events (Table 1). 11 The 2016 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Role of Non‐Statin Therapies for LDL‐Cholesterol Lowering in the Management of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk provided levels of LDL‐C, or thresholds, in terms of both percentage LDL‐C reduction from baseline and absolute on‐treatment LDL‐C measurement, which if not achieved by adherent patients would serve as factors to consider in decision making regarding the addition of nonstatin therapy. These thresholds are not firm triggers for adding medication but factors that may be considered within the broader context of an individual patient's clinical situation (Table 2). 33 Both the National Lipid Association Recommendations for Patient‐Centered Management of Dyslipidemia: Part 1 and the AACE/ACE 2017 Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia continue to define specific LDL‐C and non–HDL‐C goals based on absolute levels of atherogenic lipoproteins (Tables 3 and 4). 34, 35 The most recent AACE Guidelines introduced a new level of extreme risk, with an associated concomitant recommended LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL (Table 4).

### LDL cholesterol: how low to go? [^116kRVgD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and the results of large-scale outcome trials indicate that the association of LDL with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is causal, and continuous not only across levels seen in the general population but also down to sub-physiological values. There is no scientific basis, therefore, to set a target or 'floor' for LDL cholesterol lowering, and this presents a clinical and conceptual dilemma for prescribers, patients, and payers. With the advent of powerful agents such as proprotein convertase/subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, LDL cholesterol can be lowered profoundly but health economic constraints mandate that this therapeutic approach needs to be selective. Based on the need to maximize the absolute risk reduction when prescribing combination lipid-lowering therapy, it is appropriate to prioritize patients with the highest risk (aggressive and established CVD) who will obtain the highest benefit, that is, those with elevated LDL cholesterol on optimized statin therapy.

Introduction

Treatment guidelines for reducing cardiovascular risk focus on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on the basis of extensive evidence from primary and secondary prevention trials with statins. Treatment goals for LDL-C, as specified by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, are risk stratified: < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients (coronary heart disease [CHD] or CHD risk equivalents, 10-year risk > 20%), < 130 mg/dL for moderate-risk patients (≥ 2 risk factors, 10-year risk 10% to 20%), and < 160 mg/dL for low-risk patients (0 to 1 risk factors). CHD risk assessment is generally evaluated with the Framingham scoring system, which takes into account cigarette smoking, treated or untreated systolic hypertension, sex, age, total cholesterol level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. The 2004 update to the NCEP ATP III added an optional LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients (established cardiovascular disease [CVD] with multiple major risk factors), which also has been endorsed by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association. –

Although statins are excellent at reducing LDL-C and remain the mainstay of lipid-modifying therapies, patients optimally treated with statins continue to have cardiovascular events. One potential reason for this might be suboptimal non–HDL-C levels. The NCEP ATP III recommends non–HDL-C as a secondary target in patients with elevated triglycerides (TG) (≥ 200 mg/dL) after the LDL-C goal has been achieved.

There is some confirmation, based on recent evaluations and reviews, that non–HDL-C does have an impact on cardiovascular outcomes. – Additionally, Boekholdt et al, in a meta-analysis evaluating statin-treated patients, concluded that elevated non–HDL-C imparted just as much high risk for cardiovascular events as elevated LDL-C. With the growing evidence that non–HDL-C is a better predictor of outcomes, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Diabetes Association Consensus Conference, in 2008 endorsed non–HDL-C as a cotarget in patients with cardiometabolic risk.

We selected individuals between 40 and 75years of age with 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) between 5.0% and < 7.5% who underwent a routine health screening. For every subject, we simulated a strategy based on a 40% LDL-c reduction (S 40%) and another strategy based on achieving LDL-c target ≤ 100mg/dL (S target-100). The cardiovascular benefit was estimated assuming a 22% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular events for each 39mg/dL of LDL-c lowered.

Results

The study comprised 1756 individuals (94% men, 52 ± 5years old). LDL-c and predicted 10-year ASCVD risk would be slightly lower in S 40% compared to S target-100. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 major cardiovascular event in 10years (NNT 10) would be 56 with S 40% and 66 with S target-100. S 40% would prevent more events in individuals with lower baseline LDL-c, whereas S target-100 would be more protective in those with higher LDL-c. A dual-target strategy (40% minimum LDL-c reduction and achievement of LDL-c ≤ 100mg/dL) would be associated with outcomes similar to those expected with the S 40% (NNT 10 = 55).

Conclusions

In an intermediate-risk population, cardiovascular benefit from LDL-c lowering may be optimized by tailoring the treatment according to the baseline LDL-c or by setting a dual-target strategy (fixed dose statin plus achievement of target LDL-c concentration).

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113KaHZB]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ASCVD remains the #1 cause of death in the United States and has been on the rise for more than a decade after more than 40 years of steady decline. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Despite the existence of cholesterol guidelines, universal screening ages, risk assessment tools, and recommendations for LDL-C management based on risk, data show that LDL-C measurement and management in patients with ASCVD are not meeting guideline-directed objectives. Further, there is no single clinical guideline that presents LDL-C measurement frequency, risk assessment, management, and desirable LDL-C levels for adults based on risk.

Objective

This document aims to summarize the numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C.

Methods

Guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other relevant professional organizations were systematically reviewed. Key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application.

Results

The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations across major guidelines emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and the use of shared decision-making to improve adherence. The resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care.

Conclusion

Integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding. This approach supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: same data but different interpretations [^115m8mFL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Examining the Guidelines: Major Similarities But Differences in Interpretation of the Data

Both the 2018 AHA/ACC/MS Guideline and the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines employ a risk‐based approach to grade intensity of the intervention and use patient history, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data to identify individuals most likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering therapy. Both guidelines identify 4 major, mutually exclusive categories of patients likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering interventions, including those with clinical ASCVD, severe primary hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and primary prevention patients with high 10‐year risk for ASCVD. They recommend treatments based on the premise that the higher the baseline risk, the greater the absolute ASCVD risk reduction derived from the same reduction of LDL‐C. Some key differences in the interpretation of data include the following: definition of risk categories; employment of risk calculation systems that depend on ASCVD death (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) versus fatal and nonfatal ASCVD (Pooled Cohort Equations); use of atherosclerosis imaging tests to inform treatment decisions; value of employing LDL‐C goals, and, in selected hypertriglyceridemic patients, non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) and apoB goals, for clinical decision making; and use of pharmacotherapy that is based upon achieved LDL‐C levels. While both guidelines recognize that there is a continuum of risk, the ESC/EAS Guidelines proceed on the premise that ASCVD risk is a continuum from low to very high without categorizing people to primary and secondary prevention, while the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline maintains that differentiation between primary and secondary prevention is warranted based on the results of randomized controlled trials. The 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines provide a number of important updates to the previous ESC/EAS Guidelines of 2016 and among other key points, emphasize that lower LDL‐C is better and that the absolute LDL‐C reduction drives the clinical benefit (Data S1, Table S1). This perspective has led to new goals in high‐risk and very high‐risk patients, shifting the focus from high‐intensity statin to high‐intensity lipid‐lowering. The philosophical underpinnings of these documents and their divergent approaches to lipid lowering for ASCVD risk reduction are summarized in Table 1.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^1147H4Bj]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

When deciding how aggressive an LDL-C-lowering regimen to prescribe, clinicians should be mindful that the absolute risk reduction is a function of both the absolute decrease in LDL-C concentration and the estimated ongoing ASCVD risk. The smaller the absolute drop in LDL-C, the less the relative risk reduction, and so the benefit gained from intervention depends on the risk status of the patient. At low LDL-C levels (eg, patients on statin) further lowering is recommended primarily for those in the highest risk categories. This approach is explored in figure 3 where we present typical patients with ASCVD at high/very high risk, who would fall into three of the categories of LDL-C goals set out in the guidelines.

Figure 3
Patient scenarios. Cases of patients at high ASCVD risk being ascribed to regimens of increasingly intensive LDL-C lowering. LDL-C and triglyceride levels are given in mmol/L (see online supplemental figure 1 for the mg/dL version). The predicted LDL-C reductions of 20% for ezetimibe and 60% for PCSK9i are based on average published responses. Case 1 is a patient with probable FH on the basis of his high LDL-C and sibling with diagnosed FH. Note, the additional 6% reduction on 40 mg rosuvastatin is based on the untreated LDL-C of 5.1 mmol/L; the 20% drop on ezetimibe is calculated from the LDL-C on 20 mg rosuvastatin. Case 2 is a woman with obesity, type 2 diabetes plus other risk factors (hypertension) with symptomatic ASCVD. Case 3 is a man with hypertension with repeat ASCVD events within a short time period (26 months). Note, when LDL-C levels are low — typically < 1.8 mmol/L — laboratory measurement can be problematic especially if lipoprotein(a) or plasma triglyceride levels are high. The guidelines recommend the use of non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B as secondary measures to assess the need for further lipid-lowering action when LDL-C is low, as discussed in more detail.

International LDL-C targets and risk relationship — The risk of ASCVD events is directly proportional to the achieved LDL-C concentration, with benefit observed down to levels below 20 mg/dL, and international guidelines endorse aggressive LDL-C lowering in very high-risk populations; specifically, the European Atherosclerosis Society recommends an LDL-C goal of < 40 mg/dL for patients with recurrent events, while the Lipid Association of India advocates for a target < 30 mg/dL in individuals classified as extreme risk, and patient messaging emphasizes lipid-lowering therapy to reduce ASCVD risk because LDL-C is the building block for atheroma formation.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, management, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to target LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and LDL-C level of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) in very high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD. Initiate a combination therapy if goals cannot be achieved.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment in high-risk family medicine patients [^114zVp4t]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The Adult Treatment Panel III guideline recommends a low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goal of < 100mg/dl for patients with coronary heart disease or risk equivalence (ie, other forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease [peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, cerebrovascular disease], diabetes). An optional LDL-C goal of < 70mg/dl is recommended for patients considered "very high risk". This category is not well defined, and clinical interpretation of this category varies.

Methods

To define this category and to determine eligibility for an LDL-C goal of < 70mg/dl, 5 definitions of "very high risk" were developed. Patients with coronary heart disease or risk equivalence within the University of Colorado Family Medicine system over the course of 2 years were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes (n = 445). Their medical records were evaluated retrospectively. Patients characterized as "very high risk" according to the 5 definitions were assessed for LDL-C < 70mg/dl goal attainment.

Results

Twenty-seven patients did not have LDL-C measurements and were excluded. Using the 5 definitions, we discovered that prevalence as "very high risk" was 10.8% (atherosclerotic vascular disease [AVD] plus smoking), 19.1% (AVD plus diabetes), 21.5% (AVD plus metabolic syndrome plus uncontrolled hypertension or smoking), 47.1% (AVD plus metabolic syndrome), and 67.2% (All AVD), P < .0001. LDL-C < 70mg/dl was attained in 26.7%, 46.3%, 31.1%, 39.1%, and 35.2%, respectively (P = 0.13).

Conclusion

Classifying patients as "very high risk" is highly variable depending on individual definitions, but this does not appear to alter the rates of attaining an LDL-C goal of < 70mg/dl. When the Adult Treatment Panel IV guidelines are developed and issued, simplicity and clarity will be important in assisting clinicians in defining patient risk and developing LDL-C goals.

### Harder-to-treat patients: recognizing them and adapting treatment strategies [^111CDvVj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

National Lipid Association guidance for adult low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management — atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the #1 cause of death in the United States, and LDL-C is described as a causal factor that should be monitored and may be modified through lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. The objective is to summarize numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C. Methods systematically reviewed guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other organizations, and key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application. The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and shared decision-making to improve adherence; the resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care. The conclusion states that integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding, supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

Low risk definition and management thresholds: Individuals with 0 or 1 major ASCVD risk factors are generally at low risk for an ASCVD event (< 5% 10-year ASCVD event risk), quantitative risk scoring is not typically necessary, lifestyle therapies are primary, and consideration may be given to pharmacotherapy in those with non–HDL-C of 190 to 219 mg/dL (LDL-C of 160 to 189 mg/dL); information about additional risk indicators or subclinical disease should also be considered when making pharmacotherapy decisions.

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III guidelines [^1158JvLe]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, 5 major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C. The major recommendations for modifications to footnote the ATP III treatment algorithm are the following. In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL, but when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, ie, a reasonable clinical strategy, on the basis of available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2+ risk factors and 10-year risk 10% to 20%), the recommended LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL, but an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. The latter option extends also to moderately high-risk persons with a baseline LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. When LDL-lowering drug therapy is employed in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is advised that intensity of therapy be sufficient to achieve at least a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels. Moreover, any person at high risk or moderately high risk who has lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, or metabolic syndrome) is a candidate for TLC to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level. Finally, for people in lower-risk categories, recent clinical trials do not modify the goals and cutpoints of therapy.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction: the end is more important than the means [^1156viu1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Many epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the linear relation between elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the risk for coronary heart disease. Conversely, for each 1% reduction in LDL cholesterol in clinical trials, there is a corresponding 1% reduction in coronary heart disease risk. Although the degree of reduction is more important in affecting risk than the means used to lower LDL, statins are considered the most consistently effective means of lowering LDL. The National Cholesterol Education Program now recommends an optional goal of < 70 mg/dl for patients at very high risk for coronary heart disease. In conclusion, on the basis of completed clinical trials, there is no evidence that achieving and maintaining such low levels of LDL cholesterol result in adverse effects. The most potent statins, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, are capable of getting most patients to their LDL cholesterol goals, but combinations of statins with other drugs may be necessary for patients who require additional lipid lowering.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111ykjRF]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^1178PAur]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

High-risk treatment targets and limits of risk equations — risk equations should generally not be used in patients already treated for dyslipidemia and should not be used in individuals with FH because they underestimate risk. The goals of therapy for patients at high risk are non–HDL-C < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, with consideration given to drug therapy in those whose atherogenic cholesterol levels are higher than those goal levels, generally after a trial of lifestyle therapy. Drug treatment may be started concurrently with lifestyle therapy in some high-risk patients, such as those unlikely to attain goal atherogenic cholesterol without drug therapy (eg, LDL-C of ≥ 190 mg/dL) or with diabetes mellitus and 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their current use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. Long‐term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to current guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Current guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events; however, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis (including coronary artery calcium [CAC] scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography), a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high‐risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL‐C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk, the same category as those with documented ASCVD events.

Multiple challenges exist to effective LDL‐C management in patients with, and at risk for, ASCVD (Figure 1). This review presents a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from primary versus secondary prevention to a continuum of risk. Such an approach acknowledges the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment to prevent first cardiovascular events (ie, "high‐risk primary prevention").

### Cholesterol management: ACC / AHA updates guideline… [^114mpP3Y]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- A nonfasting plasma lipid profile can be obtained to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL-C in adults 20 years and older who are not on lipid-lowering therapy.
- Maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg per dL or greater.
- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age.

If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. level of 130 mg per dL or greater, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level of 2. 0 mg per L or greater, an ankle-brachial index less than
0. 9, and lipoprotein level of 50 mg per dL or greater, especially at higher values of lipoprotein.

Selected Moderate-Strength Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, the addition of nonstatin drug therapy should be considered at a threshold LDL-C level of at least 70 mg per dL on maximal statin therapy in patients with ASCVD at very high risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117CYeQV]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds — evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of < 100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤ 100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥ 100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that "normal" very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are < 150 mg/dL is typically ≤ 30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically > 30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Narrative review: lack of evidence for recommended low-density lipoprotein treatment targets: a solvable problem [^115uY7g7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Recent national recommendations have proposed that physicians should titrate lipid therapy to achieve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels less than 1.81 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at very high cardiovascular risk and less than 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL) for patients at high cardiovascular risk. To examine the clinical evidence for these recommendations, the authors sought to review all controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies that examined the independent relationship between LDL cholesterol and major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with LDL cholesterol levels less than 3.36 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL). For those with LDL cholesterol levels less than 3.36 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL), the authors found no clinical trial subgroup analyses or valid cohort or case-control analyses suggesting that the degree to which LDL cholesterol responds to a statin independently predicts the degree of cardiovascular risk reduction. Published studies had avoidable limitations, such as a reliance on ecological (aggregate) analyses, use of analyses that ignore statins' other proposed mechanisms of action, and failure to account for known confounders (especially healthy volunteer effects). Clear, compelling evidence supports near-universal empirical statin therapy in patients at high cardiovascular risk (regardless of their natural LDL cholesterol values), but current clinical evidence does not demonstrate that titrating lipid therapy to achieve proposed low LDL cholesterol levels is beneficial or safe.

### Compliance with dyslipidemia guidelines in daily practice: how effective is cardiovascular risk prevention? [^1132EAa5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of early mortality and morbidity. The current European guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice recommend the use of the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) system. The current American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of the new pooled cohort risk assessment equations to estimate the 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk. The purpose of this article was to investigate the compliance of dyslipidemia guidelines in daily practice in patients with dyslipidemia or who have risk factors for CVD.

Methods

The study group consisted of 500 outpatients who had dyslipidemia or risk factors for CVD. The risk level was computed according to the European and American Heart Association guidelines. Therapeutic LDL-C targets were identified based on the calculated risk level. Therapeutic target levels were compared based on the dosage of statins used and achievement of the LDL-C goal in daily practice according to the risk levels.

Findings

According to the European dyslipidemia guidelines, 231 patients were in the very-high/high-risk group, and 106 patients (45.9%) achieved the LDL-C target (< 100 mg/dL); 210 patients were in the moderate-risk group, and 156 (74.3%) patients achieved the LDL-C target (< 115 mg/dL); and 59 patients were in the low-risk group, and 55 (93.2%) patients achieved the LDL-C target (< 155 mg/dL). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the LDL-C level and presence of coronary artery disease were significantly reverse associated with achievement of the LDL-C goal (both, P < 0.001).

Implications

Our results showed that the majority of patients were in the very-high/high-risk group in daily practice. Although the European dyslipidemia guidelines are more likely to be used in daily practice, achievement of the guidelines-recommended treatment goals was low.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^113uwnEm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Desirable LDL-C targets for adults: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management should be individualized, and evidence supports an LDL-C target of < 100 mg/dL for healthy adults in the general population; individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including those with very high baseline LDL-C suggestive of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), multiple risk factors, or established ASCVD, may require lower LDL-C levels, and higher plaque burden or progression are situations where more intensive LDL-C lowering therapy should be considered.

Moderate risk lipid goals and when to consider drug therapy: The goals of therapy for those at moderate risk are non–HDL-C of < 130 mg/dL and LDL-C of < 100 mg/dL with consideration given to drug therapy in those who will have at least 30 mg/dL above these levels, and the presence of one or more additional risk indicators may prompt consideration of drug therapy when the atherogenic cholesterol level is less than 30 mg/dL above the goal threshold.
