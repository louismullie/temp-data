## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the sum of all values of x that satisfy the equation (x² − 5x + 5)⁽ˣ²⁺⁴ˣ⁻⁶⁰⁾ = 1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the conditions under which an expression aᵇ equals 1. Then, I should solve each of those conditions separately and collect all valid x values. Finally, I will sum the distinct solutions and match the result to the given options.

> Let me first confirm the three cases that make aᵇ = 1: either the base a equals 1, or the exponent b equals 0 with the base a nonzero, or the base a equals −1 and the exponent b is an even integer. I need to ensure I don't miss any of these, and I should double-check that I exclude invalid cases like 0⁰ or (−1)ᵒᵈᵈ, which would not equal 1.

> Case 1: base equals 1. I will set x² − 5x + 5 = 1 and solve for x. Subtracting 1 gives x² − 5x + 4 = 0, which factors to (x − 1)(x − 4) = 0, so x = 1 or x = 4. Wait, let me verify that these are valid: yes, when the base is 1, any real exponent yields 1, so both are legitimate solutions.

> Case 2: exponent equals 0 with base nonzero. I will set x² + 4x − 60 = 0 and solve for x. Factoring gives (x + 10)(x − 6) = 0, so x = −10 or x = 6. Hold on, I should verify that the base is not zero at these points. Plugging x = −10 into x² − 5x + 5 gives 100 + 50 + 5 = 155 ≠ 0, and plugging x = 6 gives 36 − 30 + 5 = 11 ≠ 0, so both are valid under this case.

> Case 3: base equals −1 and exponent is even. I will set x² − 5x + 5 = −1 and solve for x. Adding 1 gives x² − 5x + 6 = 0, which factors to (x − 2)(x − 3) = 0, so x = 2 or x = 3. Next, I should review whether the exponent is even at these x values. For x = 2, the exponent is 4 + 8 − 60 = −48, which is even; for x = 3, the exponent is 9 + 12 − 60 = −39, which is odd. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought both might work, but I need to correct that: only x = 2 yields an even exponent, so only x = 2 is valid in this case, whereas x = 3 must be excluded because (−1)ᵒᵈᵈ = −1 ≠ 1.

> Now I will collect all distinct solutions: from Case 1, x = 1 and x = 4; from Case 2, x = −10 and x = 6; from Case 3, x = 2. I should confirm there are no duplicates; none here, so the solution set is {−10, 1, 2, 4, 6}.

> Finally, I will sum the distinct solutions: −10 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 3. Let me double-check the arithmetic: −10 + 1 = −9; −9 + 2 = −7; −7 + 4 = −3; −3 + 6 = 3. Yes, the sum is 3, which corresponds to option (B).

The equation ((x² − 5x + 5)⁽ˣ²⁺⁴ˣ⁻⁶⁰⁾ = 1) holds when the base is 1, the exponent is 0 with a nonzero base, or the base is -1 with an even exponent. Solving these cases gives (x = 1, 4, -10, 6, 2), and the sum is **3**.

---

## Case 1: base equals 1

Set the base equal to 1:

x² − 5x + 5 = 1

x² − 5x + 4 = 0

(x − 1)(x − 4) = 0

Solutions: (x = 1) and (x = 4).

---

## Case 2: exponent equals 0 with nonzero base

Set the exponent equal to 0:

x² + 4x − 60 = 0

(x + 10)(x − 6) = 0

Solutions: (x = -10) and (x = 6).

Check that the base is nonzero at these values:

- **For (x = −10)**: ((−10)² − 5(−10) + 5 = 100 + 50 + 5 = 155 ≠ 0).
- **For (x = 6)**: (6² − 5(6) + 5 = 36 − 30 + 5 = 11 ≠ 0).

Both are valid.

---

## Case 3: base equals -1 with even exponent

Set the base equal to -1:

x² − 5x + 5 = −1

x² − 5x + 6 = 0

(x − 2)(x − 3) = 0

Solutions: (x = 2) and (x = 3).

Check that the exponent is even:

- **For (x = 2)**: (2² + 4(2) − 60 = 4 + 8 − 60 = −48) (even).
- **For (x = 3)**: (3² + 4(3) − 60 = 9 + 12 − 60 = −39) (odd).

Only (x = 2) is valid.

---

## Summary of solutions

The valid solutions are (x = 1, 4, -10, 6, 2).

---

## Sum of all solutions

1 + 4 + (−10) + 6 + 2 = 3

---

The sum of all values of (x) that satisfy the equation is **3**.

ACC/AHA cardiovascular risk assessment — Table 8 describes estimating an individual's 10-year risk of incident hard atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) using race-sex group–specific coefficients and a worked example. The example profile assumes an individual 55 years of age (for which the Ln[Age] = 4.01), with a total cholesterol of 213 mg/dL, HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) of 50 mg/dL, and an untreated systolic BP (blood pressure) of 120 mm Hg who is not a current smoker and does not have diabetes. The calculation is performed in steps: the natural log (Ln) of age, total cholesterol, HDL-C, and systolic BP is calculated; appropriate interaction terms are derived (for example, Ln[Age]×Ln[Total Cholesterol]); the resulting values are multiplied by coefficients from the equation for the specific race-sex group to yield "Coefficient × Value" terms that are summed as an "Individual Sum". The estimated risk is formally calculated as "1 minus the survival rate at 10 years ("Baseline Survival" in Table A), raised to the power of the exponent of the "Coefficient × Value" sum minus the race- and sex-specific overall mean "Coefficient × Value" sum", and the white men example equates to a 5.3% probability of a first hard ASCVD event within 10 years.

### Nonlinear delay differential equations and their application to modeling biological network motifs [^22bd51a1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Motif III: logic

A general class of functions used to describe natural,– and synthetic, biological networks are logic gates, which have two inputs regulating a single output (Fig. 5). Gates exhibit either high ("on") or low ("off") output depending on whether inputs are on or off. For example, the AND gate specifies high output only if both inputs are on. In this section we provide a specific DDE-based framework that covers 14 out of 16 possible 2-input logic operations, and show that these operations form a continuous 2D parameter space.

A simple approximation for digital logic using a sum of Hill terms recapitulates all monotonic logic functions in a single parameter space.

a A prototypical regulatory network involving logic where X and Y both regulate Z, which must integrate the two signals using some logic before it can in turn activate a downstream reporter R. b Parameter space showing regions where regulation approximately follows 14 of the 16 possible 2-input logic functions depending on the strength of two single-variable Hill regulation terms (η Z 1: regulation of Z by X, η Z 2: regulation of Z by Y). Network logic can be smoothly altered by varying the parameters (η Z 1, η Z 2), with a change of sign in (n 1, n 2) required to switch quadrants. The bottom-left quadrant shows that very weak regulation in both terms leads to an always-off (FALSE) function, weak regulation in one arm only leads to single-input (X, Y) functions, strong regulation in both arms leads to an OR function, and regulation too weak in either arm alone to activate an output but strong enough in sum leads to an AND function. The other three quadrants are related by applying NOT to one or both inputs, with function names related by de Morgan's lawNOT(X OR Y) = NOT X AND NOT Y. In particular, X IMPLY Y = NOT(X) OR Y, X NIMPLY Y = X AND NOT(Y), X NOR Y = NOT X AND NOT Y, and X NAND Y = NOT X OR NOT Y. Truth tables for all 16 logic gates are provided in Supplementary Table 1 for reference.

Comparison of the magnitude of terms 1−7 in Eq. (13a) as well as their sum, for a range of electrode parameters. Note that, while in a, τ is plotted versus L E, in all other panels, 1/ Θ is plotted versus the relevant parameter. The parameters used are given at the top left. Those bold parameters were kept constant in all panels except one, where they were varied. The solid black lines represent the total value of τ or 1/ Θ. Low values of both τ and 1/ Θ are needed for good rate performance. The other curves represent the seven individual terms in Eq. (13a), labelled 1−7 (numbered from left to right in the equation). Electrical and diffusion limited terms are marked as solid and dashed lines, respectively, with the reaction kinetics term represented by grey dots. The legend in the top left gives the term number as well of a summary of what it represents. Those terms labelled by "E" are electrically limited while those labelled by "D" are diffusion limited. The top axis in b represents the volumetric capacity of the electrode calculated using. N.B. L AM = 100 nm corresponds to a particle diameter of 2 r ≈ 600 nm because L AM = r /3 for pseudo-spherical particles

Eq. (13a) can be simplified considerably for electrodes with thickness > 100 μm, as found in practical cells. Then, Θ is dominated by terms 2 and 4 with a non-negligible contribution from term 3 under certain circumstances. Specifically, because terms 1 and 2 scale in similar ways, term 1 can be ignored when it is much smaller than term 2, i.e. if. Taking σ BL ~ 0.5 S m −1 and P E ~ 0.5, this is true if1 S m −1, which should be the aim when introducing conductive additives. Term 6 can be neglected so long as it is much smaller than the ubiquitous term 3, i.e. if. For r = 60 nm (L AM = 20 nm) Si particles (D AM ~ 10 −16 m 2 s −1), this is true if20 μm which will apply in commercial electrodes. In addition, we neglect term 7 asshould become relatively small for thick electrodes.

### Effects of changing population or density on urban carbon dioxide emissions [^49635916]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To account for the multicollinearity problem, we have fitted Eqs. (3) and (5) by using the ridge regression approach. This method solves the matrix inversion problem by adding a constant λ to the diagonal elements of X T X, so that the ridge estimator for the linear coefficients is a = (XᵀX + λI)⁻¹Xᵀy, where I is the identity matrix. The ridge estimation is equivalent to finding the optimal linear coefficients that minimize the residual sum of squares plus a penalty term (also called regularization parameter) proportional to the sum of the squares of the linear coefficients, that is, finding the a that minimizes the objective function ∥y − Xa∥² + λ∥a∥². The optimal value of λ is usually unknown in practice and needs to be estimated from data. To do so, we have used the approach of searching for the value of λ that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) in a leave-one-out cross validation strategy. In this approach, we estimate a (for a given λ) using all data except for one point that is used for calculating the squared error. This process is repeated until every data point is used exactly once for estimating the squared error, and then we calculate the value of the MSE for a given λ. The optimal value of λ = λ * is the one that minimizes the average value of the MSE estimated with the leave-one-out cross validation method. We have also standardized all predictors before searching for the optimal value λ *. This is a common practice when dealing with regularization methods and ensures that the penalty term is uniformly applied to the predictors, that is, the normalization makes the scale of the predictors comparable and prevents variables with distinct ranges from having uneven penalization.

Multivariate Bernoulli distribution

The three parametrizations we derived for the bivariate Bernoulli distribution extend to the multivariate Bernoulli distribution. Suppose that (X 1, …, X L) ∈ {0, 1} L is distributed according to a multivariate Bernoulli distribution. Then the distribution P (X) of the random variables X is uniquely specified by one of the three following parametrizations.
General parameters: These are 2 L non-negative valuessatisfyingFor example if L = 3, then p 010 = P (X 1 = 0, X 2 = 1, X 3 = 0) and p 110 = P (X 1 = 1, X 2 = 1, X 3 = 0). Note that since, only 2 L − 1 valuesare necessary to define the distribution.
Natural/canonical parameters: These are 2 L real numberssatisfyingSimilar to the general parameters p i, only 2 L − 1 values β S are necessary to uniquely define the distribution. Typically, the parameter, often called a normalizing constant or a partition function of the distribution, is left unspecified. As noted in the bivariate setting, equation (23) shows that the multivariate Bernoulli is an exponential family distribution with 2 L − 1 sufficient statistics of the form ∏ i ∈ S X i for subsets S with ∣ S ∣ > 0. Moreover, by rewriting (23) aswe observe that the natural parameters β correspond to interaction coefficients in a log-linear regression model with response variables p. For example, the natural parameter β 12 is the coefficient of the interaction term x 1 x 2.
Moments/mean parameters: These are 2 L real numberssatisfyingFor example if L = 3, then μ 13 = E [X 1 X 3] while μ 12 = E [X 1 X 2]. The mean parametersare sufficient statistics for the multivariate Bernoulli distribution, as seen in the exponential family form (23) of the multivariate Bernoulli distribution.

Methods

Optimization

The optimization to find σ andin (3) is performed by a Monte Carlo basin-hopping strategyusing the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm for local minimization within basins of the cost function. This global strategy was selected to counteract an observed tendency for local methods to get trapped in local minima. The initial guess for this search is found as follows. The normalization constant E 0 is the lowest entanglement energy of the input entanglement spectrum { E }. We iteratively construct an approximate set of single-particle entanglement energies starting from an empty set. First, we take the lowest remaining level in the spectrum and subtract E 0 to produce a new single-particle level k. Then we remove the many-body levels, which are closest to the new combinatorial levels generated according to (2) by the additional single-particle level. This process is repeated until the input spectrum is exhausted. We can also introduce a truncation of the entanglement spectrum cutting off high entanglement energies, making the construction of the initial guess terminate faster. The minimization of D (σ, σ f) to identify the optimal free model for the Ising Hamiltonian (5) is calculated using a local Nelder–Mead method.

Finite-size scaling

We perform the finite-size scaling according to an ansatz (4). The parameters of the collapse were estimated using the method of ref. From the scaling ansatz (4) and for a trial set of scaling parameters g c, ν and ζ, the scaled values x L = (g − g c) L 1/ ν andare calculated from each unscaled data point. From this collection of scaled data points (x L, y L) across all L, we implicitly define a so-called master curve that best represents them. This curve y (x) is defined around a point x as the linear regression calculated by taking the scaled data points immediately left and right of x for each system size L. We characterize the deviation of the scaled points (x L, y L) from the master curve y (x L) using the χ 2 statistic. This measure is used as the cost function for an optimization problem over the scaling parameters g c, ν, ζ and θ, which can be solved using the same techniques as the previous problems.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^57fa10b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some "visible" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, "hidden" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of "hidden" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a "space-time" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.

### The XZZX surface code [^8f6ac9c8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

This structured noise model thus leads to two distinct regimes, depending on which failure process is dominant. In the first regime where, we expect that the logical failure rate will decay like. We find this behaviour with systems of a finite size and at high bias where error rates are near to threshold. We evaluate logical failure rates using numerical simulations to demonstrate the behavior that characterises this regime; see Fig. 6 (a). Our data show good agreement with the scaling ansatz. In contrast, our data are not well described by a scaling.

Sub-threshold scaling of the logical failure rate with the XZZX code.

a Logical failure rateat high bias near to threshold plotted as a function of code distance d. We use a lattice with coprime dimensions d × (d + 1) for d ∈ {7, 9, 11, 13, 15} at bias η = 300, assuming ideal measurements. The data were collected usingiterations of Monte-Carlo (MC) samples for each physical rate sampled and for each lattice dimension used. The physical error rates used are, from the bottom to the top curves in the main plot, p = 0.19, 0.20, 0.21, 0.22 and 0.23. Error bars represent one standard deviation for the Monte-Carlo simulations. The solid lines are a fit of the data to, consistent with Eq. (2), and the dashed lines a fit to, consistent with Eq. (3) where we would expect, see Methods. The data fit the former very well; for the latter, the gradients of the best fit dashed lines, as shown on the inset plot as a function of, give a linear slope of 0.61(3). Because this slope exceeds the value of 0.5, we conclude that the sub-threshold scaling is not consistent with. b Logical failure ratesat modest bias far below threshold plotted as a function of the physical error rate p.

### Inferring time derivatives including cell growth rates using gaussian processes [^d99eaf3f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Inferring the first and second time derivatives

To determine the time derivative of the data, we use that the derivative of a Gaussian process is another Gaussian process. We can therefore adapt standard techniques for Gaussian process to allow time derivatives to be sampled too.

Building on the work of Boyle, we let g (x) and h (x) be the first and second derivatives with respect to x of the latent function f (x). If f (x) is a Gaussian process then so are both g (x) and h (x). Writing ∂ 1 and ∂ 2 for the partial derivatives with respect to the first and second arguments of a bivariate function, we have

and that

as well as

following ref.

Consequently, the joint probability distribution for y and f *, g * and h * evaluated at points X * is again Gaussian (cf. equation (7)):

where we write K = K (X, X) and K ✱ = K (X *, X *) for clarity.

The covariance function is by definition symmetric: k (x i, x j) = k (x j, x i) from equation (1). Therefore, and so

for all positive integers k and. Consequently, the covariance matrix in equation (13) is also symmetric.

Conditioning on y now gives that the distribution P (f *, g *, h *| X, y, θ, X *) is Gaussian with mean

and covariance matrix

Equation (16) includes equation (9) and shows that

which gives the error in the estimate of the first derivative. Similarly,

is the error in estimating the second derivative.

Using an empirically estimated measurement noise

Although our derivation is given for a Gaussian process where the measurement errors in the data are independent and identically distributed with a Gaussian distribution of mean zero, the derivations are unchanged if the measurement noise has a different s.d. for each time point.

When the magnitude of the measurement noise appears to change with time, we first empirically estimate the relative magnitude of the measurement noise by the variance across all replicates at each time point. We then smooth this estimate over time (with a Gaussian filter with a width of 10% of the total time of the experiment, but the exact choice is not important) and replace the identity matrix, I, in equations (6), (15) and (16) by a diagonal matrix with the relative measurement noise on the diagonal in order to make predictions.

### Mathematical modeling is more than fitting equations [^994275ea]. The American Psychologist (2014). Low credibility.

Comments on the comments made by Brown et al. (see record 2013-24609-001). The article by Brown et al. regarding the Fredrickson and Losada (see record 2005-11834-001) article discussed the use of differential equations in science and repeated our earlier observation (Luoma, Hämäläinen, & Saarinen, 2008) that there is lack of justification for the use of the Lorenz equations in the latter article. In this comment we want to point out that Brown et al. presented a very narrow view on mathematical modeling in behavioral research. We describe how the conceptual use of mathematical models is essential in many fields.

### How dieting might make some fatter: modeling weight cycling toward obesity from a perspective of body composition autoregulation [^32b99e3d]. International Journal of Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Two exponential fits are shown: a generalized linear model (GLM) with 95% confidence intervals (solid line), and a linear model (LM), with R² values (dotted line). The four figures correspond to the four methods presented in the main text for computing the value FAT END at the final time END at which the subjects would have completely recovered their initial FFM. The two red squares correspond to the US Army Ranger data points presented in the section on 'Applications of the Model'.

Their exact values depend on the method used for computing the values FAT END when the FFM has been completely recovered and on the type of statistical regression used. As explained previously, we consider four methods for computing FAT END. In Fig. 4, we show the fits obtained from a generalized linear model (GLM) with 95% confidence intervals (solid line) and from a linear model (LM), with R² values (dotted line). Following the performance of diagnostics tests to analyze the residuals, it is found that the GLM satisfies the major assumptions of regression analysis better than the LM, especially concerning the normality assumption of the error terms. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 4, both models give curves that are close to each other. In simple terms, the main difference between the above LM and GLM approaches to estimate the best parameter values for the constants a and b is the way the error term is handled. In the LM method, we write y = a × e bx × ε, where ε is a random error variable that follows a log-normal distribution with parameters μ = 0 and σ². Taking the logarithm on both sides of the equality gives, which corresponds to the linear model, where, x ′ = x, β 1 = b andis a random error variable that follows a normal distribution with mean μ = 0 and variance σ 2. Note that in the LM method, the error term ε is multiplied with the exponential function y = a × e bx. In the GLM method, the error term is instead added to the exponential function. Formally, we write y = a ×e bx + ε, where ε is a random error variable that follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ². As a consequence, the GLM admits the possibility of the value y = 0 (which is excluded in LM) and assumes that the variance V (y) is constant, while the LM method assumes that V (y) varies with x. Finally, note that the LM method admits exact analytical solutions for the model parameters a and b, while the GLM method requires numerical optimization algorithms to find the best values (the maximum likelihood estimates) for a and b.

### Estimation in medical imaging without a gold standard [^82dda7fe]. Academic Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In medical imaging, physicians often estimate a parameter of interest (eg, cardiac ejection fraction) for a patient to assist in establishing a diagnosis. Many different estimation methods may exist, but rarely can one be considered a gold standard. Therefore, evaluation and comparison of different estimation methods are difficult. The purpose of this study was to examine a method of evaluating different estimation methods without use of a gold standard.

Materials and Methods

This method is equivalent to fitting regression lines without the x axis. To use this method, multiple estimates of the clinical parameter of interest for each patient of a given population were needed. The authors assumed the statistical distribution for the true values of the clinical parameter of interest was a member of a given family of parameterized distributions. Furthermore, they assumed a statistical model relating the clinical parameter to the estimates of its value. Using these assumptions and observed data, they estimated the model parameters and the parameters characterizing the distribution of the clinical parameter.

Results

The authors applied the method to simulated cardiac ejection fraction data with varying numbers of patients, numbers of modalities, and levels of noise. They also tested the method on both linear and nonlinear models and characterized the performance of this method compared to that of conventional regression analysis by using x-axis information. Results indicate that the method follows trends similar to that of conventional regression analysis as patients and noise vary, although conventional regression analysis outperforms the method presented because it uses the gold standard which the authors assume is unavailable.

Conclusion

The method accurately estimates model parameters. These estimates can be used to rank the systems for a given estimation task.

### Fractional response analysis reveals logarithmic cytokine responses in cellular populations [^0d1364aa]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Calculation of typical fractions

The fractions of cells stimulated with dose i that have responses typical to dose j, v ij, can be easily calculated from data regardless of the number of doses and the type of experimental measurements. We have thatCalculation of typical fractions, v ij, with the above formula requires the possibility to examine the condition P (y | x j) > P (y | x k) for any experimentally observed response, y. The distributions P (y | x j) can be reconstructed from data using a variety of probability density estimators. The use of the available estimators, however, might be problematic for multivariate responses. We, therefore, propose a more convenient strategy. We replace the condition P (y | x j) > P (y | x k) with an equivalent condition that is computationally much simpler to evaluate. Precisely, we propose to use the Bayes formulaIf we set the equiprobable prior distribution, i.e. P (x j) = 1 /m, we have that P (y | x j) is proportional to P (x j | y) and the condition P (y | x j) > P (y | x k) is equivalent toThe above strategy allows avoiding estimation of the response distributions, P (y | x j), from data. For continuous and multivariate variable y the estimation of P (x j | y) is generally simpler than estimation of P (y | x j). Precisely, an estimatorof the distribution P (x j | y) can be built using a variety of Bayesian statistical learning methods. For simplicity and efficiency, here we propose to use logistic regression, which is known to work well in a range of applications. In principle, however, other classifiers could also be considered. The logistic regression estimators of P (x j | Y = y) arise from a simplifying assumption that log-ratio of probabilities, P (x j | Y = y) and P (x m | Y = y) is linear. Precisely, The above formulation allows fitting the logistic regression equations to experimental data, i.e. finding values of the parameters, α j and β j that best represent the data. The fitted logistic regression model allows assigning cellular responses to typical doses based on conditions given by Eq. 8. Formally, the fractions v ij defined by Eq. 6 are calculated aswhere n i is the number of cells measured for the dose x i, y l i denotes response of the l- th cell, andis equal 1 iffor anyand 0 otherwise.

### Identifying domains of applicability of machine learning models for materials science [^72c4ba76]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

An illustrative example

Before describing the details of DA identification and its integration into the ML process, let us illustrate the concept and its utility via a synthetic example (see Fig. 1). We consider a simple two-dimensional representation consisting of independent features x 1 and x 2 that are each distributed according to a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2 (N (0, 2)) and a target property y that is a third-degree polynomial in x 1 with an additive noise component that scales exponentially in x 2 :That is, the y values are almost determined by the third-degree polynomial for low x 2 values but are almost completely random for high x 2 values. Discovering applicable domains reveals how different models cope differently with this setting even if they have a comparable average error. To show this, let us examine the error distributions obtained from three different kernelized regression models of the formwith parameter vector ν that are fitted around a training, or fitting (F), setwith three different choices for the kernel function k. We observe:
When using the linear (lin) kernel, the resulting linear model is globally incapable to trace the variation of the third-order polynomial except for a small stripe on the x 1 -axis where it can be approximated well by a linear function. Consequently, there is a very high error globally that is substantially reduced in the DA described by σ lin (x 1, x 2) ≡ −0.3 ≤ x 1 ≤ 0.3.
When using the Gaussian kernel), the resulting radial basis function (rbf) model is able to represent the target property well locally unless (a) the noise component is too large and (b) the variation of the target property is too high relative to the number of training points. The second restriction is because the rbfs have non-negligible values only within a small region around the training examples. Consequently, the discovered DA is not only restricted in x 2 -direction but also excludes high absolute x 1 -values: σ rbf ≡ −3.3 ≤ x 11 ≤ 3.1 ∧ x 2 ≤ 0.1.
In contrast, when using the non-local third-degree polynomial (poly) kernel, data sparsity does not prevent an accurate modeling of the target property along the x 1 -axis. However, this non-locality is counterproductive along the x 2 -axis where overfitting of the noise component has a global influence that results in higher prediction errors for the almost deterministic data points with low x 2 -values. This is reflected in the identified DA σ poly (x 1, x 2) ≡ −3.5 ≤ x 2 ≤ 0.1, which contains no restriction in x 1 -direction, but excludes both high and low x 2 -values. This highlights an important structural difference between the rbf and the polynomial model that is not reflected in their similar average errors.

### State estimation of a physical system with unknown governing equations [^794152e0]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

State estimation is concerned with reconciling noisy observations of a physical system with the mathematical model believed to predict its behaviour for the purpose of inferring unmeasurable states and denoising measurable ones 1,2. Traditional state-estimation techniques rely on strong assumptions about the form of uncertainty in mathematical models, typically that it manifests as an additive stochastic perturbation or is parametric in nature 3. Here we present a reparametrization trick for stochastic variational inference with Markov Gaussian processes that enables an approximate Bayesian approach for state estimation in which the equations governing how the system evolves over time are partially or completely unknown. In contrast to classical state-estimation techniques, our method learns the missing terms in the mathematical model and a state estimate simultaneously from an approximate Bayesian perspective. This development enables the application of state-estimation methods to problems that have so far proved to be beyond reach. Finally, although we focus on state estimation, the advancements to stochastic variational inference made here are applicable to a broader class of problems in machine learning.

a Check of the stationary covariance approximation (i.e.): comparison between ψ π (t) = Var(x π (t)) measured in numerical simulations (symbols) and ψ (t) (dashed line: H = 3/8, full line H = 1/4). b Check of Eq. (9): comparison between the value m π (t) in simulations (symbols) and x 0 ϕ (t) (full line: x 0 = l /2 for H = 3/8; dashed line x 0 = l for H = 1/4). Note that m π (t) ≃ x 0 ϕ (t) is expected at large times only. c Check of the short-time scaling regime for H = 3/8. d Check of the long-time scaling regime (11) for H = 3/8. In a, c, d, the initial position is drawn from an equilibrium distribution, corresponding to our predictions for x 0 = 0. When present, error bars represent 68% confidence intervals.

General results

This approach first shows unambiguously that the mean FPT is finite. Indeed, we show in SI (Section B) that the solution to Eq. (8) satisfies at long timeswhich can be checked directly in numerical simulations, see figure 4b. This scaling, together with Eq. (6), shows that the mean FPT is finite. This contradicts the results obtained with the generalized Fokker–Planck equationor with the Wilemski-Fixman approximation. The latter amounts to assuming that the process is at all times in an equilibrium state, and would thus yield m π (t) ≃ L ϕ (t), leading to an infinite mean FPT when α < 1 (as noted earlier in a similar, but out of equilibrium, situation). Beyond this proof of finiteness, our approach yields a quantitative determination of 〈 T 〉 by solving numerically the integral equation (8) for m π (t) and next using Eq. (6); this shows quantitative agreement with numerical simulations in Fig. 3.

### Nonlinear delay differential equations and their application to modeling biological network motifs [^488abf14]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Chaotic behaviors are prevented in monotonic regulation with linear or cyclic network topology

Due to cyclic network topology (no more than one loop) and monotonic regulation, none of the motifs so far can yield chaotic dynamics. Either non-monotonic feedback (as in the Mackey-Glass equation) or non-cyclic topologyis required for chaos. Double feedback (Fig. 8 a) is a minimal motif fulfilling both requirements, although the non-monotonicity is sufficient (Supplementary Note 8).

The governing equation for such a double feedback motif is thus given by setting the output and both inputs of the logic equation (Eq. (19)) to X (and letting K = 1 for simplicity):

Chaotic behavior is possible for non-monotonic feedback with multiple feedback and disparate delays

Simulation of Eq. (37) demonstrates chaos for some parameters of positive/negative mixed feedback, as evidenced by sustained oscillations with variable maxima (Fig. 8 b), occupying an apparently fractal region in phase space (Fig. 8 c), and a large number of peaks in frequency space (Fig. 8 d). To confirm that the dynamics are in fact chaotic, we calculated the dominant Lyapunov exponent using the Wolf method(see "Methods"), finding a positive (i.e. chaotic) value of 0.0040 ± 0.00055 bits (mean ± standard deviation). We also calculated the box dimension of a reconstructed phase space with coordinates (X (T), X (T − 10), X (T − 20)) used by the Wolf method, yielding fractional dimension ~1.81, with 95% confidence interval (1.76, 1.87). These results indicate chaos (see Supplementary Fig. 4).

### Diffuse X-ray scattering from correlated motions in a protein crystal [^74e632dc]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Internal protein dynamics simulation

Internal dynamics simulations and model refinement were performed in Matlab. The dynamics of lysozyme within the crystal environment were simulated using an all-atom elastic network where each residue was restrained to move as a rigid body, and lattice contacts were explicitly modeled. To generate the model, first the atoms with alternate conformers were assigned to their occupancy-weighted average positions. Then, springs were created between any pair of non-H protein atoms belonging to different residues within a cutoff distance of 4 Å. Intermolecular springs were modeled between atoms in the protein and those of its neighbors in the lattice within the 4 Å cutoff distance. All springs were of the directional type (Eq. (6)).

The equations of motion for a single unit cell were solved using the Born/Von-Karman method as described for the lattice dynamics simulation, above, except that the potential energy function was modified in order to remove those modes associated with rigid-body motion of the entire protein. This was done by assigning the component of displacement associated with such motions a restoring force of zero. The normal modes associated with rigid-body displacements then have eigenvalues of zero and are eliminated during generalized inversion of the dynamical matrix (discussed in Section 3.3 of the Supplementary Methods). More specifically, components of the Hessian matrix (Equation 45 in the Supplementary Methods) were modified as follows:where P is an operator that projects out the rigid-body component of displacement, I is a 6 m × 6 m identity matrix (m = 129 is the number of residues), A is a 3 n × 6 m matrix (n is the number of atoms in the protein) that transforms between the Cartesian atomic displacement coordinates, u, and the generalized coordinates of the internal dynamics model (Equation 43 in the Supplementary Methods), A 0 is a 3 n × 6 matrix that transforms between u and the generalized coordinates of the lattice dynamics model, and the forward slash signifies left matrix division (if X = A \ A 0, then X is the least squares solution to the system of equations AX = A 0).

### Phase 0 / microdosing approaches: time for mainstream application in drug development? [^98d5620b]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Phase 0 approaches - which include microdosing - evaluate subtherapeutic exposures of new drugs in first-in-human studies known as exploratory clinical trials. Recent progress extends phase 0 benefits beyond assessment of pharmacokinetics to include understanding of mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Phase 0 approaches have the potential to improve preclinical candidate selection and enable safer, cheaper, quicker and more informed developmental decisions. Here, we discuss phase 0 methods and applications, highlight their advantages over traditional strategies and address concerns related to extrapolation and developmental timelines. Although challenges remain, we propose that phase 0 approaches be at least considered for application in most drug development scenarios.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^945666c0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cancer cluster investigation — Step 2 decision to close or proceed to Step 3 is based on multiple factors, and to interpret the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) the health agency must assess whether there are enough cases and population for statistical stability and, in general, that the population size of a typical census tract is the smallest denominator that will allow reliable results; if the numerator allows stability, agencies should consider whether the 95% CI exclude 1.0, along with environmental contaminants, population changes, and other information beyond the SIR to estimate whether cancers represent an excess and share a common etiology. A SIR of limited magnitude that is not statistically significant with lack of known contaminant association and no increasing trend justifies closing at Step 2, whereas a statistically significant SIR of great magnitude with an increasing trend and a known contaminant argues for continuing to Step 3; example thresholds indicate that an SIR of < 2.0 with CIs surrounding or overlapping 1.0 and < 10 cases might justify closing, while an SIR of > 4 with CIs not overlapping 1.0 and ≥ 10 etiologically linked cases should encourage advancing to Step 3.

In samples with normal triglyceride levels, it yields similar results to Martin/Hopkins at low LDL-C, but additional data in individuals with low LDL-C are needed before it can be more generally recommended for LDL-C calculation.

### Role of apolipoprotein B in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in adults: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^d0699442]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) measurement approaches — LDL-C can be measured with beta-quantification after ultracentrifugation, which is the "gold standard", but this is cumbersome, time-consuming, and not widely available; therefore, in routine practice LDL-C is estimated by equations. The Friedewald formula is LDL-C (mg/dL) = total cholesterol − HDL-C − (TG/5) and assumes a fasting sample, using TG/5 to estimate very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; however, because VLDL lipid content is variable, fixed TG:cholesterol ratio methods can be unreliable, especially with hypertriglyceridemia and/or low LDL-C. Newer equations include the Martin–Hopkins method, LDL-C = total cholesterol − HDL-C − (TG/adjustable factor), and the Sampson–National Institutes of Health (NIH) equation, LDL-C = total cholesterol/0.948 − HDL-C/0.971 − (TG/8.56 + TG × non-HDL-C/2140 − TG²/16,100) − 9.44; using the Martin–Hopkins estimate resolves some of the discordance between apoB and a Friedewald calculated LDL-C, although discordance between apoB and LDL-C still frequently occurs.

### Inferring time derivatives including cell growth rates using gaussian processes [^b5444dae]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Methods

Using a Gaussian process to fit time-series data

In the following, we will denote a Gaussian distribution with mean μ and covariance matrix Σ as(μ, Σ) and use the notation of Rasmussen and Williamsas much as possible.

Prior probability

where the expectations are taken over the distribution of latent functions (samples of f (x)).

### Spin dephasing under nonlinear gradients: implications for imaging and field mapping [^eaf2803c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This work examines the prototypical MR echo that would be expected for a voxel of spins evolving in a strong nonlinear field, specifically focusing on the quadratic z² − ½(x² + y²) field. Dephasing under nonlinear gradients is increasingly relevant given the growing interest in nonlinear imaging, and here, we report several notable differences from the linear case. Most notably, in addition to signal loss, intravoxel dephasing under gradients creating a wide and asymmetric frequency distribution across the voxel can cause skewed and nonlinear phase evolution. After presenting the qualitative and analytical origins of this difference, we experimentally demonstrate that neglecting these dynamics can lead to significant errors in sequences that assume phase evolution is proportional to voxel frequency, such as those used for field mapping. Finally, simplifying approximations to the signal equations are presented, which not only provide more intuitive forms of the exact expression but also result in simple rules to predict key features of the nonlinear evolution.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^32a698ea]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline methodology — evidence selection prioritized acceptable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effectiveness, with prophylaxis populations excluding those who had reported COVID-19 infection; if acceptable RCTs were found, no additional non-randomized or non-comparative single-arm evidence was sought, while single-arm data were included only when a historical control event rate could be estimated and conflicts were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Reviewers used a standardized form to extract data, calculating risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous outcomes calculated either mean and standard deviation or standard mean difference; where applicable, data were pooled using a random effects model, with a fixed effects model for two or fewer trials or pooling of rates, and results were presented in RevMan forest plots. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; within GRADE, certainty could be reduced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias, and could be strengthened by large or very large effects, a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Outcomes used for decision-making may change as higher-quality direct evidence becomes available; for example, at the time of the first guideline clinical improvement outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation were not reported, only radiographic findings.

### Computational methods for the estimation of ideal current patterns in realistic human models [^2f5b4b1d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To introduce a method for the estimation of the ideal current patterns (ICP) that yield optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for realistic heterogeneous tissue models in MRI.

Theory and Methods

The ICP were calculated for different surfaces that resembled typical radiofrequency (RF) coil formers. We constructed numerical electromagnetic (EM) bases to accurately represent EM fields generated by RF current sources located on the current-bearing surfaces. Using these fields as excitations, we solved the volume integral equation and computed the EM fields in the sample. The fields were appropriately weighted to calculate the optimal SNR and the corresponding ICP. We demonstrated how to qualitatively use ICP to guide the design of a coil array to maximize SNR inside a head model.

Results

In agreement with previous analytic work, ICP formed large distributed loops for voxels in the middle of the sample and alternated between a single loop and a figure-eight shape for a voxel 3-cm deep in the sample's cortex. For the latter voxel, a surface quadrature loop array inspired by the shape of the ICP reached 87.5% of the optimal SNR at 3T, whereas a single loop placed above the voxel reached only 55.7% of the optimal SNR. At 7T, the performance of the two designs decreased to 79.7% and 49.8%, respectively, suggesting that loops could be suboptimal at ultra-high field MRI.

Conclusion

ICP can be calculated for human tissue models, potentially guiding the design of application-specific RF coil arrays.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) regression-based mapping to LDL-C — Using the regression equations, the predicted average apoB corresponding to LDL-C thresholds of 55 mg/dL, 70 mg/dL, and 100 mg/dL are 62 mg/dL, 73 mg/dL, and 94 mg/dL for treated individuals. In an analysis of 11 clinical trials (n = 9 statin monotherapy; n = 2 statin + ezetimibe), LDL-lowering therapy reduced apoB by a mean of 33% compared with 42% for LDL-C. Excess apoB was associated in a dose-dependent manner with higher risk for incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and this increase in risk associated with discordantly high apoB was present across the spectrum of LDL-C concentrations.

Results of the one-man out analysis

2. The regression analysis produced a predictive equation model that can be used to estimate probe scores:
1 Probe = Y intercept+ (slope * GM value)
2 Example: Right: Y = –21.2+ (32.93*X); Left: Y = –15.19 + (28.88*X)
3 The correlation between the probe scores and GM values was calculated for the right and left EC.
4 Example: Right: r = 0.903; Left: r = 0.884

3. Depending on the analysis, the correlation between GM in the EC and probe scores was stronger in either the right or left. As such, these correlation values were used to weight the predicted probe scores.

Example: Right: r = 0.51; Left: r = 0.49

4. The GM values of the missing participant at those peak coordinates were then determined by looking at the extracted GM map of the individual.

Example: Right: 0.78; Left: 0.82

5. These GM values were inserted into the regression equation and a probe score was estimated.

Example: Right: 5.05 = –21.2 + (32.93*0.78); Left: 8.42 = –15.19 + (28.88*0.82)

6. A weighted predicted probe score for the left and right EC was calculated by multiplying the predicted probe score with the weighted correlation value.

Example: Right: 2.55 = 0.505 * 5.05; Left: 4.16 = 0.495 * 8.42

The model on the left incorporates no explicit delay terms, whereas the model on the right incorporates explicit delay terms τ x and τ z. b Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and delay differential equations (DDEs) corresponding to (a) with regulation strengths α i, removal rates β i and cooperativities n i. c Numerical simulations of equations in (b) for one set of initial conditions using parameters α x = 1, α y = 1.2, α z = 1.2, β x = β y = β z = 1, n x = n y = n z = 2 for the ODE simulation, and α x = 0.5, α z = 0.3529, β x = β z = 0.5, n x = n z = 2 for the DDE simulations (dashed curves: τ x = 0.8, τ z = 0.1; solid curves: τ x = 3, τ z = 4). Note that delays can cause more complex dynamics (e.g. transient oscillations) compared to models in which effects are instantaneous, and where both models give the same long-term steady state behavior. Left: instantaneous effects modeled using ODEs, Right: delayed effects modeled using DDEs.

### A model to predict survival in patients with end-stage liver disease [^c686fc48]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na)" for hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic encephalopathy, portopulmonary hypertension, hepatorenal syndrome, variceal hemorrhage, ascites, portal hypertension, liver transplantation, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, acute-on-chronic liver failure, acute liver failure, alcohol-related liver disease and liver cirrhosis.

The MELD-Na (UNOS/OPTN) score is used to estimate the severity of chronic liver disease and prioritize liver transplant candidates. It incorporates sodium levels, creatinine, bilirubin, and INR to assess short-term mortality risk. The formula includes adjustments for patients on dialysis and limits the score between 6 and 40

The MELD-Na calculator is utilized to evaluate the severity of liver disease and estimate mortality risk by using key laboratory values and clinical factors. It outputs a MELD-Na Score which is associated with a specific mortality risk percentage. Here's how the process works:

Input Data:

- Serum creatinine level, which can be in mg/dL (0 to 20) or converted from µmol/L (0 to 1768).
- Total bilirubin level, reported in mg/dL (0 to 50) or converted from µmol/L (0 to 855).
- International Normalized Ratio (INR), ranging from 0 to 10.
- Serum sodium level in either mEq/L or mmol/L, ranging from 100 to 180.
- Dialysis status in the past 7 days, which is a simple "Yes" or "No".

Computation Steps:

- First, if creatinine and bilirubin are provided in µmol/L, conversion to mg/dL is performed by dividing the creatinine value by 88.4 and bilirubin by 17.1.
- Then, initial adjustments are made where the minimum acceptable values for creatinine, bilirubin, and INR are set to 1.0. For creatinine, if the patient has undergone dialysis or the creatinine level exceeds 4.0 mg/dL, the value is restricted to a maximum of 4.0 mg/dL.
- Serum sodium levels are modified to ensure they fall within the 125 to 137 mEq/L range.
- The initial MELD score, termed MELD(i), is calculated using the formula:
0.957 × ln(creatinine) + 0.378 × ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 × ln(INR) + 0.643
This score is then multiplied by 10 and rounded.
- If the MELD(i) score exceeds 11, a sodium adjustment is applied to obtain the MELD-Na score:
MELD-Na = MELD(i) + 1.32 × (137 − sodium) − (0.033 × MELD(i) × (137 − sodium))
- The resulting MELD-Na score is capped at a maximum value of 40 to prevent excessively high values.

Interpreting the Results:

- A MELD-Na score of 9 or less indicates a low mortality risk of 1.9%.
- Scores between 10 and 19 suggest a moderate risk with a mortality rate of 6.0%.
- For scores between 20 and 29, the mortality risk increases to 19.6%.
- A score in the range of 30 to 39 corresponds to a substantial risk of 52.6%.
- Finally, a MELD-Na score of 40 or greater reflects the highest mortality risk at 71.3%.

By following these steps, the calculator systematically provides an objective assessment of liver disease severity and correlates it with associated mortality risks, aiding clinicians in clinical decision-making.

### Utilization of ST-segment deviation sum and change scores to identify acute myocardial infarction [^357a08e8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

No information is currently available regarding the optimal cutoff values of the baseline ST-segment deviation sum (STDsum(baseline)) and 60-minute ST-segment deviation change (STDchange(60 min)) for predicting acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Methods

A retrospective study was performed in 783 admitted patients with chest pain who had suspected acute coronary syndrome and absence of left ventricular hypertrophy or bundle branch block on the initial electrocardiogram (ECG). The STDsum(baseline) was defined as the sum in millimeters (1 mm = 0.1 mV) of the absolute value of ST-segment deviations in all 12 leads at the initiation of continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring session. The STDchange(60 min) was defined as the absolute value of the difference between the baseline and 60-minute STDsum. Three cutoff values are reported and represent the smallest values in which the positive likelihood ratio (+LR) for AMI was greater than or equal to 5, 10, and 20, respectively.

Results

Acute myocardial infarction occurred in 162 (20.7%) patients. The smallest cutoff value of the STDsum(baseline) for AMI with a +LR equal to or greater than 5, 10, and 20 was 9.6, 12.4, and 14.1 mm, respectively. In the subset of 699 patients without ST-segment elevation AMI on initial ECG, the smallest cutoff value of the STDchange(60 min) for AMI with a +LR equal to or greater than 5, 10, and 20 was 2.4, 3.5, and 7.9 mm, respectively.

Conclusions

Clinical studies need to be performed to determine if STDsum and STDchange, in conjunction with physician pretest probability of AMI, can be used to select patients who may benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy and other aggressive medical management strategies.

### Residential mobility and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: an ecological study [^633450d2]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

These variables and all possible two-way interactions among them were included in an initial model with multiple explanatory variables. The multivariate models had the form:where Y cr is the rate of childhood ALL for some stratum for race r of county c, x r is a Boolean which is true when the county–race–sex stratum is of race r, x ci is the value of the explanatory variable being examined for county c for some explanatory variable i (other than race), and every β and γ is a coefficient, each γ specifically for an interaction term. (The data are arranged such that there are separate values of observed cases and PYAR for each combination of race and sex in each county.) For both sexes, the variables used were race (black vs non-black; 'other' race was insignificant), proportion moved (linear, quadratic, and cubic terms), and proportion of households with income ⩾$5000. Successive multivariate models were then constructed for each sex by creating a new set of models, each of which lacked one of the variables of the original model, and choosing the model with the smallest deviance and of which the fit was not statistically and significantly worse (judged by the likelihood ratio test) than the original model; the chosen model became the new 'original' model and the cycle repeated until all derived models were worse than the 'original' model (essentially this is a variant on backwards step-wise selection). Finally, any interactions still present, which were based on small numbers, were dropped.

To assist interpretation, effects of continuous variables (linear, quadratic, or cubic terms) have not been tabulated but instead recategorised into strata in the results (certain results will not make sense unless this is borne in mind). For the variables not included in the final, multivariate model, quartiles weighted by PYAR were used; variables incorporated in the final multivariate model were rendered dichotomous.

### Daily steps and all-cause mortality: a meta-analysis of 15 international cohorts [^f043ba51]. The Lancet: Public Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Although 10000 steps per day is widely promoted to have health benefits, there is little evidence to support this recommendation. We aimed to determine the association between number of steps per day and stepping rate with all-cause mortality.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, we identified studies investigating the effect of daily step count on all-cause mortality in adults (aged ≥ 18 years), via a previously published systematic review and expert knowledge of the field. We asked participating study investigators to process their participant-level data following a standardised protocol. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality collected from death certificates and country registries. We analysed the dose-response association of steps per day and stepping rate with all-cause mortality. We did Cox proportional hazards regression analyses using study-specific quartiles of steps per day and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) with inverse-variance weighted random effects models.

Findings

We identified 15 studies, of which seven were published and eight were unpublished, with study start dates between 1999 and 2018. The total sample included 47471 adults, among whom there were 3013 deaths (10.1 per 1000 participant-years) over a median follow-up of 7.1 years ([IQR 4.3–9.9]; total sum of follow-up across studies was 297837 person-years). Quartile median steps per day were 3553 for quartile 1, 5801 for quartile 2, 7842 for quartile 3, and 10901 for quartile 4. Compared with the lowest quartile, the adjusted HR for all-cause mortality was 0.60 (95% CI 0.51–0.71) for quartile 2, 0.55 (0.49–0.62) for quartile 3, and 0.47 (0.39–0.57) for quartile 4. Restricted cubic splines showed progressively decreasing risk of mortality among adults aged 60 years and older with increasing number of steps per day until 6000–8000 steps per day and among adults younger than 60 years until 8000–10000 steps per day. Adjusting for number of steps per day, comparing quartile 1 with quartile 4, the association between higher stepping rates and mortality was attenuated but remained significant for a peak of 30 min (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.56–0.83]) and a peak of 60 min (0.67 [0.50–0.90]), but not significant for time (min per day) spent walking at 40 steps per min or faster (1.12 [0.96–1.32]) and 100 steps per min or faster (0.86 [0.58–1.28]).

Interpretation

Taking more steps per day was associated with a progressively lower risk of all-cause mortality, up to a level that varied by age. The findings from this meta-analysis can be used to inform step guidelines for public health promotion of physical activity.

### A simple risk score accurately predicts in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and cost in acute upper GI bleeding [^2b4d4a14]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "AIMS65 score for upper GI bleeding mortality" for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

The AIMS65 score is a clinical calculator used to predict mortality in patients with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The acronym AIMS65 stands for Albumin, International normalized ratio (INR), altered Mental status, Systolic blood pressure, and age 65 years or older. Each of these five factors is assigned one point, and the total score ranges from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of mortality.

This scoring system is applicable to patients presenting with upper GI bleeding, regardless of the cause. It is particularly useful in the emergency department or inpatient setting to stratify patients based on their risk of mortality, which can guide management decisions such as the need for hospital admission, intensive care, or urgent endoscopy.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the AIMS65 score. However, it may be less accurate in patients with lower GI bleeding or in those with non-bleeding upper GI disorders. It should also be used with caution in patients with chronic liver disease, as the INR may be elevated in these patients independent of their bleeding risk.

The AIMS65 Score is a tool designed to assess the risk of in-hospital mortality for patients experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This assessment is based on evaluating five specific factors or clinical criteria, each contributing to the total score:

- Albumin level less than 3 g/dL (30 g/L)
- INR (International Normalized Ratio) greater than 1.5
- Presence of altered mental status
- Systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg
- Age 65 years or older

For each criterion met, a score of 1 is assigned. If any of these criteria aren't met, the score for that factor is 0. Once all the criteria are evaluated, the scores are summed to provide a total score ranging from 0 to 5. This total reflects the patient's risk of in-hospital mortality, with interpretation as follows:

- A total score of 0 correlates to a 0.3% risk of in-hospital mortality.
- A score of 1 indicates a 1.2% risk.
- A score of 2 corresponds to a 2.8% risk.
- A score of 3 signifies an 8.5% risk.
- A score of 4 suggests a 15.1% risk.
- A score of 5 indicates a 24.5% risk.

This scoring system helps healthcare providers determine the severity of a patient's condition and the associated risk of mortality, facilitating informed clinical decisions. The evaluation is carried out by assessing whether each of the five factors is present or absent, computing a total score based on these assessments, and interpreting this score using predefined mortality risk percentages.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^9509c890]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Step counts (based on increments of 500 steps) to accumulate in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps by the end of the day

Details on how these recommendations were derived are provided in the Supplementary Method.

*Same as the "Overall" group.

The step counts required in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps among participants aged 17–59 were similar but were generally more than those required for participants aged 60 and above (Table 3). There were also differences in the step counts required in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps among participants with BMI less than 27.5 kg/m² on weekdays.

Across different demographics, participants aged between 30 and 39 who had accumulated fewer than 7500 steps between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day compared to participants aged 60 and above (Supplementary Fig. S6). Males who had accumulated fewer than 5000 steps between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day compared to females on weekdays, and no sex differences among those who accumulated 5000 steps or more. Participants with normal BMI were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day on weekdays, but they could also have higher mean step counts on weekends compared to participants with obese BMI. The mean step difference between participants with normal BMI and participants with obese BMI decreased with time, with little difference at 10 p.m.
