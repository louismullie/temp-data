## Question

At what age do we stop mammograms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to stop screening mammography in older women and how to frame that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline positions and where they converge or diverge. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for women 75 years and older, especially whether randomized trials exist. Next, I will examine observational and modeling data to estimate benefits and harms beyond 75. After that, I need to check how life expectancy modifies benefit and how to operationalize a 10-year life expectancy threshold. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and a shared decision-making approach, while double-checking for any conflicting data I might be overlooking.

> Let me first confirm the guideline landscape so I don't jump to conclusions. The USPSTF gives a B recommendation for biennial screening ages 40–74 and an I statement for women 75 and older, reflecting insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening beyond 74, which is a key anchor for shared decision-making rather than a blanket stop rule [^111v445a]. The American Cancer Society advises continuing screening as long as overall health is good and life expectancy is at least 10 years, explicitly rejecting age-alone cessation and emphasizing individualized decisions beyond 75 [^111FYQwv]. ACOG recommends screening at least through age 75 and then individualizing beyond that based on health status and longevity, again avoiding a fixed stop age [^111VgZPM]. The ACR and Society of Breast Imaging support continuing screening past 74 without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy, aligning with a more permissive stance for healthy older women [^111BpqKv]. Hold on, I should verify that these are the most current statements; yes, these reflect the 2024 USPSTF update and contemporary ACS and ACOG positions [^1164hhhG] [^111FYQwv] [^111VgZPM].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence gap for women 75 and older before inferring benefit. There are no randomized controlled trials of screening mammography that enrolled women 75 years or older, so the highest-quality trial evidence is absent for this exact question, which is why USPSTF issues an I statement and why recommendations must rely on observational data, modeling, and extrapolation from younger cohorts [^111v445a] [^116V11Pj]. I should double-check whether any emulated trials or large observational studies inform this; yes, a Medicare emulation found no mortality benefit to continuing screening from 75–84 compared with stopping, whereas modeling studies have suggested potential benefit, highlighting the uncertainty and the need to individualize decisions [^115uzzRT] [^115aqSdB].

> Next, I should review the magnitude of potential benefit and harms beyond 75 to frame counseling. Modeling estimates suggest that continuing screening in women 75 and older can avert a small number of breast cancer deaths but increases false positives and overdiagnosis; for example, five additional screens over 10 years in healthy 75-year-olds may avert roughly 4–15 breast cancer deaths per 1000 while yielding 238–268 false positives and 29–31% overdiagnosis, with diminishing returns at older ages and with comorbidity [^112qQ9fy]. Observational syntheses report mixed mortality signals and consistent increases in overdiagnosis with screening beyond 75, reinforcing that the balance of benefits and harms shifts with age and health status [^111v3nt8] [^114pDRPE]. Hold on, I should verify that these harms are not trivial; false positives and overdiagnosis can lead to invasive procedures, anxiety, and overtreatment, which carry higher risks in older adults, so patient values are crucial here [^112jtt4w].

> I need to ensure I'm applying the right decision threshold. The most consistently endorsed clinical criterion is a 10-year life expectancy: if life expectancy is under 10 years, the time-to-benefit for screening is unlikely to be realized, and harms likely predominate; if life expectancy is 10 years or more, screening may be reasonable depending on preferences and health status [^111FYQwv] [^111VgZPM]. Let me consider how this translates at the bedside: approximately 50% of 80-year-old women and 25% of 85-year-old women have a 10-year life expectancy, so many women in their late 70s to early 80s still meet this threshold, whereas most women older than 85–90 do not, though exceptions exist in the healthiest quartiles [^116ZTVC4]. I should confirm that tools like ePrognosis can help estimate life expectancy objectively to support these discussions [^116FTBAX].

> But wait, what if a healthy 75-year-old wants to continue annual screening rather than biennial? Does that change the calculus? Annual screening increases detection and may modestly increase mortality reduction at the cost of more false positives and overdiagnosis; modeling and radiology society guidance suggest that annual screening can be offered to women who prioritize maximizing benefit and accept more recalls, whereas biennial screening is more efficient at the population level and may better balance benefits and harms for many older women [^115aqSdB] [^111BpqKv]. I should double-check that this aligns with patient preference discussions; yes, shared decision-making should explicitly weigh these trade-offs, including anxiety from callbacks and the possibility of treating indolent disease [^112jtt4w].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I will now examine how to operationalize it. For women aged 75 and older, I should confirm health status and estimate life expectancy; if life expectancy is less than 10 years, I recommend stopping screening and pivoting to comfort-focused and geriatric-preventive priorities, explaining that the lag to benefit exceeds expected survival and that harms are more likely [^111FYQwv] [^111VgZPM]. If life expectancy is 10 years or more, I should offer screening with a discussion of frequency, acknowledging that biennial screening is reasonable and efficient, while annual screening is acceptable if the patient values marginal gains and accepts more false positives and potential overdiagnosis; this is a shared decision, not a mandate [^1164hhhG] [^111BpqKv]. Hold on, I should verify that stopping rules are framed gently; using decision aids and clear communication about overdiagnosis can improve informed choice and reduce unnecessary screening in those unlikely to benefit [^114DRF5j] [^1145fCq1].

> I should confirm special situations. For women with significant comorbidity or frailty, even if age is under 85, life expectancy may be under 10 years, so stopping screening is appropriate. Conversely, exceptionally healthy women in their early 80s may still have a 10-year life expectancy and could reasonably continue screening if they value potential benefit more than harms [^116ZTVC4]. For breast cancer survivors, surveillance mammography decisions should also be individualized by life expectancy, with many experts recommending cessation when life expectancy is under 5–10 years, while continuing for those with longer expected survival and higher in-breast event risk, again via shared decision-making [^116FSUVt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied there is a hard stop at 75. That would be misleading. There is no universal age cutoff endorsed by major U.S. guidelines, and authoritative bodies explicitly reject age-alone cessation, so the decision must be individualized to health, comorbidity, and preferences rather than a calendar age [^111VgZPM] [^111FYQwv]. I should double-check that this nuance is clear: the USPSTF I statement is not a recommendation to stop; it is a call for individualized decisions in the absence of trial evidence, which is why many clinicians use the 10-year life expectancy framework to guide discussions [^111v445a].

> Final check and bottom line: Do not stop mammograms based on age alone. Stop when life expectancy is under 10 years or when severe comorbidity limits benefit, and for women 75 and older with 10 or more years of life expectancy, offer screening with a conversation about biennial versus annual intervals, potential false positives, and overdiagnosis, documenting shared decision-making and patient values to guide continuation or cessation [^111FYQwv] [^111VgZPM].

There is **no fixed age to stop mammograms**; decisions should be individualized based on health status and life expectancy [^111VgZPM]. Most guidelines recommend continuing screening **as long as the woman is in good health and has a life expectancy of at least 10 years** [^111FYQwv] [^115wE8Lp]. The USPSTF gives an **I statement** for women ≥ 75 due to insufficient evidence, so shared decision-making is essential [^111v445a]. ACOG advises screening at least to age 75, then individualized decisions thereafter [^114L13HJ] [^111VgZPM]. Stop screening when life expectancy is < 10 years or when severe comorbidities limit benefit [^116FTBAX] [^112MVT8d].

## Evidence on benefits and harms of screening in older women

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **early detection** of smaller, lower-stage cancers, enabling less invasive treatment and reduced morbidity and mortality [^116bMxHF] [^117LfpNJ]. Observational data suggest a **mortality reduction** with regular screening in healthy older women [^116bMxHF] [^116FTBAX].

---

### Harms

- **False positives**: Increased risk of false positives, biopsies, and anxiety [^116FTBAX] [^112jtt4w].
- **Overdiagnosis**: Higher risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, especially with limited life expectancy [^116FTBAX] [^111v3nt8].
- **Physical/psychological**: Potential harms from unnecessary procedures and treatments [^116FTBAX] [^113d36kB].

---

## Factors influencing the decision to stop screening

- **Life expectancy**: Key determinant; ≥ 10 years supports continued screening [^111FYQwv] [^111VgZPM].
- **Comorbidities**: Severe comorbidities or functional limitations may outweigh benefits [^1164hhhG] [^115CDdsy].
- **Patient preferences**: Values and preferences should guide decisions [^111VgZPM] [^114PTzJb].
- **Health status**: Overall health and functional status inform benefit-harm balance [^116FTBAX] [^111VgZPM].

---

## Clinical evidence on stopping screening at specific ages

- **Age 75**: No clear mortality benefit to continuing beyond 75 in all women; individualize decisions [^115uzzRT] [^111VgZPM].
- **Age 80**: Many women have < 10-year life expectancy; screening often stops unless exceptional health [^116ZTVC4] [^116FTBAX].
- **Age 85**: Generally recommended to stop due to limited life expectancy and increased harms [^116FTBAX] [^112MVT8d].

---

## Shared decision-making and patient counseling

Shared decision-making is essential to discuss **benefits, harms, and preferences** and to align screening decisions with patient values and goals [^114PTzJb] [^116FTBAX]. Decision aids can improve **informed decision-making** and help patients weigh trade-offs [^114DRF5j].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Continue screening**: For women in good health with ≥ 10-year life expectancy [^111FYQwv] [^112SjnVL].
- **Individualize decisions**: Base on comorbidities, functional status, and preferences [^116bMxHF] [^111VgZPM].
- **Stop screening**: When life expectancy < 10 years or severe comorbidities limit benefit [^116FTBAX] [^112MVT8d].
- **Annual vs biennial**: Annual may benefit highest-risk women; biennial reduces harms [^1152SscC] [^115aqSdB].

---

There is **no fixed age to stop mammograms**; decisions should be individualized based on health, comorbidities, and preferences, with screening continued as long as life expectancy is ≥ 10 years and stopped when severe comorbidities or limited life expectancy make harms outweigh benefits [^111FYQwv] [^111VgZPM] [^111BpqKv].

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^113GNvjf]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening — women at average risk: The ACS endorses beginning annual screening mammography at age 45 years and transitioning to biennial screening at age 55 years, while retaining the option to continue annual screening. The guideline development committee (GDC) recommends that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually, that women aged 40 to 44 years who choose to be screened should do so annually, and that women aged 55 and older should transition to biennial screening but also have the opportunity to continue screening annually. The GDC concluded that women aged 40 to 44 years should have the choice to begin screening mammography at age 40 years or before age 45 years, based on their preferences and their consideration of the trade-offs.

Screening

The US Preventative Services Task Force guidelines do not recommend screening beyond the age of 74 years because of the scarcity of evidence from randomised controlled trials on the benefits of screening mammography in this older population. With the exception of the Swedish Two-County trial that invited women to screen every 33 months up to the age of 74 years, randomised controlled trials to date have not included women older than 70 years. However, there are compelling data on screening in older women from the American College of Radiology's National Mammography Database that show reductions in false positives and increases in both cancer detection rates and the positive predictive value of biopsies done at increased ages, even beyond the age of 90 years. Mammographically detected cancers in women aged 75 years or older were much more likely to be diagnosed at a lower stage in several studies: only 12% of those assessed were node-positive at diagnosis compared with 38% of those clinically detected in the series of Malmgren and colleagues, and 11% of older women with screen-detected cancers had axillary metastases, as reported by Destounis and colleagues.

There is an approximately 10-year delay in observing any benefit in breast cancer mortality from screening mammography. Instead of using 74 years of age as a screening termination target, national guidelines suggest stopping screening when the patient is no longer in good health (Society of Breast Imaging, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Society of Breast Surgeons) or has a life expectancy of less than 10 years (American Cancer Society). Even the healthiest quartile of women older than 85 years has less than 10 years of life expectancy. An analysis of outcomes in women older than 65 years found that, even after correcting for prognostic index and potential confounders, breast cancer screening was associated with reduced all-cause mortality. This screening benefit was attenuated but persisted in women with reduced cognition. The authors of this analysis suggest that current algorithms might misclassify individuals as having a low life expectancy, resulting in cessation of screening that is inappropriately premature. Similar to these national guidelines, EUSOMA–SIOG recommend stopping screening after 75 years of age.

Taken together, a detailed geriatric and life expectancy assessment in conjunction with patient preferences should guide decision making for continued screening. Clinicians should make every effort to rely on validated measures to estimate remaining life expectancy (eg, ePrognosis) and the potential benefits of continued screening. Screening after the age of 74 years can be effectively stopped, as per multiple society guidelines including the recent EUSOMA–SIOG recommendations.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111EN7pj]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Scope of review — To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the comparative effectiveness of mammography-based screening strategies by age to start and stop screening, screening interval, modality, use of supplemental imaging, or personalization, focusing on outcomes including progression to advanced breast cancer, morbidity, and breast cancer–specific or all-cause mortality. Inclusion required studies to report detection and stage distribution over more than 1 round of screening, and studies reporting only performance characteristics or detection rates were not eligible. The USPSTF also commissioned collaborative modeling from 4 CISNET teams that developed race-specific breast cancer models for Black women to provide information about effectiveness and harms of different screening strategies in Black women.

Implications for practice and research

Our findings may have different implications for practice depending on the age group, the balance between benefits and harms, available resources for public health services, and how women value the different outcomes. In the case of women invited to an opportunistic screening programme (or considering screening) a shared decision-making process to carefully explain the pros and cons of each decision is warranted. Similarly, given the low certainty of evidence and the variability and uncertainty of how women value outcomes at stake, guideline panellists are likely to formulate conditional recommendations, as opposed to strong ones. The scope of this review is determined by the European Breast Guidelines screening recommendations; thus, policy makers should note that we did not include modelling estimates for women between the ages of 40 and 44 as screening is not suggested in this age group. Also, readers should be careful when interpreting the effects of screening intervals across the different age groups, as comparisons are limited by the small number of screening rounds in the 45 to 49 and 70 to 74 age groups, compared to the 50–69 age group.

Recommendations about mammography screening intervals will also depend on the magnitude and relative importance of potential harms. Narayan, et al. assessed to what extent harms should decrease in order to make a screening interval with an unfavourable balance of benefits and harms acceptable. They found that for annual screening a reduction of 31% false positive results would be required to support a recommendation in favour of starting at 50, although this was in the context of false positive rates prevailing in the US. Policy makers should probably consider implementing interventions to improve mammography performance, mitigating concerns about potential harms. For example previous studies suggest that comparing mammograms with prior exams can significantly reduce the recall rate while maintaining the same detection rate.

Several research priorities were identified during this review, with feedback from the GDG experts, such as need for: (i) empirical research on the effectiveness of the different screening intervals due to the current very low certainty of evidence; ii) cost-effectiveness studies using unitary costs from different settings, and in particular for women aged 45 to 49, iii) assessment of alternative imaging modalities, iv) tailored screening according to risk vs population screening. For example, previous research has highlighted that breast density influences both mammography accuracy and risk of developing breast cancer.

### Effect of mammographic screening from age 40 years on breast cancer mortality (UK age trial): final results of a randomised, controlled trial [^1172CwFP]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The UK, along with many other countries, has a breast cancer screening programme offering mammography to women aged 50–70 years every 3 years. There remains uncertainty as to the appropriate age at which to start screening, specifically about whether to screen women younger than 50 years. Recommendations from official and charitable bodies vary. Mammographic screening in this age group presents a greater challenge than at older ages in both radiological and public health terms. First, the typical composition of the breast is more radiologically dense in younger women, reducing the sensitivity of mammography. Second, breast cancer incidence and mortality are lower in women younger than 50 years than in women aged 50 years and older, so the potential absolute gain from screening is lower. Third, there is evidence that tumours in younger women progress more rapidly, are more likely to be oestrogen receptor negative, and have unfavourable histological grade. Thus, there remains interest in the effects, both favourable and unfavourable, of mammography screening in women aged 40–49 years.

Two major UK studies of mammographic screening before 50 years of age are the AgeX trialof extending the screening age range to 47–73 years, and the UK Age trialof yearly screening from the age of 40 years. The AgeX trial is not expected to report results until 2026. The UK Age trial reported 17-year follow-up results in 2015, showing a reduction in breast cancer mortality with yearly screening from the age of 40 years, which was significant in the first 10 years after randomisation, and was attenuated thereafter. In this paper, we report on breast cancer incidence and mortality results in the UK Age trial after 23 years of follow-up.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed with no date or language restrictions with the search terms "breast" AND "screening" AND "mammography" AND "age" AND "trial". This search yielded eight trials. Results from all the trials (except the UK Age trial) included the effect of screening after participants younger than 50 years at randomisation reached age 50 years. In meta-analyses of these trials, Cochrane and US Preventive Services Task Force reviews found 13–16% reductions in breast cancer mortality with invitation to screening before age 50 years. There is considerable uncertainty about overdiagnosis of breast cancer in this age group, as previous estimates vary widely.

### Randomized trial of information for older women about cessation of breast cancer screening invitations [^1145fCq1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Older women receive no information about why Australia's breast screening program (BreastScreen) invitations cease after 74 years. We tested how providing older women with the rationale for breast screening cessation impacted informed choice (adequate knowledge; screening attitudes aligned with intention).

Methods

In a three-arm online randomized trial, eligible participants were females aged 70–74 years who had recently participated in breast screening (within 5 years), without personal breast cancer history, recruited through Qualtrics. Participants read a hypothetical scenario in which they received a BreastScreen letter reporting no abnormalities on their mammogram. They were randomized to receive the letter: (1) without any rationale for screening cessation (control); (2) with screening cessation rationale in printed-text form (e.g., downsides of screening outweigh the benefits after age 74); or (3) with screening cessation rationale presented in an animation video form. The primary outcome was informed choice about continuing/stopping breast screening beyond 74 years.

Results

A total of 376 participant responses were analyzed. Compared to controls (n = 122), intervention arm participants (text [n = 132] or animation [n = 122]) were more likely to make an informed choice (control 18.0%; text 32.6%, p = .010; animation 40.5%, p < .001). Intervention arm participants had more adequate knowledge (control 23.8%; text 59.8%, p < .001; animation 68.9%, p < .001), lower screening intentions (control 17.2%; text 36.4%, p < .001; animation 49.2%, p < .001), and fewer positive screening attitudes regarding screening for themselves in the animation arm, but not in the text arm (control 65.6%; text 51.5%, p = .023; animation 40.2%, p < .001).

Conclusions

Providing information to older women about the rationale for breast cancer screening cessation increased informed decision-making in a hypothetical scenario. This study is an important first step in improving messaging provided by national cancer screening providers direct to older adults. Further research is needed to assess the impact of different elements of the intervention and the impact of providing this information in clinical practice, with more diverse samples.

### Screening mammography: recommendations and controversies [^1172TJj1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past several years, there have been numerous changes in the guidelines for screening mammography. Additionally, different societies have released guidelines with variance in the recommendations of age to initiate and frequency of imaging. The current recommendations as well as the importance of screening mammography for early detection and survival are discussed.

### Screening for breast cancer in average-risk women: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^112MVT8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this guidance statement is to provide advice to clinicians on breast cancer screening in average-risk women based on a review of existing guidelines and the evidence they include.

Methods

This guidance statement is derived from an appraisal of selected guidelines from around the world that address breast cancer screening, as well as their included evidence. All national guidelines published in English between 1 January 2013 and 15 November 2017 in the National Guideline Clearinghouse or Guidelines International Network library were included. In addition, the authors selected other guidelines commonly used in clinical practice. Web sites associated with all selected guidelines were checked for updates on 10 December 2018. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the quality of guidelines.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is all asymptomatic women with average risk for breast cancer.

Guidance Statement 1

In average-risk women aged 40 to 49 years, clinicians should discuss whether to screen for breast cancer with mammography before age 50 years. Discussion should include the potential benefits and harms and a woman's preferences. The potential harms outweigh the benefits in most women aged 40 to 49 years.

Guidance Statement 2

In average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years, clinicians should offer screening for breast cancer with biennial mammography.

Guidance Statement 3

In average-risk women aged 75 years or older or in women with a life expectancy of 10 years or less, clinicians should discontinue screening for breast cancer.

Guidance Statement 4

In average-risk women of all ages, clinicians should not use clinical breast examination to screen for breast cancer.

### Factors associated with mammography screening choices by women aged 40–49 at average risk [^1158Mz3M]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend routine mammogram screening for women aged 40–49 years at average risk for breast cancer. We aimed to assess the extent to which women were following guideline recommendations and to examine whether guideline awareness and other individual-level factors were associated with adherence. Materials and Methods: We surveyed a nationally representative panel of 383 U.S. women aged 40–49 years at low risk for hereditary breast cancer in October 2019. Results: Only 29% of women reported not having initiated screening mammography. Most women (80%) were unaware of the USPSTF screening guideline related to age of initiation and frequency of mammography. Being aware of the recommendation to initiate screening at age 50 increased the odds of not initiating screening (odds ratio [OR] = 6.70, p < 0.001), whereas being older than 45 years (OR = 0.22, p < 0.001) and having a primary care doctor decreased the odds of not initiating screening (OR = 0.25, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Mammogram screening in excess of USPSTF recommendations is prevalent among U.S. women aged 40–49 years. Efforts are needed to increase women's awareness of the rationale for guidelines and the opportunities to discuss with providers whether delaying mammograms is appropriate.

### Should women under 50 be screened for breast cancer? [^1175eRpz]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Despite some controversy in recent years, the majority of experts agree on the evidence for effectiveness of breast screening by mammography for women aged 50 years and above, but for those under 50 years, the picture is much less clear. However, the issue remains of importance both to policy makers and to individual women; although the incidence of breast cancer is lower at younger ages, the life years lost due to cancers diagnosed below 50 years amount to a third of all those lost due to the disease.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112cjM3u]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Screening mammography mortality estimates by age — USPSTF evidence summarized relative risks of 0.85, 0.86, and 0.68 for women aged 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and 60 to 69 years, respectively. In a Swedish evaluation of counties inviting women in their 40s to screening vs not inviting, after an average 16 years of follow-up an overall 29% mortality reduction was observed (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.80), with 18% reduction for ages 40 to 44 and 23% for ages 45 to 49.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^115marp3]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite many studies having reported on outcomes of screening women aged 75 and older, findings from this systematic review highlight the limited evidence available from high quality studies to make a recommendation for or against continuing breast screening beyond the age of 75 years. Many of the comparisons used in published studies are not directly informative as far as benefit or harms associated with continuing to screen (as opposed to stopping) beyond 75. Further studies with more informative comparisons, specifically comparing continuing versus stopping screening at 75 years, are required before definitive recommendations can be made.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111v445a]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among all US women, breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death. In 2023, an estimated 43 170 women died of breast cancer. Non-Hispanic White women have the highest incidence of breast cancer and non-Hispanic Black women have the highest mortality rate.

Objective

The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different mammography-based breast cancer screening strategies by age to start and stop screening, screening interval, modality, use of supplemental imaging, or personalization of screening for breast cancer on the incidence of and progression to advanced breast cancer, breast cancer morbidity, and breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality, and collaborative modeling studies to complement the evidence from the review.

Population

Cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth aged 40 years or older at average risk of breast cancer.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 74 years has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer with breast ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of breast density.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram. (I statement).

### Evidence to support screening women annually [^111MkTCD]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Radiology, American Cancer Society, and US Preventive Services Task Force agree that mammography screening beginning at age 40 saves more lives than any other strategy. Despite these seemingly concordant summaries of the benefits of screening mammography, there are persistent debates regarding when to start and how often women should participate. Costs of screening, both monetary and personal, comprise the foundation of arguments against screening. This article specifically explores the evidence related to screening intervals and attempts to answer the question: should women be screened annually or biennially?

### Impact of age-specific recommendation changes on organized breast screening programs [^116qD3E5]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent changes in recommendations for mammography screening for women in their forties could have an impact on organized screening programs, as these require clear definition of target and eligible populations.

Current Status

Internationally, a majority of programs target women fifty and over, and so the recent USPSTF age recommendations for screening are quite consistent with this practice. However, there is a good deal of variability in the availability of population-based screening programs to women in their forties should they choose to participate.

Future Impact

Several programs are reviewing recommendations regarding the eligibility of women in their forties; as guidelines indicate women in this age group should be eligible for screening, even if not targeted, there is discussion as to whether they should be allowed in programs so that they benefit from the same programmatic quality assurance afforded to the target population of women over 50. Clear communication of the evidentiary basis for the eligibility criteria and target populations is required, so that the public is aware that programs are designed to deliver maximal population impact, while minimizing population risk.

### Women 75 years old or older: to screen or not to screen? [^117LfpNJ]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with the incidence rising substantially with age. Older women are a vulnerable population at increased risk of developing and dying from breast cancer. However, women aged 75 years and older were excluded from all randomized controlled screening trials, so the best available data regarding screening benefits and risks in this age group are from observational studies and modeling predictions. Benefits of screening in older women are the same as those in younger women: early detection of smaller lower-stage cancers, resulting in less invasive treatment and lower morbidity and mortality. Mammography performs significantly better in older women with higher sensitivity, specificity, cancer detection rate, and positive predictive values, accompanied by lower recall rates and false positives. The overdiagnosis rate is low, with benefits outweighing risks until age 90 years. Although there are conflicting national and international guidelines about whether to continue screening mammography in women beyond age 74 years, clinicians can use shared decision making to help women make decisions about screening and fully engage them in the screening process. For women aged 75 years and older in good health, continuing annual screening mammography will save the most lives. An informed discussion of the benefits and risks of screening mammography in older women needs to include each woman's individual values, overall health status, and comorbidities. This article will review the benefits, risks, and controversies surrounding screening mammography in women 75 years old and older and compare the current recommendations for screening this population from national and international professional organizations. © RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available through the Online Learning Center.

### Screening mammography among older women: a review of United States guidelines and potential harms [^113d36kB]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, older women (aged ≥ 65 years) continue to receive routine screening mammography surveillance, despite limited evidence supporting the benefits to this subpopulation. This article reviews screening mammography guidelines and the potential harms of such screening for older women in the United States. Published guidelines and recommendations on screening mammography for older women from professional medical societies and organizations in the United States were reviewed from the mid-20th century to present. Observational data were then synthesized to present the documented harms from screening mammography among older women. In 1976, the American Cancer Society recommended to screen all women aged ≥ 40 years with no upper age limit. With time, other major U.S. medical societies adopted their own screening guidelines without a consensus on age of screening cessation. A population-wide screening effort has largely continued without an upper age limit and with it, a growing body of literature on the harms of screening older women. Reported harms from screening mammography procedures have included physical pain, psychological distress, excessive use of health services from overdiagnoses/false positives, and undue financial expenses. These costs are particularly pronounced among special populations with limited life expectancies such as those of very advanced age ≥ 80 years, long-term nursing home residents, and the cognitively impaired. When potential harms, remaining life years, and the viability of available treatments are considered, the burdens of screening mammography often outweigh the benefits for older women. For some cases, an individualized approach to recommendations would be appropriate. National guidelines should be updated to provide clear guidance for screening women of advanced age, especially those in special populations with limited life expectancies.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^112fBm6A]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

The search strategy yielded 3114 unique titles (Fig. 1). We excluded 2932 records after titles or abstract screening, leaving 182 papers for full-text screen. After full-text screen we excluded 116 publications that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Sixty-six papers were deemed potentially eligible for inclusion. An additional 35 were excluded because data was not stratified for 75 years and older to enable data extraction. Searches of reference lists and additional sources identified 5 additional papers, resulting in a total of 36 studies included in this review.

Fig. 1
Study identification and selection.

Table 1 summarises study characteristics. All included studies contained either observational (n = 27) or modelled/simulated data (n = 9). No RCTs which evaluated mammography screening in women 75 years and older were identified. As such, all included observational studies were subject to potential selection bias, confounding and lead time bias, with the vast majority of observational studies deemed at critical or serious risk of bias and only two studies at moderate risk of bias. Of the modelling studies, most did not report the assumptions made within the model, and a few failed to describe the validation process (Supplementary Appendix 2). As such, two were deemed low risk of bias, six at moderate risk, and one at high risk of bias.

Of the 27 observational studies, 18 studies followed up women after screening and/or diagnosis; follow-up times in these studies ranged from 4 months to 20 years. Three studies did not include any comparison group and provided only descriptive statistics and three studies compared groups by detection methods in those with breast cancer. One study had multiple comparisons (by age and screening history); the remaining studies compared mammography screening outcomes in women aged 75 years and older with screening outcomes in women: of other ages (ten studies); differing screening histories (three studies); differing screening intervals (three studies) or historical unscreened women (one study); women who did not screen (one study) and women who stopped screening (two studies).

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116V11Pj]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Breast cancer screening in women 75 years or older — burden and evidence gap: Breast cancer incidence remains high at 453.3 and 409.9 cases per 100 000 women aged 75 to 79 and 80 to 84 years, respectively, compared with 468.2 cases per 100 000 women aged 70 to 74 years; there are no randomized clinical trials of breast cancer screening including women 75 years or older, collaborative modeling predicted that screening in women 75 years or older is of benefit but a trial emulation found no benefit in women aged 75 to 84 years, and thus there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening mammography in women 75 years or older.

### Collaborative modeling to compare different breast cancer screening strategies: a decision analysis for the US preventive services task force [^115aqSdB]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effects of breast cancer incidence changes and advances in screening and treatment on outcomes of different screening strategies are not well known.

Objective

To estimate outcomes of various mammography screening strategies.

Design, Setting, and Population

Comparison of outcomes using 6 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models and national data on breast cancer incidence, mammography performance, treatment effects, and other-cause mortality in US women without previous cancer diagnoses.

Exposures

Thirty-six screening strategies with varying start ages (40, 45, 50 years) and stop ages (74, 79 years) with digital mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) annually, biennially, or a combination of intervals. Strategies were evaluated for all women and for Black women, assuming 100% screening adherence and "real-world" treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimated lifetime benefits (breast cancer deaths averted, percent reduction in breast cancer mortality, life-years gained), harms (false-positive recalls, benign biopsies, overdiagnosis), and number of mammograms per 1000 women.

Results

Biennial screening with DBT starting at age 40, 45, or 50 years until age 74 years averted a median of 8.2, 7.5, or 6.7 breast cancer deaths per 1000 women screened, respectively, vs no screening. Biennial DBT screening at age 40 to 74 years (vs no screening) was associated with a 30.0% breast cancer mortality reduction, 1376 false-positive recalls, and 14 overdiagnosed cases per 1000 women screened. Digital mammography screening benefits were similar to those for DBT but had more false-positive recalls. Annual screening increased benefits but resulted in more false-positive recalls and overdiagnosed cases. Benefit-to-harm ratios of continuing screening until age 79 years were similar or superior to stopping at age 74. In all strategies, women with higher-than-average breast cancer risk, higher breast density, and lower comorbidity level experienced greater screening benefits than other groups. Annual screening of Black women from age 40 to 49 years with biennial screening thereafter reduced breast cancer mortality disparities while maintaining similar benefit-to-harm trade-offs as for all women.

Conclusions

This modeling analysis suggests that biennial mammography screening starting at age 40 years reduces breast cancer mortality and increases life-years gained per mammogram. More intensive screening for women with greater risk of breast cancer diagnosis or death can maintain similar benefit-to-harm trade-offs and reduce mortality disparities.

### The recent US preventive services task force guidelines are not supported by the scientific evidence and should be rescinded [^113USqxK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The recent US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on mammographic screening ignore the scientific evidence and should be rescinded. There are no data to support the age of 50 years as a threshold for screening. There are no data to support screening women aged 40 to 49 years on the basis of risk. The USPSTF failed to understand the randomized controlled trials and used the lowest possible benefit in its calculations. The death rate from breast cancer has decreased by 30%, primarily because of screening. The agency ignored direct data with regard to decreasing deaths in real populations in favor of computer models. The USPSTF admits that its guidelines will result in unnecessary deaths from breast cancer that could be avoided by screening annually beginning at the age of 40 years.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^116ZTVC4]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — older age, health, and life expectancy: Health and life expectancy, not simply age, must be considered in screening decisions, and a significant proportion of women 75 years and older are in good health and can be expected to live considerably longer than 10 or more years. Based on 2010 US Life Tables, approximately 50% of 80-year-old women and 25% of 85-year-old women will live at least 10 years, and an older woman's life expectancy exceeding 10 years is generally defined as having greater than a 50% probability of surviving 10 years. For women who are healthy and have at least a 10-year life expectancy, individualized decisions about screening mammography should be considered, and the GDG recommends that women should continue screening as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.

### Breast cancer screening modalities, recommendations, and novel imaging techniques [^114bKLHp]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Among women, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Mammography remains the only validated screening tool to reduce breast cancer mortality. The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends that average-risk women undergo breast cancer screening every year starting at age 40. This article reviews the fundamentals of mammography screening, current age-based mammography screening recommendations, supplemental breast cancer screening recommendations in high-risk women, and novel imaging technologies. This review summarizes recommendations from the American Society of Breast Surgeons and published guidelines from major societies to reflect a range of evidence-based perspectives regarding mammographic screening.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^1111zPu5]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

The other comparisons made by included studies do not provide direct evidence on the health benefits and harms of continuing to screen beyond age 75. Studies that compare older women to younger age groups, compare according to screening history or screening interval, or compare by whether a cancer is screen-detected or diagnosed clinically (by physician or patient) are prone to lead time bias and as a result may be inherently biased towards screening, and do not tell us how health outcomes change if the woman chooses to stop vs continue screening beyond age 75. For example, a study with a more informative comparison (stop vs continue screening) indicates a non-significant breast cancer death hazard ratio (1.00; 95% CI 0.83–1.19), whereas a study with a less informative comparison (within age-group clinical detection vs screen-detected) suggests a significant benefit to screen detection (HR 0.5; 95% CI 0.31–0.82). As such, the results of many of the studies with less informative comparisons need to be interpreted with caution.

Several studies reported screening detection measures, showing similar or higher cancer detection rates (depending on the comparison used) or PPV for recall (detection yield) for screening older women although several studies did not have a comparator. These metrics provide information about the performance of the screening process, but they provide less knowledge about the health benefit of continuing to screen. This comparison is particularly problematic when being made by age-groups as the detection metrics generally differ between younger and older women. For example, mammograms are more sensitive in older women, and underlying cancer rates higher, so more cancer detection would be expected at screening in older women (compared to younger groups) but this is not equivalent to evidence on whether screening beyond 75 years and older as opposed to stopping confers a mortality benefit.

Likewise, comparing cancer characteristics and treatment patterns between younger and older women is un-informative about screening effects because breast cancer biology and treatment are known to differ between younger and older women, so in extreme age, i.e. 75 years and older, these differences would be expected and could be more evident. Therefore reported differences related to cancer characteristics between age-groups do not provide direct evidence about health benefit of screening into older age.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^117CPium]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The current follow‐up in The Netherlands consists of annual follow‐up visits in the hospital for a minimum of 5 years, with clinical examination and mammography [3]. This is comparable to follow‐up schedules in other countries, such as the U.K. [11], Australia [12] and the U.S. [13]. Dutch recommendations on the monitoring after 5 years of follow‐up are based on consensus. The age after 5 years of follow‐up determines the schedule: women < 60 years will continue with annual visits and those between the ages of 60 and 75 biennial visits (in the population‐based screening program), whereas for those > 75 years, the guideline suggests to consider stopping follow‐up. With these age‐based recommendations, implicit assumptions are made as to what level of risk is appropriate for which frequency of follow‐up visits. It is uncertain whether the recommendations capture the differences of developing an LRR or SP between the age groups after 5 years. Ideally, risk groups should clearly differentiate in risk and the frequency of follow‐up visits should match the risk of recurrence, with higher‐risk patients receiving more follow‐up visits, unless the abovementioned lack of value of follow‐up becomes translated into practice.

Women without a history of breast cancer aged 50–75 years are invited by the national breast cancer screening program to undergo biennial screening. It is unclear how the risk for primary breast cancer in the healthy screening population and the corresponding recommendations relate to women with a history of breast cancer who are at risk for recurrence and are advised annual, biennial, or no hospital follow‐up. When examining the patterns in the risk of recurrence, risk thresholds could be identified and support evidence‐based follow‐up decisions.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to analyze long‐term breast cancer recurrence patterns and determine how the current age‐based recommendations on the follow‐up schedules after 5 years correspond to the actual risk of LRR and SP. Moreover, alternative age cutoffs are proposed, and risk of LRR or SP was compared with the risk of breast cancer in the general screening population aged 50–74 years.

### Collaborative modeling of the benefits and harms associated with different U.S. breast cancer screening strategies [^1152SscC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy persists about optimal mammography screening strategies.

Objective

To evaluate screening outcomes, taking into account advances in mammography and treatment of breast cancer.

Design

Collaboration of 6 simulation models using national data on incidence, digital mammography performance, treatment effects, and other-cause mortality.

Setting

United States.

Patients

Average-risk U.S. female population and subgroups with varying risk, breast density, or comorbidity.

Intervention

Eight strategies differing by age at which screening starts (40, 45, or 50 years) and screening interval (annual, biennial, and hybrid [annual for women in their 40s and biennial thereafter]). All strategies assumed 100% adherence and stopped at age 74 years.

Measurements

Benefits (breast cancer-specific mortality reduction, breast cancer deaths averted, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years); number of mammograms used; harms (false-positive results, benign biopsies, and overdiagnosis); and ratios of harms (or use) and benefits (efficiency) per 1000 screens.

Results

Biennial strategies were consistently the most efficient for average-risk women. Biennial screening from age 50 to 74 years avoided a median of 7 breast cancer deaths versus no screening; annual screening from age 40 to 74 years avoided an additional 3 deaths, but yielded 1988 more false-positive results and 11 more overdiagnoses per 1000 women screened. Annual screening from age 50 to 74 years was inefficient (similar benefits, but more harms than other strategies). For groups with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk, annual screening from age 40 years had similar harms and benefits as screening average-risk women biennially from 50 to 74 years. For groups with moderate or severe comorbidity, screening could stop at age 66 to 68 years.

Limitation

Other imaging technologies, polygenic risk, and nonadherence were not considered.

Conclusion

Biennial screening for breast cancer is efficient for average-risk populations. Decisions about starting ages and intervals will depend on population characteristics and the decision makers' weight given to the harms and benefits of screening.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to do not continue or discontinue screening based on age alone. Decide on discontinuing screening mammography beyond age 75 years based on a shared decision-making process informed by the females health status and longevity.

### Benefits and harms of annual, biennial, or triennial breast cancer mammography screening for women at average risk of breast cancer: a systematic review for the European commission initiative on breast cancer (ECIBC) [^115fd3ty]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Structured question and outcome prioritisation

The clinical question ' Should an annual, biennial or triennial screening frequency be used for screening asymptomatic women ?' was prioritised by the GDG (Box 1: Structured clinical question). This review focused on the three age subgroups for which the European Guidelines previously issued recommendations for screening (45–49, 50–69, and 70–74 years old). The GDG prioritised the outcomes using a 1–9 scale (7–9 critical; 4–6 important; 1–3 of limited importance).

Box 1 PICO structured clinical question

Data sources and searches

We initially searched MEDLINE (via PubMed, October 2016), EMBASE (via Ovid, October 2016) and CENTRAL (via The Cochrane Library, October 2016) databases using pre-defined algorithms for individual studies. We updated our initial search in MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE (via Ovid) in April 2020 (Supplementary Table S1: Protocol Systematic Review, Supplementary Table S2: Search strategy).

Study selection

We included studies published in English of the following designs: (I) randomised clinical trials (RCTs), (ii) observational studies such as cohorts, time trend (before-after), or analysis of population surveillance registries, and (iii) decision analytic models (hereafter referred to as modelling studies) (Supplementary Tables S3a and 3b). All studies included at least two screening intervals in one of the age groups of interest; screening intervals from observational studies should had been defined based on at least two examinations prior to diagnosis; modelling studies should have assumed 100% adherence to the screening programmes and applied no discounting to the effects. Due to sparse empirical evidence in the 45–49 age subgroup, we included RCTs and observational studies that recruited women from 40 to 49.

We excluded studies of women at high risk for breast cancer, i.e. having known susceptibility gene mutations (BRCA1/BRCA2), a history of previous breast cancer or lobular neoplasia, exposure to chest irradiation (other than diagnostic imaging over that anatomical area) or having a direct family member with breast cancer.

Pairs of reviewers (CCA, MP), after calibration, assessed eligibility and reviewed the full text of the selected references. Discrepancies were resolved either by consensus or with the help of a third reviewer.

### Use of patient decision aids increased younger women's reluctance to begin screening mammography: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115S3M4C]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

As breast cancer screening guidelines have changed recently, additional investigation is needed to understand changes in women's behavior after using breast cancer screening patient decision aids (BCS-PtDAs) and the potential effect on mammography utilization. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to evaluate the effect of BCS-PtDAs on changes in women's intentions to undergo screening mammography and whether women deciding to begin or discontinue screening mammography displayed similar changes in screening intentions after using a BCS-PtDA.

Methods

We searched Medline, Scopus, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Health Technology Assessment Database, PsycARTICLES, and cited references in eligible papers for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, published through August 24, 2016. The proportions of women who did and not intend to undergo screening and who were uncertain about undergoing screening mammography were pooled, using risk ratios (RR) and random effects. According to the protocol, RCTs or observational studies and any language were considered eligible for systematic review if they included data about women for which shared decision making is recommended.

Results

We ultimately included six studies with screening intention data for 2040 women. Compared to usual care, the use of BCS-PtDAs in three RCTs resulted in significantly more women deciding not to undergo screening mammography (RR 1.48 [95% CI 1.04–2.13]; P = 0.03), particularly for younger (38–50 years) women (1.77 [1.34–2.34]; P < 0.001). The use of BCS-PtDAs had a non-significant effect on the intentions of older women (69–89 years) to discontinue screening.

Conclusions

The use of BCS-PtDAs increased younger women's reluctance to undergo screening for breast cancer. The implementation of such BCS-PtDAs in clinical practice would be expected to result in a 77% increase in the number of younger women (aged 38–50) who do not intend to be screened, and as a consequence, may reduce utilization of screening mammography.

Registration

The protocol of this review is registered in the PROSPERO database, #CRD42016036695.

### The cost-effectiveness of screening mammography beyond age 65 years: a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^114dbEe5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

There are few data on the effects of disease biology and competing mortality on the effectiveness of screening women for breast cancer after age 65 years. The authors performed a review to determine the costs and benefits of mammography screening after age 65 years.

Data Sources

Cost-effectiveness articles published between January 1989 and March 2002.

Study Selection

Studies were identified by using MEDLINE and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. The authors included research on screening after age 65 years conducted from a societal or government perspective; reviews and analyses of other technologies were excluded.

Data Synthesis

115 studies were identified and 10 met inclusion criteria. One study modeled age-dependent assumptions of disease biology. No study fully captured the potential harms of screening, including anxiety associated with false-positive results, overdiagnosis, and previous knowledge of cancer or living longer with the consequences of treatment. Studies differed in the specific strategies compared and in analytic approaches. On average, extending biennial screening to age 75 or 80 years was estimated to cost 34 000 dollars to 88 000 dollars (2002 U.S. dollars) per life-year gained, compared with stopping screening at age 65 years. Two studies suggested that it was more cost-effective to target healthy women than those with several competing risks for death.

Conclusions

Current estimates suggest that biennial breast cancer screening after age 65 years reduces mortality at reasonable costs for women without clinically significant comorbid conditions. More data are needed on disease biology and preferences for benefits and harms in older women.

### Informing women about overdetection in breast cancer screening: two-year outcomes from a randomized trial [^114DRF5j]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2021). Medium credibility.

Mammography screening can reduce a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer but entails the risk of having a cancer diagnosed that would not have presented clinically in her lifetime — termed overdetection or overdiagnosis. Such a diagnosis, and the resulting overtreatment, can harm women physically and emotionally, for example, through treatment side effects and psychosocial consequences of being labeled with a diagnosis of cancer.

Growing scientific attention to overdetection has highlighted the importance of ensuring that women invited to breast screening are informed about the potential for harm in addition to benefit. After a thorough evidence review, the Independent UK Panel on Breast Cancer Screening wrote that "information should be made available in a transparent and objective way to women invited to screening so that they can make informed decisions". Momentum is shifting from persuasive approaches to screening communication toward more balanced information, giving people the opportunity to make informed choices whether to screen or not based on their personal assessment of the trade-offs between potential outcomes.

Decision aids are tools to communicate evidence-based information about benefits and harms of different health-care options to help people make informed decisions. Numerous randomized trials show decision aids improve knowledge and facilitate informed choice in various settings, including cancer screening. However, earlier breast screening decision aid trials did not involve women aged 50 years (when screening is initiated in many countries), and the decision aids paid little attention to overdetection. We developed the world's first mammography decision aid giving comprehensive explanatory and quantitative information about overdetection along with other important breast screening outcomes. Both intervention and control versions included information about breast cancer deaths averted and false-positive screening results, but only the intervention decision aid contained information about overdetection.

The aim of our study was to investigate for the first time the effects of including evidence-based consumer-friendly information about overdetection of breast cancer in a decision aid in a community sample of women around the target age for starting breast screening in Australia. Mammographic screening is offered free of charge to women in Australia, and treatment is available to all through the public health-care system. We previously published short-term findings showing that overdetection information statistically significantly improved knowledge and increased the number of women making an informed choice about breast screening. Here, we present the effects of the intervention on a range of additional prespecified outcomes collected from the same study cohort over 2 years of follow-up, importantly including both self-reported and objectively measured data on participation in screening.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^114wf3dd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening for women at average risk — key age bands and modalities are: Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation). Women should undergo regular screening mammography beginning at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation), and women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Clinical breast examination is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). All women should become familiar with the potential benefits, limitations, and harms associated with breast cancer screening. Average-risk women were defined as those without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age. In contrast, ACS, 2003 guidance stated: Begin annual mammography screening at age 40 years; For women in their 20s and 30s, it is recommended that clinical breast examination be part of a periodic health examination, preferably at least every 3 years; Asymptomatic women aged 40 years and older should continue to receive a clinical breast examination as part of a periodic health examination, preferably annually.

### Start mammograms at 40, not 50, USPSTF suggests [^114xeP6c]. Cancer Discovery (2023). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has proposed changing the recommended age for women to begin getting routine breast cancer screenings from 50 to 40. In new draft recommendations, the task force says the shift was driven by new data showing persistent racial disparities in breast cancer death rates, as well as rising diagnoses among younger women.

### Breast cancer screening recommendations inclusive of all women at average risk: update from the ACR and society of breast imaging [^111BpqKv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths, and the leading cause of premature death in US women. Mammography screening has been proven effective in reducing breast cancer deaths in women age 40 years and older. A mortality reduction of 40% is possible with regular screening. Treatment advances cannot overcome the disadvantage of being diagnosed with an advanced-stage tumor. The ACR and Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40, which provides the greatest mortality reduction, diagnosis at earlier stage, better surgical options, and more effective chemotherapy. Annual screening results in more screening-detected tumors, tumors of smaller sizes, and fewer interval cancers than longer screening intervals. Screened women in their 40s are more likely to have early-stage disease, negative lymph nodes, and smaller tumors than unscreened women. Delaying screening until age 45 or 50 will result in an unnecessary loss of life to breast cancer and adversely affects minority women in particular. Screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. Benefits of screening should be considered along with the possibilities of recall for additional imaging and benign biopsy and the less tangible risks of anxiety and overdiagnosis. Although recall and biopsy recommendations are higher with more frequent screening, so are life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted. Women who wish to maximize benefit will choose annual screening starting at age 40 years and will not stop screening prematurely.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^114PTzJb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain screening mammography every 1 or 2 years based on an informed, shared decision-making process including a discussion of the benefits and harms of annual and biennial screening and incorporating patient values and preferences in females at average risk of breast cancer. Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

### Effect of mammographic screening from age 40 years on breast cancer mortality in the UK age trial at 17 years' follow-up: a randomised controlled trial [^1152nnKd]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Age-specific effects of mammographic screening, and the timing of such effects, are a matter of debate. The results of the UK Age trial, which compared the effect of invitation to annual mammographic screening from age 40 years with commencement of screening at age 50 years on breast cancer mortality, have been reported at 10 years of follow-up and showed no significant difference in mortality between the trial groups. Here, we report the results of the UK Age trial after 17 years of follow-up.

Methods

Women aged 39–41 from 23 UK NHS Breast Screening Programme units years were randomly assigned by individual randomisation (1:2) to either an intervention group offered annual screening by mammography up to and including the calendar year of their 48th birthday or to a control group receiving usual medical care (invited for screening at age 50 years and every 3 years thereafter). Both groups were stratified by general practice. We compared breast cancer incidence and mortality by time since randomisation. Analyses included all women randomly assigned who could be traced with the National Health Service Central Register and who had not died or emigrated before entry. The primary outcome measures were mortality from breast cancer (defined as deaths with breast cancer coded as the underlying cause of death) and breast cancer incidence, including in-situ, invasive, and total incidence. Because there is an interest in the timing of the mortality effect, we analysed the results in different follow-up periods. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN24647151.

Findings

Between Oct 14, 1990, and Sept 25, 1997, 160 921 participants were randomly assigned; 53 883 women in the intervention group and 106 953 assigned to usual medical care were included in this analysis. After a median follow-up of 17 years (IQR 16.8–18.8), the rate ratio (RR) for breast cancer mortality was 0.88 (95% CI 0.74–1.04) from tumours diagnosed during the intervention phase. A significant reduction in breast cancer mortality was noted in the intervention group compared with the control group in the first 10 years after diagnosis (RR 0.75, 0.58–0.97) but not thereafter (RR 1.02, 0.80–1.30) from tumours diagnosed during the intervention phase. The overall breast cancer incidence during 17 year follow-up was similar between the intervention group and the control group (RR 0.98, 0.93–1.04).

Interpretation

Our results support an early reduction in mortality from breast cancer with annual mammography screening in women aged 40–49 years. Further data are needed to fully understand long-term effects. Cumulative incidence figures suggest at worst a small amount of overdiagnosis.

### Surveillance mammography in older patients with breast cancer-can we ever stop? a review [^1161D484]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Approximately 4% to 5% of breast cancer survivors will develop a new ipsilateral or contralateral cancer (in-breast event) over the 5 years following diagnosis, and annual surveillance mammography is recommended for those with residual breast tissue. The risk for such in-breast events persists over time, though increasing age at cancer diagnosis and treatment with hormonal therapy are associated with lower risk, and most older survivors of breast cancer will ultimately die from nonbreast cancer-related causes. Specific guidelines for surveillance strategies in older patients are limited. Prospective data on the benefits and harms of surveillance mammography in this population are lacking, and most of the evidence is derived from observational, retrospective data, often in the general population.

Observations

We review the current recommendations for breast cancer screening and surveillance for older patients, the current evidence for ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer risks in older survivors of breast cancer, and suggested approaches for discussions about surveillance mammography with older patients. We recommend individualized decision making for surveillance breast imaging in older survivors of breast cancer, with consideration of the following strategy for women 70 years or older: 1-time imaging 6 to 12 months after completion of local therapy followed by annual or biennial surveillance mammography for healthy women and cessation of mammography in patients whose life expectancy is less than 5 years to 10 years, regardless of age. Decisions on mammographic surveillance should also incorporate whether hormonal therapy is being administered, whether a patient's anticipated life expectancy is extraordinary, and whether a patient's individual risk for in-breast events is higher (or lower) than average risk for breast cancer survivors.

Conclusions and Relevance

We propose reframing discussions around surveillance mammography in older breast cancer survivors and to consider cessation while taking into account life expectancy, the estimated risk for subsequent in-breast events, and patient preferences.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^111u9eL9]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening recommendations — average-risk women state that women should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (strong recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (qualified recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (qualified recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (qualified recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (qualified recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (qualified recommendation).

### Current guidelines and gaps in breast cancer screening [^115XETkW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States. Mammography screening is proven to significantly decrease breast cancer mortality, with a 40% or more reduction expected with annual use starting at age 40 for women of average risk. However, less than half of all eligible women have a mammogram annually. The elimination of cost sharing for screening made possible by the Affordable Care Act (2010) encouraged screening but mainly for those already insured. The United States Preventive Services Task Force 2009 guidelines recommended against screening those 40 to 49 years old and have left women over 74 years of age vulnerable to coverage loss. Other populations for whom significant gaps in risk information or screening use exist, including women of lower socioeconomic status, black women, men at higher than average risk of breast cancer, and sexual and gender minorities. Further work is needed to achieve higher rates of screening acceptance for all appropriate individuals so that the full mortality and treatment benefits of mammography screening can be realized.

### Breast screening policy: are we heading in the right direction? [^115Pj4cr]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

There is a large body of evidence supporting 2-yearly screening of women aged 50–69 years. There is good evidence for a mortality reduction from mammographic screening in women aged 40 to 49 years but a 1-year interval is required. The lack of specificity of screening in young women does remain a problem. There is no evidence to suggest that a single screen between the ages of 47 and 50 years within a programme screening at 3-year intervals will reduce mortality; the trials showing a mortality benefit in women in their 40s included multiple screening episodes and shorter screening intervals. There is no randomized, controlled trial evidence to support screening in women aged above 70 years and screening this age group will cause greater harm than in younger women through higher rates of over-diagnosis and consequent over-treatment. The randomized phase of the screening age extension, which at the moment is planned to last only 6 years, should not be immediately followed by general implementation of the policy. Only if and when additional mortality reductions and an acceptable balance between benefit and harms are shown to be achieved by the extra screens should the 2007 Cancer Reform Strategy policy on age extension be implemented. Resources saved by delaying or abandoning the roll-out of the age extension could potentially be redirected towards reducing the current 3 year screening interval to 2 years in women aged 50–69 years. However, reducing the screening interval to 2 years for women aged 50–69 years would require significantly more screening invitations and resources than the proposed age extension.

### Age to begin and intervals for breast cancer screening: balancing benefits and harms [^1114xuz6]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Screening mammography has been widely used for breast cancer detection and has been found to decrease mortality, but debate continues. The purpose of this article is to review screening recommendations and the benefits and perceived harms of earlier and more frequent screening.

Conclusion

Annual mammography beginning at age 40 decreases mortality. Clinicians should educate women and preserve recommendations for early and annual screening.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, more specifically with respect to breast cancer screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to offer screening mammography starting at age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Offer screening mammography no earlier than age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Begin screening mammography by no later than age 50 years in females not initiated screening in their 40s. Make the decision about the age to begin mammography screening through a shared decision-making process taking into account information about the potential benefits and harms.

### Screening mammography in older women: a review [^116FTBAX]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend individualizing screening mammography decisions for women aged 75 years and older. However, little pragmatic guidance is available to help counsel patients.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based approach for individualizing decision-making about screening mammography in older women.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched PubMed for English-language studies in peer-reviewed journals published from January 1, 1990, to February 1, 2014, to identify risk factors for late-life breast cancer in women aged 65 years and older and to quantify the benefits and harms of screening mammography for women aged 75 years and older.

Findings

Age is the major risk factor for developing and dying from breast cancer. Breast cancer risk factors that reflect hormonal exposures in the distant past, such as age at first birth or age at menarche, are less predictive of late-life breast cancer than factors indicating recent hormonal exposures such as high bone mass or obesity. Randomized trials of the benefits of screening mammography did not include women older than 74 years. Thus it is not known if screening mammography benefits older women. Observational studies favor extending screening mammography to older women who have a life expectancy of more than 10 years. Modeling studies estimate 2 fewer breast cancer deaths/1000 women who in their 70s continue biennial screening for 10 years instead of stopping screening at age 69. Potential harms of continued screening over 10 years include false-positive mammograms in approximately 200/1000 women screened and overdiagnosis (ie, finding breast cancer that would not have clinically surfaced otherwise) in approximately 13/1000 women screened. Providing information about life expectancy along with potential benefits and harms of screening may help older women's decision-making about screening mammography.

Conclusions and Relevance

For women with less than a 10-year life expectancy, recommendations to stop screening mammography should emphasize increased potential harms from screening and highlight health promotion measures likely to be beneficial over the short term. For women with a life expectancy of more than 10 years, deciding whether potential benefits of screening outweigh harms becomes a value judgment for patients, requiring a realistic understanding of screening outcomes.

### Breast cancer screening with mammography [^115cRB7Z]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

There has been a great deal of controversy regarding the change in breast cancer screening recommendations released by the US Preventive Services Task Force in November 2009. Despite limited new data, the Task Force changed their previous recommendations delaying initial screening of asymptomatic women from age 40 to age 50 and recommending biennial rather than annual breast cancer screening. It is important to fully understand the nuances of the analysis and modeling upon which the revisions were based in order to accurately inform patients of the risks and benefits of breast cancer screening. Several new studies as well as additional guidelines have also been released over the past year which further inform the debate, and a number of commentaries have helped to place the risks and benefit in clinical and societal context.

### Evidence to support screening women in their 40s [^116yGJ2V]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

A large body of evidence demonstrates a 30% to 50% mortality benefit of screening mammography for women aged 40 to 49. Because of more rapid cancer growth rates in younger women, annual screening is more effective than biennial. Studies indicate that selective screening of women aged 40 to 49 would miss the majority of breast cancers. If implemented, recent US Preventive Services Task Force breast cancer screening guidelines, which recommend against routine screening of women in their 40s, could result in thousands of preventable breast cancer deaths per year. Vigilance is needed to safeguard younger women's access to screening mammography.

### Screening mammography: proven benefit, continued controversy [^111V4SjB]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Screening mammography, despite its limitations, remains the best means for diagnosing breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Regarding the continuing controversies concerning the age at which screening should start, evidence supports beginning regular screening at age 40 in women at average risk. Similarly, evidence suggests that the screening interval should be yearly, especially in younger women. Rather than an arbitrary age at which screening should stop, the decision on screening elderly women should be made on an individual basis, taking into account level of health and life expectancy. More work needs to be done on determining the optimum screening strategies for high-risk women. As to the interpretation of screening mammography, a certain level of observer variability and of false-negative and false-positive readings are inherent in the process. These should be kept to a minimum through efforts by the interpreting radiologist to improve performance through auditing of individual results and continuing education. The impact of double reading and computer-aided detection in the interpretation of screening mammograms warrants further evaluation in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Despite these continuing controversies, mortality from breast cancer in the United States has been decreasing steadily for the past 25 years. The magnitude of the decrease has been reported to range from 8% to 25%. Although some of this decrease may be attributable to improvements in the treatment of breast cancer, early detection through screening mammography has undoubtedly played a role in this mortality reduction. The controversies that surround the issue of screening should not detract from the fact that screening mammography has proved to save lives.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^112knnfT]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The majority of population-based organised breast screening programmes invite women aged 50–69 years to participate in mammography screening. This is based on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which show that detection of breast cancer at an early-stage through mammography screening leads to a reduction in breast cancer mortality in this age-group. Evidence for screening women 70–74 years comes mainly from observational and modelling studies and there is limited additional evidence from the RCTs, with some programmes expanding the target age-group for screening to include women up to 74 years of age. For women older than 74 years, there is no trial evidence for the benefits and hence no specific guidance regarding the net health benefits (versus harms) of continuing mammography screening beyond that upper age limit of 74 years. Despite this, data indicate that screening women into their late 70s, 80s and 90s is occurring in practice. In the US, where there is no stipulated upper age limit for breast screening, there are no clear recommendations as to whether to continue or stop mammography screening beyond 75 years of age. The European Commission's recommendations are for biennial screening in women aged 50–69 years and a suggestion of every 2–3 year screening up to age 74 years.

Australia actively recruits women aged 50–74 years for two-yearly (biennial) mammography screening for breast cancer. Prior to 2013–14, the target age-group included women aged 50–69, however this was extended to invite women aged 70–74, based on a recommendation in a programme evaluation report. This report also recommended that women aged 75 years and over should no longer be eligible to attend the programme given limited evidence of health benefits. Nonetheless, currently, women aged 75 years and older can self-select to attend mammography screening. In 2016–2017, 14.4% of women aged 75–79 years, 5.4% of women aged 80–84 years and 1.2% of women aged 85 years and older underwent a screening mammogram despite not being actively invited to screening.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117ENUM6]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Response to public comment — The USPSTF notes that no trials of breast cancer screening enrolled women 75 years or older and an emulated trial showed no benefit to screening women aged 75 to 79 or 80 to 84. The USPSTF found no evidence on the benefits or harms of individualized breast cancer screening based on risk factors. Regarding screening interval, it did not identify any randomized trials directly comparing annual vs biennial screening, and two trials conducted in the 1980s to 1990s reported no difference in breast cancer mortality or features when comparing annual vs triennial screening; modeling found that biennial screening results in greater life-years gained and mortality reduction per mammogram and has a more favorable balance of benefits to harms compared with annual screening. For dense breasts, the USPSTF clarified that the I statement is not a recommendation for or against supplemental screening in women with dense breasts and that it fundamentally means there is insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms, or to recommend for or against supplemental screening. The USPSTF clarified that this recommendation applies to women with a family history of breast cancer but not those who have a genetic marker or syndrome or chest radiation exposure at a young age associated with a high risk of breast cancer, and stated that current evidence shows that screening for breast cancer starting at age 40 years will be of significant benefit to Black women.

Objective

Breast cancer is an important health problem for women 40–49 years old, yet screening mammography for this age group remains controversial. This article reviews recent guidelines and supporting evidence on screening mammography in women of this age group.

Conclusion

Evidence supports the benefit of annual screening mammography in women 40–49 years old. Models of different breast cancer screening strategies consistently show the greatest breast cancer mortality reduction and life-years gained with annual screening starting when women reach 40 years old.

### Toward optimal screening strategies for older women. costs, benefits, and harms of breast cancer screening by age, biology, and health status [^117K1zbb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Optimal ages of breast cancer screening cessation remain uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate screening policies based on age and quartiles of life expectancy (LE).

Design and Population

We used a stochastic model with proxies of age-dependent biology to evaluate the incremental U.S. societal costs and benefits of biennial screening from age 50 until age 70, 79, or lifetime.

Main Outcome Measures

Discounted incremental costs per life years saved (LYS).

Results

Lifetime screening is expensive (151,434 dollars per LYS) if women have treatment and survival comparable to clinical trials (idealized); stopping at age 79 costs 82,063 dollars per LYS. This latter result corresponds to costs associated with an LE of 9.5 years at age 79, a value expected for 75% of 79-year-olds, about 50% of 80-year-olds, and 25% of 85-year-olds. Using actual treatment and survival patterns, screening benefits are greater, and lifetime screening of all women might be considered (114,905 dollars per LYS), especially for women in the top 25% of LE for their age (50,643 dollars per LYS, life expectancy of approximately 7 years at age 90).

Conclusions

If all women receive idealized treatment, the benefits of mammography beyond age 79 are too low relative to their costs to justify continued screening. However, if treatment is not ideal, extending screening beyond age 79 could be considered, especially for women in the top 25% of life expectancy for their age.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^111FYQwv]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Recommendation 2 — screening continuation in older women states that women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Breast cancer incidence continues to increase until ages 75 to 79 years, and 26% of breast cancer deaths each year are attributable to a diagnosis after age 74 years; none of the RCTs included women 75 years and older, although observational studies have observed a reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with mammographic detection among women aged 75 years and older. The guideline notes that the reduced life expectancy associated with being older decreases the likelihood of screening benefit in some women.

### Cancer screening in the older patient [^112NsWMT]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Although there are clear guidelines that advise at what age to begin screening for various cancers, there is less guidance concerning when it may be appropriate to stop screening. The decision to stop screening must take into account patients' age; overall health and life expectancy; the natural history of the disease; and the risks, expense, and convenience of the screening test, and any subsequent testing and treatment. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians suggest that Papanicolaou smears can be discontinued in women at 65 years of age, provided they have had adequate recent normal screenings. Evidence suggests that cessation of breast cancer screening at approximately 75 to 80 years of age is appropriate, although American Geriatric Society guidelines recommend cessation at a more advanced age. Studies support continuing colon cancer screening until approximately 75 years of age in men and 80 years of age in women for patients without significant comorbidities. Prostate cancer screening, if conducted at all, may be discontinued at approximately 75 years of age in otherwise healthy men. Ultimately, the decision to screen or to discontinue screening must be made after careful discussion with each patient, using evidence-based guidelines and individual patient preferences.

### Decision-making regarding mammography screening for older women [^115CDdsy]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

The population is aging, and breast cancer incidence increases with age, peaking between the ages of 75 and 79. However, it is not known whether mammography screening helps women aged 75 and older live longer because they have not been included in randomized controlled trials evaluating mammography screening. Guidelines recommend that older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy not be screened because it takes approximately 10 years before a screen-detected breast cancer may affect an older woman's survival. Guidelines recommend that clinicians discuss the benefits and risks of screening with women aged 75 and older with a life expectancy of 10 years or longer to help them elicit their values and preferences. It is estimated that two of 1,000 women who continue to be screened every other year from age 70 to 79 may avoid breast cancer death, but 12% to 27% of these women will experience a false-positive test, and 10% to 20% of women who experience a false-positive test will undergo a breast biopsy. In addition, approximately 30% of screen-detected cancers would not otherwise have shown up in an older woman's lifetime, yet nearly all older women undergo treatment for these breast cancers, and the risks of treatment increase with age. To inform decision-making, tools are available to estimate life expectancy and to educate older women about the benefits and harms of mammography screening. Guides are also available to help clinicians discuss stopping screening with older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy. Ideally, screening decisions would consider an older woman's life expectancy, breast cancer risk, and her values and preferences.

### Challenges women face limit mammograms… [^114udaPP]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening mammograms can save lives Breast cancer causes more than 40, 000 deaths in women each year in the United States. Deaths due to breast cancer have decreased over time, yet some groups experience more deaths than others. For example, Black women, women who are uninsured, and women with low incomes are more likely to die from breast cancer. Screening mammograms have been shown to reduce breast cancer death by 22%. Regular mammograms can find breast cancer early Getting screening mammograms regularly can help find breast cancer early when it is easier to treat. Women ages 50 to 74 years should get a screening mammogram every 2 years, as currently recommended by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force. The task force is a group of doctors and disease experts who look at research on the best way to prevent diseases. This group makes recommendations on how doctors can help patients avoid diseases or find them early.

Only about 3 in 4 women ages 50 to 74 years were up to date with their mammograms in 2022. More women need to get screening mammograms that can save lives.

Women ages 50 to 74 years who are at average risk for breast cancer should get a screening mammogram every 2 years. This will help find breast cancer early when treatment works best. Average risk refers to women without a strong family history of breast cancer, without changes in certain breast cancer genes, and who have not had chest radiation. Women who are 40 to 49 years old should talk to their doctor about when to start and how often to get a mammogram.

### Breast cancer screening: ACP releases guidance… [^116ehGkf]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- The most significant breast cancer screening benefit for women at average risk is from biennial mammograms from 50 to 74 years of age, which can decrease breast cancer–related deaths without affecting overall longevity.
- Annual mammogram screening increases false-positive results by 45% with little to no difference in outcomes.
- Starting screening at age 40 has a small effect on breast cancer mortality at the cost of increasing false-positive results by more than 60%.
- There is no mortality benefit to screening women 75 years or older or with a life expectancy less than 10 years because screening benefits are not seen for 11 years. Recommendations AGE 50 TO 74 YEARS Women 50 to 74 years of age should be screened with mammography biennially. Screening women 50 to 69 years of age reduces breast cancer mortality but not all-cause mortality.

A benefit is less clear for women 70 to 74 years of age, but the best balance of benefits to harms for breast cancer screening is from 50 to 74 years of age. AGE 40 TO 49 YEARS Women 40 to 49 years of age should discuss the decision to screen for breast cancer with their clinician. For most women, the harms outweigh the benefits of screening for breast cancer with mammography. If 1, 000 women are screened from 40 to 74 years of age, one additional breast cancer death will be prevented at the cost of 576 additional false-positive screens, 67 additional unnecessary biopsies, and two cancers will be overdiagnosed compared with screening from 50 to 74 years of age. AGE 75 OR OLDER OR LIFE EXPECTANCY LESS THAN 10 YEARS Women 75 years or older or who have a life expectancy of 10 years or less should not be screened for breast cancer.

Older age, comorbid conditions that reduce life expectancy, and the patient value of the balance of benefits and harms are all reasons to discontinue breast cancer screening for this age group. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the USPSTF recommendations for biennial screening in women 50 to 74 years of age and an individual decision for starting biennial screening at age 40 based on limited benefit and increased harms. — Michael Arnold, MD, Medical Editing Fellow.

Randomisation and masking

Women were randomly assigned (1:2) to the intervention group or control group. From April 1, 1992, onwards, randomisation and allocation to trial group were carried out on the Health Authorities computer system using ad hoc software. Randomisation used computerised random number generation and was done by Health Authority personnel independently of the screening centres and without the screening services having previous sight of the randomisation status. Before this, in three centres that started the trial early, when randomisation on the system was not yet available to the trial, random number lists were generated, also from a computerised random number generator, by the trial coordinators and applied to GP practice lists. This randomisation was also done independently of screening services, without their knowledge of randomisation status. It was not feasible to blind the screening services thereafter, because they had to deliver the screening to the intervention group. Individual randomisation was done, stratified by GP practice, so that a third of the women in any practice were allocated to the intervention group, but otherwise randomisation was unrestricted and unblocked. For each general practice, the entire randomisation allocation was performed in a single run.

Procedures

Screening in the trial was by two-view film (analogue) mammography at the first screen, with single view thereafter, unless otherwise indicated. Mammograms were double read (both reads done locally). All women in the intervention group were re-invited for screening yearly unless they requested otherwise. Women who moved to areas not covered by the trial were not re-invited for screening as part of the trial, but were able to self-refer to either their previous or their nearest participating screening centre. Screening in three centres ceased prematurely (after four, five, and six rounds of screening) due to the inability of the centres to manage the additional workload.

Women were flagged with the National Health Service (NHS) Central Register, and the trialists have been notified of all breast cancers, breast cancer deaths, and deaths from all other causes, up to Feb 28, 2017. Since 2015, notifications were supplied by NHS Digital. At the age of 50 years, both groups became eligible for invitation to screening every 3 years as part of the NHSBSP, and received their first invitation between age 50 and 52 years. The intervention phase of the trial ceased for each participant when they were invited to their first NHSBSP screen. Cessation in all centres followed this protocol, except for three centres that had to stop screening early because of logistic and capacity issues.

### Should women under 50 be screened for breast cancer? [^1144LVn5]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

CURRENT SCREENING GUIDELINES

The uncertainty is reflected in the variation in current guidelines among countries for screening women below 50 years for breast cancer. A summary of guidelines used in 22 countries, from a survey conducted in 1995 by the International Breast Screening Network, reported that while a majority of countries or pilot projects had a lower age limit of 50 years, a number involved a lower limit of 40 years, although in countries such as Sweden and Australia policy can vary by county or state. Japan, which does not use mammography, reported a lower age limit of 30 years. In Sweden, the recommended screening interval is 1.5 years for women aged 40–49 years compared with 2 years for those aged 50 years and above. In the US, the recommendation (updated in February 2002) from the US Preventive Services Task Force is for 'screening mammography with or without clinical breast examination' (CBE) every 1 or 2 years for women aged 40 years and above. The age range was extended below 50 years despite the finding that 'the strongest evidence of benefit and reduced mortality is among women aged 50–69 years'. The US National Cancer Institute continues to recommend mammography for women in their 40s and older, while the American Cancer Society recommends 'yearly mammograms' (plus CBE) starting at 40 years. In 2001, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care concluded that 'upon reaching the age of 40 years, Canadian women should be informed of the potential benefits and risks of screening mammography and assisted in deciding at what age they wish to initiate the manoeuvre'.

The IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention on breast cancer screening, published in 2002, concluded that the marginal cost-effectiveness of expanding a programme to younger women (aged 40–49 years) greatly depends on its effect on reducing breast cancer mortality as estimated from randomised controlled trials, 'and that it is likely to be more cost-effective to make other changes'.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1139oJYS]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Age to start or stop screening — The USPSTF did not identify any randomized clinical trials designed to test the comparative effectiveness of different ages to start or stop screening that reported morbidity, mortality, or quality-of-life outcomes. An emulation study reported that continued screening between the ages of 70 and 79 years was associated with a 22% decrease in the risk of breast cancer mortality compared with cessation at age 70 years, although the trial emulation study found no difference in the hazard ratio or absolute rates of breast cancer mortality with continued screening vs discontinued screening from ages 70 to 79 years across 80 to 84 years.

### Inclusion of the US preventive services task force recommendation for mammography in state comprehensive cancer control plans in the US [^113GbPNj]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

All of the organizations with recommendations agree on the benefits of breast cancer screening for women at average risk. However, the ages at which women should start and end mammography examinations and the frequency of mammography examinations have been a matter of political, emotional, and scientific debate for 3 decades. In particular, the recommended age at which to start screening has changed over the years based on accumulated scientific evidence. Apart from the USPSTF, differences in recommendations arise from the different studies used for evidence to support the recommendations and the organizational criteria for weighing evidence, membership advocacy, and methods of harm as well as the benefit to harm ratio threshold calculations. Some health system concerns are overdiagnosis, false-positive results, and radiation harm caused by the increased number of mammography examinations for women who receive a diagnosis at a younger age. The calculation of benefits and harms varies based on age group and evidence for individual preferences and values, leading to more emphasis on shared decision-making between patients and clinicians, especially for those aged 40 to 49 years. The CDC expects state CCC plans to stay up to date with current recommendations, although, in practice, the periodicity of plan updates may preclude inclusion of the most current recommendations.

The most current USPSTF recommendation statement (grade B) issued in 2016 states that women aged 50 to 74 years with average risk (no signs, symptoms, or prior diagnosis of breast cancer; no history of a high-risk breast lesion; no history of chest irradiation at a young age; and no predisposing genetic or family history profile) for developing breast cancer should undergo biennial mammography. Prior to 50 years of age, the decision to start mammography is an individual one. The USPSTF recommendation statements prior to 2009 recommended beginning biennial mammography at 40 years of age. The objective of this study is to evaluate the inclusion of the B-rated, USPSTF-recommended frequency of mammography examinations and the ages at which women at average risk should start and end mammography examinations in state CCC plans.

### Mammographic screening in older women: when is It time to stop? [^116bMxHF]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Mammographic screening guidelines in women aged 75 and older are inconsistent due to a lack of data from prospective randomized controlled trials, such as those that exist for women between 40–74 years of age. In addition, older women are perceived as less likely to benefit from early detection due to increased comorbidities and a greater proportion of biologically favorable cancers. With increasing life expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, the question of when to stop mammographic screening merits renewed discussion. Observational data support a survival benefit from regular screening in older women with no severe comorbidities. In addition, screening mammography in this age group has been shown to perform better than in younger age groups, tipping the balance toward greater benefits than harms. Early studies of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in older women suggest that performance metrics are further improved with DBT screening. While a biennial schedule in older women preserves some of the benefit of screening, annual mammography achieves the greatest reductions in breast cancer mortality and morbidity. As the medical community strives to offer personalized care for all age groups, health care providers are well positioned to offer shared decision-making based on existing data and tailored to each woman's individual risk profile, comorbid conditions, and personal values.

### Reducing barriers and strategies to improve appropriate screening mammogram attendance in women 75 years and older [^112AcRjQ]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Although breast cancer death rates have persistently declined over the last 3 decades, older women have not experienced the same degree in mortality reduction as younger women despite having more favorable breast cancer phenotypes. This occurrence can be partially attributed to less robust mammographic screening in older women, the propensity to undertreat with advancing age, and the presence of underlying comorbidities. With recent revisions to breast cancer screening guidelines, there has been a constructive shift toward more agreement in the need for routine mammographic screening to commence at age 40. Unfortunately, this shift in agreement has not occurred for cutoff guidelines, wherein the recommendations are blurred and open to interpretation. With increasing life expectancy and an aging population who is healthier now than any other time in history, it is important to revisit mammographic screening with advanced age and understand why older women who should undergo screening are not being screened as well as offer suggestions on how to improve screening mammogram attendance in this population.

### Screening guidelines update for average-risk and high-risk women [^117JWNTd]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to describe screening updates for women with average and high risk for breast cancer, compare different screening strategies, and describe new approaches in risk prediction, including radiomics. CONCLUSION. All women are at substantial risk for breast cancer. For women with average risk, annual mammography beginning at 40 years old maximizes the life-extending benefits and provides improved treatment options. Women at higher risk need earlier and more intense screening. Delaying initiation or decreasing frequency of mammographic screening adversely affects breast cancer detection.

### The benefits and harms of breast cancer screening: an independent review [^1139frsh]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Both views have some supporting arguments, but the panel found no convincing evidence that one or other was more likely to be correct. Thus, the panel's view is that the appropriate manner in which to view the benefits of screening and those of better treatments are that these effects are independent, and thus that the estimates of the relative reduction in breast cancer mortality achieved with screening are the same now as 20 years ago. However, the uncertainty about whether there could be an interaction between the benefits of screening and of contemporary treatments is not a reason for stopping breast screening.

Particular aspects for which there is at least some evidence about the external validity of the trials relate to age, screening intensity, and follow-up time. The RR does not appear to change much across the age range 50–69 years, but it may be reduced below the age of 50. The RR does not appear to depend strongly on the number of screens, or the screening interval, at least across the ranges studied in the trials. The only randomised trial that compared different screening intervals is inconclusive (Breast Screening Frequency Trial Group, 2002). Reports from trials with long follow-up suggest that little benefit in terms of breast cancer mortality is seen in the first 5 years after starting screening, and that the benefit lasts for at least 10 years after cessation of screening. This is not surprising, given the slow progression rates of many breast cancers.

Conclusion

The panel concludes that the current screening programmes in the United Kingdom, which invite women aged 50–70 every 3 years to undergo mammography, are likely to deliver about a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality at ages 55–79 years. Clearly, there is uncertainty in this figure. In addition to the uncertainty owing to the limited numbers of breast cancer deaths across the trials, there are potential biases in the trials and concerns about the generalisability of results from the trials to the current UK screening programmes. We note, however, that the level of disagreement in the literature about the RR reduction is minor in comparison to the controversy about the absolute risk reduction.

### Recommendations from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative on breast cancer screening for women at average risk and patient navigation services for breast and cervical cancer screening [^113xFxkS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

The Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) expanded its previous breast cancer screening recommendation-initiate annual or biennial mammography screening for women at average risk of breast cancer between the ages of 40 and 50 years-by including additional imaging and pathology evaluation as part of the screening process if needed. Consistent with the previous recommendation, screening should continue through at least age 74 years, and age alone should not be the basis for discontinuing screening. To increase utilization of screening recommendations, the WPSI also issued a new recommendation to provide patient navigation services for breast and cervical cancer screening. To update its 2016 breast cancer screening recommendation, the WPSI found no new evidence of benefits and harms of screening. However, additional studies reported that gaps in insurance coverage contributed to incomplete follow-up after an initial abnormal mammogram for many women. For its new patient navigation recommendation, the WPSI evaluated 42 randomized controlled trials of patient navigation services for breast and cervical cancer screening and follow-up that showed increased rates compared with usual care. Patient navigation services involve person-to-person contact and are individualized to the patient's specific needs. Services include but are not limited to person-centered assessment and planning, health care access and health system navigation, referrals to support services, and patient education. The new recommendations are intended to expand breast cancer screening follow-up and to improve access and equity for cancer screening. Beginning in 2026, under the Affordable Care Act, these services will be covered without copay or deductible charges for most eligible women.

### Individualizing surveillance mammography for older patients after treatment for early-stage breast cancer: multidisciplinary expert panel and International Society of Geriatric Oncology consensus statement [^116FSUVt]. JAMA Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

There is currently no guidance on how to approach surveillance mammography for older breast cancer survivors, particularly when life expectancy is limited.

Objective

To develop expert consensus guidelines that facilitate tailored decision-making for routine surveillance mammography for breast cancer survivors 75 years or older.

Evidence

After a literature review of the risk of ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer events among breast cancer survivors and the harms and benefits associated with mammography, a multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop consensus guidelines on surveillance mammography for breast cancer survivors 75 years or older. Using an iterative consensus-based approach, input from clinician focus groups, and critical review by the International Society for Geriatric Oncology, the guidelines were refined and finalized.

Findings

The literature review established a low risk for ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer events in most older breast cancer survivors and summarized the benefits and harms associated with mammography. Draft mammography guidelines were iteratively evaluated by the expert panel and clinician focus groups, emphasizing a patient's risk for in-breast cancer events, age, life expectancy, and personal preferences. The final consensus guidelines recommend discontinuation of routine mammography for all breast cancer survivors when life expectancy is less than 5 years, including those with a history of high-risk cancers; consideration to discontinue mammography when life expectancy is 5 to 10 years; and continuation of mammography when life expectancy is more than 10 years. Individualized, shared decision-making is encouraged to optimally tailor recommendations after weighing the benefits and harms associated with surveillance mammography and patient preferences. The panel also recommends ongoing clinical breast examinations and diagnostic mammography to evaluate clinical findings and symptoms, with reassurance for patients that these practices will continue.

Conclusions and Relevance

It is anticipated that these expert guidelines will enhance clinical practice by providing a framework for individualized discussions, facilitating shared decision-making regarding surveillance mammography for breast cancer survivors 75 years or older.

### Screening for breast cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MthJP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for breast cancer in the general population.

Methods

The USPSTF examined the evidence on the efficacy of 5 screening modalities in reducing mortality from breast cancer: film mammography, clinical breast examination, breast self-examination, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging in order to update the 2002 recommendation. To accomplish this update, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review of 6 selected questions relating to benefits and harms of screening, and 2) a decision analysis that used population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of starting and ending mammography screening at different ages and using annual versus biennial screening intervals.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends against routine screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take into account patient context, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms. (Grade C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women between the ages of 50 and 74 years. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against clinicians teaching women how to perform breast self-examination. (Grade D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging instead of film mammography as screening modalities for breast cancer.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1164hhhG]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of other organizations for breast cancer screening — The American Cancer Society "recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years" and "suggests that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually", that those "55 years or older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually", may "begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years", and should continue "as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer". The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists "recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years", and if not initiated in their 40s, "by no later than age 50 years", with screening "every 1 or 2 years" and continued "until at least age 75 years", with decisions "Beyond age 75 years" based on shared decision-making. The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging "recommend annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years for women at average risk", advise continuing "past age 74 years, without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy", and the American College of Radiology "also recommends breast cancer risk assessment by age 25 years for all individuals". The American Academy of Family Physicians "supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer".

### Inclusion of the US preventive services task force recommendation for mammography in state comprehensive cancer control plans in the US [^114LuCfe]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are the objectives of US state comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plans consistent with the current US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for mammography for women at average risk for breast cancer?

Findings

This cross-sectional study found that the objectives of CCC plans from 50 US states and the District of Columbia do not universally suggest that USPSTF-recommended screening should start at the age of 50 years for women at average risk for breast cancer. Many state CCC plan objectives do not include an age for ending screening, and a few do not include frequency of screening.

Meaning

This study suggests that specifying that women at high risk require different screening age recommendations may reduce the heterogeneity in mammography guidance that is present in state CCC plans.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^111v3nt8]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The studies included in our systematic review used heterogeneous methods to assess and report on a range of outcomes for mammography screening in older women. Given this heterogeneity, we have summarised study-specific findings in evidence tables (since pooling of data would not be appropriate), noting there was mixed evidence about the benefits of continuing mammography screening beyond the age of 75 years. The few studies that reported on breast cancer mortality as outcome gave contrasting (mixed) results: about equal numbers of studies showed a beneficial effect or no effect on mortality and/or used un-informative comparisons.

Although fewer studies reported on the harms of screening beyond the age of 75, evidence presented on various harms (false positives, recalls, biopsy, and overdiagnosis) were generally more consistent. Specifically, there was consistent evidence that screening into older age increases overdiagnosis which can be partially explained due to the shorter follow-up time possible with older women, and higher competing causes of mortality.

The evidence reported in this review should be interpreted factoring in the various limitations we identified. Many studies used comparisons that were not informative about the health impact of screening into older age or used comparisons that could bias towards an effect from screening: the ideal comparison to assess the impact of screening beyond the age of 75 would be to compare those who continue screening with those who stop screening at the age of 75. Only two observational studies undertook this comparison, although some modelling studies simulated this scenario. The results of these studies are summarised in Appendix 2. When considering only these studies three of the modelling studies indicated a benefit, whereas both observational studies and one modelling study did not, and all six studies reported harms. One study showed similar estimates in breast cancer deaths averted, two showed no difference in risk of breast cancer death, two indicated benefit in terms of life years gained and two estimated a reduction in breast cancer mortality. We also see an additional number of false positive screens, an increase in the false positive biopsy rate, an increase in the incidence of breast cancer (including increase in both invasive cancer detection rates and DCIS rates)and an increase in overdiagnosis.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112SjnVL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening guideline (2015) for average-risk women — Women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation), and women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation), and should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The target population is women at average risk — women without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age.

### Benefits and harms of breast cancer screening: a systematic review [^112jtt4w]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Patients need to consider both benefits and harms of breast cancer screening.

Objective

To systematically synthesize available evidence on the association of mammographic screening and clinical breast examination (CBE) at different ages and intervals with breast cancer mortality, overdiagnosis, false-positive biopsy findings, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy.

Evidence Review

We searched PubMed (to March 6, 2014), CINAHL (to September 10, 2013), and PsycINFO (to September 10, 2013) for systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (with no limit to publication date), and observational and modeling studies published after January 1, 2000, as well as systematic reviews of all study designs. Included studies (7 reviews, 10 RCTs, 72 observational, 1 modeling) provided evidence on the association between screening with mammography, CBE, or both and prespecified critical outcomes among women at average risk of breast cancer (no known genetic susceptibility, family history, previous breast neoplasia, or chest irradiation). We used summary estimates from existing reviews, supplemented by qualitative synthesis of studies not included in those reviews.

Findings

Across all ages of women at average risk, pooled estimates of association between mammography screening and mortality reduction after 13 years of follow-up were similar for 3 meta-analyses of clinical trials (UK Independent Panel: relative risk [RR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73–0.89]; Canadian Task Force: RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74–0.94]; Cochrane: RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.74–0.87]); were greater in a meta-analysis of cohort studies (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.81]); and were comparable in a modeling study (CISNET; median RR equivalent among 7 models, 0.85 [range, 0.77–0.93]). Uncertainty remains about the magnitude of associated mortality reduction in the entire US population, among women 40 to 49 years, and with annual screening compared with biennial screening. There is uncertainty about the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with different screening strategies, attributable in part to lack of consensus on methods of estimation and the importance of ductal carcinoma in situ in overdiagnosis. For women with a first mammography screening at age 40 years, estimated 10-year cumulative risk of a false-positive biopsy result was higher (7.0% [95% CI, 6.1%-7.8%]) for annual compared with biennial (4.8% [95% CI, 4.4%-5.2%]) screening. Although 10-year probabilities of false-positive biopsy results were similar for women beginning screening at age 50 years, indirect estimates of lifetime probability of false-positive results were lower. Evidence for the relationship between screening and life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy was low in quality. There was no direct evidence for any additional mortality benefit associated with the addition of CBE to mammography, but observational evidence from the United States and Canada suggested an increase in false-positive findings compared with mammography alone, with both studies finding an estimated 55 additional false-positive findings per extra breast cancer detected with the addition of CBE.

Conclusions and Relevance

For women of all ages at average risk, screening was associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality of approximately 20%, although there was uncertainty about quantitative estimates of outcomes for different breast cancer screening strategies in the United States. These findings and the related uncertainty should be considered when making recommendations based on judgments about the balance of benefits and harms of breast cancer screening.

### The WISDOM study: breaking the deadlock in the breast cancer screening debate [^116uvzPX]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Annual screening mammography — the most common approach in the US today — has its roots in the large, randomized screening trials of the 1980s. The first trial of annual screening, the U.S. Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, began in 1963 and included 31,000 women in each arm. At 18 years of follow-up, it showed a 25% reduction in mortality, although benefit to women in their forties accrued after they were 50. The overview of the Swedish trials of bi- or triennial screening showed a relative reduction in breast cancer mortality of 21%, with maximum benefit for women in their sixties. The degree and timing of benefit to younger women in particular has generated a great deal of controversy. Even a decade later, there remains a continuing debate over the methodologic flaws of each of these studies, the net effect of which has impeded consensus on public recommendations for breast screening. –

From the outset, translating these studies into population-based screening recommendations stirred controversy, with debate focused on the frequency and most appropriate age to begin screening. The January 1997 Consensus Development Panel convened by the National Institutes of Health recommended women aged 40–49 be informed of the benefits and risks of screening and decide for themselves. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and American Cancer Society (ACS), however, recommended regular screening for women in their forties while disagreeing on screening frequency, with the former recommending every 1–2 years, the latter annually. Partly because of the controversy generated, the NCI later stopped issuing screening guidelines.

Now, 20 years later, we find ourselves in a familiar place — still reviewing and reanalyzing data from the same trials, debating the optimum age to begin and interval, with professional societies that set guidelines compelled to "take a side" in the debate. The controversy following the 2009 JAMA commentary "Rethinking Screening"and updates to USPSTF guidelinesillustrates how entrenched both sides have become. Consensus on recommendations remains distant.

### Screening mammography benefit controversies: sorting the evidence [^115ejE6u]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Numerous clinical studies have confirmed that screening women age 40 years and older reduces breast cancer mortality by 30% to 50%. Several factors including faster breast cancer growth rates and lower breast cancer incidence among younger women, as well as shorter life expectancy and more comorbid conditions among older women, should also be considered in screening guidelines. Annual screening beginning at age 40 years and continuing with no upper age limit, as long as a woman has a life expectancy of at least 5 years and no significant comorbid conditions, is currently recommended.

### Breast cancer screening for average-risk women: recommendations from the ACR commission on breast imaging [^111rY5dB]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States. Before the introduction of widespread mammographic screening in the mid-1980s, the death rate from breast cancer in the US had remained unchanged for more than 4 decades. Since 1990, the death rate has declined by at least 38%. Much of this change is attributed to early detection with mammography. ACR breast cancer screening experts have reviewed data from RCTs, observational studies, US screening data, and other peer-reviewed literature to update our recommendations. Mammography screening has consistently been shown to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality over a variety of study designs. The ACR recommends annual mammography screening starting at age 40 for women of average risk of developing breast cancer. Our recommendation is based on maximizing proven benefits, which include a substantial reduction in breast cancer mortality afforded by regular screening and improved treatment options for those diagnosed with breast cancer. The risks associated with mammography screening are also considered to assist women in making an informed choice.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^114pDRPE]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is little evidence on the balance between potential benefits and harms of mammography screening in women 75 years and older. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise the evidence on the outcomes of mammography screening in women aged 75 years and older.

Methods

A systematic review of mammography screening studies in women aged 75 years and over.

Results

Thirty-six studies were included in this review: 27 observational studies and 9 modelling studies. Many of the included studies used no or uninformative comparison groups resulting in a potential bias towards the benefits of screening. Despite this, there was mixed evidence about the benefits and harms of continuing mammography screening beyond the age of 75 years. Some studies showed a beneficial effect on breast cancer mortality, and other studies showed no effect on mortality. Some studies showed some harms (false positive tests and recalls) being comparable to those in younger age-groups, with other studies showing increase in false positive screens and biopsies in older age-group. Although reported in fewer studies, there was consistent evidence of increased overdiagnosis in older age-groups.

Conclusion

There is limited evidence available to make a recommendation for/against continuing breast screening beyond the age of 75 years. Future studies should use more informative comparisons and should estimate overdiagnosis given potentially substantial harm in this age-group due to competing causes of death. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020203131).

### Breast cancer screening is harmful after age 75… [^116WZNGJ]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on March 22, 2020 To increase acute care capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have suspended elective surgical procedures, and family medicine practices have postponed visits for preventive care and monitoring of stable chronic diseases
- particularly in patients older than 70 years, whose risk of developing serious illness from SARS-CoV-2 contracted in a health care setting likely outweighs potential benefits. For example, women in this age group should cancel or postpone screening mammograms. Even in the best of times, though, it's not known if screening mammography beyond 75 years of age is helpful or harmful. The U. S Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of breast cancer screening after age 75, and decision tools have been developed to help women decide whether or not to continue to be screened, relying on limited evidence and the patient's predicted life expectancy.

As the authors of a recent. AFP editorial observed, though, discussing the clinical implications of life expectancy with older patients can be challenging and fraught with pitfalls. Since it is unlikely that a randomized controlled trial of screening mammography in older women will be performed, researchers recently used observational data from the U. S. Medicare program to emulate such a trial in more than 1 million beneficiaries aged 70 to 84 years with a life expectancy of at least 10 years and no previous breast cancer diagnosis. The primary outcome was eight-year risk of breast cancer mortality. While women age 70 to 74 years who continued to have screening mammograms had a 22 percent lower risk than those who stopped being screened, there was no mortality benefit for women who continued screening after age 75 years.

Although guidelines already discourage screening for cancer in adults with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, this study suggested that stopping breast cancer screening after age 75 may be the right decision for all women, regardless of health status.

### Factors influencing elderly women's mammography screening decisions: implications for counseling [^115R8jDn]. BMC Geriatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There is great heterogeneity in health among older women leading to substantial differences in life expectancy. For instance, women aged 80–84 in the top quartile of health have 13 years of life expectancy while women aged 80–84 in the lowest quartile of health have only 4.6 years of life expectancy. Meanwhile, experts generally agree that a woman needs 5 to even 10 years of life expectancy to potentially benefit from mammography screening. Benefits of mammography screening among older women include possibly prolonging life or preventing morbidity associated with advanced breast cancer. However, potential risks include complications and anxiety related to finding and treating breast cancers that would never have become clinically significant in an older woman's lifespan. Therefore, guidelines recommend that clinicians consider older women's life expectancy and comorbidities before recommending mammography screening. Increasingly more women aged 80 and older are undergoing mammography screening and evidence suggests it is not being targeted to the oldest women in the best health and most likely to benefit.

To better understand elderly women's mammography screening decisions, we interviewed women aged 80 and older and physicians who cared for these women using qualitative methods. In that study, we developed a conceptual framework of the factors that influence mammography screening decisions of women aged 80 and older, including: 1) Patient factors (e.g. risk perception, habit, history of breast disease, etc.); 2) System factors (e.g. access, mailed reminders); 3) Social Influences (e.g. daughter's encouragement, family/friends' experience with breast cancer); and 4) Physician influences. We also found that physicians feel uncomfortable discussing stopping screening with women aged 80 and older. Since qualitative data cannot be used to determine the prevalence of attitudes or beliefs in a population and since qualitative methods do not allow for statistical comparisons between groups, we designed a telelphone survey to determine which factors identified in our qualitative study were most important to older women's mammography screening decisions. We were most interested in factors that influence elderly women to choose screening since these factors may need to be addressed before elderly women can feel comfortable stopping screening. We compared responses for women aged 80 and older with women aged 65–79 to see if certain factors need to be specifically addressed among the oldest women. In addition, we examined whether older women preferred that their physician make the decision whether or not they should get sreened or whether they preferred to make the decision on their own or share the decision with their physician.

### Continuation of annual screening mammography and breast cancer mortality in women older than 70 years [^115uzzRT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized trials have shown that initiating breast cancer screening between ages 50 and 69 years and continuing it for 10 years decreases breast cancer mortality. However, no trials have studied whether or when women can safely stop screening mammography. An estimated 52% of women aged 75 years or older undergo screening mammography in the United States.

Objective

To estimate the effect of breast cancer screening on breast cancer mortality in Medicare beneficiaries aged 70 to 84 years.

Design

Large-scale, population-based, observational study of 2 screening strategies: continuing annual mammography, and stopping screening.

Setting

U.S. Medicare program, 2000 to 2008.

Participants

1 058 013 beneficiaries aged 70 to 84 years who had a life expectancy of at least 10 years, had no previous breast cancer diagnosis, and underwent screening mammography.

Measurements

Eight-year breast cancer mortality, incidence, and treatments, plus the positive predictive value of screening mammography by age group.

Results

In women aged 70 to 74 years, the estimated difference in 8-year risk for breast cancer death between continuing and stopping screening was -1.0 (95% CI, -2.3 to 0.1) death per 1000 women (hazard ratio, 0.78 [CI, 0.63 to 0.95]) (a negative risk difference favors continuing). In those aged 75 to 84 years, the corresponding risk difference was 0.07 (CI, -0.93 to 1.3) death per 1000 women (hazard ratio, 1.00 [CI, 0.83 to 1.19]).

Limitations

The available Medicare data permit only 8 years of follow-up after screening. As with any study using observational data, the estimates could be affected by residual confounding.

Conclusion

Continuing annual breast cancer screening past age 75 years did not result in substantial reductions in 8-year breast cancer mortality compared with stopping screening.

### Mammography screening should begin at age 40 years [^113ZZBkc]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

The 2023 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force draft recommendation statement on screening for breast cancer recommends lowering the starting age for biennial screening with mammography to age 40 years from 50 years, the age of screening initiation that the Task Force had previously recommended since 2009. A recent Perspective article in the New England Journal of Medicine by Woloshin et al contends that this change will provide no additional benefit and is unjustified. This article reviews the main ideas presented by Woloshin et al and provides substantial evidence not considered by those authors in support of screening mammography in U.S. women starting at age 40 years.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112oTWjo]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer is a leading cause of premature mortality among US women. Early detection has been shown to be associated with reduced breast cancer morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To update the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2003 breast cancer screening guideline for women at average risk for breast cancer.

Process

The ACS commissioned a systematic evidence review of the breast cancer screening literature to inform the update and a supplemental analysis of mammography registry data to address questions related to the screening interval. Formulation of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence and judgment (incorporating values and preferences) about the balance of benefits and harms.

Evidence Synthesis

Screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence supports breast cancer screening for women 70 years and older who are in good health. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.

Recommendations

The ACS recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (strong recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (qualified recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (qualified recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (qualified recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (qualified recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (qualified recommendation).

Conclusions and Relevance

These updated ACS guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer. These recommendations should be considered by physicians and women in discussions about breast cancer screening.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^116w24KA]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We report our methods and results in line with the Preferred Reporting Standards for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and provide a completed PRISMA checklist (Supplementary Appendix 1).

Search strategy

Our search strategy was developed based on a Cochrane systematic review of mammography screening (2013), with limits in place regarding age and publication date (Appendix 1). We searched three major databases (Ovid Medline, Embase and Cinahl), as well as hand searching all identified systematic reviews of breast cancer screening. We performed forward and backward citation tracking of identified relevant articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies not located as part of the comprehensive search.

Searches were carried out in the specified databases for publications from 1990 to July 2022, with no language or other restrictions.

Selection criteria

Studies that reported relevant outcomes data for women aged 75+ years undergoing mammography screening using any method (i.e. film, digital, tomosynthesis) in a comparative context (relative to another group; continuing beyond 74 vs stopping at younger age; or screening beyond 74 vs not screened) or a non-comparative design were eligible for inclusion in this review (case reports and case series were excluded). All studies that included women aged 75 years and over, were included, however some were later excluded at data extraction stage if data was not stratified to enable extraction for this age group.

Relevant outcomes included both the benefits (or surrogate outcomes from which benefits could be inferred) and harms of mammography screening. Such outcomes included: breast cancer mortality; all-cause mortality; incidence of advanced breast cancer (or breast cancer stage distributions); prognostic characteristics of screen-detected breast cancers; evidence on treatment patterns (including data on treatment-related morbidity, such as physical adverse effects of treatment, quality of life measures); false-positive mammography; overdiagnosis; overtreatment; anxiety or adverse impact on quality of life; false positive biopsy or surgery for benign findings, false-negative findings (reported as interval cancer rates).

### Randomized trial of information for older women about cessation of breast cancer screening invitations [^1112Vxxb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

There is uncertain benefit of screening mammography for older women, as women aged ≥ 74 years have not been included in randomized controlled trials. At a population level, potential harms become more likely with increasing age, including false positives and anxiety due to additional tests following detection of an abnormality, as well as overdiagnosis (diagnosis of a cancer that would never have caused problems) and overtreatment. In one Australian modeling study, if screening were extended to 1000 women aged 70–74 years (compared to inviting women up to 69 years), one additional breast cancer death would be averted, eight breast cancers would be overdiagnosed, and 102 additional tests would include 78 additional false positives. However, a US modeling study indicated that continued screening to 78 or 80 years for women with no comorbidity could have similar benefit-harm ratios as screening women aged 50–74 years at average risk.

United States (US) guidelines recommend individualized breast screening decisions beyond 74 years based on overall health, life expectancy, and personal preference. – Screening is not recommended for individual women with limited life expectancy (< 10 years) due to the 10-year lag-time to benefitand greater chance of harm. However, over 50% of women aged ≥ 74 years report recent screening in US national survey data, and around 38% of women with limited life expectancy continue breast screening. In Australia, the nationally funded screening program (BreastScreen) invites women to participate in mammography screening for breast cancer up to 74 years of age through local health districts. Women aged ≥ 74 years can continue free screening and are encouraged to speak with their primary care clinician (general practitioner [GP]) if they wish. Screening rates by life expectancy are unknown in Australia. However, since BreastScreen extended invitations to women aged 70–74 years in 2013, annual participation rates in this age group increased from 25.9 to 55.8%, and data suggests 7.6–10% of women continue to be screened beyond 74 years. One reason for this may be the high trust people living in Australia have in the healthcare system.

### Age to initiate routine breast cancer screening: ACOG clinical practice update [^111stqrB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

This Clinical Practice Update provides revised guidance on the age to start routine breast cancer screening with mammography. This document is a focused update of related content in Practice Bulletin No. 179, Breast Cancer Risk Assessment and Screening in Average-Risk Women (Obstet Gynecol 2017;130:e1–16).

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^114KBKov]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Globally, there is no consensus or uniform policy on whether mammography screening should be ceased or even discouraged in older women (and if so what upper age limit should be set). Importantly, there is little evidence on the balance between potential benefits and harms in older women (specifically 75+) in whom competing causes of death and co-morbidities could render routine screening relatively harmful, and a shorter life expectancy could reduce the likelihood of experiencing benefit from screening. To support population-level, as well as individual, decisions about the age or age-range to stop (or recommend against) screening, we conducted a systematic review of the evidence on the outcomes of mammography screening in older women.

The aim of this study was to systematically review and synthesise the evidence on the outcomes of mammography screening in women aged 75 years and older, to guide screening recommendations.

### Factors influencing elderly women's mammography screening decisions: implications for counseling [^1118Y416]. BMC Geriatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Although several studies offer clinicians advice on how to encourage patients to undergo mammography screening and two studies provide clinicians data to help determine which of their older patients may benefit from screening, we are unaware of studies that offer clinicians advice on how to discuss stopping screening with their patients. As it is important for clinicians to learn how to recommend screening, it is also important for clinicians to learn how to discuss stopping screening, especially since older patients report that they want to have these discussions with their clinicians. When discussing stopping screening with elderly women in poor health, clinicians may want to acknowledge they understand how hard it must be for a patient to stop going for mammography when they have been doing so for years. Clinicians may also want to explain that just as there is a time to start screening, there is also a time to stop screening. Clinicians should discuss the risks of screening elderly women in poor health (e.g. unknown benefit of screening and complications from work-up and treatment of breast cancer). In addition, since a need for reassurance about one's health is important to patients, clinicians should be sure to offer patients reassurance by saying they will focus on preventive health measures (e.g. screening for geriatric health issues) that are more likely to benefit these women. This may help prevent patients from feeling like their doctor is giving up on them.

Although it is difficult to draw conclusions about factors that influence older women to choose not to be screened due to the low numbers of these women in our study, women aged 80 and older who chose not to be screened ranked age and then doctor's counseling as the most important factors influencing their decision. In fact, women aged 80 and older were significantly more likely than younger women to score age highly in their decision not to get screened. Resnick et al. also found that age and a lack of a doctor's recommendation were the most common reasons older adults living in a retirement community gave for not undergoing screening. Physicians may need to explain to older women in good health who prefer not to be screened, that health rather than age should influence their decision. This is especially important since observational studies have found a mortality benefit of regular mammography screening for women aged 80–84 in good health.

### Benefits and harms of mammography screening in 75 + women to inform shared decision-making: a simulation modeling study [^112qQ9fy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend shared decision-making (SDM) around mammography screening for women ≥ 75 years old.

Objective

To use microsimulation modeling to estimate the lifetime benefits and harms of screening women aged 75, 80, and 85 years based on their individual risk factors (family history, breast density, prior biopsy) and comorbidity level to support SDM in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We adapted two established Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models to evaluate the remaining lifetime benefits and harms of screening U.S. women born in 1940, at decision ages 75, 80, and 85 years considering their individual risk factors and comorbidity levels. Results were summarized for average- and higher-risk women (defined as having breast cancer family history, heterogeneously dense breasts, and no prior biopsy, 5% of the population).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Remaining lifetime breast cancers detected, deaths (breast cancer/other causes), false positives, and overdiagnoses for average- and higher-risk women by age and comorbidity level for screening (one or five screens) vs. no screening per 1000 women.

Results

Compared to stopping, one additional screen at 75 years old resulted in six and eight more breast cancers detected (10% overdiagnoses), one and two fewer breast cancer deaths, and 52 and 59 false positives per 1000 average- and higher-risk women without comorbidities, respectively. Five additional screens over 10 years led to 23 and 31 additional breast cancer cases (29–31% overdiagnoses), four and 15 breast cancer deaths avoided, and 238 and 268 false positives per 1000 average- and higher-risk screened women without comorbidities, respectively. Screening women at older ages (80 and 85 years old) and high comorbidity levels led to fewer breast cancer deaths and a higher percentage of overdiagnoses.

Conclusions

Simulation models show that continuing screening in women ≥ 75 years old results in fewer breast cancer deaths but more false positive tests and overdiagnoses. Together, clinicians and 75+women may use model output to weigh the benefits and harms of continued screening.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116Z9RwC]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Age to start screening — Collaborative modeling estimated that compared with biennial screening from ages 50 to 74 years, biennial screening starting at age 40 years until 74 years would lead to 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 6.7 vs 8.2, respectively, across 6 models) per 1000 women screened over a lifetime for all women. Models also estimated that for Black women, biennial screening starting at age 40 years would result in 1.8 additional breast cancer deaths averted (median, 9.2 deaths averted for screening from ages 50 to 74 vs 10.7 deaths averted, across 4 models) per 1000 women screened. Epidemiologic data show that in women aged 40 to 49 years the incidence rate of invasive breast cancer increased at an average of 2.0% annually between 2015 and 2019, and these factors led the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to conclude that screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years has a moderate benefit by reducing the number of breast cancer deaths.

### United States preventive services task force screening mammography recommendations: science ignored [^111QYd9c]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to examine the scientific evidence considered by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in recommending against screening mammography in women 40–49 years old and against annual screening mammography in women 50 and older. We use evidence made available to the USPSTF to estimate the benefits and "harms" of screening mammography in women 40 years old and older. We use Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network modeling to compare lives saved by different screening scenarios and the summary of evidence prepared for the USPSTF to estimate the frequency of harms of screening mammography by age.

Conclusion

Averaged over the six Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network models of benefit, screening mammography shows greatest benefit — a 39.6% mortality reduction — from annual screening of women 40–84 years old. This screening regimen saves 71% more lives than the USPSTF-recommended regimen of biennial screening of women 50–74 years old, which had a 23.2% mortality reduction. For U.S. women currently 30–39 years old, annual screening mammography from ages 40–84 years would save 99,829 more lives than USPSTF recommendations if all women comply, and 64,889 more lives with the current 65% compliance rate. The potential harms of a screening examination in women 40–49 years old, on average, consist of the risk of a recall for diagnostic workup every 12 years, a negative biopsy every 149 years, a missed breast cancer every 1,000 years, and a fatal radiation-induced breast cancer every 76,000–97,000 years. Evidence made available to the USPSTF strongly supports the mortality benefit of annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years, whereas potential harms of screening with this regimen are minor.
