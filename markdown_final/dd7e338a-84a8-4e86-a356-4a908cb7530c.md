## Question

Can hypertension cause pulmonary edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hypertension can cause pulmonary edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of pulmonary edema and the Starling forces that govern fluid movement in the lungs. Then, I should verify how systemic hypertension translates into left-sided heart pressures and pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. Next, I will review clinical evidence linking hypertensive emergencies to pulmonary edema, including epidemiology and specific syndromes like SCAPE and Pickering syndrome. After that, I need to consider special contexts such as pregnancy, high-altitude pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension therapies that can precipitate edema. Finally, I will synthesize the causal relationship and outline practical clinical implications for diagnosis and management, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the basic mechanism of pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema occurs when the net transudation of fluid from pulmonary capillaries into alveolar spaces exceeds lymphatic clearance, classically driven by elevated pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure from left-sided heart failure, with cardiogenic pulmonary edema reflecting a failure of the left ventricle to maintain forward flow and normal filling pressures.

> Now, I need to check how systemic hypertension fits into this. Severe systemic hypertension acutely increases left ventricular afterload, which can precipitate acute left ventricular dysfunction and a rise in left atrial pressure. That pressure is transmitted retrogradely to the pulmonary capillaries, elevating hydrostatic pressure and causing interstitial then alveolar flooding, i.e., cardiogenic pulmonary edema, particularly in the setting of hypertensive emergency or hypertensive acute heart failure [^116vBpE4] [^111JbAtL].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical magnitude of this association. Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses of hypertensive emergencies show that pulmonary edema or acute heart failure is among the most common forms of hypertension-mediated organ damage, with pooled prevalence around 24% and in-hospital mortality near 10%, underscoring both frequency and severity of this complication in the ED population [^115whCgm] [^115nxP77] [^116rq61z].

> Hold on, I should confirm specific syndromes where hypertension is the proximate driver. Sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema (SCAPE) is a prototypical presentation of abrupt, severe pulmonary edema with marked hypertension; emergency care emphasizes rapid afterload reduction with high-dose nitrates and noninvasive ventilation, consistent with a hemodynamic, afterload-driven mechanism rather than primary volume overload [^113uH44H]. I initially thought diuretics were always first-line here, but wait, I need to correct that — diuretics are reserved for clear systemic volume overload, whereas the immediate priority is vasodilation and ventilatory support in SCAPE [^113uH44H].

> Next, I should review renovascular hypertension as a special but instructive example. Pickering syndrome describes recurrent flash pulmonary edema in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or a solitary kidney with renal artery stenosis. RAAS activation with sodium and water retention, uncontrolled hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction from hypertensive cardiomyopathy converge to produce abrupt pulmonary congestion, and case reports document resolution after revascularization, reinforcing a causal chain from hypertension to edema in this phenotype [^115uLewp] [^111MfY3P].

> Let me consider pregnancy-related hypertensive disease, where the link is also well established. Pulmonary edema is a severe manifestation of preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, with obstetric guidance recognizing pulmonary edema as a criterion of severe disease and recommending urgent blood pressure control and supportive care, again aligning with hypertension-related end-organ involvement in the lungs [^113ygohr] [^113CVuNi].

> But wait, what if pulmonary hypertension is the starting point rather than systemic hypertension. High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) demonstrates that markedly elevated pulmonary artery pressures from hypoxic vasoconstriction can exceed the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier, causing edema even without left-sided failure; this is a different mechanism than systemic hypertensive edema, yet it confirms that pulmonary vascular pressure can directly precipitate edema in susceptible settings [^1147kUx9] [^117WdirQ].

> I should double-check iatrogenic scenarios where pulmonary hypertension therapies unmask edema. Initiation of pulmonary vasodilators in patients with occult pulmonary veno-occlusive disease or left heart disease can precipitate pulmonary edema by increasing inflow without relieving venous outflow impedance; FDA labeling for inhaled and parenteral prostacyclins and endothelin receptor antagonists warns to stop therapy and consider PVOD if edema occurs, and observational data show increased edema risk with parenteral prostacyclin initiation in patients with left heart disease risk factors [^1154oT2M] [^117Bu4QM] [^114TwpyQ] [^1167VzAy].

> Let me synthesize the causal relationship now. Yes, hypertension can cause pulmonary edema, most commonly via acute elevation of left-sided filling pressures in hypertensive emergencies or hypertensive acute heart failure, producing hydrostatic cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Mechanistically, afterload mismatch and retrograde transmission of pressure to the pulmonary capillaries drive alveolar flooding, and this is supported by epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment responsiveness to afterload reduction and ventilatory support [^116vBpE4] [^115whCgm] [^113uH44H].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are clear. In the ED, new pulmonary edema with severe hypertension should prompt rapid recognition of hypertensive acute heart failure or SCAPE, early noninvasive ventilation, and aggressive afterload reduction with nitrates or other vasodilators while avoiding premature diuresis in euvolemic patients. Guideline-based pathways emphasize nitroglycerin as first-line in this context and caution against beta-blockade in acute pulmonary edema, with careful attention to precipitating causes such as renal artery stenosis or ischemia [^113uH44H] [^116o6ZBR] [^1144pfWc].

> Finally, I should confirm the diagnostic approach to distinguish cardiogenic from noncardiogenic edema when needed. Bedside echocardiography and lung ultrasound help confirm cardiogenic edema and guide therapy, while invasive hemodynamics can differentiate pulmonary venous hypertension from isolated pulmonary arterial hypertension when the etiology remains uncertain or when considering PAH-targeted therapies that carry edema risk in left heart disease or PVOD [^1135imwo] [^113yyeW6] [^115Y881R].

Hypertension can cause pulmonary edema through **acute left ventricular failure** [^1161pZ3U] from sudden severe blood pressure elevation, leading to increased left atrial pressure and alveolar flooding [^116vBpE4]. This is most common in **hypertensive emergencies** [^115whCgm] and in patients with diastolic dysfunction or renal artery stenosis [^115uLewp]. Management centers on **rapid blood pressure control** [^1144pfWc] with vasodilators and diuretics [^116o6ZBR] to reduce preload and afterload and prevent recurrence [^111HtaQb].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** link hypertension to pulmonary edema:

---

### Acute left ventricular failure

- **Increased afterload**: Sudden severe hypertension acutely increases left ventricular afterload, causing LV failure and elevated left atrial pressure [^113uH44H].
- **Backward transmission**: Elevated left atrial pressure is transmitted to pulmonary veins, raising capillary hydrostatic pressure and causing fluid transudation into alveoli [^113uvewb].
- **Flash pulmonary edema**: Rapid-onset edema can occur in minutes, especially with diastolic dysfunction or renal artery stenosis [^116XbGbp] [^115uLewp].

---

### Chronic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy

- **Diastolic dysfunction**: Chronic hypertension causes LV hypertrophy and impaired relaxation, increasing susceptibility to edema with acute BP spikes [^115uLewp].
- **Increased stiffness**: Reduced compliance elevates end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary pressure during stress [^112LHhJ6].

---

### Renal artery stenosis and neurohormonal activation

In renal artery stenosis, **RAAS activation** drives sodium and water retention, volume expansion, and hypertension, precipitating edema [^115uLewp]. Sympathetic activation further increases vascular resistance and afterload, worsening LV failure and edema [^113Gdt7f].

---

## Clinical evidence linking hypertension to pulmonary edema

Multiple studies and reviews document a strong association between hypertension and pulmonary edema:

- **Hypertensive emergencies**: Pulmonary edema/acute heart failure is a common organ damage in hypertensive emergencies, with ~24% prevalence and ~10% in-hospital mortality [^115whCgm] [^115nxP77].
- **Flash pulmonary edema**: Recurrent episodes are linked to bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral stenosis in a solitary kidney (Pickering syndrome) [^115uLewp] [^111MfY3P].
- **Pregnancy**: Hypertensive disorders, especially preeclampsia, frequently cause pulmonary edema due to acute LV failure and capillary leak [^113CVuNi] [^113ygohr].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients with hypertension-induced pulmonary edema typically present with:

- **Dyspnea**: Sudden severe dyspnea and orthopnea [^116o6ZBR].
- **Hypoxemia**: Cyanosis and respiratory distress [^113uH44H].
- **Hypertension**: Markedly elevated BP, often > 180/120 mmHg [^notfound].
- **Rales**: Pulmonary crackles on exam [^115Y881R].

Diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment, chest radiography, echocardiography, and biomarkers** (BNP/NT-proBNP) to confirm cardiogenic edema and exclude noncardiogenic causes [^115Y881R].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management focuses on **rapid blood pressure control** and correction of precipitating factors:

| **Intervention** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical consideration** |
|-|-|-|
| Vasodilators (nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, clevidipine) | Reduce preload/afterload | First-line in hypertensive pulmonary edema [^1144pfWc] [^116o6ZBR] |
| Loop diuretics (furosemide) | Reduce intravascular volume | Use if fluid overload present [^113uH44H] |
| Noninvasive ventilation | Improve oxygenation and reduce preload | Reduces intubation need [^113uH44H] |
| Treat underlying causes (e.g. renal artery stenosis) | Address precipitant | Prevent recurrence [^115uLewp] |

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause, comorbidities, and timeliness of BP control. Recurrence is common without **adequate BP control** and risk-factor modification, especially in renal artery stenosis or chronic hypertension with LV hypertrophy [^115uLewp] [^114wECJF].

---

Hypertension can cause pulmonary edema, most often via **acute LV failure** from sudden severe BP elevation. Management requires **rapid BP reduction**, diuretics, and treatment of precipitating factors to prevent recurrence [^116vBpE4].

### Congestive heart failure-acute pulmonary edema… [^1161pZ3U]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Acute pulmonary edema is a disorder in which L there is sudden and relatively rapid transudation of fluid from the pulmonary capillary bed into the alveolar spaces. Whereas left ventricular failure is the usual cause of acute pulmonary edema, it also occurs after a variety of noncardiac disturbances, such as inhalation of irritating gases, pulmonary embolism, and intracranial hemorrhage. Instances of acute pulmonary edema secondary to disorders of atrial and ventricular rhythm or to mechanical interference with pulmonary venous drainage represent special conditions. This communication is concerned primarily with pulmonary edema secondary to congestive left ventricular failure. 1–3 Mechanism The fundamental disorder in acute pulmonary edema is failure of the left ventricle to serve as an effective pump, due to imbalance between myocardial contractile strength and myocardial load.

Such an imbalance is, in turn, related to a loss or damage of myocardial contractile units. Burch GE, DePasquale NP. Congestive Heart Failure — Acute Pulmonary Edema. JAMA. 1969; 208: 1895–1897.

Treatment-naive PAH patients without symptoms (WHO FC I) and patients at increased risk: For treatment-naive PAH patients with WHO FC I symptoms, we suggest continued monitoring for the development of symptoms that would signal disease progression and warrant the initiation of pharmacotherapy (Ungraded consensus-based statement). Early symptoms concerning for the progression of PAH include new or worsening dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and weakness, and as the disease evolves, symptoms including lower extremity edema, angina or syncope could signal right heart dysfunction and or failure; patients with PAH and FC I symptoms should be closely monitored for increased symptoms. We suggest that patients at increased risk for the development of PAH (Table 1) be monitored for the development of symptoms of PAH (Ungraded consensus-based statement), and we suggest also that contributing causes of PH (eg, sleep apnea and systemic hypertension) in patients with PAH be treated aggressively (Ungraded consensus-based statement).

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome following Abrupt Discontinuation

Wean from ULSPIRA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Abrupt discontinuation of ULSPIRA may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure, i.e. Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome include hypoxemia, systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and decreased cardiac output. If Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension occurs, reinstate ULSPIRA therapy immediately.

5.2 Hypoxemia from Methemoglobinemia

Nitric oxide combines with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, which does not transport oxygen. Methemoglobin levels increase with the dose of ULSPIRA; it can take 8 hours or more before steady-state methemoglobin levels are attained. Monitor methemoglobin and adjust the dose of ULSPIRA to optimize oxygenation.

If methemoglobin levels do not resolve with decrease in dose or discontinuation of ULSPIRA, additional therapy may be warranted to treat methemoglobinemia [see Overdosage (10)].

5.3 Airway Injury from Nitrogen Dioxide

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) forms in gas mixtures containing NO and O2. Nitrogen dioxide may cause airway inflammation and damage to lung tissues.

If there is an unexpected change in NO2 concentration, or if the NO2 concentration reaches 3 ppm when measured in the breathing circuit, then the delivery system should be assessed in accordance with the Nitric Oxide Delivery System O&M Manual troubleshooting section, and the NO2 analyzer should be recalibrated. The dose of ULSPIRA and/or FiO2 should be adjusted as appropriate.

5.4 Worsening Heart Failure

Patients with left ventricular dysfunction treated with ULSPIRA may experience pulmonary edema, increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, worsening of left ventricular dysfunction, systemic hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Discontinue ULSPIRA gas while providing symptomatic care.

Rebound: Abrupt discontinuation of ULSPIRA may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure (5.1).

Methemoglobinemia: Methemoglobin increases with the dose of nitric oxide; following discontinuation or reduction of nitric oxide, methemoglobin levels return to baseline over a period of hours (5.2).

Elevated NO2Levels: Monitor NO2levels (5.3).

Heart Failure: In patients with pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, ULSPIRA may increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure leading to pulmonary edema (5.4).

Group 5 pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms is described as a complex group of disorders in which "The cause is often multifactorial and can be secondary to increased pre- and post-capillary pressure, as well as direct effects on pulmonary vasculature". The "incidence and prevalence of PH in most of these disorders are unknown", though "high-quality registries have recently enabled estimation of PH prevalence in adult patients with sarcoidosis", and "Studies suggest that PH can be common and its presence is often associated with increased morbidity and mortality".

### Unilateral renal artery stenosis causing hypertensive flash pulmonary oedema [^111MfY3P]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Flash pulmonary oedema can occur as a result of multiple triggers that may act independently or in concert. One such precipitating factor is bilateral renal artery stenosis which can be treated either with revascularisation or with medical therapy. Unilateral renal artery stenosis, however, is a rare cause of flash pulmonary oedema, especially when the contralateral kidney is still functional. We describe a case of an elderly woman with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and multiple hospitalisations for hypertensive crisis and flash pulmonary oedema who was found to have right, ostial renal artery stenosis that was treated with stent placement.

### Pulmonary edema following initiation of parenteral prostacyclin therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: a retrospective study [^1167VzAy]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary edema may complicate the use of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-targeted therapies. We aimed to determine the proportion of patients who develop pulmonary edema after initiation of parenteral prostacyclin therapy, to identify its risk factors, and to assess its implications for hospital length of stay and mortality.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of patients with PAH at the initiation of parenteral prostacyclin between 1997 and 2015 enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic PAH registry. Pulmonary edema was defined as at least one symptom or clinical sign and radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema. We determined patient characteristics predictive of pulmonary edema as well as the association between pulmonary edema and hospital length of stay (LOS) and 6-month mortality.

Results

One hundred and fifty-five patients were included (median age, 51 years; female, 72%; white, 85%; idiopathic, 64%; and connective tissue disease [CTD], 23%). Pulmonary edema developed in 33 of 155 patients (21%). Independent predictors of pulmonary edema were high right atrial pressure (RAP), CTD etiology, and the presence of three or more risk factors for left heart disease (LHD). Pulmonary edema was associated with a 4.5-day increase in hospital LOS (95% CI, 1.4–7.5 days; P < .001) and a 4-fold increase in 6-month mortality (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.28–14.36; p = 0.031).

Conclusions

Pulmonary edema occurred in 21% of patients with PAH initiated on parenteral prostacyclin. Three or more risk factors for LHD, CTD-PAH, and a high baseline RAP were independent predictors of pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema was associated with a prolonged hospital LOS and increased 6-month mortality.

### Left ventricular failure produces profound lung remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in mice: heart failure causes severe lung disease [^114sNQuX]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic left ventricular failure causes pulmonary congestion with increased lung weight and type 2 pulmonary hypertension. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for type 2 pulmonary hypertension and the development of novel treatments for this condition requires a robust experimental animal model and a good understanding of the nature of the resultant pulmonary remodeling. Here we demonstrate that chronic transverse aortic constriction causes massive pulmonary fibrosis and remodeling, as well as type 2 pulmonary hypertension, in mice. Thus, aortic constriction-induced left ventricular dysfunction and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure are associated with a ≤ 5.3-fold increase in lung wet weight and dry weight, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Interestingly, the aortic constriction-induced increase in lung weight was not associated with pulmonary edema but resulted from profound pulmonary remodeling with a dramatic increase in the percentage of fully muscularized lung vessels, marked vascular and lung fibrosis, myofibroblast proliferation, and leukocyte infiltration. The aortic constriction-induced left ventricular dysfunction was also associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, increased right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and right atrial hypertrophy. The massive lung fibrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and pulmonary hypertension in mice after transverse aortic constriction clearly indicate that congestive heart failure also causes severe lung disease. The lung fibrosis and leukocyte infiltration may be important mechanisms in the poor clinical outcome in patients with end-stage heart failure. Thus, the effective treatment of left ventricular failure may require additional efforts to reduce lung fibrosis and the inflammatory response.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^113ygohr]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The 4 categories of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia-eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. These disorders are among the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Proper diagnosis in the emergency department is crucial in order to initiate appropriate treatment to reduce the potential harm to the mother and the fetus. Prompt management should be undertaken when the blood pressure is greater than 160/110 mm Hg or there are other severe features such as acute kidney injury, elevated liver function tests, severe abdominal pain, pulmonary edema, and central nervous system disturbances.

Key points
- Pulmonary hypertension is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal.
- The increased blood pressure in the lungs can make the heart work harder than normal to pump blood into the lungs. This can damage the heart and cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness. What it is With pulmonary hypertension, the blood vessels to the lungs develop an increased amount of muscle in the wall of the blood vessels. The heart pumps blood from the right ventricle to the lungs to get oxygen. Because the blood does not have to travel very far, the pressure in this side of the heart and in the artery taking blood from the right ventricle to the lungs is normally low — usually much lower than systolic or diastolic blood pressure.

When the pressure in this artery gets too high, the arteries in the lungs can narrow and then the blood does not flow as well as it should, resulting in less oxygen in the blood. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension during the initial stage of the disease are common to many other medical conditions. This often results in a delayed diagnosis until more severe symptoms arise, such as:

- Dizziness
- Chest pain
- Ankle swelling
- Feeling the heart race or pound. Causes Some common underlying causes of pulmonary hypertension include high blood pressure in the lungs' arteries due to some types of congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, liver disease, blood clots to the lungs, and chronic lung diseases like emphysema. Genetics also play a role.

Pulmonary hypertension can happen in association with many other diseases, such as lung disease and heart disease. Heart failure is common in pulmonary hypertension. Treatment and recovery There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. However, there are many different types of treatments, including:

- Inhaled medicine.
- Medicine given through the veins under the skin.
- Medicine to reduce swelling in the feet.
- Oxygen therapy.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) treatment — Descent remains the single best treatment, and individuals should try to descend at least 1000 m or until symptoms resolve while minimizing exertion because exertion can further increase pulmonary artery pressure and exacerbate edema formation. We recommend that descent is initiated for individuals with HAPE. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of heart failure [^115Y881R]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of volume overload, which may include peripheral edema and pulmonary rales. Heart failure has high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in older persons. Many conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, can cause or lead to decompensation of chronic heart failure. Up to 40 to 50 percent of patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular function, and the overall mortality is similar to that of systolic heart failure. The initial evaluation includes a history and physical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and laboratory assessment to identify causes or precipitating factors. A displaced cardiac apex, a third heart sound, and chest radiography findings of venous congestion or interstitial edema are useful in identifying heart failure. Systolic heart failure is unlikely when the Framingham criteria are not met or when B-type natriuretic peptide level is normal. Echocardiography is the diagnostic standard to confirm systolic or diastolic heart failure through assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction. Evaluation for ischemic heart disease is warranted in patients with heart failure, especially if angina is present, given that coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure.

### Emergency medicine updates: sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema [^113uH44H]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with heart failure exacerbation can present in a variety of ways, including sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema (SCAPE). Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning the diagnosis and management of SCAPE for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

SCAPE is a subset of acute heart failure, defined as a patient with sudden, severe pulmonary edema and hypertension, resulting respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. This is associated with significantly elevated afterload with fluid maldistribution into the pulmonary system. Evaluation and resuscitation should occur concurrently. Laboratory assessment, electrocardiogram, and imaging should be obtained. Point-of-care ultrasound is a rapid and reliable means of confirming pulmonary edema. Management focuses on respiratory support and vasodilator administration. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with oxygen support is associated with reduced need for intubation, improved survival, and improved respiratory indices. If the patient does not improve or decompensates on NIPPV, endotracheal intubation is recommended. Rapid reduction in afterload is necessary, with the first-line medication including nitroglycerin. High-dose bolus nitroglycerin is safe and effective, followed by an infusion. If hypertension is refractory to NIPPV and high-dose nitroglycerin, other agents may be administered including clevidipine or nicardipine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalaprilat are an option in those with normal renal function and resistant hypertension. Diuretics may be administered in those with evidence of systemic volume overload (e.g., cardiomegaly, peripheral edema, weight gain), but should not be routinely administered in patients with SCAPE in the absence of fluid overload. Caution is recommended in utilizing opioids and beta blockers in those with SCAPE.

Conclusion

An understanding of the current literature concerning SCAPE can assist emergency clinicians and improve the care of these patients.

HFpEF mimics — noncardiac disease mimics highlight that some individuals presenting with dyspnea and/or edema may not have heart failure (HF). Noncardiovascular entities that may mimic HF include kidney failure or nephrotic syndrome, liver failure or cirrhosis, anemia, severe obesity with peripheral edema, lung disease with or without cor pulmonale, primary pulmonary hypertension, and chronic respiratory failure hypoventilation syndrome. Based on clinical presentation, evaluation may include urinalysis to assess for proteinuria, abdominal ultrasound to assess for cirrhosis, and pulmonary evaluation with imaging, spirometry, and arterial blood gas. Recognizing that not every individual with shortness of breath or edema has HF is essential.

Pediatric pulmonary hypertensive crisis pathophysiology — cardiopulmonary cascade and gas-exchange consequences are described as follows: Pulmonary hypertensive crisis develops with an acute increase of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), driving an increase in right ventricle (RV) pressure and volume with interventricular septal shift that reduces left ventricle (LV) volume; rising ventricular filling pressures with compensatory tachycardia and systemic hypotension compromise coronary perfusion, resulting in low cardiac output and metabolic acidosis; increased PAP also decreases pulmonary blood flow with dynamic airway obstruction from distended small intrapulmonary arteries and lung oedema; consequently dead space ventilation increases and, with ventilation–perfusion mismatch, leads to hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.

### Pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment of pulmonary hypertension in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114p4BCB]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a characteristic feature of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The magnitude of PH has been shown to correlate with the severity of lung injury in patients with ARDS independently of the severity of associated hypoxaemia and has an adverse prognostic significance. Early in the histopathological evolution of ARDS, pulmonary vasoconstriction, thromboembolism and interstitial oedema contribute to the development of PH, although pulmonary vascular remodelling probably occurs eventually. Intravenous vasodilator agents lead to an increase in intrapulmonary shunting and systemic hypotension, which can limit their therapeutic use, and have not been shown to improve survival. By contrast, rapidly metabolised vasodilators administered by inhalation induce selective pulmonary vasodilatation and decrease shunting, but again do not appear to confer a survival benefit. Research aimed at further understanding the mechanisms that underlie pulmonary hypertension, a characteristic feature of the acute respiratory distress syndrome, are expected to provide improvements in pharmacological interventions for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure (HF) clinical syndrome and etiologies — The cardinal manifestations are dyspnea and fatigue that may limit exercise tolerance and fluid retention leading to pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema, and the term heart failure is preferred over congestive heart failure because not all patients have volume overload at evaluation. The syndrome may result from pericardial, myocardial, endocardial, or great vessel disorders, with most symptoms due to impairment of left ventricular (LV) myocardial function, and HF may range from normal LV size with preserved ejection fraction (EF) to severe dilatation and/or markedly reduced EF. Coronary artery disease, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease are substantial causes, and as many as 30% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may have a genetic cause. HF is not equivalent to cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction; it is defined as a clinical syndrome with specific symptoms and signs, and there is no single diagnostic test because diagnosis is based on careful history and physical examination.

### Recurrent hydrochlorothiazide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^112L2eEC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a commonly prescribed sulfonamide thiazide-type diuretic medication that has been associated with rare cases of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Case Report

A man in his 50s with a medical history notable for hypertension was transferred to our institution for evaluation of refractory hypoxemia. After taking an initial dose of HCTZ earlier in the day, he developed progressive respiratory failure and was intubated at a referring hospital. Progressive hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed and he was transferred to our institution for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Venovenous ECMO (vv-ECMO) was initiated in the Emergency Department and he was admitted to the intensive care unit. After several days of ECMO, his ARDS resolved and he was decannulated and extubated. Further history indicated that he had had two previous episodes of ARDS in the setting of HCTZ use without recognition of the inciting trigger, likely explaining his presentation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? One of the most commonly prescribed antihypertensives, HCTZ is associated with rare cases of pulmonary edema, which typically develop within minutes to hours of the initial dose of the medication. Although most cases resolve with supportive care, severe cases may require intubation and even vv-ECMO. The mechanism of the reaction is unknown, and affected individuals are typically able to tolerate other sulfonamide medications without issue.

### Acute pulmonary oedema in pregnant women [^113CVuNi]. Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary oedema in pregnant women is an uncommon but life-threatening event. The aims of this review are to address why pulmonary oedema occurs in pregnant women and to discuss immediate management. We performed a systematic literature search of electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, using the key words obstetrics, pregnancy, acute pulmonary oedema, pregnancy complications, maternal, cardiac function and haemodynamics. We present a simple clinical classification of acute pulmonary oedema in pregnancy into pulmonary oedema occurring in normotensive or hypotensive women (i.e. without hypertension), and acute pulmonary oedema occurring in hypertensive women, which allows focused management. Pre-eclampsia remains an important cause of hypertensive acute pulmonary oedema in pregnancy and preventive strategies include close clinical monitoring and restricted fluid administration. Immediate management of acute pulmonary oedema includes oxygenation, ventilation and circulation control with venodilators. Pregnancy-specific issues include consideration of the physiological changes of pregnancy, the risk of aspiration and difficult airway, reduced respiratory and metabolic reserve, avoidance of aortocaval compression and delivery of the fetus.

End-Organ Damage

End-organ damage from ADHF can occur via 2 main hemodynamic mechanisms: elevated venous and ventricular filling pressures resulting in congestion and hypoperfusion due to either decreased cardiac output or local hemodynamic regulation. Increased inflammation and oxidative stress may exacerbate these hemodynamic effects. The common organs affected by congestion, including the lungs, kidneys, liver, and gut. Pulmonary congestion results in increased hydrostatic forces across leaky pulmonary capillaries leading to pulmonary edema and, in many cases, pleural effusions. Recurrent cardiopulmonary insults cause alveolar stiffness and pulmonary fibrosis, further worsening alveolar gas diffusion and eventually resulting in pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group II) and restrictive ventilation.

Cardiorenal interplay is critical in the pathophysiology and management of ADHF. The renal system has direct control over preload management by signaling for increased or decreased urine output based on a number of complex pathways, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which regulates neurohormonal pathways that additionally control autonomic nervous system activation and vascular endothelium as mentioned above. This system is affected in the setting of acute renal injury, which may occur as ADHF sequelae or as a precipitating factor. Cardiorenal syndrome is formally classified into 5 subtypes with the most relevant pathophysiology being a combination result of poor cardiac output with poor renal perfusion and central venous congestion with increased afterload on the kidneys. Most studies have suggested that increased central venous pressure is a much more critical factor than reduced cardiac output, and some studies have demonstrated that worsening renal function is only predictive of poor cardiovascular outcomes when accompanied by persistent congestion. –

### Diagnosis: pulmonary hypertension. next steps [^1114CcFB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease that is generally first encountered by primary care physicians. Usually, patients present with dyspnea on exertion and a loss of exercise tolerance, although they can have symptoms of chest discomfort, syncope, or edema. Most patients are diagnosed with 2-dimensional Doppler echocardiography although echo is not 100% sensitive or specific in making this diagnosis. Note that the diagnostic criteria for this disease have changed recently. Most patients develop PH secondary to left heart failure, or to pulmonary disease with or without hypoxemia. Ultimately, many patients require right heart catheterization for diagnosis and for proper treatment. This is best performed by those that specialize in management of this disease. It is important to diagnose patients who have PH due to pulmonary artery hypertension and patients with chronic thromboembolic PH as these patients require specialized treatment that is most effective if started early in the disease course. This review discusses issues related to diagnosis and appropriate referral of patients with PH.

5	WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hypotension leading to syncope has been observed. Monitor vital signs while initiating VENTAVIS. VENTAVIS should not be administered in patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg (5.1).
Pulmonary venous hypertension: Discontinue if pulmonary edema is present (5.2).
May cause bronchospasm: Patients with a history of hyperreactive airway disease may be more sensitive (5.3).

5.1	Risk of Syncope

Monitor vital signs while initiating VENTAVIS. Do not initiate VENTAVIS in patients with systolic blood pressure below 85 mmHg. Syncope can also occur in association with pulmonary arterial hypertension, particularly in association with physical exertion. The occurrence of exertional syncope may reflect a therapeutic gap or insufficient efficacy, and the need to adjust dose or change therapy should be considered.

5.2	Pulmonary Venous Hypertension

Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when inhaled VENTAVIS is administered in patients with pulmonary hypertension, stop treatment immediately, as this may be a sign of pulmonary venous hypertension.

5.3	Bronchospasm

VENTAVIS inhalation can induce bronchospasm. Bronchospasm may be more severe or frequent in patients with a history of hyperreactive airways. VENTAVIS has not been evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, or with acute pulmonary infections.

5.4 Fluid Retention

Peripheral edema is a known clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH and is also a known effect of TRACLEER and other endothelin receptor antagonists. In PAH clinical trials with TRACLEER, combined adverse events of fluid retention or edema were reported in 1.7% (placebo-corrected) of patients.

In addition, there have been numerous postmarketing reports of fluid retention in patients with pulmonary hypertension occurring within weeks after starting TRACLEER. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

If clinically significant fluid retention develops, with or without associated weight gain, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause, such as TRACLEER or underlying heart failure, and the possible need for treatment or discontinuation of TRACLEER [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

5.5 Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease

If signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and consider whether TRACLEER should be discontinued.

5.6 Decreased Sperm Counts

Decreased sperm counts have been observed in patients receiving TRACLEER. Preclinical data also suggest that TRACLEER, similar to other endothelin receptor antagonists, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

5.7 Decreases in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Treatment with TRACLEER can cause a dose-related decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. There have been postmarketing reports of decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit that have resulted in anemia requiring transfusion. It is recommended that hemoglobin concentrations be checked after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. If a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Clinical outcomes in hypertensive emergency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117KWp8g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

To study the prevalence and types of hypertension‐mediated organ damage and the prognosis of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with hypertensive emergencies.

Methods and Results

PubMed was queried from inception through November 30, 2021. Studies were included if they reported the prevalence or prognosis of hypertensive emergencies in patients presenting to the ED. Studies reporting data on hypertensive emergencies in other departments were excluded. The extracted data were arcsine transformed and pooled using a random‐effects model. Fifteen studies (n = 4370 patients) were included. Pooled analysis demonstrates that the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.40%–0.70%) in all patients presenting to ED and 35.9% (95% CI, 26.7%–45.5%) among patients presenting in ED with hypertensive crisis. Ischemic stroke (28.1% [95% CI, 18.7%–38.6%]) was the most prevalent hypertension‐mediated organ damage, followed by pulmonary edema/acute heart failure (24.1% [95% CI, 19.0%–29.7%]), hemorrhagic stroke (14.6% [95% CI, 9.9%–20.0%]), acute coronary syndrome (10.8% [95% CI, 7.3%–14.8%]), renal failure (8.0% [95% CI, 2.9%–15.5%]), subarachnoid hemorrhage (6.9% [95% CI, 3.9%–10.7%]), encephalopathy (6.1% [95% CI, 1.9%–12.4%]), and the least prevalent was aortic dissection (1.8% [95% CI, 1.1%–2.8%]). Prevalence of in‐hospital mortality among patients with hypertensive emergency was 9.9% (95% CI, 1.4%–24.6%).

Conclusions

Our findings demonstrate a pattern of hypertension‐mediated organ damage primarily affecting the brain and heart, substantial cardiovascular renal morbidity and mortality, as well as subsequent hospitalization in patients with hypertensive emergencies presenting to the ED.

### Physiological mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension [^112aVx3r]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is usually related to obstruction of pulmonary blood flow at the level of the pulmonary arteries (eg, pulmonary embolus), pulmonary arterioles (idiopathic pulmonary hypertension), pulmonary veins (pulmonary venoocclusive disease) or mitral valve (mitral stenosis and regurgitation). Pulmonary hypertension is also observed in heart failure due to left ventricle myocardial diseases regardless of the ejection fraction. Pulmonary hypertension is often regarded as a passive response to the obstruction to pulmonary flow. We review established fluid dynamics and physiology and discuss the mechanisms underlying pulmonary hypertension. The important role that the right ventricle plays in the development and maintenance of pulmonary hypertension is discussed. We use principles of thermodynamics and discuss a potential common mechanism for a number of disease states, including pulmonary edema, through adding pressure energy to the pulmonary circulation.

### Using natriuretic peptides for selection of patients in acute heart failure clinical trials [^116qxrHh]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a complex syndrome with presentations ranging from hypotensive cardiogenic shock to hypertensive emergency with pulmonary edema. Most patients with AHF present with worsening of chronic HF signs and symptoms over days to weeks, and significant heterogeneity exists. It can, therefore, be challenging to characterize the overall population. The complexity of defining the AHF phenotype has been cited as a contributing cause for neutral results in most pharmacologic trials in patients with AHF. Dyspnea has been a routine inclusion criterion for AHF for over a decade, but the utility of current instruments for dyspnea assessment has been called into question. Furthermore, the threshold of clinical severity that prompts patient admission of an HF clinic visit may vary substantially across regions in global trials. Therefore, the inclusion of cardiac-specific biomarkers has been incorporated into AHF trials as 1 strategy to support inclusion of the target patient population and potentially enrich the population with patients at risk for clinical outcomes. In conclusion, we discuss strategies to support appropriate patient selection in AHF trials with an emphasis on using biomarker criteria that may improve the likelihood of success with future AHF clinical trials.

### Management of hypertensive crises: the scientific basis for treatment decisions [^112tyNYF]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The spectrum of disorders associated with an elevated blood pressure (BP) encompasses chronic uncomplicated hypertension and the hypertensive crises, including hypertensive urgencies and emergencies. Although these syndromes vary widely in their presentations, clinical courses, and outcomes they share pathophysiologic mechanisms and, consequently, therapeutic responses to specifically targeted antihypertensive drug types. Nevertheless, hypertensive crises are often treated with drugs which, in that setting are either unsafe or are of unsubstantiated efficacy. The purpose of this review is to examine the pathophysiology of commonly encountered hypertensive crises, including stroke, hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, acute pulmonary edema, and preeclampsia-eclampsia and to provide a rational approach to their treatment based upon relevant pathophysiologic and pharmacologic principles. Measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA) level often provides insight regarding pathophysiology and predicts efficacy of antihypertensive treatments in the individual patient. However, in hypertensive crises, drug therapy is initiated before the PRA level is known. Nevertheless, the renin-angiotensin dependence (R-type) or volume dependence (V-type) of hypertension can often be deduced by the BP response to drugs that interrupt the renin system (R-drugs) or that decrease body volume (V-drugs). Based upon these considerations, a treatment algorithm is provided to guide drug selection in patients presenting with a hypertensive crisis.

ASSESSING AND TREATING HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES

Hypertensive emergencies classically occur in patients with systolic BP (SBP) > 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > 120 mm Hg. Nevertheless, lower thresholds can be associated with hypertensive emergencies in the setting of rapid elevations from low-to-normal baseline BP. Furthermore, BP elevations > 170/100 mm Hg can cause worsening target-organ injury in select patients. Elevated BP values in isolation, no matter how high they may be, do not by themselves define a hypertensive emergency unless the patient has concomitant acute organ injury for which immediate BP lowering will modify this injury. Thus, terms such as "hypertensive crisis", which have been historically assigned to all patients with markedly elevated BP have little utility in contemporary practice. New or worsening end-organ injury occurs in the cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, hematologic, and renovascular systems. The most common hypertensive emergencies are stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and acute heart failure leading to pulmonary edema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a rare and poorly understood condition that may reflect direct adverse acute effects of markedly elevated BP on the brain.

Most ED patients with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg have elevated BP without evidence of end-organ injury. These patients have no immediate indication for rapid BP lowering. Though a common concern among ED providers, hypertensive emergency is rare in patients with elevated BP in the ED. Thus, while all hypertensive emergencies should be managed with intravenous (IV) antihypertensive therapy to achieve immediate BP reduction, few patients require such intervention. Beyond hypertensive emergency, IV antihypertensive therapy is only indicated for select patients with strict oral medication restrictions and patients abruptly withdrawing from beta-blockade or sympatholytic therapy. These latter patients may benefit from IV labetalol. Given the aforementioned variability in clinical practice, it is not surprising that the majority of IV medications given to achieve immediate BP reduction in the ED are done so inappropriately to patients without new or worsening end-organ injury that can be modified by rapid treatment.

### Pulmonary hypertension in mitral regurgitation [^113uvewb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The processes that govern the development of pulmonary hypertension in MR are multifactorial (see Figure 2) and are not yet fully understood. Elevation of LAP, which occurs not only in acute MR, but also in the transitional and decompensated phases of chronic MR, is believed to be the initiating factor in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. Sustained elevation of LAP, which is passively transmitted backward into the pulmonary veins, can lead to disruption of the delicate alveolar‐capillary complex in a process known as alveolar capillary stress failure, with resulting capillary leakage and pulmonary edema. In the initial phases, this lesion is reversible. However, with long‐standing pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH), the alveolar‐capillary unit may be irreversibly altered by a remodeling process characterized by excessive type IV collagen deposition, leading to a reduction in alveolar diffusion capacity.

Figure 2.
Pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension in mitral regurgitation. Chronic severe mitral regurgitation induces compensatory LV and LA dilation in the initial phase, but over time, leads to LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, reduced LA compliance, and elevated LA pressure in the decompensated phase. Backward transmission of elevated left atrial pressures can cause disruption of the alveolar capillary complex with resultant pulmonary edema. Long‐standing passive pulmonary hypertension resulting from venous congestion can lead to structural changes in the distal arterioles and endothelial injury with vascular functional abnormalities, which can then cause elevation in transpulmonary gradient and reactive pulmonary hypertension. Chronic right ventricular pressure overload resulting from pulmonary hypertension ultimately leads to cavity dilation and contractile dysfunction.

Misguided Importance Attributed to Highin Emergency Care

The concept that sustained high BP was associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events was consolidated. The idea that high BP was also the cause of immediate consequences was a corollary of this knowledge, creating the theoretical grounds to propose immediate intervention over BP in patients presenting with acute clinical conditions.

Most patients with stroke, acute pulmonary edema, aortic dissection, encephalopathy, and others present with high BP in emergency rooms. These clinical conditions were then recognized as a consequence of acute BP rising. The perception of reversal causality, for example, BP increasing as a response to the damage or dysfunction of organs, particularly the brain and heart, was missed because the diagnosis of high BP and those clinical conditions was concurrent. This misguided interpretation also occurred with more trivial clinical conditions, such as headache and epistaxis.

The recommendation to treat high BP as a means to interrupt a worse clinical course of the clinical conditions that characterize hypertensive emergencies was included in medical textbooks and guidelines. This notion still prevails in emergency care worldwide and may eventually give primacy to measures to lower BP, delaying the treatment the primary clinical diagnosis.

### Prognostic factors in acute pulmonary edema… [^113fb7UD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Over a six-month period, 106 admissions of 94 patients for acute pulmonary edema were identified and their charts were reviewed. Precipitating factors for acute pulmonary edema included progressively worsening congestive heart failure in 25. 5% of cases, coronary insufficiency in
20. 8%, subendocardial myocardial infarction in 16. 0%, acute transmural myocardial infarction in
10. 4%, arrhythmia in 8. 5%, medical noncompliance in
6. 6%, and other causes in 12. 6%. In-hospital mortality was 17. 0%. Of those patients discharged from the hospital, an additional 27 were dead at one year, giving an overall one-year mortality of 51. 2%. We found that patients with progressively worsening congestive heart failure have a better prognosis than patients with other precipitants. Also, patients with an initial systolic blood pressure in the emergency room of 160 mm Hg or higher had an improved survival over patients with an initial systolic blood pressure under 160 mm Hg.

No other in-hospital or long-term prognostic factors were identified. Goldberger JJ, Peled HB, Stroh JA, Cohen MN, Frishman WH. Prognostic Factors in Acute Pulmonary Edema. Arch Intern Med. 1986; 146: 489–493.

### SCAI / HFSA clinical expert consensus document on the use of invasive hemodynamics for the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease [^1135imwo]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) invasive hemodynamic assessment — differentiation of pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and exercise testing — is outlined as follows: Invasive hemodynamic assessment of pulmonary artery and left-sided pressures is necessary for all patients being considered for vasodilator therapy, and evaluations must establish left heart filling status with normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) defined as < 18 mm Hg; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is only a surrogate of LVEDP and can be normal when LVEDP is elevated. All PCWP measurements should be confirmed with oximetry or, when equivocal, direct left atrial pressure, and if there is a suspicion of left heart disease with a normal PCWP, direct LVEDP measurement can clarify the problem. During vasoreactivity testing, caution should be exercised with selective vasodilators due to risk of pulmonary edema; inhaled nitric oxide can acutely exacerbate left heart congestion, whereas sildenafil frequently relieves it in PH with an elevated PCWP. For exercise hemodynamics, it is important that cardiac output (CO) during exercise be directly measured because formula-based VO2 estimates do not account for the increase with exercise; a graded bicycle ergometer protocol with a 5- to 10-Watt-per-minute ramp is described, and the normal response includes a rise in CO, absence of significant increases in atrial pressures, and a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) such that mean pulmonary artery pressure should remain < 30 mm Hg at a CO of 10 liters per minute.

### Right heart failure: a narrative review for emergency clinicians [^116eGqMv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Right heart failure (RHF) is a clinical syndrome with impaired right ventricular cardiac output due to a variety of etiologies including ischemia, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, or volume overload. Emergency department (ED) patients with an acute RHF exacerbation can be diagnostically and therapeutically challenging to manage.

Objective

This narrative review describes the pathophysiology of right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, the methods to diagnose RHF in the ED, and management strategies.

Discussion

Right ventricular contraction normally occurs against a low pressure, highly compliant pulmonary vascular system. This physiology makes the right ventricle susceptible to acute changes in afterload, which can lead to RHF. Patients with acute RHF may present with an acute illness and have underlying chronic pulmonary hypertension due to left ventricular failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic lung conditions, thromboemboli, or idiopathic conditions. Patients can present with a variety of symptoms resulting from systemic edema and hemodynamic compromise. Evaluation with electrocardiogram, laboratory analysis, and imaging is necessary to evaluate cardiac function and end organ injury. Management focuses on treating the underlying condition, optimizing oxygenation and ventilation, treating arrhythmias, and understanding the patient's hemodynamics with bedside ultrasound. As RHF patients are preload dependent they may require fluid resuscitation or diuresis. Hypotension should be rapidly addressed with vasopressors. Cardiac contractility can be augmented with inotropes. Efforts should be made to support oxygenation while trying to avoid intubation if possible.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician understanding of this condition is important to diagnose and treat this life-threatening cardiopulmonary disorder.

Hypertensive emergencies — burden and management principles: Patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. Common forms of acute hypertension-related target organ damage include acute heart failure/pulmonary edema, neurologic disorders (encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], acute ischemic stroke), and acute kidney injury (AKI), with aortic dissection the least common presentation. Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of blood pressure (BP) to prevent or limit further target organ damage, whereas patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy; reinstitution or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients.

The presentation of PAH may be modified by diseases that are associated with PAH, as well as comorbidities. Clinical assessment is a key part of evaluating patients with PAH, and at follow-up changes in WHO functional class (WHO-FC), episodes of chest pain, arrhythmias, haemoptysis, syncope, and signs of right heart failure (HF) provide important information. Physical examination should assess heart rate, rhythm, blood pressure, cyanosis, enlarged jugular veins, oedema, ascites, and pleural effusions, and the WHO-FC is one of the strongest predictors of survival.

### Serial sonographic assessment of pulmonary edema in patients with hypertensive acute heart failure [^113yyeW6]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Objective measures of clinical improvement in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine whether repeated lung sonography could semiquantitatively capture changes in pulmonary edema (B-lines) in patients with hypertensive AHF early in the course of treatment.

Methods

We conducted a feasibility study in a cohort of adults with acute onset of dyspnea, severe hypertension in the field or at triage (systolic blood pressure ≥ 180mm Hg), and a presumptive diagnosis of AHF. Patients underwent repeated dyspnea and lung sonographic assessments using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) and an 8-zone scanning protocol. Lung sonographic assessments were performed at the time of triage, initial VAS improvement, and disposition from the emergency department. Sonographic pulmonary edema was independently scored offline in a randomized and blinded fashion by using a scoring method that accounted for both the sum of discrete B-lines and degree of B-line fusion.

Results

Sonographic pulmonary edema scores decreased significantly from initial to final sonographic assessments (P < .001). The median percentage decrease among the 20 included patient encounters was 81% (interquartile range, 55%-91%). Although sonographic pulmonary edema scores correlated with VAS scores (ρ = 0.64; P < .001), the magnitude of the change in these scores did not correlate with each other (ρ = -0.04; p = 0.89).

Conclusions

Changes in sonographic pulmonary edema can be semiquantitatively measured by serial 8-zone lung sonography using a scoring method that accounts for B-line fusion. Sonographic pulmonary edema improves in patients with hypertensive AHF during the initial hours of treatment.

Patients on diuretics should regularly monitor body weight and seek medical advice in case of weight gain; kidney function and serum electrolytes should be regularly monitored, and intravascular volume depletion must be avoided due to risks of reduced cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. Clinicians should also recognize that fluid retention and oedema may be a side effect of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy.

Absence of Clinical Trials With Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Hypertensive Emergencies

Patients presenting with the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency have already a diagnosis of an acute cardiovascular event on course. Therefore, treatments would aim to reduce complications of the clinical conditions that characterize the occurrence of hypertensive emergencies, particularly the evolution to fatal outcomes or more severe complications. The strategy to reach these goals should be tested in randomized clinical trials, which should depart from the definition of the disease to be treated. Hypertensive emergencies do not fill this criterion because various clinical conditions define it. The simple decision to treat or not treat is naturally different in patients with stroke, acute left ventricular failure, angina, and others. Moreover, there is no common denominator among the different clinical conditions to justify a similar BP‐lowering strategy for all.

The use of BP‐lowering drugs in the absence of such trials could be eventually justified because the hypertensive response worsens the clinical condition, such as acute pulmonary edema. In this case, however, the treatment should be tailored to the underlining diagnosis, which is better defined by guidelines and protocols specific to each clinical condition.

### Ambrisentan (Letairis) [^116yijQm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Embryo-fetal Toxicity

Based on data from animal reproduction studies, Letairis may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and is contraindicated during pregnancy. The available human data for endothelin receptor antagonists do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects related to the use of Letairis. Advise patients who can become pregnant of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test prior to initiation of treatment with Letairis. Advise patients who can become pregnant to use effective contraception prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment, and for one month after discontinuation of treatment with Letairis. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue use as soon as possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2 Fluid Retention

Peripheral edema is a known class effect of endothelin receptor antagonists, and is also a clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH. In the placebo-controlled studies, there was an increased incidence of peripheral edema in patients treated with doses of 5 or 10 mg Letairis compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most edema was mild to moderate in severity.

In addition, there have been postmarketing reports of fluid retention in patients with pulmonary hypertension, occurring within weeks after starting Letairis. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or, in some cases, hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

If clinically significant fluid retention develops, with or without associated weight gain, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause, such as Letairis or underlying heart failure, and the possible need for specific treatment or discontinuation of Letairis therapy.

Peripheral edema/fluid retention is more common with Letairis plus tadalafil than with Letairis or tadalafil alone.

5.3 Pulmonary Edema with Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease (PVOD)

If patients develop acute pulmonary edema during initiation of therapy with vasodilating agents such as Letairis, the possibility of PVOD should be considered, and if confirmed Letairis should be discontinued.

5.4 Decreased Sperm Counts

Decreased sperm counts have been observed in human and animal studies with another endothelin receptor antagonist and in animal fertility studies with ambrisentan.

### AMPK deficiency in smooth muscles causes persistent pulmonary hypertension of the new-born and premature death [^115rjGu4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The present investigation reveals a direct link between smooth muscle-selective AMPK-α1/α2 deficiency and persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension of the new-born. The primary characteristics were as follows: (1) increased medial thickness throughout the pulmonary arterial tree and muscle evident in arteries that would normally be non-muscular; (2) hypertrophy rather than proliferation of pulmonary arterial myocytes; (3) no evidence of intimal fibrosis, hyperplasia or plexiform lesions (although plexiform lesions are not common features in mouse models); (4) simplification of alveoli and reduced alveolar numbers, with thickening of alveolar walls and no sign of intra-alveolar or interstitial edema; (5) increases in pulmonary-vascular resistance; (6) right ventricular dilation and increased right ventricular volume/weight ratio; (7) age-dependent increases in right ventricular pressures and decreases in cardiac output; (8) attenuation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and thus acute hypoxic pulmonary hypertension; (9) no significant parenchymal fibrosis or lung oedema, indicating that pulmonary vasculopathy arose independent of either left ventricular dysfunction or chronic congestive heart failure.

### Epoprostenol sodium (Flolan) [^1154oT2M]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Pulmonary edema: Discontinue therapy if pulmonary edema occurs. (5.1)
Rebound pulmonary hypertension: Do not abruptly discontinue or decrease the dose. (5.2)
Vasodilation reactions: Monitor blood pressure and symptoms regularly during initiation and after dose change. (5.3)
Increased risk for bleeding: Increased risk for hemorrhagic complications, particularly for patients with other risk factors for bleeding. (5.4)

5.1 Pulmonary Edema

If the patient develops pulmonary edema during initiation with FLOLAN, discontinue therapy and do not readminister. Consider the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in such patients.

5.2 Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension following Abrupt Withdrawal

Avoid abrupt withdrawal (including interruptions in drug delivery) or sudden large reductions in dosage of FLOLAN because symptoms associated with rebound pulmonary hypertension (e.g., dyspnea, dizziness, and asthenia) may occur. In clinical trials, one Class III patient's death was judged attributable to the interruption of FLOLAN.

5.3 Vasodilation

FLOLAN is a potent pulmonary and systemic vasodilator and can cause hypotension and other reactions such as flushing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Monitor blood pressure and symptoms regularly during initiation and after dose change [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.4 Increased Risk for Bleeding

FLOLAN is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Therefore, expect an increased risk for hemorrhagic complications, particularly for patients with other risk factors for bleeding [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### 2019 updated consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric pulmonary hypertension: the European pediatric pulmonary vascular disease network (EPPVDN), endorsed by AEPC, ESPR and ISHLT [^1167x7hG]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in pediatrics — recent developments include that the first randomized pediatric PAH trials have been conducted recently, and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PVOD/PCH) is now considered within the spectrum of PAH and is associated with a particularly poor prognosis, very limited response to PAH therapy, and the risk of pulmonary edema with vasodilator therapy; this statement makes recommendations on early combination therapy (double or triple) in PAH patients in WHO functional class II–IV, including those with inadequate response to the initial pharmacotherapy, and notes that in those patients with progressive, severe PAH and inadequate response to therapy, advances in drug development and both interventional and surgical procedures provide strategies to prevent, reverse, or ameliorate RV pressure overload, left ventricular compression/underfilling, and ultimately end-stage heart failure.

### Management of hypertensive crisis for the obstetrician / gynecologist [^1129C1fv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are among the leading preventable contributors of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, including maternal and fetal death. Blood pressure increase has a strong association with unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, including stroke and pulmonary edema. A persistent blood pressure measurement greater than or equal to 160/110 mm Hg lasting for more than 15 minutes, during pregnancy or postpartum, is considered an obstetric emergency and requires rapid appropriate treatment. Following evidence-based guidelines, implementing institutional polices, and understanding the classification and pathophysiology of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are essential and can significantly improve the rate of preventable complications.

### Therapeutic challenges and emerging treatment targets for pulmonary hypertension in left heart disease [^112s4DyQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Compared with PAH, the underlying pathophysiology and histopathological associations with PH‐LHD are limited and not yet understood. Small exploratory studies have added to our understanding of underlying mechanisms in PH‐LHD (Figure 1, Table 2). In 108 patients with PH‐LHD, global pulmonary vascular remodeling with severe medial and intimal thickening of the veins similar to patients with pulmonary veno‐occlusive disease was identified. The severity of PH, based on PASP from echocardiography and transpulmonary gradient and PVR from RHC, was strongly correlated with the degree of pulmonary venous remodeling. Extensive venous remodeling in pulmonary veno‐occlusive disease can increase the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure gradient and lead to alveolar edema precipitated by increases in pulmonary arterial blood flow attributable to PAH‐targeted vasodilators. These findings could explain the predisposition of patients with HF to worsening pulmonary edema in response to pulmonary vasodilators that is similar to pulmonary veno‐occlusive disease. The findings also provide the pathobiology of pulmonary venous remodeling as a potential treatment target for PH‐LHD. A mouse model of aortic constriction‐induced left HF and advanced PH exhibited increased wet and dry lung weights that were not associated with pulmonary edema, but with pulmonary fibrosis and remodeling. The extensive increase in the proportion of muscularized lung vessels was seen with myofibroblast proliferation and leukocyte infiltration. In addition to pulmonary fibrosis, right ventricular fibrosis in PH‐HFpEF has been associated with worsening right ventricular diastolic volume and right ventricular free wall strain. This indicates an inadequate structural and functional remodeling of the right ventricle. However, right ventricular fibrosis was not associated with total pulmonary resistance as it was in PAH. This suggests that the diffuse right ventricular fibrosis in PH‐HFpEF may be out of proportion to the right ventricular afterload seen in this disease. This observation offers a distinct pathophysiology for PH‐HFpEF compared with PAH.

### Acute effects of intracranial hypertension and ARDS on pulmonary and neuronal damage: a randomized experimental study in pigs [^114BxjGn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study support the hypothesis that acute intracranial hypertension causes cerebral and pulmonary edema. The latter reduces the gas–tissue ratio in previously healthy lungs without causing histologically detectable pulmonary damage or changes in gas exchange parameters. AICH also exacerbates the pre-existing damage in animals with ARDS.

Plasma concentrations of NSE and S100B increased in all treatment groups. TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β responded in different ways to intracranial hypertension and acute lung injury, but there was a consistent increase in animals with ARDS which was augmented by intracranial hypertension. Hippocampal damage and cerebral edema was greatest in animals with combined ARDS and intracranial hypertension. This is in agreement with clinical reports and could indicate reciprocal synergistic effects.

The initial pulmonary responses to acute intracranial hypertension are an increase in ELWI and lung density that are not detectable by chest radiography or blood gas analysis until frank pulmonary edema ensues. Our findings confirm this and underscore the importance of ELWI as an early indicator of lung injury and ARDS.

Proposed mechanisms for the development of neurogenic pulmonary edema, i.e. the increase in ELWI after an acute neurologic injury are a massive increase in cerebral sympathetic outflow causing acute pulmonary venoconstriction with a fluid shift into the interstitium. There is a simultaneous activation of inflammatory responses that further increase the permeability of the endothelium for proteins.

The reduction in heart rate variability supports the role of sympathetic activation, but we did not see the blood pressure increase that was observed in a similar animal model, in which inflation of an intracranial Fogarty catheter was used to induce brain death. Pulmonary venoconstriction is also unlikely to increase arterial pressures, and the increase in pulmonary arterial pressures in the animals with ARDS is probably a consequence and not a cause of pulmonary pathology. Su et al. concluded that the increase in sympathetic activity may be relative to decreased parasympathetic activity secondary to brain stem damage. Avlonitis et al. showed that the inflammatory response is significantly decreased in brain-dead animals when the initial catecholamine storm is treated with phentolamine and the following hypotension is treated with noradrenaline. Our results suggest that not only brain death but also isolated AICH might induce NSE release and systemic inflammation. A recent study showed that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduced mortality in elderly patients with blunt head injuries.

### Interventional strategies for children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111RSkAo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — pediatric pulmonary hypertension with suspected PCH or PVOD: In patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and imaging features suggestive of PCH or PVOD, pulmonary edema may occur with pulmonary vasodilators, so careful use is emphasized and transplant evaluation is prioritized. PCH or PVOD should be suspected when chest imaging shows nodular ground-glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and/or lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary edema, at times severe, may develop with the use of pulmonary vasodilators, yet many patients may derive some benefit from carefully titrated pulmonary vasodilator therapy balanced with concomitant diuretic use. Given increased risk and potentially limited benefit, caution should be used with the initiation and titration of pulmonary vasodilators, and early referral for lung transplantation evaluation is highly recommended for a child with PCH or PVOD.

### Frequency of edema in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension receiving ambrisentan [^114oauTE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Edema is a common side effect of endothelin receptor antagonists. Ambrisentan is an endothelin type A-selective endothelin receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We examined the clinical outcomes of patients who developed edema with and without ambrisentan treatment in 2 phase III, randomized placebo-controlled trials, ambrisentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: results of the ambrisentan in pulmonary arterial hypertension, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, efficacy (ARIES) study 1 and 2 (ARIES-1 and ARIES-2) (n = 393). Edema-related adverse events were extracted using broad adverse event search terms. The present post hoc analysis included 132 placebo patients and 261 ambrisentan patients. Of these patients, 14% of the placebo patients and 23% of the ambrisentan patients experienced edema-related adverse events. Overall, the patients who experienced edema tended to have a worse baseline World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (edema 76%, WHO functional class III-IV; no edema 56%, WHO functional class III-IV). In the ambrisentan patients, those with edema were older (mean age 58 ± 13 years) and heavier (mean weight 75 ± 19 kg) than those without edema (mean age 49 ± 15 years; mean weight 70 ± 17 kg). At week 12 of treatment, the ambrisentan patients had significantly increased their 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) by 34.4 m compared to the placebo patients in whom the 6MWD had deteriorated by -9.0 m (p < 0.001). Among the ambrisentan patients, those without edema had a 6MWD increase of 38.9 m and those with edema had a 6MWD increase of 19.4 m. Ambrisentan significantly improved the brain natriuretic peptide levels by -34% compared to the brain natriuretic peptide levels in the placebo group that had worsened by +11% (p < 0.001). Ambrisentan reduced the brain natriuretic peptide concentrations similarly in patients with and without edema. In conclusion, the present subanalysis of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension has revealed that ambrisentan therapy provides clinical benefit compared to placebo, even in the presence of edema.

### Congestive lower extremity failure: an educational model for improved understanding of phlebolymphedema [^111ckirT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of venous and lymphatic diseases and phlebolymphedema is, therefore, becoming increasingly complex and difficult to teach with existing educational models. Hence, medical students, young doctors, and even clinically advanced physicians and practitioners struggle to stay abreast of these dogma-altering concepts, as we attempt to integrate a renewed understanding of this "conundrum of the microcirculation". Successfully bridging and overcoming this significant educational challenge has the potential reward of improving clinical assessment, diagnosis, and therapeutic management, and to decrease the recidivism rate of patients with phlebolymphedema and its associated complications and morbidities.

In the effort to improve the educational model, we look to congestive heart failure (CHF) as an analogy. CHF is a well-known and well-understood pathophysiologic process that medical students, residents, and fellows can understand, describe in detail, and treat with a high and reproducible level of competency. We believe that CHF can serve as a descriptive analogy for phlebolymphedema, and it can be used as a model for what we introduce here as a novel concept: congestive lower extremity failure (CLEF). The comparison seems obvious; endothelial inflammation and valvular destruction are at the root of both pathologies. In CHF, inflammation is often the primary culprit, which instigates mitral valve destruction, mitral insufficiency, and regurgitation. This pathological reversal of flow causes overload of the left atrium and pulmonary hypertension eventually ensues. Chronic pulmonary hypertension favors further inflammatory processes, resulting in pulmonary edema. Parenchymal lung edema results in respiratory complications owing to volume overload, the compromise of microarterial perfusion, and the concomitant negative impact on gas exchange. Patients typically present with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, and fatigue as cardiac pump failure also develops. The ultimate end-stage effects are characterized by pulmonary microinfarctions, tissue fibrosis, and respiratory failure (Fig).

### Pulmonary hypertension [^116yR6R1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is the term used to describe a group of disorders characterized by abnormally high pressures in the pulmonary arteries. Initial evaluation is focused on identifying the cause, which helps guide appropriate treatment. Pulmonary hypertension is often a feature of advanced common diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and left heart disease, and treatment is focused primarily on the underlying disease. More rarely, pulmonary hypertension results from chronic organized thromboemboli or a primary vasculopathy. The former requires evaluation for surgical intervention, and the latter is treated with advanced medical therapies.

### ISHLT consensus statement: perioperative management of patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure undergoing surgery [^115LWTij]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

Preoperative stabilization and optimization for non-emergent cardiac surgery in heart failure emphasize controlling congestion, while emergent cases should not delay intervention for volume optimization. For non-emergent surgery, it is recommended that heart failure is stabilized prior to surgery, and this recommendation is based on poorer outcomes in patients who are classified as decompensated at the time of surgery; because high filling pressures are directly linked to clinical pulmonary edema and increased RV afterload, the risk for perioperative pulmonary edema and RVF should be reduced by preoperative optimization for elective cases, whereas if cardiac surgery is emergent due to myocardial ischemia or unstable critical valve disease, waiting to improve volume status is not recommended.

### High altitude, a natural research laboratory for the study of cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology [^117M82D1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

High altitude constitutes an exciting natural laboratory for medical research. Although initially, the aim of high-altitude research was to understand the adaption of the organism to hypoxia and find treatments for altitude-related diseases, during the past decade or so, the scope of this research has broadened considerably. Two important observations led the foundation for the broadening of the scientific scope of high-altitude research. First, high-altitude pulmonary edema represents a unique model that allows studying fundamental mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension and lung edema in humans. Second, the ambient hypoxia associated with high-altitude exposure facilitates the detection of pulmonary and systemic vascular dysfunction at an early stage. Here, we will review studies that, by capitalizing on these observations, have led to the description of novel mechanisms underpinning lung edema and pulmonary hypertension and to the first direct demonstration of fetal programming of vascular dysfunction in humans.

### Nitric oxide (Inomax) [^1161Ayzk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Rebound: Abrupt discontinuation of INOmax may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure (5.1).

Methemoglobinemia: Methemoglobin increases with the dose of nitric oxide; following discontinuation or reduction of nitric oxide, methemoglobin levels return to baseline over a period of hours (5.2).

Elevated NO2Levels: Monitor NO2levels (5.3).

Heart Failure: In patients with pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, INOmax may increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure leading to pulmonary edema (5.4).

5.1 Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome following Abrupt Discontinuation

Wean from INOmax [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Abrupt discontinuation of INOmax may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure, i.e. Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome include hypoxemia, systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and decreased cardiac output. If Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension occurs, reinstate INOmax therapy immediately.

5.2 Hypoxemia from Methemoglobinemia

Nitric oxide combines with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, which does not transport oxygen. Methemoglobin levels increase with the dose of INOmax; it can take 8 hours or more before steady-state methemoglobin levels are attained. Monitor methemoglobin and adjust the dose of INOmax to optimize oxygenation.

If methemoglobin levels do not resolve with decrease in dose or discontinuation of INOmax, additional therapy may be warranted to treat methemoglobinemia [see Overdosage (10)].

5.3 Airway Injury from Nitrogen Dioxide

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) forms in gas mixtures containing NO and O2. Nitrogen dioxide may cause airway inflammation and damage to lung tissues.

If there is an unexpected change in NO2concentration, or if the NO2concentration reaches 3 ppm when measured in the breathing circuit, then the delivery system should be assessed in accordance with the Nitric Oxide Delivery System O&M Manual troubleshooting section, and the NO2analyzer should be recalibrated. The dose of INOmax and/or FiO2should be adjusted as appropriate.

5.4 Worsening Heart Failure

Patients with left ventricular dysfunction treated with INOmax may experience pulmonary edema, increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, worsening of left ventricular dysfunction, systemic hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Discontinue INOmax while providing symptomatic care.

### Pulmonary vascular disease in the setting of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113fqZMZ]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is defined as clinical features of heart failure, ideally with biomarker evidence such as elevated plasma natriuretic peptide levels, in the setting of an ejection fraction (EF) greater than 50% and imaging evidence of diastolic left ventricular dysfunction [1,2]. In the absence of cardiac imaging or invasive hemodynamics, this is a clinical syndrome that is often indistinguishable from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). HFpEF and HFrEF present with a cadre of comparable signs and symptoms including jugular venous distention, pulmonary rales on auscultation, breathlessness, orthopnea, exercise intolerance, exertional dyspnea, fatigue and peripheral edema. HFpEF accounts for at least half of all diagnoses of heart failure [1,2]. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common complication of HFpEF that is linked to worse disease morbidity and mortality. In fact, mortality has been linked to increases in the intrinsic pulmonary vascular resistance in the setting of increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure, characterized hemodynamically by rises in the transpulmonary pressure gradient, pulmonary vascular resistance or diastolic pressure gradient. Despite being the most common form of PH, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of PH secondary to HFpEF. This review will summarize the hemodynamic classifications of PH in the setting of HFpEF, mechanisms of disease, the potential contribution of pulmonary vascular disease to poor outcomes in patients with HFpEF, and new approaches to therapy.

### Pickering syndrome: an overlooked renovascular cause of recurrent heart failure [^115uLewp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

In 1988, Pickering et al first described recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema and reduced kidney function in patients with arterial hypertension and bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney, a condition thereafter named Pickering syndrome. The term flash was used by Pickering to describe pulmonary edemas that occurred rapidly and repeatedly in these patients, like the flash of a camera. Activation of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS), in the setting of an impaired glomerular filtration rate caused by the renal artery stenosis and multi‐infarct cortical nephropathy, was suggested to set the stage for sodium and water retention, progressive worsening of renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, and altered lung vascular permeability. In the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy attributable to hypertensive cardiomyopathy, which impairs diastolic left ventricular filling, these alterations lead to lung congestion with recurrent pulmonary edema (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Pickering syndrome.

In patients with arterial hypertension and bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney, the activation of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) and other hormonal axes, in the setting of an impaired glomerular filtration rate caused by renal ischemia and multi‐infarct cortical nephropathy, sets the stage for sodium and water retention, progressive worsening of renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, worsening New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and altered lung vascular permeability. In the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) attributable to hypertensive cardiomyopathy, with ensuing diastolic dysfunction, these alterations predispose to lung congestion with recurrent flash pulmonary edema, a condition named Pickering syndrome. BP indicates blood pressure; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; ET‐1, endothelin‐1; IV, intravenous; LA, left atrial; LV, left ventricular; LVED, LV end diastolic; LVMI, LV mass index; ΔP, differential pressure; PCW, pulmonary capillary wedge; and SNS, sympathetic nervous system.

High altitude–related pulmonary hypertension (PH) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) — Recommendations are as follows: Patients with symptomatic high altitude–related PH may be encouraged to move to low altitude (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy (with amlodipine or nifedipine) may be reasonable for HAPE prophylaxis in children with a history of HAPE (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). Therapy for symptomatic HAPE should include supplemental oxygen therapy and consideration of immediate descent (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Children with HAPE should undergo evaluation to rule out abnormalities of pulmonary arteries or pulmonary veins, lung disease, or abnormal control of breathing (Class I; Level of Evidence B).

### Ambrisentan [^112kRz9m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Embryo-fetal Toxicity

Based on data from animal reproduction studies, ambrisentan tablets may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and is contraindicated during pregnancy. The available human data for endothelin receptor antagonists do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects related to the use of ambrisentan tablets. Advise patients who can become pregnant of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test prior to initiation of treatment with ambrisentan tablets. Advise patients who can become pregnant to use effective contraception prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment, and for one month after discontinuation of treatment with ambrisentan tablets. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue use as soon as possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.2 Fluid Retention

Peripheral edema is a known class effect of endothelin receptor antagonists, and is also a clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH. In the placebo-controlled studies, there was an increased incidence of peripheral edema in patients treated with doses of 5 or 10 mg ambrisentan tablets compared to placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most edema was mild to moderate in severity.

In addition, there have been postmarketing reports of fluid retention in patients with pulmonary hypertension, occurring within weeks after starting ambrisentan tablets. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or, in some cases, hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

If clinically significant fluid retention develops, with or without associated weight gain, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause, such as ambrisentan or underlying heart failure, and the possible need for specific treatment or discontinuation of ambrisentan therapy.

5.3 Pulmonary Edema with Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease (PVOD)

If patients develop acute pulmonary edema during initiation of therapy with vasodilating agents such as ambrisentan, the possibility of PVOD should be considered, and if confirmed ambrisentan tablets should be discontinued.

5.4 Decreased Sperm Counts

Decreased sperm counts have been observed in human and animal studies with another endothelin receptor antagonist and in animal fertility studies with ambrisentan. Ambrisentan may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Clinical outcomes in hypertensive emergency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nxP77]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background To study the prevalence and types of hypertension-mediated organ damage and the prognosis of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with hypertensive emergencies. Methods and Results PubMed was queried from inception through November 30, 2021. Studies were included if they reported the prevalence or prognosis of hypertensive emergencies in patients presenting to the ED. Studies reporting data on hypertensive emergencies in other departments were excluded. The extracted data were arcsine transformed and pooled using a random-effects model. Fifteen studies (n = 4370 patients) were included. Pooled analysis demonstrates that the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies was 0.5% (95% CI, 0.40%-0.70%) in all patients presenting to ED and 35.9% (95% CI, 26.7%-45.5%) among patients presenting in ED with hypertensive crisis. Ischemic stroke (28.1% [95% CI, 18.7%-38.6%]) was the most prevalent hypertension-mediated organ damage, followed by pulmonary edema/acute heart failure (24.1% [95% CI, 19.0%-29.7%]), hemorrhagic stroke (14.6% [95% CI, 9.9%-20.0%]), acute coronary syndrome (10.8% [95% CI, 7.3%-14.8%]), renal failure (8.0% [95% CI, 2.9%-15.5%]), subarachnoid hemorrhage (6.9% [95% CI, 3.9%-10.7%]), encephalopathy (6.1% [95% CI, 1.9%-12.4%]), and the least prevalent was aortic dissection (1.8% [95% CI, 1.1%-2.8%]). Prevalence of in-hospital mortality among patients with hypertensive emergency was 9.9% (95% CI, 1.4%-24.6%). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate a pattern of hypertension-mediated organ damage primarily affecting the brain and heart, substantial cardiovascular renal morbidity and mortality, as well as subsequent hospitalization in patients with hypertensive emergencies presenting to the ED.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^116o6ZBR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary oedema

Heart failure associated with raised BP may present as hypertensive crisis. Typically, shortness of breath, cough, orthopnoea, with compatible signs on CXR points towards heart failure. Underlying conditions like ischaemic heart disease or bilateral renal artery stenosis may predispose to heart failure.

Treatment should be directed toward the underlying cause and the associated pathophysiology. Patient may not always present with florid symptoms of pulmonary oedema. Flash pulmonary oedema, which occurs with elevated left ventricular filling pressures may be the first presentation albeit rarely.

Patients with acute hypertensive heart failure have been under-represented in acute heart failure trials. The best available evidence for treatment of heart failure is for use of diuretics particularly loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide. Treatment aiming for a decrease in BP (fall in MAP by 20–25%) over a few hours has been mentioned in most guidelines. AHA guidelines recommend treatment of pulmonary oedema with clevidipine, nitro-glycerine, nitroprusside or enalaprilat. ESC guidelines, recommend treating BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg in patients with heart failure, to SBP < 140 mmHg.

GTN is the most commonly used therapy in hypertensive heart failure, administered by continuous infusion. However, the evidence comes from small, retrospective, and non-randomised clinical trials. The advantage is a quick reduction in preload and afterload. The use of higher doses of nitrates in patients with pulmonary oedema associated with myocardial infarction is supported by a few older studies. Small doses of opioids for vasodilatory and anxiolytic effect must be considered. Use of parenteral ACEi such as enalaprilat is supported by two studies particularly, one relatively large (n = 103) retrospective study of IV enalaprilat prescribed in the setting of acute heart failure and another small (n = 20) double blinded RCT comparing IV enalaprilat versus placebo in patients with congestive heart failure. However, IV enalaprilat is not routinely available. Nitroprusside may be an acceptable treatment strategy, while being cautious in patients with concomitant renal and liver failure. Clevidipine has been used safely in small studies. β blockers are contraindicated in acute pulmonary oedema (Table 11).

Both pulmonary oedema and ACS can be accompanied by an acute rise in BP with multiple confounding factors including pain and anxiety. Clinical discretion is required to differentiate if HTN is the causative factor, or a mere bystander similar to AIS and SAH.

Cardiac Factors

The diagnosis of ICI‐pneumonitis can also be complicated by comorbid cardiorespiratory conditions such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. These conditions may result in a clinical presentation of pulmonary edema, which can cause sudden interstitial lung changes, mimicking ICI‐pneumonitis. In this context, it may be prudent for patients with these conditions to undergo baseline cardiac clinical evaluation (S3, raised jugulovenous pressure, lower extremity edema), echocardiogram to quantify left and right heart function and valvular disease, and CT imaging and pulmonary function testing. Specifically, a reduction in DLCO that is disproportionate to the FEV1 and FVC, especially when observed with clinical evidence of volume overload, should raise concerns for underlying pulmonary hypertension.

### Bosentan [^114TwpyQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Fluid Retention

Peripheral edema is a known clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH and is also a known effect of bosentan and other endothelin receptor antagonists. In PAH clinical trials with bosentan, combined adverse events of fluid retention or edema were reported in 1.7% (placebo-corrected) of patients.

In addition, there have been numerous postmarketing reports of fluid retention in patients with pulmonary hypertension occurring within weeks after starting bosentan. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

If clinically significant fluid retention develops, with or without associated weight gain, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause, such as bosentan or underlying heart failure, and the possible need for treatment or discontinuation of bosentan [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

5.5 Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease

If signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and consider whether bosentan should be discontinued.

5.6 Decreased Sperm Counts

Decreased sperm counts have been observed in patients receiving bosentan. Preclinical data also suggest that bosentan, similar to other endothelin receptor antagonists, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

5.7 Decreases in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit

Treatment with bosentan can cause a dose-related decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. There have been postmarketing reports of decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit that have resulted in anemia requiring transfusion. It is recommended that hemoglobin concentrations be checked after 1 and 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. If a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs, further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause and need for specific treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — calcium channel blocker dosing, tolerability, and regulatory status: High doses of CCBs may be required to realize full hemodynamic benefit, with typical dosages of amlodipine 20 to 30 mg/d, nifedipine 180 to 240 mg/d, or diltiazem 720 to 960 mg/d; these high dosages are well tolerated with ankle edema as the major side effect, which can be treated with diuretics, and CCBs are not specifically approved for PAH by the FDA or European Medicines Agencies.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^117WdirQ]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) — definition, types, incidence, timing, diagnosis, and prevention: HAPE is an acute increase in PAP with normal LA pressure that is stimulated in susceptible individuals by exposure to hypoxia. There are 2 types of HAPE: that which afflicts lowlanders who rapidly ascend to altitudes above 2500 m (although lower altitudes have been associated with HAPE) and re-entry HAPE, which occurs in high-altitude residents who return to high altitude after sojourning (for as little as 1 day) to low altitude. The incidence of HAPE with rapid ascent to 4559 m is 7% in mountaineers without previous HAPE but 62% in those with a prior episode, and HAPE is much less common at lower altitudes, with an estimated incidence among visitors at 2 Colorado ski areas at 2500 to 3000 m between ≈0.1% and 0.01%. The onset of HAPE is usually 2 to 4 days after rapid ascent to altitude, and criteria for diagnosing HAPE in previously healthy children include rapid ascent to altitude above ≈2500 m, having ascended from altitudes ≥ 2500 m at a rate exceeding ≈300 m/d, and the above signs, symptoms, and x-ray findings. Because patients with HAPE typically improve rapidly (within minutes) with enriched inspired O2, patients who do rapidly improve merit consideration for further investigation for other causes of PH, and slow ascent is effective and is the first-line preventive measure.

### Management of crashing patients with pulmonary hypertension [^112CZ7Xd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) often seem well, but they can decompensate dramatically in a short time. PH has several causes, classes, and complications; but the natural progression eventually leads to right ventricular failure, which can be extraordinarily difficult to manage. The purpose of this review is to discuss the causes, signs, and symptoms of PH as well as its management strategies and emergent complications. Treatment options are often limited, so it is imperative that the emergency department physician can recognize and manage these patients in a timely fashion.

### Clinical outcomes in hypertensive emergency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116rq61z]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is one of the largest systematic review and meta‐analysis of patients with hypertensive emergency presenting to the ED and their clinical outcomes. Our study demonstrated that incidence of hypertensive emergency among patients presenting to ED was 0.5%, whereas 35.9% of patients presenting with hypertensive crisis in the ED were categorized as hypertensive emergency. Moreover, the most common complications of hypertensive emergencies are ischemic stroke and pulmonary edema/acute heart failure. Lastly, almost 10% of patients with hypertensive emergencies died during the hospitalization period.

According to our pooled analysis of 15 studies, which included 4370 patients with hypertensive emergency, the prevalence of hypertensive emergency was 0.5%, which is similar to the prevalence of hypertensive emergencies found in a smaller meta‐analysis that included 8 studies with 1970 patients with hypertensive emergency and indicated a prevalence of 0.3% among patients presenting to the ED. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that prevalence of hypertensive emergency among patients with hypertensive crisis in ED was 35.9%. Previous meta‐analysis corroborates these findings, as hypertensive urgency was considered to be significantly higher than hypertensive emergency (odds ratio, 2.5 [1.4%–4.3%]) in patients presenting to ED. Our findings are similarly consistent with the STAT (Studying the Treatment of Acute Hypertension) registry, the largest database of patients with hypertensive emergency in the United States, which reported a 0.2% prevalence of hypertensive emergencies. Loss of hypertension control is a major issue that can influence prevalence of hypertensive emergency. In a study to analyze the trend of hypertension between 2 study periods, analysis demonstrated that hypertension control rates increased from 2009 to 2014; however, after a temporary stationary period, a significant decline was observed from 2015 to 2018. Further analysis demonstrated that a significant reduction in initiation of antihypertensive therapy, from 75.3% to 70.7%, can be linked to declining hypertension control rates. Moreover, the impact of COVID‐19 on hypertension control has been undesirable. Analysis shows reduced outpatient visits for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, with a 20% elevated incidence of mortality during COVID‐19 compared with before the pandemic.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^113Gdt7f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute Left Ventricular Failure

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a self‐evident clinical condition with short‐term resolution in most patients and is another clinical condition that does not have its management primarily oriented by BP values. The management is based on the physiopathology of the syndrome and the clinical experience. BP is elevated in many patients, particularly those with hypertensive cardiomyopathy, because of the sympathetic discharge promoted by hypoxemia and the fear of imminent death. The rationale for treatment indicates drugs that reduce preload and afterload, such as nitrates.

Guidelines for managing heart failure superficially address on the management of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a condition that was specifically focused by a complementary statement from the European Society of Cardiology. It recommends vasodilators, preferentially nitrates, and oxygen and loop diuretics as the first step for treatment. Pulmonary edema secondary to acute left ventricular failure is another clinical condition that does not have its management primarily oriented by BP values in most patients.

### Acute heart failure: a novel approach to its pathogenesis and treatment [^111HtaQb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Acute heart failure (HF) is one of the most common syndromes in emergency medicine, however, its exact pathogenesis has remained largely unknown. Based on clinical and hemodynamic data we have sub-divided acute HF into four syndromes: cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, hypertensive crisis and exacerbated HF. Cardiogenic shock is caused by a severe reduction in cardiac power which is not met by an adequate increase in peripheral vascular resistance leading to significant decrease in blood pressure and end organ perfusion. Hence the treatment of cardiogenic shock should be directed at improving cardiac performance (by optimizing filling pressure, intra-aortic balloon pump and immediate revascularization) and administration of peripheral vasoconstrictors. The other acute HF syndromes (pulmonary edema, HTN crisis and exacerbated HF) are caused by a combination of progressive excessive vasoconstriction superimposed on reduced left ventricular functional reserve. The impaired cardiac power and extreme vasoconstriction induce a vicious cycle of afterload mismatch resulting in a dramatic reduction of CO and elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure, which is transferred backwards to the pulmonary capillaries yielding pulmonary edema. Therefore, the immediate treatment of these acute HF syndromes should be based on the administration of strong, fast-acting intravenous vasodilators such as nitrates or nitroprusside. After initial stabilization, therapy should be directed at reducing recurrent episodes of acute HF, by prevention of repeated episodes of excessive vasoconstriction along with efforts to optimize cardiac function.

### High-altitude pulmonary hypertension: a pathophysiological entity to different diseases [^111aJSSt]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a hallmark of high-altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) and of congestive right heart failure in subacute mountain sickness (SMS) and chronic mountain sickness (CMS) in the Himalayas and in the end-stage of CMS (Monge's disease) in the Andes. There are studies to suggest that transmission of excessively elevated pulmonary artery pressure and/or flow to the pulmonary capillaries leading to alveolar haemorrhage is the pathophysiological mechanism of HAPE. In the Himalayas, HAPE was successfully prevented by extending the acclimatisation period from a few days to 5 weeks, however, this did not prevent the occurrence of congestive right heart failure after several weeks of stay at 6,000 m. This leads to the concept that rapid remodelling of the small precapillary arteries prevents HAPE but not the development of right heart failure in SMS and CMS. Unresponsiveness of pulmonary hypertension to oxygen at high altitude and its complete resolution only after weeks of stay at low altitude suggest that structural rather than functional changes are its pathophysiological mechanism. Since pulmonary hypertension at high altitude is the driving force leading to high-altitude pulmonary oedema and "high-altitude right heart failure" in newcomers and residents of high altitude, the authors propose to adjust current terminology accordingly.

### Bilateral leg edema, obesity, pulmonary hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea… [^116RZ15H]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Bilateral leg edema in obese primary care patients is associated with both OSA and modest pulmonary hypertension. If these findings are generalizable, then bilateral leg edema may be an important clinical marker for underlying OSA. WHEN CARDIAC conditions cause edema, it is due to the development of left or right ventricular dysfunction. When pulmonary diseases initiate edema formation, it is a result of right ventricular dysfunction. A previous study from our group identified an association between bilateral leg edema and pulmonary hypertension, 1 with many of the subjects with pulmonary hypertension having no evidence of cardiac or pulmonary disease. Ambulatory patients older than 18 years with bilateral pitting leg edema whose echocardiogram demonstrated pulmonary hypertension were eligible to participate in the study. We found that OSA is associated with pulmonary hypertension in patients with bilateral leg edema, most of whom are obese.

Since a previous study demonstrated that bilateral leg edema is associated with isolated pulmonary hypertension, 1 the implication of both studies is that bilateral leg edema is associated with OSA in ambulatory adults. Furthermore, if these findings are generalizable, then bilateral leg edema may be a useful clinical marker for underlying OSA. Nonetheless, our data raise the question of a causal relationship among sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and bilateral leg edema. The absence of other known risk factors for pulmonary hypertension — in particular, the absence of daytime hypoxemia, significant spirometric abnormalities, and left ventricular dysfunction — suggests that the relationship may be a valid one. We speculate that the hypoxemia caused by apnea during sleep induces the pulmonary hypertension.

Another plausible hydrostatic mechanism is that edema results from the pulmonary hypertension as the increased pressure is transmitted from the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle, the right atrium, and ultimately through the vena cava and into the venous circulation of the legs, perhaps contributing to lymphedema in the process. If this mechanism is correct, then the differential diagnosis of edema should be expanded to include pulmonary hypertension. Previous research indicates that pulmonary hypertension in and of itself is inadequate to cause edema, at least in some instances. Some healthy individuals living at high altitudes have pulmonary hypertension without evidence of heart failure. 51 In these individuals, chronic pulmonary hypertension allows right ventricular hypertrophy to maintain blood flow.

52 Among patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, virtually none have edema at the time of initial diagnosis, 13, 53 but, with time, edema develops in increasing numbers of these individuals. 53 These observations suggest that a factor apart from pulmonary hypertension is necessary for edema formation.

### Current concept of chronic mountain sickness: pulmonary hypertension-related high-altitude heart disease [^1126MA9K]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

High-altitude heart disease, a form of chronic mountain sickness, has been well established in both Tibet and Qinghai provinces of China, although little is known regarding this syndrome in other countries, particularly in the West. This review presents a general overview of high-altitude heart disease in China and briefly summarizes the existing data with regard to the prevalence, clinical features, and pathophysiology of the illness. The definition of high-altitude heart disease is right ventricular enlargement that develops primarily (by high-altitude exposure) to pulmonary hypertension without excessive polycythemia. The prevalence is higher in children than adults and in men than women, but is lower in both sexes of Tibetan high-altitude residents compared with acclimatized newcomers, such as Han Chinese. Clinical symptoms consist of headache, dyspnea, cough, irritability, and sleeplessness. Physical findings include a marked cyanosis, rapid heart and respiratory rates, edema of the face, liver enlargement, and rales. Most patients have complete recovery on descent to a lower altitude, but symptoms recur with a return to high altitude. Right ventricular enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and remodeling of pulmonary arterioles are hallmarks of high-altitude heart disease. It is hoped that this information will assist in understanding this type of chronic mountain sickness, facilitate international exchange of data, and stimulate further research into this poorly understood condition.

### Nitric oxide (Genosyl) [^117PTmrQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension: Abrupt discontinuation of GENOSYL may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure (5.1).

Methemoglobinemia: Methemoglobin increases with the dose of nitric oxide; following discontinuation or reduction of nitric oxide, methemoglobin levels return to baseline over a period of hours (5.2).

Elevated NO2Levels: Monitor NO2levels (5.3).

Heart Failure: In patients with pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, GENOSYL may increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure leading to pulmonary edema (5.4).

5.1 Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome following Abrupt Discontinuation

Wean from GENOSYL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Abrupt discontinuation of GENOSYL may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure, i.e. Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome. Signs and symptoms of Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension Syndrome include hypoxemia, systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and decreased cardiac output. If Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension occurs, reinstate GENOSYL therapy immediately.

5.2 Hypoxemia from Methemoglobinemia

Nitric oxide combines with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, which does not transport oxygen. Methemoglobin levels increase with the dose of GENOSYL; it can take 8 hours or more before steady-state methemoglobin levels are attained. Monitor methemoglobin and adjust the dose of GENOSYL to optimize oxygenation.

If methemoglobin levels do not resolve with decrease in dose or discontinuation of GENOSYL, additional therapy may be warranted to treat methemoglobinemia [see Overdosage (10)].

5.3 Airway Injury from Nitrogen Dioxide

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) forms in gas mixtures containing NO and O2. Nitrogen dioxide may cause airway inflammation and damage to lung tissues.

If there is an unexpected change in NO2concentration, or if the NO2concentration reaches 0.5 ppm when measured in the breathing circuit, then the delivery system should be assessed in accordance with the GENOSYL Delivery System Operator's Manual troubleshooting section, and the NO2analyzer should be recalibrated. The dose of GENOSYL and/or FiO2should be adjusted as appropriate.

5.4 Worsening Heart Failure

Patients with left ventricular dysfunction treated with GENOSYL may experience pulmonary edema, increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, worsening of left ventricular dysfunction, systemic hypotension, bradycardia and cardiac arrest. Discontinue GENOSYL while providing symptomatic care.

Postoperative left ventricular dysfunction — In patients undergoing lung transplantation for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), lung transplantation transiently resets the PVR to physiologic conditions, increasing LV filling and cardiac output, but the untrained LV may not handle the sudden volume load, leading to temporary LV failure and pulmonary edema. There is a chronological distinction in which PGD occurs within the first 24 hours after lung transplantation, whereas temporary LV failure occurs later during weaning from mechanical respiratory support as positive pressure is reduced. Management includes optimization of fluid balance, inotropic support, hemodynamic stability, and avoiding rapid LV loading while the LV adapts to new physiologic conditions.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of urapidil and nitroglycerin for blood pressure control in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema [^114axenQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE) is a life-threatening manifestation of acute heart failure characterized by abrupt pulmonary congestion and hypertension. Rapid blood pressure (BP) reduction with intravenous vasodilators is a cornerstone of emergency management. Nitroglycerin is widely used but may be limited by side effects, while urapidil, an α1-adrenergic antagonist with additional central serotonergic activity, has been proposed as an alternative.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study at a tertiary university emergency department, adults with hypertensive ACPE received either intravenous nitroglycerin or urapidil as part of initial management. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at baseline and every 30 min up to 330 min. The primary outcome was achievement of target systolic BP (< 140 mmHg). Secondary outcomes included time-resolved changes in systolic/diastolic BP and heart rate, need for rescue therapy, mechanical ventilation, disposition, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 296 patients were analyzed (nitroglycerin n = 142, urapidil n = 154; median age 69 years, 51% female). Urapidil achieved earlier and higher cumulative attainment of the BP target from 60 min onward (p < 0.001) and produced faster early declines in systolic/diastolic BP and heart rate. However, invasive mechanical ventilation (13.6% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.038) and intensive care admissions (55.2% vs. 38.7%, p = 0.010) were more frequent with urapidil. Rescue therapy was required more often with nitroglycerin (28.2% vs. 16.9%, p = 0.020). Headache occurred more frequently with nitroglycerin, while other adverse events were comparable.

Conclusion

In hypertensive ACPE, urapidil reaches blood pressure targets in a more timely manner, but may be associated with higher rates of endotracheal intubation and ICU admission in this cohort. These observations may support consideration of nitroglycerin when early clinical stabilization is prioritized, while urapidil remains a reasonable alternative. Safety profiles were broadly similar, aside from more frequent headaches with nitroglycerin.

Expected benefit is decreased signs of right heart failure; hyperkalaemia is noted with spironolactone. COR/LOE entries specify COR IIa LOE C for spironolactone, and COR IIb LOE C for furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide. Cautions include that moderate to excessive diuresis can reduce the preload of the failing RV and worsen clinical status, and that care is needed as over diuresis can reduce the preload of the failing RV.

### Acute pulmonary edema caused by epoprostenol infusion in a child with scimitar syndrome and pulmonary hypertension [^1162jgHD]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous epoprostenol is frequently administered in adults and children for treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Although generally safe, pulmonary edema has been described in a few case reports of adult patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.

Case Report

We present an infant who had an operation for scimitar syndrome and abnormal drainage of the right pulmonary veins into the inferior vena cava who developed pulmonary edema while receiving a prostacyclin infusion. The typical partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage was operatively corrected at 6 days of age, and an accompanying coarctation was resected. At 7 months of age, diagnostic cardiac catheterization was performed to evaluate suspected pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary pressure was elevated to supra-systemic values, and obstructed venous drainage of the right hypoplastic lung was demonstrated. To decrease pulmonary hypertension during weaning and extubation, epoprostenol infusion was initiated. Sixty minutes after extubation, massive acute pulmonary edema lead to reintubation. Mean airway pressure of 16 mm Hg (21 mbar) with pure oxygen ventilation was initially required, with an oxygenation index of 14, a ventilation index of 36, and an alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference of 541 mm Hg. After discontinuation of epoprostenol, weaning and extubation was successful.

Conclusion

Pulmonary edema caused by prostacyclin infusion in patients with impaired postcapillary pulmonary drainage may also be encountered in children and has to be anticipated.

### New insights in the pathogenesis of high-altitude pulmonary edema [^1147kUx9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

High-altitude pulmonary edema is a life-threatening condition occurring in predisposed but otherwise healthy individuals. It therefore permits the study of underlying mechanisms of pulmonary edema in the absence of confounding factors such as coexisting cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and/or drug therapy. There is evidence that some degree of asymptomatic alveolar fluid accumulation may represent a normal phenomenon in healthy humans shortly after arrival at high altitude. Two fundamental mechanisms then determine whether this fluid accumulation is cleared or whether it progresses to HAPE: the quantity of liquid escaping from the pulmonary vasculature and the rate of its clearance by the alveolar respiratory epithelium. The former is directly related to the degree of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, whereas the latter is determined by the alveolar epithelial sodium transport. Here, we will review evidence that, in HAPE-prone subjects, impaired pulmonary endothelial and epithelial NO synthesis and/or bioavailability may represent a central underlying defect predisposing to exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and, in turn, capillary stress failure and alveolar fluid flooding. We will then demonstrate that exaggerated pulmonary hypertension, although possibly a conditio sine qua non, may not always be sufficient to induce HAPE and how defective alveolar fluid clearance may represent a second important pathogenic mechanism.

### Symptom duration, recurrence, and long-term effects of swimming-induced pulmonary edema: a 30-month follow-up study [^112WEBoP]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities have been discussed as risk factors for immersion pulmonary edema in divers. In deaths among triathletes during swimming, left ventricular hypertrophy was overrepresented. In our relatively healthy group of patients with SIPE, consisting predominantly of middle-aged women, a lower prevalence of hypertension (11%) was found compared with the middle-aged Swedish population (22%). In contrast, we observed a higher prevalence of asthma (17%) compared with what has been reported for the middle-aged Swedish population (7%-11%). Interestingly, asthma was independently associated with both symptom duration > 2 days and recurrent SIPE symptoms after encountering SIPE. We speculate that SIPE and concurrent asthma may result in a worsening of symptoms and a corresponding extension of symptom duration. Similarly, a recurrent episode of SIPE may trigger an asthma exacerbation in patients with asthma. There is currently no evidence of a pathophysiologic connection between asthma or bronchial hyperreactivity and the development of SIPE. Also, most patients with recurrent SIPE had no previously known comorbid condition. Without a control group of swimmers without SIPE, the hypothesis of preexisting asthma as a risk factor for SIPE could not be tested in the present study, but merits consideration for future studies.

Most patients with SIPE who required acute hospital care had no other immediate cause for pulmonary edema than exposure to cold water swimming. Three patients received a diagnosis of myocardial infarction in adjacent to the race, which theoretically could have been the primary cause, or a consequence, of SIPE. However, all three patients had normal coronary angiography results, which is more indicative of a secondary myocardial strain. None of these patients reported having heart disease before the swimming race (data not shown). During the follow-up period of 30 months, 5%, 8%, and 5% of the patients reported receiving a diagnosis of either asthma, hypertension, or heart disease, respectively. Hypertension has been reported as a comorbid condition both in SIPE and immersion pulmonary edema among divers, and an increased incidence of hypertension over time has also been reported in this group. Some of the cases of hypertension diagnosed during the follow-up period might have been due to unknown or untreated high BP at the time of the swimming race. Because of the absence of a relevant control group in the present study, we could not evaluate the relative importance of individual cardiovascular and pulmonary risk factors and long-term consequences of SIPE.

### Flash pulmonary edema [^116XbGbp]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Flash pulmonary edema (FPE) is a general clinical term used to describe a particularly dramatic form of acute decompensated heart failure. Well-established risk factors for heart failure such as hypertension, coronary ischemia, valvular heart disease, and diastolic dysfunction are associated with acute decompensated heart failure as well as with FPE. However, endothelial dysfunction possibly secondary to an excessive activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, impaired nitric oxide synthesis, increased endothelin levels, and/or excessive circulating catecholamines may cause excessive pulmonary capillary permeability and facilitate FPE formation. Renal artery stenosis particularly when bilateral has been identified has a common cause of FPE. Lack of diurnal variation in blood pressure and a widened pulse pressure have been identified as risk factors for FPE. This review is an attempt to delineate clinical and pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for FPE and to distinguish pathophysiologic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects of FPE from those of acute decompensated heart failure.

### The potential of non-invasive remote dielectric sensing in predicting short-term prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension [^116A1sxq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) represents a global health challenge with significant cross-age-group impact, affecting an estimated 1% of the global population. PH is characterized by restricted pulmonary arterial blood flow and sustained elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure, which subsequently imposes increased right ventricular afterload and culminates in right ventricular failure. This hemodynamic cascade constitutes the primary driver of morbidity and mortality in affected individuals.

PH demonstrates a profound pathophysiological association with right heart failure (RHF). Emerging evidence indicates that 32% of acute heart failure patients exhibit residual pulmonary congestion (≥ 39%) at the time of scheduled discharge, highlighting the clinical challenge of suboptimal decongestion in this population. Elevated pulmonary arterial pressure increases right ventricular afterload, culminating in RHF. RHF, in turn, exacerbates pulmonary congestion through dual mechanisms: increasing central venous pressure and impairing lymphatic drainage, a pathophysiological interplay that is particularly pronounced in patients with PH. Therefore, the assessment of pulmonary fluid accumulation is inherently integral to the management of heart failure (HF).

The Remote Dielectric Sensing (ReDS™) lung fluid monitor represents the world's first non-invasive device designed for HF monitoring and management. By measuring thoracic dielectric constant variations, this technology directly reflects lung fluid content with a detection range of 15–60%, enabling sensitive identification of pathological states from mild cardiac compensation to severe pulmonary edema. Although ReDS™ cannot directly measure pulmonary artery pressure, changes in lung fluid content may indirectly reflect disease progression in specific types of PH. While research on ReDS™ technology in HF has advanced gradually, there remains a paucity of literature addressing innovative frontiers such as early warning of RHF in PH patients. Therefore, this study aims to leverage ReDS™ technology to develop a PH-ReDS predictive model, utilizing real-world clinical data to assess the risk of all-cause mortality or clinical deterioration in PH patients.

CONCLUSIONS

Our findings show that ischemic stroke and pulmonary edema/acute heart failure are the most commonly reported organ damage caused by hypertensive emergency. According to our findings, there is a substantial incidence of in‐hospital mortality (nearly 10%) among patients with hypertensive emergency who present to the ED. More studies are required to discover the incidence, interval, and secondary causes of subsequent hospitalization and to evaluate additional causes and complications associated with mortality in patients with hypertensive emergency.

### A new global definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113d8vmd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Timing, Risk Factors, and Extrapulmonary Factors

The committee agreed that the current time frame for the diagnosis of ARDS should be retained: acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure is defined as occurring within 1 week of the onset of the predisposing risk factor or within 1 week of new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Prolonging the time to onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure was considered, as protracted symptoms may precede progression to frank respiratory failure, as in the case of COVID-19; however, expanding the definition to include HFNO (detailed below) should allow earlier diagnosis, so the time frame of 1 week for acute onset of respiratory failure was maintained. The acute onset or worsening of hypoxemic respiratory failure and pulmonary edema should not be exclusively or primarily attributable to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload, atelectasis or lung collapse, pleural effusion, or pulmonary embolism. ARDS can be diagnosed in the presence of these conditions if a predisposing risk factor for ARDS is also present, and the clinician believes that these other conditions (e.g. fluid overload, atelectasis) are unlikely to be the primary causes of the hypoxemia. ARDS also can be diagnosed in the presence of chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hypertension, providing that acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is not primarily attributable to these underlying conditions. Further rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E2 and Tables E1 and E2.

Chest Imaging

The committee agreed that chest imaging criteria should include bilateral radiologic (chest radiography or computed tomography) or ultrasound findings suggestive of loss of lung aeration that are not fully explained by effusions, atelectasis, or nodules/masses. Although the identification of bilateral opacities by chest radiography has poor interrater reliability, chest radiography is the most common imaging modality in critically ill patients, which contributed to the recommendation to retain it in the definition despite its limitations. In addition, the committee recommended that ultrasound be accepted as a modality for identifying signs of loss of lung aeration consistent with (noncardiogenic) pulmonary edema or lung consolidation, especially when chest radiography or computed tomography is not available. There is evidence that ultrasound can be reliable if the operator is trained to detect bilateral consolidations and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, an approach that should have value, especially in resource-limited areas. Further discussion of the rationale for these recommendations is provided in Supplement E3.

### High filling pressures in HFpEF: Do men and women get there differently? [^112LHhJ6]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In the last 2 decades, we have learned that the pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is nothing short of complex. Abnormalities in global myocardial performance vascular reserve, and skeletal muscle all variably contribute to the exercise limitations in individual patients with HFpEF. In contrast to this heterogeneity in pathophysiology, there is homogeneity in disease manifestation where all patients with HFpEF universally have 'pump failure' reflected by an inability of the heart to deliver blood to the body during exercise without pathological increases in left atrial (LA) pressures. This abnormal rise in exertional LA pressure is the pathognomonic abnormality in HFpEF being associated with pulmonary edema, dyspnea, exercise capacity, and prognosis; and responds favorably to SGLT2 inhibitors as a potential mediator of benefit as observed in the CAMEO-DAPA (Evaluation of the Cardiac and Metabolic Effects of Dapagliflozin in Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction) trial.

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of HFpEF is established based on an increase in exercise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) [ie, LA pressure] to at least 25 mm Hg. The use of absolute PCWP elevation to diagnose HFpEF is based on the rationale that the lungs experience dynamic congestion related to the absolute hydrostatic pressure elevation in the pulmonary capillaries. Despite the fact that women on average have smaller hearts and height compared to men, we do not correct the abnormal PCWP cutoff for underlying heart or body size reflecting the fact that similar to arterial hypertension, LA hypertension is fundamentally abnormal regardless of how we get there. Despite the use of similar PCWP cutoffs to diagnose HFpEF in men and women, women with HFpEF have unique disease features including greater abdominal adiposity contributing to their hemodynamic abnormalities, and more limited myocardial and vascular reserve.

Group 5 PH — management by underlying mechanism and cautious use of off‑label vasodilators: Care should be dictated by underlying pathophysiology and volume status, approaching sarcoidosis without left ventricular dysfunction and predominantly parenchymal lung disease as Group 3 PH and treating end‑stage renal disease with fluid overload as Group 2 PH; cautious consideration of off‑label pulmonary vasodilator therapies should be reserved for more severe PH with right ventricular dysfunction, with close monitoring for pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and/or hypotension.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^1134Mwun]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Emergency department scope and population — Asymptomatic elevated blood pressure: This guideline is intended for physicians working in EDs and applies to patients aged 18 years or older who present to the ED with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure without signs and symptoms of acute target organ injury. It excludes patients with signs or symptoms of acute hypertensive emergencies (eg, acute stroke, cardiac ischemia, pulmonary edema, encephalopathy, and congestive heart failure), as well as pregnant patients, those with end-stage renal insufficiency, emergent conditions likely to cause elevated blood pressure more directly related to acute target organ injury (eg, trauma, other pain syndromes), and acute presentations of serious medical conditions associated with hypertension such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2019 update [^111zwWuG]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) treatment — descent remains the single best treatment; individuals should try to descend at least 1000 m or until symptoms resolve and minimize exertion during descent because exertion can further increase pulmonary artery pressure and exacerbate edema formation. Recommendation: Descent is indicated for individuals with HAPE (Recommendation Grade: 1A).

### The respiratory system in pediatric chronic heart disease [^116u7hEA]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease in the pediatric population closely affects the respiratory system inducing water retention in the lungs and pulmonary edema, airway compression by cardiovascular structures, restrictive pulmonary physiology as a result of hemodynamic changes and surgical repair, susceptibility to respiratory infections, development of pulmonary hypertension, thrombosis, or hemorrhage. Chronic heart failure and congenital heart disease are characterized by various respiratory manifestations and symptoms mimicking lung disease, which are frequently difficult to diagnose and treat. Pulmonary function is multiply affected in pediatric heart disease with mostly restrictive but also obstructive and diffusion abnormalities. Patients with Fontan circulation represent a separate group with slow, passive pulmonary blood flow and distinct pathophysiology with low cardiac output heart failure, restrictive lung pattern, increased thromboembolic complications and rare conditions such as protein losing enteropathy and plastic bronchitis. Distinguishing between cardiovascular and pulmonary symptoms may be challenging in the growing population of pediatric and adult survivors of congenital heart disease and understanding of the relationship of the two systems in heart disease is crucial for the optimal management of these patients.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1148KFCJ]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.
