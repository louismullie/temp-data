## Question

What's the augmentin equivalent oral solutions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Augmentin equivalent oral solutions, including what strengths exist, how they are dosed, and how they compare to tablet formulations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which Augmentin oral solution products are actually available and their exact strengths. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic equivalence between suspension and chewables versus tablets. Next, I will review pediatric and adult dosing by indication, including the high-dose ES-600 formulation. After that, I need to check administration instructions, storage, and reconstitution details. Finally, I will consider special populations, safety, and when to choose suspension over tablets, and I will double-check any conflicting dosing statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the available oral solution formulations. The standard Augmentin for oral suspension comes in two strengths: 125 mg amoxicillin/31.25 mg clavulanic acid per 5 mL, and 250 mg amoxicillin/62.5 mg clavulanic acid per 5 mL, both requiring reconstitution and refrigeration after mixing, with a 10-day discard window once reconstituted [^114SkpnH] [^116XPaHU]. Wait, let me verify the high-dose pediatric product: Augmentin ES-600 is 600 mg amoxicillin/42.9 mg clavulanic acid per 5 mL, also a powder for oral suspension with the same storage and discard rules, and it is specifically indicated for pediatric acute otitis media in defined risk contexts [^1178ACju] [^111vfjiR] [^115m26RY].

> I need to check pharmacokinetic equivalence between suspension and chewables versus tablets. The FDA labeling states that 5 mL of the 250 mg/62.5 mg suspension provides average peak serum concentrations of about 6.9 mcg/mL amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL clavulanic acid approximately 1 hour after dosing, and that one 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet or two 125 mg/31.25 mg chewables yield similar serum concentrations to 5 mL of the 250 mg/62.5 mg suspension, establishing suspension–chewable interchangeability for PK exposure [^115rB2cJ] [^111ST8zN]. Hold on, I should verify tablet equivalence: the 250 mg/125 mg tablet is not substitutable with the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable because the clavulanic acid content differs, so tablet-to-suspension substitution must respect the clavulanate ratio and labeled tablet strengths [^116CJFZ1].

> Next, I should review pediatric dosing by indication and age. For children 3 months and older, standard dosing is 45 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided every 12 hours using the 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL suspension (often described as the 7:1 ratio), which corresponds to 45 mg/kg BID for acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and lower respiratory tract infections [^1114LuDM] [^117DHpHS] [^111mU89t]. For infants under 3 months, I initially thought the dose was 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, but wait, let me verify: the current FDA pediatric dosing recommends 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours for neonates and infants under 12 weeks, which aligns with the 30 mg/kg BID regimen for this age group in otitis media labeling, so I should correct myself to 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours rather than a blanket 30 mg/kg BID statement [^113XcijU] [^1114LuDM].

> I will now examine the high-dose pediatric formulation. Augmentin ES-600 is indicated for recurrent or persistent acute otitis media in children 3 months to 12 years who weigh 40 kg or less, dosed at 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided every 12 hours for 10 days, which delivers a 14:1 amoxicillin-to-clavulanate ratio to maximize amoxicillin exposure while limiting clavulanate-related GI adverse effects [^115m26RY] [^115DoUDw]. Let me consider the evidence base: a pivotal pediatric trial comparing 45 mg/kg every 12 hours versus 40 mg/kg every 8 hours showed comparable clinical efficacy with less diarrhea in the every-12-hour arm, supporting the BID regimen and the PK rationale for higher amoxicillin dosing in persistent AOM [^1128n4Kg] [^113XcijU].

> Now, I should review adult dosing and whether suspension is typically used. Adults are generally dosed with tablets rather than suspension, using 500/125 mg every 8 hours or 875/125 mg every 12 hours depending on indication and severity, with higher-dose regimens for severe infections or specific syndromes; suspension is not the standard adult formulation, though it can be used if tablets are not feasible [^1114LuDM] [^117DHpHS] [^115Z6Zqy]. Hold on, I should verify the XR formulation: Augmentin XR 2000/125 mg every 12 hours is an adult-only, extended-release tablet for community-acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial sinusitis, and it is not interchangeable with standard tablets due to different PK and clavulanate content, so it should not be confused with pediatric suspensions [^114yHmSC] [^115oZGzb].

> I need to ensure administration and storage details are precise. All suspensions should be shaken well before each dose, administered at the start of a meal to enhance clavulanate absorption and reduce GI upset, and stored refrigerated after reconstitution; unused suspension should be discarded after 10 days, and dosing should use a calibrated oral syringe for accuracy [^112UudGt] [^116XPaHU] [^115DoUDw]. Let me double-check the reconstitution steps: add about two-thirds of the total water, shake vigorously, then add the remaining water and shake again to ensure uniform suspension, which is consistent across Augmentin and ES-600 instructions [^116CJFZ1] [^115DoUDw].

> Next, I should review special populations and safety. In renal impairment, dose adjustments are required when GFR is below 30 mL/min, with avoidance of the 875/125 mg regimen in severe impairment and use of 500/125 mg or 250/125 mg every 12–24 hours depending on severity and dialysis status, which applies to both tablet and suspension formulations since amoxicillin is renally cleared [^113XcijU] [^116CJFZ1]. I should confirm hepatic cautions: monitor liver function in hepatic impairment and watch for cholestatic jaundice, and avoid unnecessary use to limit C. difficile risk and resistance selection, especially given clavulanate's association with GI adverse effects [^113tqqwp] [^113Wjyhn].

> But wait, what if the clinician is considering a generic or compounded alternative. Therapeutically equivalent oral solutions must match the same amoxicillin/clavulanate ratios and deliver comparable bioavailability; the 4:1, 7:1, and 14:1 ratios reflect different design goals, with 7:1 standard and 14:1 reserved for high-dose pediatric AOM, so any "equivalent" solution should replicate the labeled ratio and PK performance of the reference product to ensure clinical equivalence [^115rB2cJ] [^115m26RY] [^113Wjyhn]. Hold on, I should verify that ratio choice impacts tolerability: higher clavulanate exposure is linked to more GI adverse effects, which is why high-dose pediatric formulations use a higher amoxicillin-to-clavulanate ratio to maximize efficacy while minimizing clavulanate burden [^113Wjyhn].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically actionable: the Augmentin-equivalent oral solutions are the reconstitutable suspensions available as 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL, 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL, and the pediatric high-dose 600 mg/42.9 mg per 5 mL (ES-600), all of which provide the same active components with the same PK equivalence to chewables and the same storage and administration requirements; suspension–chewable interchangeability is supported, but tablet formulations are not directly substitutable with suspension due to differing clavulanate ratios, so dose adjustments must follow the labeled strength and indication-specific regimens [^114SkpnH] [^115rB2cJ] [^1178ACju] [^116CJFZ1].

Augmentin oral solution is the **liquid formulation** of amoxicillin/clavulanate, available as 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL and 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspensions [^114SkpnH] [^116XPaHU]. These suspensions are **clinically equivalent to tablets** and chewables containing the same amoxicillin/clavulanate ratios, providing the same antimicrobial activity when dosed correctly [^115rB2cJ] [^111ST8zN]. The high-dose pediatric formulation (ES-600, 600 mg/42.9 mg per 5 mL) is used for recurrent or persistent acute otitis media and is not interchangeable with standard-strength suspensions [^115m26RY] [^1178ACju]. Always shake well, refrigerate after reconstitution, and discard after 10 days [^112UudGt] [^116XPaHU].

---

## Available oral solution formulations

Augmentin oral solution is available in **two standard strengths** and a high-dose pediatric formulation:

| **Formulation** | **Amoxicillin concentration** | **Clavulanic acid concentration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Standard suspension | 125 mg per 5 mL | 31.25 mg per 5 mL | General pediatric and adult use |
| Standard suspension | 250 mg per 5 mL | 62.5 mg per 5 mL | General pediatric and adult use |
| ES-600 suspension | 600 mg per 5 mL | 42.9 mg per 5 mL | Pediatric recurrent or persistent acute otitis media |

---

These formulations are **clinically equivalent to tablet and chewable formulations** containing the same amoxicillin/clavulanate ratios, providing identical antimicrobial activity when administered at equivalent doses [^115rB2cJ] [^111ST8zN].

---

## Clinical equivalence to tablet and chewable formulations

The oral solution formulations are **pharmacokinetically and clinically equivalent** to tablet and chewable formulations containing the same amoxicillin/clavulanate ratios. This equivalence ensures consistent therapeutic outcomes across different dosage forms when administered at equivalent doses [^115rB2cJ] [^111ST8zN].

---

## Dosage and administration

Dosage varies by indication, age, and weight; **general pediatric dosing** is 20–45 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component, divided every 8–12 hours, while **adult dosing** typically uses 500/125 mg every 8 hours or 875/125 mg every 12 hours. The ES-600 suspension is dosed at 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component, divided every 12 hours, for pediatric recurrent or persistent acute otitis media [^115m26RY] [^115DoUDw]. Shake the bottle well before each use, administer with food to enhance absorption and reduce GI upset, and use a calibrated measuring device for accurate dosing [^112UudGt] [^113wET6j].

---

## Storage and stability

Store reconstituted suspension **under refrigeration** and discard any unused portion after 10 days [^116XPaHU]. Prior to reconstitution, store the dry powder at or below 25°C (77°F) [^116XPaHU].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Allergic reactions**: Monitor for hypersensitivity, especially in patients with penicillin allergy [^112UudGt].
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Diarrhea is common; monitor for severe or persistent diarrhea suggestive of Clostridioides difficile infection [^114Q1S9r].
- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment is required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min) [^113XcijU].

---

Augmentin oral solution is the **liquid formulation** of amoxicillin/clavulanate, available in standard and high-dose pediatric strengths, and is clinically equivalent to tablet and chewable formulations when dosed correctly.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

AUGMENTIN XR should be taken at the start of a meal to enhance
the absorption of amoxicillin and to minimize the potential for gastrointestinal
intolerance. Absorption of the amoxicillin component is decreased when AUGMENTIN
XR is taken on an empty stomach (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

The recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is 4,000 mg/250 mg daily according to
the following table:

Tablets of AUGMENTIN (250 mg or 500 mg) CANNOT be used to
provide the same dosages as AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets. This is
because AUGMENTIN XR contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid, while the AUGMENTIN
250-mg and 500-mg tablets each contain 125 mg of clavulanic acid. In addition,
the Extended Release Tablet provides an extended time course of plasma
amoxicillin concentrations compared to immediate-release Tablets. Thus, two
AUGMENTIN 500-mg tablets are not equivalent to one AUGMENTIN XR tablet.

Scored AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets are available for greater
convenience for adult patients who have difficulty swallowing. The scored tablet
is not intended to reduce the dosage of medication taken; as stated in the table
above, the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is two tablets twice a day (every 12
hours).

Renally Impaired Patients

The pharmacokinetics of AUGMENTIN XR have not been studied in
patients with renal impairment. AUGMENTIN XR is contraindicated in patients with
a creatinine clearance of < 30 mL/min. and in hemodialysis patients (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hepatically Impaired Patients

Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and
hepatic function monitored at regular intervals (see WARNINGS).

Pediatric Use

Pediatric patients who weigh 40 kg or more and can swallow
tablets should receive the adult dose.

Geriatric Use

No dosage adjustment is required for the elderly (see
PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Administration Instructions

Inform patients that AUGMENTIN may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the dose prescribed. Each dose should be taken with a meal or snack to reduce the possibility of gastrointestinal upset.

Allergic Reactions

Counsel patients that AUGMENTIN contains a penicillin class drug product that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.

Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCAR)

Advise patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations. Instruct patients to stop taking AUGMENTIN immediately and promptly report the first signs or symptoms of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Diarrhea

Counsel patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials, and it usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibacterial. If diarrhea is severe or lasts more than 2 or 3 days, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including AUGMENTIN, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold).

When AUGMENTIN is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by AUGMENTIN or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Storage Instructions

Advise patients to keep suspension refrigerated. Shake well before using. When dosing a child with the suspension (liquid) of AUGMENTIN, use a calibrated oral syringe. Be sure to rinse the calibrated oral syringe after each use. Bottles of suspension of AUGMENTIN may contain more liquid than required. Follow your doctor's instructions about the amount to use and the days of treatment your child requires. Discard any unused medicine.

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^115sQKE2]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of AUGMENTIN. Dosing in the
fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin.
While AUGMENTIN can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate
potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. In 1
study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when AUGMENTIN
was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high-fat breakfast. The
safety and efficacy of AUGMENTIN have been established in clinical trials where
AUGMENTIN was taken without regard to meals.

Meanaamoxicillin and clavulanate potassium
pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in the table below:

aMean values of 14 normal volunteers (n = 15 for
clavulanate potassium in the low-dose regimens). Peak concentrations occurred
approximately 1.5 hours after the dose.

bAdministered at the start of a light meal.

Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with AUGMENTIN are similar to those
produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone.
The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of AUGMENTIN is 1.3
hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1.0 hour.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

AUGMENTIN is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Mean amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium pharmacokinetic parameters in normal adults following administration of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets are shown in Table 6 and following administration of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets are shown in Table 7.

Table 6: Mean (± S.D.) Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Pharmacokinetic Parameters a, b with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Tablets

Table 7: Mean (± S.D.) Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Pharmacokinetic Parameters a, b with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets

Oral administration of 5 mL of the 250 mg/62.5 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium or the equivalent dose of 10 mL of the 125 mg/31.25 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium provides average peak serum concentrations approximately 1 hour after dosing of 6.9 mcg/mL for amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL for clavulanic acid. The areas under the serum concentration curves obtained during the first 4 hours after dosing were 12.6 mcg*h/mL for amoxicillin and 2.9 mcg*h/mL for clavulanic acid when 5 mL of the 250 mg/62.5 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium or equivalent dose of 10 mL of the 125 mg/31.25 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium were administered to normal adults. One 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium or two 125 mg/31.25 mg chewable tablets of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium are equivalent to 5 mL of the 250 mg/62.5 mg suspension of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium and provide similar serum concentrations of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin) [^113wET6j]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium are similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1 mcg/mL for amoxicillin has been shown to be similar after corresponding every 12 hour and every 8-hour dosing regimens of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium in adults and children.

Absorption: Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin. While AUGMENTIN can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. In one study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when AUGMENTIN was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high‑fat breakfast.

Distribution: Neither component in AUGMENTIN is highly protein‑bound; clavulanic acid is approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound

Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid.

Two hours after oral administration of a single 35 mg/kg dose of suspension of AUGMENTIN to fasting children, average concentrations of 3 mcg/mL of amoxicillin and 0.5 mcg/mL of clavulanic acid were detected in middle ear effusions.

Metabolism and Excretion: The half‑life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of AUGMENTIN is 1.3 hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1 hour.

Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of a single 250 mg/125 mg or 500 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (augmentinXR) [^111NeCX3]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of AUGMENTIN XR.

AUGMENTIN XR is an extended-release formulation which provides sustained
plasma concentrations of amoxicillin. Amoxicillin systemic exposure achieved
with AUGMENTIN XR is similar to that produced by the oral administration of
equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. In a study of healthy adult volunteers,
the pharmacokinetics of AUGMENTIN XR were compared when administered in a fasted
state, at the start of a standardized meal (612 kcal, 89.3 g carb, 24.9 g fat,
and 14.0 g protein), or 30 minutes after a high-fat meal. When the systemic
exposure to both amoxicillin and clavulanate is taken into consideration,
AUGMENTIN XR is optimally administered at the start of a standardized meal.
Absorption of amoxicillin is decreased in the fasted state. AUGMENTIN XR is not
recommended to be taken with a high-fat meal, because clavulanate absorption is
decreased. The pharmacokinetics of the components of AUGMENTIN XR following
administration of two AUGMENTIN XR tablets at the start of a standardized meal
are presented in Table 1.

aMedian (range).

The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of AUGMENTIN XR is
approximately 1.3 hours, and that of clavulanate is approximately 1.0 hour.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin ES-600) [^111EzxRD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Animal Data

Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given amoxicillin and clavulanate (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin and clavulanate. The amoxicillin doses in rodents (based on body surface area and assuming a 20 kg child) were approximately 2 times (rats) or equal to (mice) the recommended clinical AUGMENTIN ES-600 dose of 90/6.4 mg/kg/day. For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 15 times and 7.5 times the recommended daily dose of AUGMENTIN ES-600.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from a published clinical lactation study report that amoxicillin is present in human milk. There are reports of diarrhea, irritability, and rash in infants exposed to amoxicillin and clavulanate through breast milk; therefore, infants exposed to AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be monitored for these symptoms. There are no data on the effects of amoxicillin and clavulanate on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for AUGMENTIN ES-600 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from AUGMENTIN ES-600 or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Acute Otitis Media

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg, for the treatment of acute otitis media, and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling.

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age have not been established.

The safety and effectiveness of Augmentin ES-600 have not been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing more than 40 kg.

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 have been established for the treatment of pediatric patients (3 months to 12 years of age) with acute bacterial sinusitis. This use is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of AUGMENTIN XRTM Extended Release Tablets in adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, studies of AUGMENTIN ES-600 in pediatric patients with acute otitis media, and by similar pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin and clavulanate in pediatric patients taking AUGMENTIN ES-600 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] and adults taking AUGMENTIN XR.

Susceptibility Testing

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial MICs.
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial
compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure.
Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method1(broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and
standardized concentrations of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder.

The recommended dilution pattern utilizes a constant amoxicillin/clavulanate
potassium ratio of 2 to 1 in all tubes with varying amounts of amoxicillin. MICs
are expressed in terms of the amoxicillin concentration in the presence of
clavulanic acid at a constant 2 parts amoxicillin to 1 part clavulanic acid. The
MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria:
RECOMMENDED RANGES FOR AMOXICILLIN/CLAVULANIC ACID SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING

For Gram-Negative Enteric Aerobes:

For Staphylococcus and Haemophilus species:

gStaphylococci which are susceptible to
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid but resistant to methicillin/oxacillin must be
considered as resistant.

For S. pneumoniae from
non-meningitis sources:

Isolates should be tested using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and the following
criteria should be used:

NOTE: These interpretive criteria are based on the
recommended doses for respiratory tract infections.

A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be
inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration
usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" indicates that the result should
be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to
alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This
category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is
physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be
used. This category also provides a buffer zone, which prevents small
uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in
interpretation. A report of "Resistant" indicates that the pathogen is not
likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the
concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 3,119 patients in an analysis of clinical studies of AUGMENTIN, 32% were greater than or equal to 65 years old, and 14% were greater than or equal to 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR less than 30 mL/min). See Patients with Renal Impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.

To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be taken at the start of a meal. Absorption of clavulanate potassium may be enhanced when AUGMENTIN ES-600 is administered at the start of a meal.

2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients

Pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg: Based on the amoxicillin component (600 mg/5 mL), the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN ES-600 is 90 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, administered for 10 days (see Table 1 as a general example guideline for attainment of this dosage). This dose provides 6.4 mg/kg/day of the clavulanic acid component.

Table 1: General Dosage Guidelines for AUGMENTIN ES-600 in Pediatric Patients

Pediatric patients weighing greater than 40 kg: Experience with AUGMENTIN ES-600 in this group is not available.

2.3 Dosage in Adult Patients

Experience with AUGMENTIN ES-600 in adults is not available and adults who have difficulty swallowing should not be given AUGMENTIN ES-600 in place of the 500 mg or 875 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

2.4 Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and hepatic function monitored at regular intervals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

2.5 Preparation of the Oral Suspension

Prepare the suspension at time of dispensing as follows: Tap bottle until all powder flows freely. Measure the total amount of water (see Table 2) to be added in two parts. Add approximately 2/3 of the total amount of water for reconstitution, replace cap and shake vigorously to suspend powder. Add remainder of the water (that had been measured), replace cap and again shake vigorously.

Table 2: Volume of Water for Reconstituting AUGMENTIN ES-600

Each 5 mL will contain 600 mg of amoxicillin as the trihydrate, and 42.9 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.

Shake oral suspension well before each use. Suspension must be refrigerated. Discard after 10 days. Suspension is off-white at time of reconstitution; some color change is normal during the dosing period.

Safety

In 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies, AUGMENTIN XR
(2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours, n = 577) was compared to AUGMENTIN
(875 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours, n = 570), administered for 7 days for the
treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Adverse events, regardless of
relationship to test drug, were reported by 44.4% of patients who received
AUGMENTIN XR (versus 46.3% in comparator group). Treatment-related adverse
events were reported in 21.7% of patients who received AUGMENTIN XR (versus
21.2% in comparator group); most were mild and transient in nature. Adverse
events which led to withdrawal were reported by 2.8% of patients who received
AUGMENTIN XR (versus 5.3% in comparator group). In each group, the most
frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea (14.4% versus 13.0%, p = 0.47),
nausea (3.5% versus 4.4%), and headache (3.5% versus 3.2%). Only 2 patients
(0.3%) who received AUGMENTIN XR and 3 patients (0.5%) in the comparator group
withdrew due to diarrhea. Serious adverse events considered suspected or
probably related to test drug were reported in 0.3% of patients (versus 0.5% in

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given AUGMENTIN (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to AUGMENTIN. The amoxicillin doses in rats and mice (based on body surface area) were approximately 4 and 2 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (875 mg every 12 hours). For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 9 and 4 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (125 mg every 8 hours). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

8.2 Labor and Delivery

Oral ampicillin‑class antibacterials are poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Amoxicillin has been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets have been established in pediatric patients. Use of AUGMENTIN in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from studies of AUGMENTIN Tablets in adults with additional data from a study of AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension in pediatric patients aged 2 months to 12 years with acute otitis media [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed; clavulanate elimination is unaltered in this age group. Dosing of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium should be modified in pediatric patients aged less than 12 weeks (less than 3 months) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

12.1 Mechanism of Action

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin and clavulanate were determined in a study of 19 pediatric patients, 8 months to 11 years, given AUGMENTIN ES-600 at an amoxicillin dose of 45 mg/kg q12h with a snack or meal. The mean plasma amoxicillin and clavulanate pharmacokinetic parameter values are listed in the Table 3.

Table 3. Mean (± SD) Plasma Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values Following Administration of 45 mg/kg of AUGMENTIN ES-600 Every 12 Hours to Pediatric Patients

The effect of food on the oral absorption of AUGMENTIN ES-600 has not been studied.

Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of 10 mL of 250 mg/5 mL suspension of AUGMENTIN.

Neither component in AUGMENTIN ES-600 is highly protein-bound; clavulanic acid has been found to be approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound.

Oral administration of a single dose of AUGMENTIN ES-600 at 45 mg/kg (based on the amoxicillin component) to pediatric patients, 9 months to 8 years, yielded the following pharmacokinetic data for amoxicillin in plasma and middle ear fluid (MEF):

Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids, with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid. The results of experiments involving the administration of clavulanic acid to animals suggest that this compound, like amoxicillin, is well distributed in body tissues.

Drug Interaction Studies

Clinical Studies

Concurrent administration of probenecid delays amoxicillin excretion but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid.

2.5 Directions for Mixing Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium for Oral Suspension

Prepare AUGMENTIN for oral suspension at time of dispensing as follows: Tap bottle until all powder flows freely. Measure a total (see Table 5 below for total amount of water for reconstitution) OF WATER. Add approximately 2/3 of the water to the powder. Replace cap and shake VIGOROUSLY. Add remaining water. Replace cap and shake VIGOROUSLY.

Table 5: Amount of Water for Mixing AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension

Shake oral suspension well before using. Reconstituted suspension must be stored under refrigeration and discarded after 10 days. Some color change is normal during dosing period.

2.6 Switching between Dosage Forms and between Strengths

AUGMENTIN 250 mg/125 mg Tablet is NOT Substitutable with AUGMENTIN 250 mg/62.5 mg Chewable Tablet

The 250 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN and the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN should NOT be substituted for each other and the 250 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN should NOT be used in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The 250 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN and the 250 mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN do not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid. The 250 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid whereas the 250 mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid.

Two AUGMENTIN 250 mg/125 mg Tablets are NOT Substitutable with One 500 mg/125 mg AUGMENTIN Tablet

Two 250 mg/125 mg tablets of AUGMENTIN should NOT be substituted for one 500 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN. Since both the 250 mg and 500 mg tablets of AUGMNTIN contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (125 mg, as the potassium salt), two 250 mg tablets of AUGMENTIN are not equivalent to one 500 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

Adults with a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) were
evaluated in 3 clinical studies. In one study, 363 patients were randomized to
receive either AUGMENTIN XR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours or
levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 10 days in a double-blind, multicenter,
prospective trial. These patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated
at the test of cure (day 17–28) visit. The combined clinical and radiological
responses were 83.7% for AUGMENTIN XR and 84.3% for levofloxacin at the test of
cure visit in clinically evaluable patients (95% CI for the treatment difference
-9.4, 8.3). The clinical response rates at the test of cure were 87.0% and
88.6%, respectively.

The other 2 trials were non-comparative, multicenter studies designed to
assess the bacteriological and clinical efficacy of AUGMENTIN XR (2,000
mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days) in the treatment of 2288 patients
with ABS. Evaluation timepoints were the same as in the prior study. Patients
underwent maxillary sinus puncture for culture prior to receiving study
medication. At test of cure, the clinical success rates were 87.5% and 86.6%
(intention-to-treat) and 92.5% and 92.1% (per protocol populations).

### Amoxicillin / clavulanate for infections in infants and children: past, present and future [^1162TPSu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Chemical synthesis of the penicillin nucleus in the 1950s made introduction of a broad array of new and important antimicrobials, including ampicillin and amoxicillin, possible. Ampicillin was introduced in 1962 in oral and parenteral forms as the first of the semisynthetic penicillins to provide increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Amoxicillin replaced oral ampicillin beginning in 1974 because amoxicillin resulted in higher and more prolonged serum concentrations than did equivalent doses of ampicillin. Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) was introduced in the United States in 1984 to enhance the activity of amoxicillin by addition of the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid. During the past 20 years, amoxicillin/clavulanate has proven effective for a variety of pediatric infectious diseases, particularly acute otitis media (AOM). In 2001, a new pediatric formulation, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES-600) was approved for use in the United States. The high dose preparation addressed the needs of pediatricians by providing greater amounts of amoxicillin while maintaining the same daily dose of clavulanic acid as the regular strength formulation. Doubling the dose of amoxicillin for management of recurrent and persistent AOM was recommended in 1999 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of concern about the increased incidence of nonsusceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The original formulation combined amoxicillin/clavulanate in a 4:1 ratio and was followed by a 7:1 ratio formulation. The high dose formulation (600 mg of amoxicillin per 5 ml) provides a 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate. Although management of AOM will likely undergo changes in the coming years, amoxicillin is expected to remain first line therapy for AOM. For children who fail initial therapy with amoxicillin, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate, an oral cephalosporin or parenteral ceftriaxone is recommended.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.

Amoxicillin and clavulanate (4:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. Amoxicillin and clavulanate was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at concentrations that were also associated with decreased cell survival. Amoxicillin and clavulanate was negative in the mouse micronucleus test, and in the dominant lethal assay in mice. Clavulanate potassium alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test and was negative in each of these assays.

Amoxicillin and clavulanate (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses of up to 1,200 mg/kg/day was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance in rats. Based on body surface area (assuming a 20 kg child), this dose of amoxicillin is approximately 2 times the recommended clinical AUGMENTIN ES-600 dose of 90/6.4 mg/kg/day. For clavulanate, the dose multiple is approximately 15 times higher than the recommended clinical daily dose, also based on body surface area.

14.2 Acute Bacterial Otitis Media and Diarrhea in Pediatric Patients

One US/Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided every 12 hours) of AUGMENTIN for 10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided every 8 hours) of AUGMENTIN for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. Only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. A total of 575 pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years) were enrolled, with an even distribution among the 2 treatment groups and a comparable number of patients were evaluable (i.e., greater than or equal to 84%) per treatment group. Otitis media‑specific criteria were required for eligibility and a strong correlation was found at the end of therapy and follow‑up between these criteria and physician assessment of clinical response. The clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy visit (defined as 2 to 4 days after the completion of therapy) and at the follow‑up visit (defined as 22 to 28 days post‑completion of therapy) were comparable for the 2 treatment groups, with the following cure rates obtained for the evaluable patients: At end of therapy, 87% (n equals 265) and 82% (n equals 260) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively. At follow‑up, 67% (n equals 249) and 69% (n equals 243) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively.

5.6 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth

The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfection occurs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

5.7 Phenylketonurics

AUGMENTIN Chewable tablets and AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine. Each 200 mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN contains 2.1 mg phenylalanine; each 400 mg chewable tablet contains 4.2 mg phenylalanine; each 5 mL of either the 200 mg/5 mL or 400 mg/5 mL oral suspension contains 7 mg phenylalanine. The other formulations of AUGMENTIN do not contain phenylalanine.

5.8 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing AUGMENTIN in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug‑resistant bacteria.

Susceptibility Test Methods

When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should
provide cumulative results of in vitro susceptibility test results for
antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician
as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and
community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in
selecting the most effective antimicrobial.

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the
susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be
determined using a standardized procedure.1,3Standardized procedures are based on dilution methods (broth or agar; broth for S. pneumoniae and H.
influenzae) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentration and
standardized concentrations of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder.

The recommended dilution pattern utilizes a constant amoxicillin/clavulanate
potassium ratio of 2 to 1 in all tubes with varying amounts of amoxicillin. MICs
are expressed in terms of the amoxicillin concentration in the presence of
clavulanic acid at a constant 2 parts amoxicillin to 1 part clavulanic acid. The
MIC values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in
Table 3.

Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters
also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to
antimicrobials. One such standardized technique requires the use of a
standardized inoculum concentration.1,4This procedure
uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium
(20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) to test susceptibility of
microorganisms to amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium. Disk diffusion zone sizes
should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 3.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology 12.4]

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Mean amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium pharmacokinetic parameters in normal adults following administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are shown in Table 3 and following administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and chewable tablets are shown in Table 4.

Table 4: Mean (± S.D.) Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Pharmacokinetic Parameters with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium Powder for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets

aMean (± standard deviation) values of 28 normal adults. Peak concentrations occurred approximately 1 hour after the dose.

bAmoxicillin/clavulanate potassium administered at the start of a light meal.

Oral administration of 5 mL of 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium or the equivalent dose of 10 mL of 125 mg/31.5 mg per 5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium provides average peak serum concentrations approximately 1 hour after dosing of 6.9 mcg/mL for amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL for clavulanic acid. The areas under the serum concentration curves obtained during the first 4 hours after dosing were 12.6 mcg*h/mL for amoxicillin and 2.9 mcg*h/mL for clavulanic acid when 5 mL of 250 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium or equivalent dose of 10 mL of 125 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium were administered to normal adults. One 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium or two 125 mg/31.25 mg chewable tablet of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are equivalent to 5 mL of 250 mg/5 mL suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium and provide similar serum concentrations of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration with probenecid is not recommended. (7.1)
Concomitant use of AUGMENTIN ES-600 with oral anticoagulants may increase the prolongation of prothrombin time. (7.2)
Co-administration with allopurinol increases the risk of rash. (7.3)
AUGMENTIN ES-600 may reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. (7.4)

7.1 Probenecid

Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use with AUGMENTIN ES-600 may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. Co-administration of probenecid is not recommended.

7.2 Oral Anticoagulants

Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.

7.3 Allopurinol

The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with AUGMENTIN ES-600 and allopurinol administered concurrently.

7.4 Oral Contraceptives

AUGMENTIN ES-600 may affect intestinal flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.

7.5 Effects on Laboratory Tests

High urine concentrations of amoxicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST®, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution. Since this effect may also occur with AUGMENTIN ES-600, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions be used.

Following administration of amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin ES-600) [^111oa2Bf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is a combination of amoxicillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and clavulanate potassium, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg with:

Recurrent or persistent acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae (penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL), H. influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) characterized by the following risk factors (1): Antibacterial exposure for acute otitis media within the preceding 3 months, and either of the following: 1) age 2 years, or younger or 2) day care attendance.

Limitations of Use

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is not indicated for the treatment of acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 4 mcg/mL. Acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve both S. pneumoniae (penicillin MIC less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL) and the beta lactamase producing organisms listed above. (1)

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (1)

2.2 Pediatric Patients

Based on the amoxicillin component, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be dosed as follows:

Neonates and Infants Aged < 12 weeks (< 3 months): The recommended dose of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet is 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, based on the amoxicillin component. Experience with the 200 mg/5 mL formulation in this age group is limited, and thus, use of the 125 mg/5 mL oral suspension is recommended.

Patients Aged 12 weeks (3 months) and Older: See dosing regimens provided in Table 1. The every 12 hour regimen is recommended as it is associated with significantly less diarrhea [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Table 1: Dosing in Patients Aged 12 weeks (3 months) and Older

aEach strength of suspension of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is available as a chewable tablet for use by older children.

bDuration of therapy studied and recommended for acute otitis media is 10 days.

Patients Weighing 40 kg or More: Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations.

The 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should not be used until the child weighs at least 40 kg, due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the 250 mg/125 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (250/125) versus the 250 mg/62.5 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (Chewable).

2.3 Patients with Renal Impairment

Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe. Renal impairment patients with a glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min should not receive the 875 mg/125 mg dose. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection.

Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg with:

Recurrent or persistent acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae (penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL), H. influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or M. catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) characterized by the following risk factors:

- Antibacterial drug exposure for acute otitis media within the preceding 3 months, and either of the following: 1) age 2 years, or younger or 2) day care attendance [see Microbiology (12.4)].

Limitations of Use

AUGMENTIN ES-600 is not indicated for the treatment of acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MIC greater than or equal to 4 mcg/mL. Acute otitis media due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve both S. pneumoniae (penicillin MIC less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL) and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms listed above.

Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 3,119 patients in an analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, 32% were ≥ 65 years old, and 14% were ≥ 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Dosing in Renal Impairment

Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min). See Patients with Renal Impairment (2.3) for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.

### Overview of newer antimicrobial formulations for overcoming pneumococcal resistance [^1116Ukz9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of an antimicrobial agent provides important information that can be used to maximize bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, minimize selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance, and determine an optimal dosing regimen. Judicious selection of an antimicrobial based on local susceptibility data and PK and PD parameters is imperative in this era of increasing resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. The beta-lactam antimicrobials display time-dependent bacterial killing with minimal to no persistent effects. Ketolides and fluoroquinolones display concentration-dependent bacterial killing, and tetracyclines and macrolides display time-dependent killing. All have prolonged persistent effects (e.g., postantibiotic effect) that retard or prevent bacterial regrowth when free drug levels fall below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). New high-dose and/or extended-release formulations of traditional antimicrobials have been added to the current armamentarium for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. These formulations include amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension 90/6.4 mg/kg per day divided every 12 hours (Augmentin ES-600; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets 2 × 1,000 mg/62.5 mg every 12 hours (Augmentin XR; GlaxoSmithKline), clarithromycin extended-release tablets 2 × 500 mg once daily (Biaxin XL; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and cefaclor extended-release tablets 375 mg or 500 mg every 12 hours (Ceclor CD; Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, IN). Of these agents, only amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets were designed to treat infections caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci (penicillin MIC ≤ 2 microg/mL). Extended-release clarithromycin does not provide higher daily doses than its immediate-release counterpart; rather, it allows for once-daily dosing of this agent because of its slower absorption following oral administration. Extended-release cefaclor is considered clinically equivalent to 250 mg of immediate-release cefaclor pulvules administered 3 times daily; it cannot be used interchangeably with 500 mg 3-times-daily dosages of other cefaclor formulations. Thus, despite providing a similar or higher total daily dose than its immediate-release counterpart, extended-release cefaclor is indicated only for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of certain organisms.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibacterial with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamases, and therefore, its spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam, structurally related to penicillin, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases frequently found responsible for transferred drug resistance.

The clavulanic acid component of AUGMENTIN ES-600 protects amoxicillin from degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, AUGMENTIN ES-600 possesses the distinctive properties of a broad spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

Antimicrobial Activity

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Gram-Positive bacteria:

Streptococcus pneumoniae (including isolates with penicillin MICs less than or equal to 2 mcg/mL)

Gram-Negative bacteria:

Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. However, the safety and efficacy of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in treating infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials.

Gram-Positive bacteria:

Staphylococcus aureus (including beta-lactamase-producing isolates)

Staphylococci which are resistant to methicillin/oxacillin must be considered resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

Streptococcus pyogenes

S. pyogenes do not produce beta-lactamase, and therefore, are susceptible to amoxicillin alone. Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials have established the effectiveness of amoxicillin alone in treating certain clinical infections due to S. pyogenes.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

Key Points

Question

Will additional amoxicillin benefit adults with acute bacterial sinusitis treated with standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 157 patients with sinusitis was stopped early for futility when an interim analysis showed that a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days was reported by 31 of 70 patients (44.3%) who received a standard dose of amoxicillin plus clavulanate but only 24 of 66 patients (36.4%) receiving a high dose.

Meaning

Additional amoxicillin does not appear to benefit adults receiving standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate for acute sinusitis.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension and chewable tablets have been established in pediatric patients. Use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets in adults with additional data from a study of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension in pediatric patients aged 2 months to 12 years with acute otitis media [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed; clavulanate elimination is unaltered in this age group. Dosing of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be modified in pediatric patients aged < 12 weeks (< 3 months) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 3,119 patients in an analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, 32% were ≥ 65 years old, and 14% were ≥ 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Dosing in Renal Impairment

Amoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min). See Patients with Renal Impairment (2.3) for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (4:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was negative in the mouse micronucleus test, and in the dominant lethal assay in mice.

Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays.

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses of up to 1,200 mg/kg/day was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance in rats. Based on body surface area, this dose of amoxicillin is approximately 4 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (875 mg every 12 hours). For clavulanate, the dose multiple is approximately 9 times higher than the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (125 mg every 8 hours), also based on body surface area.

Patients Weighing 40 kg or More: Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations.

The amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet 250 mg/125 mg should not be used until the child weighs at least 40 kg, due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet 250 mg/125 mg versus the amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablet 250 mg/62.5 mg.

2.3 Patients with Renal Impairment

Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe. Renal impairment patients with a glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min should not receive the amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets 875 mg/125 mg dose. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min should receive amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min should receive amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection.

Hemodialysis patients should receive amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets 500 mg/125 mg or 250 mg/125 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis.

14.2 Acute Bacterial Otitis Media and Diarrhea in Pediatric Patients

One U.S./Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided every 12 hours) of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for 10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided every 8 hours) of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. Only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. A total of 575 pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years) were enrolled, with an even distribution among the 2 treatment groups and a comparable number of patients were evaluable (i.e., ≥ 84%) per treatment group. Otitis media-specific criteria were required for eligibility and a strong correlation was found at the end of therapy and follow-up between these criteria and physician assessment of clinical response. The clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy visit (defined as 2 to 4 days after the completion of therapy) and at the follow-up visit (defined as 22 to 28 days post-completion of therapy) were comparable for the 2 treatment groups, with the following cure rates obtained for the evaluable patients: At end of therapy, 87% (n = 265) and 82% (n = 260) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively. At follow-up, 67% (n = 249) and 69% (n = 243) for 45 mg/kg/day every 12 hours and 40 mg/kg/day every 8 hours, respectively.

The number of bacteriologically evaluable patients was comparable between the two dosing regimens. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium produced comparable bacteriological success rates in patients assessed 2 to 4 days immediately following end of therapy. The bacteriologic efficacy rates were comparable at one of the follow-up visits (5 to 9 days post-therapy) and at a late post-therapy visit (in the majority of cases, this was 2 to 4 weeks post-therapy).

As noted before, though there was no significant difference in the percentage of adverse events in each group, there was a statistically significant difference in rates of severe diarrhea or withdrawals with diarrhea between the regimens.

### Oral amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid: properties, indications and usage [^113Wjyhn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Amoxicillin has been in use since the 1970s; it is the most widely used penicillin both alone and in combination with the β-lactamase clavulanic acid.

Objectives

In this narrative review, we re-examine the properties of oral amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and provide guidance on their use, with emphasis on the preferred use of amoxicillin alone.

Sources

Published medical literature (MEDLINE database via Pubmed).

Content

While amoxicillin and clavulanic acid have similar half-lives, clavulanic acid is more protein bound and even less heat stable than amoxicillin, with primarily hepatic metabolism. It is also more strongly associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including Clostridium difficile infection, and, thus, in oral combination formulations, limits the maximum daily dose of amoxicillin that can be given. The first ratio for an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination was set at 4:1 due to clavulanic acid's high affinity for β-lactamases; ratios of 2:1, 7:1, 14:1 and 16:1 are currently available in various regions. Comparative effectiveness data for the different ratios are scarce. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is often used as empiric therapy for many of the World Health Organization's Priority Infectious Syndromes in adults and children, leading to extensive consumption, when some of these syndromes could be handled with a delayed antibiotic prescription approach or amoxicillin alone.

Implications

Using available epidemiological and pharmacokinetic data, we provide guidance on indications for amoxicillin versus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and on optimal oral administration, including choice of combination ratio. More data are needed, particularly on heat stability, pharmacodynamic effects and emergence of resistance in 'real-world' clinical settings.

### Necessity of amoxicillin clavulanic acid in addition to prednisolone in mild-to-moderate COPD exacerbations [^11419Yes]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Study design

This study was a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to either the intervention or control group based on a computer generated randomisation list. The hospital pharmacy provided both amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and placebo in identical containers with identical capsules. Based on the randomisation list, the hospital pharmacy sequentially numbered the containers with both amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and placebo. This list was kept in a safe at the hospital pharmacy throughout the course of the study. Patients received these numbered containers in sequence of randomisation, which was recorded on a medication distribution list.

Patients in both groups received oral prednisolone, 30 mg/day for 7 days. Patients in the intervention group additionally received oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin) 500/125 mg three times daily for 7 days, while control patients received a matching placebo. The choice for this amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is based on the negligible prevalence of organisms resistance in our region (less than 5%). All patients continued their prescribed inhaled regimen. Patients were followed for 28 days for the primary outcome and for 4 months to detect new AECOPDs.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome was the duration of the AECOPD. Start of the AECOPD was defined as the day the patient presented with an AECOPD at the outpatient clinic. The end day of the AECOPD was based on a symptom diary, which patients completed daily. In this diary, patients reported whether their major symptoms and minor symptoms, according to Anthonisen et al (table 1), were beyond normal. At inclusion all patients received a 'what is normal' card on which their individual levels of major symptoms in stable health state were recorded. This card was used as a reference for the diary. When patients experienced no increase in severity of any symptoms listed in the diary, they could tick 'no change in symptoms'. In all other cases, they had to report on all the symptoms in the diary - whether the level of each symptom was normal, whether there was a small increase or an evident increase in severity compared to their stable state.

### Evaluation of amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin) for antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis following Bacillus anthracis inhalational exposure in cynomolgus macaques [^116VkW5V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative infections, such as infections of the ear, nose, and throat, genitourinary tract, skin, and lower respiratory tract; gonorrhea; and Helicobacter pylori. The prophylactic benefit of both amoxicillin and Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanate for use against β-lactamase-expressing bacteria) was evaluated for inhalation anthrax in cynomolgus macaques in 2 studies. A pilot study on amoxicillin-clavulanate that used a portion of the study animals demonstrated empirically that dosing twice a day was efficacious. In a subsequent study on both amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate that used the remaining study animals, the animals were treated orally every 12 hours on days 1–28 postchallenge and followed for an additional 60 days (total of 88 days from day of aerosol challenge to when the animals were culled). The animals from each treatment arm of the 2 studies were completely protected. All untreated animals succumbed to the infection. The degree of protection observed in this study suggests that both amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, administered prophylactically over a period of 28 days after a lethal exposure to Bacillus anthracis spores, is sufficient for full protection.

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. The amoxicillin doses in rats and mice (based on body surface area) were approximately 4 and 2 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (875 mg/125 mg every 12 hours). For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 9 and 4 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (125 mg every 8 hours). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

8.2 Labor and Delivery

Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Amoxicillin has been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension and chewable tablets have been established in pediatric patients. Use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from studies of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets in adults with additional data from a study of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension in pediatric patients aged 2 months to 12 years with acute otitis media [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]

Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed; clavulanate elimination is unaltered in this age group. Dosing of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be modified in pediatric patients aged < 12 weeks (< 3 months) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]

### The clinical pharmacokinetics of a new pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation of amoxicillin / clavulanate [^115jr6RF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A new oral pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation of the broad-spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin/clavulanate has been developed to provide more effective therapy against resistant pathogens than is provided by currently available formulations by maintaining therapeutically useful plasma amoxicillin concentrations for a longer period after dosing.

Objective

This study explored the pharmacokinetics of the new oral formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate in healthy male and female subjects.

Methods

A single oral dose of pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate (2000/125 mg; 16:1 ratio) was administered to subjects at the start of a meal. After dosing, blood samples were collected at frequent intervals up to 12 hours, and plasma was assayed for amoxicillin and clavulanate concentrations using validated procedures. The new formulation consisted of 1 layer of immediate-release amoxicillin and clavulanate and another of sustained-release amoxicillin in a proportion such that for an amoxicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 microg/mL, the time above the MIC (T > MIC) would be approximately ≥ 40% over a 12-hour dosing interval.

Results

The study enrolled 24 and 31 healthy male and female subjects, respectively. Their mean age was 35 years (range, 18–58 years) and mean body weight was 69 kg (range, 51–86 kg). After the expected sharp peak in plasma amoxicillin concentration, there appeared to be a slower decline with the pharmacokinetically enhanced formulation than is usually seen with conventional formulations, and there was evidence of a second amoxicillin absorption phase. The mean T > MIC for an amoxicillin MIC of 4 microg/mL was 49.4% of a 12-hour dosing interval, a value that cannot be achieved with existing approved doses and formulations of amoxicillin/clavulanate. By 12 hours, plasma amoxicillin concentrations were very low (approximately 0.05 microg/mL), suggesting no expectation of notable dose-to-dose accumulation on repeat dosing with a BID regimen. The terminal half-lives of amoxicillin (1.27 hours) and clavulanate (1.03 hours) with the new formulation were similar to those of existing formulations of amoxicillin/clavulanate. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

The enhanced pharmacokinetic profile of amoxicillin/clavulanate seen in this study suggests that this formulation is likely to be highly effective for the oral treatment of infections caused by bacteria — including beta-lactamase-producing organisms — and strains with amoxicillin MICs ≤ 4 microg/mL.

### Effective dose range of mometasone furoate nasal spray in the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis [^111WXtbd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) 400 microg, twice daily, as adjunctive treatment with oral antibiotic significantly improved symptoms of recurrent rhinosinusitis.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MFNS 200 microg, twice daily, and 400 microg, twice daily, compared with placebo as adjunctive treatment with oral antibiotic for acute rhinosinusitis.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 967 outpatients with computed tomographic scan-confirmed moderate to severe rhinosinusitis received amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (Augmentin, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) 875 mg, twice daily, for 21 days with adjunctive twice daily MFNS 200 microg, MFNS 400 microg, or placebo nasal spray. Patients recorded scores of six rhinosinusitis symptoms and any adverse events twice daily. Pre- and postcosyntropin-stimulation plasma cortisol levels were measured in a subset of patients at selected study sites.

Results

Treatment with MFNS 200 microg or 400 microg, twice daily, produced significantly greater improvements in total symptoms score (primary efficacy variable) day 1 to day 15 average (50% and 51%, respectively) than placebo (44%, P ≤ 0.017). Both doses of MFNS produced significant total symptoms score improvement over placebo by day 4, and maintained efficacy over the entire 21-day study. Relief of individual symptoms showed a similar pattern. Both doses of MFNS were well tolerated, and adverse events were similar to that of placebo. Cosyntropin stimulation showed no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression.

Conclusions

As adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotic treatment, MFNS at doses of 200 microg or 400 microg, twice daily, was well tolerated and significantly more effective in reducing the symptoms of rhinosinusitis than antibiotic therapy alone.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^116NN5uF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We compared baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes using χ² tests, Fisher exact tests, and t tests as appropriate for differences in proportions and means. We reported 95% CIs and P values for the differences in proportions between the 2 groups, and we reported standard deviations (SDs) for the means for the groups as well as 95% CIs and P values for the differences between these means. We used the statistical software Stata, version 15.0 (StataCorp LLC) for analysis and assessed statistical significance at the.05 level.

To look for potential confounding factors, we analyzed the effect on the primary outcome of any significant differences between groups in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. In our unplanned interim analysis, we did a best-case analysis for participants lost to follow-up, classifying those missing in the high-dose arm as a GRI 5 or 6 and in the standard-dose arm as a GRI less than 5. After the decision to stop the trial, we investigated futility further by calculating, under different assumptions, the conditional power of finding the proposed 18% increase in positive outcomes in the high-dose group if we would continue to the planned enrollment of 115 in each group.

We had planned to do repeat analyses by combining the participants in this study and those in the second time period of the initial study (because the methodology was the same). Given the negative results of the current study, however, we looked only at the primary efficacy outcome.

### Building in efficacy: developing solutions to combat drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [^115pKvFR]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The development of our understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles that determine antimicrobial efficacy has advanced substantially over the last 10 years. We are now in a position to use PK/PD principles to set targets for antimicrobial design and optimisation so that we can predict eradication of specific pathogens or resistant variants when agents are used clinically. Optimisation of PK/PD parameters to enable the treatment of resistant pathogens with oral agents may not be possible with many current agents, such as some cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Aminopenicillins, however, such as amoxicillin, have linear PK and have a good safety profile even at high doses. The new pharmacokinetically enhanced oral formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate, 2000/125 mg twice daily, was designed using PK/PD principles to be able to eradicate Streptococcus pneumoniae with amoxicillin MICs of up to and including 4 mg/L, which includes most penicillin-resistant isolates. For amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, a time above MIC (T > MIC) of 35–40% of the dosing interval (based on blood levels) is predictive of high bacteriological efficacy. This target was met by the design of a unique bilayer tablet incorporating 437.5 mg of sustained-release sodium amoxicillin in one layer plus 562.5 mg of immediate-release amoxicillin trihydrate and 62.5 mg of clavulanate potassium in the second layer, with two tablets administered for each dose. This unique design extends the bacterial killing time by increasing the T > MIC to 49% of the dosing interval against pathogens with MICs of 4 mg/L, and 60% of the dosing interval against pathogens with MICs of 2 mg/L. Based on these results, this new amoxicillin/clavulanate formulation should be highly effective in treating respiratory tract infections due to drug-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.
