## Question

which antibiotics reverse celiac disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics, if any, can reverse celiac disease and whether antibiotics have a role in its management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology to determine if an antimicrobial rationale exists. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for first-line and refractory disease. Next, I will examine where antibiotics appear in the evidence base, including disease risk and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. After that, I should review the microbiome and probiotic literature to avoid overinterpreting correlations. Finally, I will consider emerging non-antibiotic pharmacotherapies and synthesize a cautious, patient-centered conclusion with clear clinical guidance [^1133y7Qs] [^114YFNj5] [^112PfpU4] [^114gd22p].

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated, T-cell driven enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible hosts, with autoantibodies to tissue transglutaminase and characteristic small-bowel mucosal injury; mechanistically, this is not an infectious process, so antibiotics would not be expected to reverse the underlying pathophysiology or induce mucosal healing per se [^1133y7Qs] [^114YFNj5].

> Next, I should review what authoritative guidelines say about treatment. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before checking the documents. All major societies agree that strict, lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet is the only proven therapy for uncomplicated celiac disease, and for nonresponsive or refractory cases, recommended approaches include systematic evaluation for ongoing gluten exposure and other etiologies, dietitian-led optimization, and, when true refractory celiac disease is confirmed, corticosteroids such as open-capsule budesonide or prednisone with selective use of immunomodulators; antibiotics are not listed as disease-modifying therapy for celiac disease in these pathways [^114YFNj5] [^112PfpU4] [^114gd22p] [^112C6DE9] [^116CCvNE].

> I will now examine where antibiotics enter the evidence base. Wait, let me verify the direction of association. Multiple large observational datasets link early-life systemic antibiotic exposure with a higher subsequent risk of celiac disease, with dose-response signals and similar concerns for acid suppression, suggesting microbiome perturbation as a potential contributor rather than a remedy; these are associations and not proofs of causality, but they do not support antibiotics as a treatment for celiac disease itself [^116U3fuG] [^113dvXSM] [^111c7eue].

> But wait, what if persistent symptoms on a gluten-free diet reflect small intestinal bacterial overgrowth rather than active celiac disease. I should double-check the interventional data here. In poorly responsive celiac cohorts, a placebo-controlled trial of rifaximin did not improve gastrointestinal symptoms, and expert guidance emphasizes evaluating for SIBO and other mimics systematically rather than empirically treating with antibiotics; if SIBO is objectively confirmed, targeted therapy may be appropriate for SIBO, but that is treatment of a comorbidity, not reversal of celiac disease [^114ZFDp2] [^114gd22p].

> Next, I should review the microbiome literature to ensure I'm not overextending conclusions. Let me consider the balance of evidence. Dysbiosis is described in celiac disease and may be involved in pathogenesis, but current data are largely correlative; probiotics have limited and inconsistent signals and, per ACG guidance, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against their use as celiac disease therapy, reinforcing that neither antibiotics nor probiotics currently supplant the gluten-free diet as disease treatment [^114YFNj5] [^114RWMvt] [^1131SECq].

> I will now examine emerging pharmacologic strategies to make sure I'm not missing an antibiotic candidate. Hold on, I should verify the mechanisms. Candidate drugs in phase 2–3 trials target gluten processing, transglutaminase 2 inhibition, immune-blockade, or induction of tolerance; these are not antibiotics and are being studied as adjuncts or alternatives to ease diet burden rather than as antimicrobial cures [^11289Rvf] [^113K4gPP].

> Let me reconsider my wording for the bottom line. My initial impulse is to say "antibiotics are contraindicated for celiac disease", but wait, that overstates the evidence; I should confirm the precise guidance. Guidelines do not label antibiotics as contraindicated in celiac disease — they simply are not a treatment for the disease and should be reserved for confirmed bacterial indications, while strict lifelong gluten avoidance remains the only proven therapy, with steroid-based regimens and specialist referral for confirmed refractory celiac disease [^114YFNj5] [^112PfpU4] [^114gd22p].

No antibiotics reverse **celiac disease** [^1111vWMx]. The only effective treatment is **a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet** [^112LWDxN], which leads to mucosal healing [^114sJVLJ] and symptom resolution [^112PfpU4]. Antibiotics are not recommended for celiac disease management and do not reverse the autoimmune process; they are used only for confirmed infections or complications such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) [^114gd22p] [^114ZFDp2]. Emerging therapies are under investigation but are not yet approved or proven to replace the gluten-free diet [^114p5PCw] [^11289Rvf] [^117Ct44U].

## Pathophysiology of celiac disease

Celiac disease is an **autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten ingestion** [^1133y7Qs] in genetically predisposed individuals, leading to immune-mediated inflammation and villous atrophy in the small intestine [^116eAYHL]. The cornerstone of treatment is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet [^112LWDxN], which results in mucosal healing [^114LLAVf] and symptom resolution [^112PfpU4].

---

## Role of antibiotics in celiac disease

Antibiotics are not indicated for the treatment or reversal of **celiac disease** [^1111vWMx]. Their primary role in celiac disease management is limited to treating confirmed bacterial infections or complications [^114gd22p] such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) [^114ZFDp2]. Antibiotics do not address the underlying autoimmune response triggered by gluten ingestion [^1133y7Qs].

---

## Evidence regarding antibiotics and celiac disease

Current clinical guidelines and scientific literature consistently emphasize that **antibiotics do not reverse celiac disease** [^1111vWMx]. The only proven treatment [^11289Rvf] is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet [^112LWDxN] [^112PfpU4]. Antibiotics are not recommended as a primary or adjunctive therapy for celiac disease [^1111vWMx].

---

## Potential risks of antibiotic use in celiac disease

Antibiotic use in celiac disease patients carries potential risks, including:

- **Alteration of gut microbiota**: Antibiotics can disrupt the gut microbiome, potentially exacerbating gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation [^1131SECq] [^114RWMvt].

- **Increased risk of infections**: Antibiotics may increase susceptibility to infections such as Clostridioides difficile, which can complicate celiac disease management [^1131SECq] [^114ZNYu9].

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Prolonged or inappropriate antibiotic use can lead to antibiotic resistance, complicating future treatment of bacterial infections [^114ZNYu9].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current clinical guidelines from major gastroenterological societies, including the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the European Society for the Study of Coeliac Disease (ESsCD), clearly state that antibiotics are not indicated for the treatment or reversal of celiac disease [^112PfpU4]. The only recommended treatment is **strict adherence to a gluten-free diet** [^112LWDxN] [^1111vWMx].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

While antibiotics are not effective in reversing celiac disease, emerging therapies are being investigated, including:

- **Enzyme therapies**: Designed to degrade gluten peptides before they trigger an immune response [^1128SsPU].

- **Immune-modulating therapies**: Targeting specific immune pathways involved in celiac disease pathogenesis [^116TbmPu].

- **Microbiome-based therapies**: Aiming to restore healthy gut microbiota balance [^1142zqbh].

However, these therapies are still under investigation and are **not yet approved or proven to replace the gluten-free diet** [^114p5PCw] [^11289Rvf] [^117Ct44U].

---

## Conclusion

Antibiotics do not reverse **celiac disease** [^1111vWMx]. The only effective treatment is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet [^112LWDxN]. Antibiotics are only used to treat confirmed bacterial infections or complications such as SIBO [^114gd22p] [^114ZFDp2]. Current clinical guidelines do not recommend antibiotics as a primary or adjunctive therapy for celiac disease [^112PfpU4] [^1111vWMx].

### Coeliac disease and microbiota: Is it time for personalised biotics intervention? A scoping review [^111c7eue]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). Low credibility.

Several studies have evaluated the potential association between antibiotics and CeD. Some found an increased risk of CeD after antibiotic exposure, particularly in the first years of life, while others showed no association between CeD onset and antibiotic exposure. Gut microbiota becomes more stable by 3 years of age, and antibiotic exposure during this crucial period of microbiota engraftment could alter immunological maturation. Specifically, Mårild et al. reported in a Swedish register-based study that antibiotic exposure up to 3 years before the diagnosis was associated with the risk of developing CeD at all ages. Additionally, a cohort of more than 14,000 children demonstrated a significant antibiotic dose-dependent relationship for CeD and other chronic conditions, which was stronger in girls than in boys.

The prospective Celiac Disease Genomic Environmental Microbiome and Metabolomic (CDGEMM) study showed that zonulin levels, a biomarker of gut permeability, increase in children who developed CeD months ahead of the onset of the disease but not in control subjects. This study also showed that antibiotic exposure influenced zonulin levels in cases but not in controls, with the greater the number of antibiotic exposures, the greater the increase in zonulin before disease onset. Conversely, antibiotic exposure during prenatal life does not seem to be a potential risk factor for developing CeD.

The relationship between the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and CeD pathogenesis also points towards possible microbiome interference. Some studies found that the use of PPIs could be linked to changes in the gut microbiome that may contribute to the pathogenesis of CeD.

### Society for the study of celiac disease position statement on gaps and opportunities in coeliac disease [^116nsxdn]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Progress has been made in understanding coeliac disease, a relatively frequent and underappreciated immune-mediated condition that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. However, several gaps remain in knowledge related to diagnosis and management. The gluten-free diet, currently the only available management, is not curative or universally effective (some adherent patients have ongoing duodenal injury).

An unprecedented number of emerging therapies, including some with novel tolerogenic mechanisms, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. In March 2020, the Celiac Disease Foundation and the Society for the Study of Celiac Disease convened a consensus workshop to identify high-yield areas of research that should be prioritized. Workshop participants included leading experts in clinical practice, academia, government, and pharmaceutical development, as well as representatives from patient support groups in North America.

This roadmap summarizes key advances in the field of coeliac disease and provides information on important discussions from the consensus approach to address gaps and opportunities related to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of coeliac disease. The morbidity of coeliac disease is often underestimated, which has led to an unmet need to improve the management of these patients. Expanded research funding is needed as coeliac disease is a potentially curable disease.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: Guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology [^112oAaH8]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for coeliac disease (CD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Originally, oats were also avoided in the GFD. Earlier research indicates that oats uncontaminated by gluten are probably safe for patients with CD. This is important because oats contain soluble fiber, which can lower blood glucose and attenuate the insulin response. The appearance of symptoms related to introducing oats might be due to cross-contamination, and a small percentage of patients with CD may be sensitive to oats, potentially developing symptoms or even mucosal damage.

Patients with CD should be educated to avoid cereals and foods containing gluten. They should be encouraged to consume naturally occurring gluten-free foods and alternative sources of starch. Levels of susceptibility to gluten contamination in food vary among patients with CD. While it has been suggested that the acceptable threshold for gluten content in gluten-free products can be set at 100 ppm (¼ mg/kg) from a clinical perspective, the Codex Alimentarius Commission of the WHO issued new guidelines for gluten content in processed food in 2008. A law from the European Commission (EC41/2009), effective since January 2012, stipulated that foods labeled as "gluten free" should contain ≤ 20 parts per million.

### Novel therapies for coeliac disease [^1128SsPU]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Coeliac disease is a widespread, lifelong disorder for which dietary control represents the only accepted form of therapy. There is an unmet need for nondietary therapies to treat this condition. Most ongoing and emerging drug-discovery programs are based on the understanding that coeliac disease is caused by an inappropriate T-cell-mediated immune response to dietary gluten proteins. Recent genome-wide association studies lend further support to this pathogenic model. The central role of human leucocyte antigen genes has been validated, and several new risk loci have been identified, most of which are related to the biology of T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Here, we review the status of potential nondietary therapies under consideration for coeliac disease. We conclude that future development of novel therapies will be aided considerably by the identification of new, preferably noninvasive, surrogate markers for coeliac disease activity.

### Gut microbiota in celiac disease [^1131SECq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Antibiotic therapy and exposure can impact the composition of the gut flora and influence the development of chronic diseases. Patients who have an early intestinal infection treated with antibiotics can develop intestinal dysbiosis. The changes in gut microbiota may predispose individuals to a higher risk of celiac disease (CD). Norwegian and Danish case-control studies found that antibiotic exposure in the first year of life was positively correlated with a diagnosis of CD in later years. There also seems to be a dose-dependent relationship between the number of dispensed antibiotics and CD risk.

Additional population case-control studies conducted on Swedish, Italian, and North American children revealed a strong association between antibiotic therapy and the development of CD. However, none of these studies were able to delineate whether antibiotic use was simply a response to the manifestation of undiagnosed disease. A large multinational prospective cohort study (TEDDY) noted that the most prescribed antibiotics during the first four years of life, regardless of geographic region, were not associated with the development of autoimmunity for CD in children at increased genetic risk. These antibiotics included cephalosporins, penicillins, and macrolides. Furthermore, no association has been established between antibiotic consumption during pregnancy and the risk of CD, and the evidence is conflicting. Nevertheless, it is still best clinical practice to prescribe antibiotics for patients with bacterial infections. While there may be variances in gut microbiota due to delivery mode, it…

### European Society for the Study of Coeliac Disease (ESsCD) guideline for coeliac disease and other gluten-related disorders [^111KfHoA]. United European Gastroenterology Journal (2019). High credibility.

The 2019 ESsCD guidelines recommend suspecting a diagnosis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity in patients who exhibit gluten-related intestinal and/or extra-intestinal complaints. This suspicion is particularly warranted when these patients have negative results for celiac disease and positive wheat allergy serological markers while on a gluten-containing diet.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^112qpyj6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The management of celiac disease (CeD) currently relies on a gluten-free diet (GFD), which is generally well tolerated. While the GFD remains effective, it poses social, psychological, and practical challenges. Future treatments should improve efficacy while maintaining safety comparable to a GFD. New therapeutic approaches targeting the underlying mechanisms of CeD have emerged to ease the burden of dietary restrictions and improve patients' quality of life. These include strategies to modify gluten processing in the gut, block gluten-triggered immune responses, or restore immune tolerance to gluten.

This field of research is active, with ongoing and completed trials aiming to validate these methods. ZED1227 (also known as TAK-227) is a therapeutic agent that has garnered significant attention. If successful in the ongoing clinical trials, TAK-227 could represent a valid pharmacological treatment for celiac disease, offering an alternative to the strict GFD. Although phase II trials have shown promise for several therapeutic targets, broader validation through phase III trials is needed.

Clinical trials often show discrepancies between symptoms, serological findings, and mucosal biopsy results, emphasizing the need for further research. In many cases, final results and pitfalls have not been published yet. Moreover, the studies conducted so far exhibit several limitations in terms of both study design and methodology. In most cases, the protocols enrolled CeD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and evidence of duodenal mucosal damage, which often suggests poor adherence to a GFD.

### Early infections are associated with increased risk for celiac disease: An incident case-referent study [^115RyoYL]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Among the 373 included cases, there was a predominance of girls (67%) (Figure 1). The median age at celiac disease diagnosis was 14 months (inter-quartile range 12–18 months), with a median age at symptom onset of 11 months (inter-quartile range 9–13 months). Data on age at symptom onset was missing for 5% of the cases.

- **Study population characteristics**: We found no significant association between having siblings and celiac disease (OR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.74–1.3; P = 0.92) [Table 1]. Belonging to a family of lower socioeconomic strata, compared to high-medium strata, was associated with increased celiac disease risk (OR 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2–2.0; P = 0.002) [Table 1]. Adjusting for infant feeding and early infections reduced the risk estimate, but it remained statistically significant (adjusted OR 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.8; P = 0.037). Breastfeeding at the time of introducing gluten-containing foods into the infant's diet was associated with decreased risk for celiac disease [Table 1]. Introducing gluten in large amounts, compared to small and medium amounts, increased the risk [Table 1]. The age at gluten introduction was not an independent risk factor for celiac disease (adjusted OR 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9–2.4; P = 0.16).

- **Exposures before six months of age**: Bivariate conditional logistic regression was used, employing matched sets of cases with 1–2 referents.

- **Additional notes**: Preliminary versions of this result have previously been included in book chapters. These data have been published previously.

### How future pharmacologic therapies for celiac disease will complement the gluten-free diet [^11289Rvf]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The only proven treatment for celiac disease is adherence to a strict, lifelong, gluten-free diet. However, complete dietary gluten avoidance is challenging, and a substantial number of patients do not respond fully, clinically, or histologically despite their best efforts. As celiac disease is common and its central pathophysiology is well elucidated, it has become attractive for drug development to address the limitations of dietary treatment.

Most efforts target nonresponsive celiac disease, defined as continued symptoms and/or signs of disease activity despite adherence to a gluten-free diet, and the more severe forms of refractory celiac disease, types I and II. An increasing spectrum of therapeutic approaches targets defined mechanisms in celiac disease pathogenesis, and some have advanced to Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies.

We discuss these approaches in terms of potential efficiency, practicability, safety, and need as defined by patients, regulatory authorities, health care providers, and payors.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^116Aitd6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten, which is the storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye. It primarily affects the small intestine in individuals with a genetic predisposition and resolves with the exclusion of gluten from the diet.

There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years, along with an increase in the rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. Celiac disease can present with various symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, and abdominal pain. It can also manifest as non-gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as abnormal liver function tests, iron deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean manifestations. Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no symptoms at all.

Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies, and the diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The treatment for celiac disease primarily involves a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up.

Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing.

### Coeliac disease and microbiota: Is it time for personalised biotics intervention? A scoping review [^114D23e3]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). Low credibility.

A true increase in the prevalence of coeliac disease (CeD) has been witnessed worldwide. This 'on-the-rise' epidemiological trend for CeD is shared with other immune-mediated disorders and could be due to environment-driven gut microbiota perturbances.

- **Objectives**: To summarise recent evidence regarding possible relationships between microbiota disturbances and CeD onset, with a specific focus on pathogenesis and possible biotic-based therapeutic interventions.

- **Methods**: A literature search was launched on 20 August 2024 using Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus, using keywords as follows: celiac disease AND microbiota; celiac disease AND microbiome; celiac disease AND prebiotics; celiac disease AND probiotics; celiac disease AND symbiotics; celiac disease AND postbiotics.

- **Results**: A total of 1779 articles were retrieved from two authors' blinded search, of which 1297 were duplicates. 206 articles were excluded by abstract as they were commentaries, letters, or case series. A final set of 276 articles was suitable for the scope of our review and, after carefully reading the full-text articles, only 131 were considered valuable for the review and included as references.

- **Conclusions**: While there is extensive literature on microbiota alterations and CeD, lack of clarity remains regarding whether the changes observed in the microbiota of individuals with CeD are effects of the condition or if and how they play a role in its onset. Limited evidence points towards the utility of specific probiotic strains to reduce symptoms, decrease inflammation, and support gr.

### Practical insights into gluten-free diets [^114LLAVf]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Coeliac disease is a global disease, and the only currently available treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Although conceptually simple, the diet changes are substantial and have a profound effect on a patient's life. Untreated coeliac disease is associated with complications, including excess mortality, most of which can be avoided with a strict GFD. However, there are many barriers, including the availability, cost, and safety of gluten-free foods, as well as gluten cross-contamination. The GFD can be restrictive in social situations, leading to poor quality of life and, ultimately, nonadherence.

As the number of patients with coeliac disease increases worldwide, clinicians need to be aware of the challenges patients face. Heightened awareness by physicians, dietitians, and other providers can help maximize successful treatment, improve outcomes, and reduce health-care costs and disease burden. Routine follow-up is necessary to reinforce the need for a GFD, provide social and emotional support, and achieve mucosal healing, leading to a reduced risk of complications. Unfortunately, there is wide variation in follow-up practices.

The objective of this review is to increase awareness of the challenges, management, and follow-up of patients with coeliac disease. It aims to help them achieve GFD adherence and prevent complications while preserving their quality of life.

### Celiac disease: A comprehensive current review [^113FZBTv]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Celiac disease remains a challenging condition because of a steady increase in knowledge tackling its pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and possible therapeutic options.

- **Main body**: A major milestone in the history of celiac disease was the identification of tissue transglutaminase as the autoantigen, thereby confirming the autoimmune nature of this disorder. A genetic background (HLA-DQ2/DQ8 positivity and non-HLA genes) is a mandatory determinant of the disease's development, which occurs with the contribution of environmental factors (e.g. viral infections and dysbiosis of gut microbiota). Its prevalence in the general population is approximately 1%, with a female predominance. The disease can occur at any age and with a variety of symptoms and manifestations. This multifaceted clinical presentation leads to several phenotypes, including gastrointestinal, extraintestinal, subclinical, potential, seronegative, non-responsive, and refractory. Although small intestinal biopsy remains the diagnostic 'gold standard', highly sensitive and specific serological tests, such as tissue transglutaminase, endomysial, and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies, have become gradually more important in the diagnostic work-up of celiac disease. Currently, the only treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong, strict gluten-free diet, which leads to improvement in quality of life, ameliorating symptoms, and preventing the occurrence of refractory celiac disease, ulcerative jejunoileitis, and small intestinal adenocarcinoma and lymphoma.

### Advances in the treatment of coeliac disease: an immunopathogenic perspective [^116TbmPu]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Coeliac disease is a common and fairly well-characterized systemic disorder that mainly affects the small intestine but also has extraintestinal manifestations. The environmental trigger, gluten derived from wheat, rye, and barley, along with the genetic predisposition conferred by the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes, and many steps in the disease pathogenesis are known. This knowledge has enabled researchers to suggest novel alternative treatments or adjunctive therapies to the gluten-free diet, which is currently the only available and effective treatment for the condition. This review focuses on emerging and potential treatment strategies based on the concept of the disease pathophysiology. The search for novel future treatment modes, including nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches, is also outlined. The potential pitfalls associated with the various research avenues are also discussed.

### Immunopathogenesis and environmental triggers in coeliac disease [^116eAYHL]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

If at the time of writing the GFD proposed in the mid-1950s remains the only treatment for uncomplicated CD, mechanistic insight into CD pathogenesis has opened many new diagnosis and therapeutic avenues. The discovery that TG2 is the target of coeliac-specific autoantibodies has led to the development of highly specific diagnostic tests. The demonstration of its role in the activation of the antigluten response has provided the rationale to develop selective inhibitors, which show promising therapeutic results in a first clinical trial. In-depth characterization of the gluten-specific CD4+ T cell responses has allowed designing desensitization approaches and defining tools and methods to monitor related therapeutic trials. These tools are also promising to facilitate diagnosis in patients already on GFD, a frequent issue nowadays. The identification of somatic mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway as a putative driver of CD lymphomagenesis and of specific surface markers of the malignant cells highlights potential therapeutic targets. Accordingly, CD is attracting increasing interest from drug companies, providing hope that it will soon be possible to implement new strategies to alleviate or complete GFD in order to facilitate patients' daily life. Yet, it will be necessary to assess precisely the risks and benefits of each of these strategies, notably in uncomplicated CD, where GFD, despite its difficulties for the patients, remains a safe and relatively cheap treatment.

### A look into the future: Are we ready for an approved therapy in celiac disease [^113K4gPP]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

As it appears that we are currently at the cusp of an era in which drugs that are new, repurposed, or "supplements" will be introduced to the management of celiac disease, we need to reflect on whether the framework is set for celiac disease to be treated increasingly with pharmaceuticals as well as diet. This refers to reflecting on the rigor of diagnostic practices, the limitations of the standard of care, which is a gluten-free diet, and the lack of objective markers of disease severity. Investigating these issues will help us to identify gaps in technology and practices that could be critical for selecting patients with a well-defined need for an improved or alternative treatment.

Both aspects, circumscribed limitations of the gluten-free diet and diagnostics helping to define celiac disease target groups, together with the guiding requirements by the responsible regulatory authorities, will contribute to defining the subgroups of patients with confirmed celiac disease eligible for distinct pharmacologic strategies. Because many patients with celiac disease are diagnosed in childhood, these aspects need to be differentially discussed for the pediatric setting.

In this perspective, we aimed to describe these contextual issues and then looked ahead to the future. What might be the major challenges in celiac disease clinics in the coming years once drugs are an option alongside diet? And what will be the future objectives for researchers who further decipher the mucosal immunology of celiac disease? Speculating on the answers to these questions is as stimulating as it is necessary.

### Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review [^117YGJBu]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The assessment of ongoing signs and symptoms in CD indicates that the majority of patients exhibit a symptomatic and mucosal response to the GFD. However, some patients do not achieve complete control of symptoms or normalization of villous structure despite attempting adherence to the GFD. These patients have traditionally been referred to as having non-responsive CD. This terminology has caused confusion, as many manifestations are due to associated conditions rather than CD itself. In light of emerging tests for CD monitoring, such as GIPs, and novel therapies for active CD, an update to this classification (formerly non-responsive CD) is proposed.

When evaluating a patient with CD on a GFD who exhibits ongoing signs or symptoms, the initial step is to differentiate between ongoing active CD (OACD) and the presence of associated CD conditions (ACDCs). OACD can be identified in three scenarios:

- **Slow response**: Progressive improvement in symptoms and mucosal damage, but full remission does not occur for at least 1–2 years.
- **RCD (Refractory Celiac Disease)**: Ongoing severe enteropathy and malabsorptive symptoms persist after 6–12 months on a GFD.
- **Gluten exposure**: Despite adequate understanding of the GFD and attempted adherence, gluten avoidance is insufficient to result in symptomatic or histologic remission. This is the most frequent cause of OACD and can be due to very high sensitivity to low levels of gluten exposure or an inability to achieve the recommended gluten restriction.

Conversely, when patients with ongoing symptoms are faced with additional challenges, it requires a comprehensive approach to manage these persistent issues effectively.

### Coeliac disease and microbiota: Is it time for personalised biotics intervention? A scoping review [^115HPrkK]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, while there is extensive literature describing and investigating the microbiota and coeliac disease (CeD), the central issue remains the lack of clarity regarding whether the changes observed in the microbiota of individuals with CeD are effects of the condition or if and how they play a role in its onset. Only long-term longitudinal data which track at-risk individuals from birth through the development of CeD autoimmunity and into the full manifestation of the disease can clarify this. Gathering extensive data from a prospective longitudinal cohort with samples before and after disease development, such as the ongoing CD-GEMM cohort, may help accommodate individual differences, thereby enabling the identification of specific links between microbial makeup and disease onset, and perhaps offering therapeutic targets for preventing CeD.

As regards biotic intervention in patients diagnosed with CeD on a gluten-free diet (GFD), limited evidence points towards the utility of strains to reduce symptoms, decrease inflammation, support growth in children, and overall enhance recovery. However, small sample sizes of the conducted studies and few strains tested limit the generalizability of the findings. Given the individual differences in the intestinal microbiota, it is likely that personalised biotics that aim to balance alterations induced by genetics, personal environmental exposures (e.g. antibiotic exposure, diet, built environment), and other factors will be needed to truly target and intercept disease.

### A review of rifaximin and bacterial overgrowth in poorly responsive celiac disease [^114ZFDp2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

A proportion of patients with celiac disease have a poor response to a gluten-free diet, which may be due to small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Treatment with rifaximin is often used in the clinical setting, but there is limited literature to support this practice. In addition, challenges in the diagnosis of SIBO confound response interpretation. Our recent placebo-controlled trial did not demonstrate any improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment with rifaximin and casts doubt on the utility of lactulose-hydrogen breath testing for SIBO in this population.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1111vWMx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

This guideline presents an update to the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology Guideline on the diagnosis and management of celiac disease with updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with celiac disease (CD). CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g. tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have an excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD, often associated with a poor prognosis.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^116fXNHi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for celiac disease, particularly with respect to the management of refractory disease, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of pharmacotherapy in patients with refractory celiac disease. This is characterized by persistent or malabsorptive symptoms and signs with small-intestinal villous atrophy, despite adherence to a strict gluten-free diet for 12 months or more, and in the absence of other disorders, including overt lymphoma. Pharmacotherapy should be considered as an adjunct to a gluten-free diet.

### Early infections are associated with increased risk for celiac disease: An incident case-referent study [^114xfdDJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The microbiota interacts with genetic and environmental factors, such as infant feeding, through a complex immunological process. This process can result in the establishment of oral tolerance to gluten, or in failure to do so, resulting in celiac disease. Infections early in life, when the gut microbiota is developing, may lead to a different microbiota. This in turn can affect both intestinal immune responses and mucosal barrier function, thereby influencing the risk for celiac disease.

Additionally, antibiotic treatment affects the gut microbiota and could be considered a potential risk factor for celiac disease. It is speculated that the increase in celiac disease occurrence over the past decades may be related to the increased use of antibiotics during the same period. However, in our post hoc analysis of antibiotic treatment and celiac disease, we found no significant association. This could be due to a lack of data on the types of antibiotics used.

Similar to antibiotics and early infections, early vaccinations influence the immune system. We have previously shown that BCG vaccination is associated with a protective effect against celiac disease, although this finding should be interpreted with caution. Adjusting the association between early infections and celiac disease for BCG vaccination status did not alter the association (data not shown). Other vaccinations within the Swedish national program were not identified as risk factors.

With the beginning and end of the Swedish celiac disease epidemic, infant feeding practices changed. Since infant feeding affects the microbiota, these changes may have resulted in the inc… (truncated)

### Maternal and perinatal conditions and the risk of developing celiac disease during childhood [^114uHe4C]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Lately, gut microbiota has received much attention in relation to the development of immunological diseases, celiac disease (CD) included. Our living conditions have changed substantially, affecting diet, microbiota, and infection patterns, including antibiotic use. These changes influence our immune system and increase the risk of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Against this background, the well-known hygiene hypothesis was first suggested by Strachan in 1989. Several studies have been conducted in developed countries indicating an increase in CD, and Kondroshova et al. demonstrated that the hygiene hypothesis is applicable to CD development.

In line with the hygiene hypothesis, disturbed microbiota, or dysbiosis, has garnered increasing attention in CD research. In the present study, we found an increased risk of CD in boys born through elective caesarean section. Similar results have been shown previously but without sex-related differences. Studies on Crohn's disease have also identified elective caesarean delivery as a risk factor. Children born by elective caesarean delivery are not exposed to vaginal or fecal microbiota, in contrast to children born through emergency caesarean delivery after initiated labor and ruptured membranes, who are exposed to vaginal microbiota. We also found an increased CD risk to be associated with maternal infections during pregnancy, particularly repeated urinary tract infections. During pregnancy, antibiotics are used to treat urinary tract infections, which could affect the gut microbiota that is later transferred to the neonate.

### Celiac disease: Clinical update [^114JB63P]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

This review highlights the literature from the past year and explores the impact on the understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.

- **Recent findings**: In contrast to earlier clinical trials, recent data suggest that early gluten introduction may protect against the development of celiac disease. Celiac disease is underdiagnosed, associated with a high burden of disease, and linked to an excess mortality risk. However, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the utility of mass screening in asymptomatic individuals. The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, although the exact mechanism is undefined. Probiotics have been proposed as a disease-modifying option for celiac disease, but most studies assessing their efficacy are of low quality. Patients with celiac disease do not appear to be at an increased risk of contracting or developing adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Little is known about the pathogenesis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity; however, recent findings suggest an autoimmune basis for the condition.

- **Summary**: Understanding of celiac disease continues to advance, though significant knowledge gaps remain. Large, rigorous, prospectively designed studies are needed to further characterize celiac disease pathogenesis, management, and therapeutic options.

### Alterations in intestinal microbiota of children with celiac disease at the time of diagnosis and on a gluten-free diet [^115hiLsa]. Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

The role of Bifidobacterium in the underlying microbial origins of CD pathogenesis has received extensive attention within mechanistic research. Inoculation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with feces from active and asymptomatic CD patients increased tumor necrosis factor-α production and CD86 expression and decreased interleukin-10 cytokine production and CD4 expression compared with samples from HCs, but specific Bifidobacterium strains suppressed this helper T cell type 1 proinflammatory milieu, characteristic of CD. In a subsequent study of the same group, addition of Bifidobacterium strains changed the gliadin-derived peptide pattern and attenuated production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β and expression of NF-κB and chemokine CXCR3 receptor from Caco-2 cells exposed to gliadin digestions. These in vitro data were replicated in gliadin-induced enteropathy murine models sensitized with interferon-γ where Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 attenuated the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and the CD4 mediated immune response and increased the tissue messenger RNA levels of NF-κB and interleukin-10.

The exact mechanism by which bifidobacteria may exhibit immune-modulating properties is not yet clear, but it has been demonstrated that Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 produces a serine protease inhibitor that attenuates gliadin-induced immunopathology and impacts intestinal microbial composition in the NOD/DQ8 mouse model of gluten sensitivity. In one of the few clinical trials available, administration of Bifidobacterium infantis decreased Paneth cells.

This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled parallel group study. The patient recruitment was carried out between 2013 and 2015 at the Gastroenterology Units of University of Bari, Castellana Grotte (BA), Foggia and Taranto, by inviting volunteer adults (age 18 and above) with celiac disease (CD) who had been treated with a gluten-free diet (GFD) for two years or more, to participate in the study.

Inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (a) they complained of persistent IBS-type symptoms according to the ROME III criteria with no clinical evidence of other medical conditions to explain the symptoms, (b) were strictly adherent to a GFD, and (c) had their diagnosis confirmed by chart review, showing elevated serum tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin-A (tTG-IgA), in the presence of histologic evidence of villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia, and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes on a gluten-containing diet.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal, hematologic, hepatic, neurological or psychiatric disease; previous gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy and/or surgery; pregnancy or lactation; alcohol abuse or drug addiction; use of medications including corticosteroids or anti-inflammatory drugs, proton-pump inhibitors, antibiotic treatment, and participation in another clinical trial within six months before enrollment.

There seems to be a complex relationship between celiac disease (CD) and gut microbiota. A host of different factors influence the early colonization and development of gut flora within the context of CD. Multiple studies have noted variances in gut microbial abundances in response to several stimuli, including genetics, environmental triggers, and dietary gluten. Research regarding adjuvant therapy with a gluten-free diet is further required, but initial results are promising. We suggest further high-quality clinical studies, particularly in regard to probiotic therapy, in the treatment of this chronic condition.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^114p5PCw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the small intestine triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically predisposed individuals. The cornerstone of CeD management remains a strict adherence to a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), although such a dietary restriction can lead to an altered quality of life and may not be easy to follow, for many patients. These challenges have highlighted the need for alternative therapies. This review aims to explore the latest advancements in these therapeutic avenues, emphasizing mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles of drugs currently in advanced stages of clinical testing.

- **Recent findings**: Recent advances in the understanding of CeD pathophysiology have catalyzed the development of new therapeutic approaches, which include strategies to modify gluten processing in the gut, block gluten-triggered immune responses, or restore immune tolerance to gluten.

- **Summary**: While these therapies are not poised to take the place of GFD, they represent promising treatment alternatives that could enhance quality of life and minimize long-term consequences in CeD patients. Further research, as well as phase III clinical trials of those already conducted, are needed to establish the feasibility of integrating these novel drugs in the clinical management of CeD.

### Association between antibiotics in the first year of life and celiac disease [^116U3fuG]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

The intestinal microbiota is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease in addition to genetic variants and dietary gluten. The gut microbiota is strongly influenced by systemic antibiotics, especially in early life. We explored the association between exposure to a systemic antibiotic in the first year of life and the risk of diagnosed celiac disease.

- **Methods**: We performed an observational nationwide register-based cohort study. We included all children born in Denmark from 1995 through 2012 or Norway from 2004 through 2012. Children born in Denmark were followed until May 8, 2015 (age at end of follow-up was 2.3–20.3 years), and children born in Norway were followed until December 31, 2013 (age at end of follow-up was 1–10 years). We collected medical information from more than 1.7 million children, including 3,346 with a diagnosis of celiac disease. Exposure to systemic antibiotics was defined as a dispensed systemic antibiotic in the first year of life.

- **Results**: Exposure to systemic antibiotics in the first year of life was positively associated with diagnosed celiac disease in the Danish and Norwegian cohorts (pooled odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.16–1.36). We found a dose-dependent relation between an increasing number of dispensed antibiotics and the risk of celiac disease (pooled odds ratio for each additional dispensed antibiotic 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.05–1.11). No specific type of antibiotic or age period within the first year of life was prominent.

Celiac disease is a common gastrointestinal condition with an estimated global prevalence of up to 1%. Adequate long-term surveillance of patients is imperative to ensure strict adherence to treatment with a gluten-free diet and the ensuing clinical and histologic recovery. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by means of regular on-site attendance at specialist health care facilities, accompanied for most patients by follow-up endoscopic and laboratory tests. However, the rapidly increasing prevalence of celiac disease and the limited health care resources challenge the centralized and nonindividualized follow-up strategies.

The improved noninvasive surveillance tools and online health care services are further changing the landscape of celiac disease management. There is a clear need for more personalized and on-demand follow-up based on early treatment response and patient-related factors associated with long-term prognosis. Additional scientific evidence on the optimal implementation of follow-up for pediatric and adulthood celiac disease is nevertheless called for.

### Current and emerging therapies for coeliac disease [^117Ct44U]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Coeliac disease is a common enteropathy that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals in response to the ingestion of gluten proteins present in wheat, rye, and barley. Currently, the only available treatment for the condition is a strict, life-long gluten-free diet that, despite being safe and often effective, is associated with several challenges. Due to the high cost, particularly restrictive nature, and perception of decreased quality of life associated with the diet, some patients are continuously exposed to gluten, which prevents adequate disease control. Moreover, a subgroup of patients does not respond to the diet adequately, and healing of the small-bowel mucosa can be incomplete. Thus, there is a need for alternative treatment forms.

The increasingly understood pathogenetic process of coeliac disease has enabled the identification of various targets for future therapies. Multiple investigational therapies, ranging from tolerogenic to immunological approaches, are in the pipeline, and several drug candidates have entered phase II/III clinical trials. This review gives a broad overview of the different investigative treatment modalities for coeliac disease and summarizes the latest advances in this field.

### Coeliac disease and microbiota: Is it time for personalised biotics intervention? A scoping review [^1142zqbh]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). High credibility.

The prevalence of coeliac disease (CeD) has been observed to increase globally. This rising trend is common among various immune-mediated disorders and is potentially linked to environmentally driven disturbances in gut microbiota.

The objective of this review is to summarize recent evidence regarding the relationship between microbiota disturbances and the onset of CeD, emphasizing pathogenesis and possible biotic-based therapeutic interventions. A literature search was conducted on August 20, 2024, using Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus with keywords: celiac disease AND microbiota; celiac disease AND microbiome; celiac disease AND prebiotics; celiac disease AND probiotics; celiac disease AND symbiotics; celiac disease AND postbiotics.

A total of 1779 articles were retrieved from a blinded search by two authors. Of these, 1297 were duplicates. An additional 206 articles were excluded based on abstracts, as they were commentaries, letters, or case series. Ultimately, 276 articles were deemed appropriate for the review's scope, and following a thorough examination of the full texts, only 131 were considered valuable and included as references.

While extensive literature exists on microbiota alterations and CeD, ambiguity persists concerning whether the changes observed in individuals with CeD are consequences of the condition or if and how they contribute to its onset. Limited evidence suggests the potential utility of specific probiotic strains to reduce symptoms and decrease inflammation.

It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific guideline must be made by the physician in light of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient.

### Current status of celiac disease drug development [^114kfM84]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Celiac disease (CeD) is one of the most common immune-mediated diseases. Symptoms and disease activity are incompletely controlled by the gluten-free diet, which is currently the only available therapy. Although no therapies are yet approved, there is a growing field of candidates and an improving understanding of the regulatory pathway. In this review, we briefly discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment paradigm for CeD. We also review the major classes of therapies being considered for CeD and discuss extensively what is known and can be surmised regarding the regulatory pathway for approval of a CeD therapeutic.

The coming years will see an increasing number and diversity of potential therapies entering clinical trials and hopefully the first approved agents targeting this significant unmet medical need. Although biomarkers including histology and serology will always be important in therapeutic clinical trials, they currently lack the necessary evidence linking them to improved patient outcomes required for use as primary outcomes for drug approval. For this reason, patient-reported outcomes will likely be primary endpoints in Phase III CeD trials for the foreseeable future.

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Trials of antibiotic therapy in Crohn's disease have studied a wide range of antimicrobial agents. A meta-analysis demonstrated efficacy for these pooled trials over placebo (RR for continued disease activity 0.85 [95% CI 0.73 to 0.99], p = 0.03), but there was significant heterogeneity in the agents and dosing regimens used, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. The risk of adverse effects, particularly with prolonged or repeated courses, should be considered.

	- Rifaximin, a non-absorbed oral antibiotic in an extended-intestinal release formulation, has been shown in a large dose-ranging study to be effective at a higher dose than usually employed (800 mg BD). However, there was no dose-response, with numerical but not statistical difference to placebo for the 400 mg BD and 1200 mg BD doses. Rifaximin is unlicensed for this indication.

	- In a blinded randomized trial involving 73 patients with pediatric Crohn's disease, a regimen of azithromycin 75 mg/kg, 5 days per week for 4 weeks, followed by metronidazole 20 mg/kg/day for another 4 weeks, was compared with metronidazole only for 8 weeks. The study showed a remission rate of 66% for the azithromycin/metronidazole group and 39% for the metronidazole-only group (p = 0.025), although response rates were similar. In 12 patients failing metronidazole, 83% achieved remission on open-label azithromycin.

There is ongoing research interest in antibiotic therapy for Crohn's disease treatment. Presently, antibiotics should only be used in patients with disease complicated by infection, such as abscesses or bacterial overgrowth.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for celiac disease, specifically concerning a gluten-free diet after diagnosis, the ACG 2023 guidelines recommend advising the consumption of gluten-free oats in patients with celiac disease. It is essential to monitor for oat tolerance due to the potential for gluten contamination of oats, variability in toxicity among different oat varieties, and the small risk of an immune reaction to the oat protein avenin.

### Prevention measures and exploratory pharmacological treatments of celiac disease [^1135NGPY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Increasing prevalence, protean clinical manifestations, and lack of pharmacological therapy make celiac disease (CD) a complex and highly relevant illness in gastroenterology. This chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine is caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI manifestations. Awareness among physicians is growing due to accessible and highly accurate diagnostic and screening methods. Recent evidence suggests a possible rising incidence of CD.

Environmental factors such as early-life gluten exposure, intestinal infections, short duration of breast-feeding, and changes in intestinal microbiota have been proposed to have a role in CD pathogenesis. Thus, prevention approaches to diminish the rising prevalence of CD are currently being evaluated. Still, the cornerstone treatment of CD remains a strict gluten-free diet. This nutritional regime is demanding, and non-adherence is common because of social isolation, financial issues, or restriction of food diversity. Allowing patients to occasionally consume small amounts of gluten would greatly improve their quality of life.

Owing to recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of CD, different targets have been identified and have motivated the development of several experimental therapeutic strategies. The main goal of this review is to discuss the mechanisms that can be exploited therapeutically to prevent or delay CD, disease associations, and its complications.

### Acid suppression and antibiotics administered during infancy are associated with celiac disease [^113dvXSM]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

To investigate why certain at-risk individuals develop celiac disease (CD), we examined the association of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and antibiotic prescriptions in the first 6 months of life with an early childhood diagnosis of CD.

- **Study design**: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Military Healthcare System database. Children with a birth record from October 1, 2001, to September 30, 2013, were identified. Outpatient prescription records were queried for antibiotic, PPI, and H2RA prescriptions in the first 6 months of life. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of developing CD based on medication exposure. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes identified children with an outpatient visit for CD.

- **Results**: There were 968,524 children who met the inclusion criteria, with 1,704 cases of CD in this group. The median follow-up for the cohort was approximately 4.5 years. PPIs (HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.76–2.83), H2RAs (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.67–2.26), and antibiotics (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02–1.28) were all associated with an increased hazard of CD.

- **Conclusions**: There is an increased risk of developing CD if antibiotics, PPIs, and H2RAs are prescribed in the first 6 months of life. Our study highlights modifiable factors, such as medication stewardship, that may change the childhood risk of CD.

### Celiac disease: A clinical review [^1133y7Qs]. Abdominal Radiology (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on celiac disease:

- **Definition**: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated inflammatory enteropathy triggered by gluten exposure in genetically susceptible individuals.

- **Pathophysiology**: In patients with CD, the ingestion of gluten triggers an innate and adaptive immune response, leading to tissue inflammation and damage. Characteristically, deamidated gluten and the self-protein TG2 both become targets of highly disease-specific B-cell responses.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of CD is estimated at 500–1,000 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: CD may result in disease manifestations related to malabsorption (e.g. electrolyte imbalances, osteoporosis, infertility, neurological disorders), manifestations of extra-intestinal autoimmunity (e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis), or manifestations of neoplastic complications (e.g. increased risk of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and small bowel adenocarcinoma).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The majority of patients will respond to a lifelong gluten-free diet, which is the cornerstone of therapy.
