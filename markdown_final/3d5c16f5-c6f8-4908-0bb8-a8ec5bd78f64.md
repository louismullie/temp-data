## Question

Is diarrhea a side effect of amlodipine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diarrhea is a side effect of amlodipine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and expected adverse effect profile of amlodipine. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says for amlodipine monotherapy. Next, I will check combination products that include amlodipine to see if diarrhea appears there and whether it can be attributed to the partner drug. After that, I should review post-marketing data and any mechanistic plausibility. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented conclusion with counseling points and what to do if diarrhea occurs on therapy.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and typical adverse effects. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker whose most common adverse effects are dose-related peripheral edema, flushing, dizziness, palpitations, fatigue, and nausea; constipation is also described, whereas diarrhea is not a characteristic or expected effect of dihydropyridine CCBs, which generally slow gut motility rather than accelerate it [^114aVCZF] [^114jkPmc] [^1124KZzN].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA labeling for amlodipine monotherapy. Multiple FDA sources consistently list edema, dizziness, flushing, palpitations, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence as common adverse reactions, and they note constipation but do not list diarrhea as a common or dose-related adverse effect of amlodipine alone, which supports that diarrhea is not expected with amlodipine monotherapy [^114aVCZF] [^1117fnyV] [^1124KZzN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check combination products where diarrhea appears. In amlodipine/atorvastatin (Caduet), diarrhea is listed as a very common adverse reaction, but this aligns with atorvastatin's known gastrointestinal tolerability profile rather than amlodipine's, so the diarrhea signal there is attributable to the statin component rather than the CCB [^112kKXzA] [^111h6WYk].

> I need to check the olmesartan/amlodipine combinations next. Several FDA labels for olmesartan/amlodipine and triple therapy with HCTZ list diarrhea in post-marketing sections, but they explicitly attribute gastrointestinal adverse effects, including diarrhea and sprue-like enteropathy, to olmesartan rather than to amlodipine, reinforcing that the ARB is the culprit when diarrhea occurs in these combinations [^112RUdBb] [^113eeGw6] [^117JWYLW] [^116XbbM7].

> Let me consider mechanistic plausibility. Dihydropyridine CCBs like amlodipine primarily cause vasodilation and can produce edema, flushing, and reflex sympathetic effects; they do not typically increase intestinal motility, and in fact are more often associated with constipation than diarrhea, which makes a direct causal link between amlodipine and diarrhea biologically less plausible [^114jkPmc] [^1118vQn2].

> But wait, what if there are rare idiosyncratic reports. I should double-check post-marketing sections and large safety databases. Across FDA materials, when diarrhea is mentioned with amlodipine-containing products, it is either in the context of a combination partner (atorvastatin or olmesartan) or listed generically without a signal specific to amlodipine monotherapy, and no label highlights diarrhea as a characteristic amlodipine adverse effect, which supports that any association is weak, inconsistent, or confounded by co-medications [^114aVCZF] [^1133ryY1] [^115ubKpw].

> I will now examine the clinical implications and counseling. If a patient on amlodipine develops new diarrhea, I should confirm timing relative to dose changes, review all co-medications for more likely etiologies (especially statins, ARBs like olmesartan, ACE inhibitors, antibiotics, metformin, PPIs, SSRIs, and others), assess for infection or dietary causes, and only consider amlodipine as a rare, idiosyncratic cause after more plausible explanations are excluded; if diarrhea persists and no other cause is found, a cautious trial of discontinuation can be considered, but this scenario is uncommon [^115A2ae5] [^114aVCZF].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Diarrhea is not a recognized or common side effect of amlodipine monotherapy; when diarrhea appears in amlodipine-containing regimens, it is typically due to the co-prescribed agent (notably atorvastatin or olmesartan) or an unrelated cause, so clinicians should prioritize other etiologies before attributing causality to amlodipine [^114aVCZF] [^112kKXzA] [^112RUdBb].

---

Diarrhea is **not a common side effect** of amlodipine [^114aVCZF]. It is not listed among the most frequent adverse reactions in clinical trials or labeling [^1133ryY1], and when diarrhea occurs, it is usually mild and self-limited. Rare cases have been reported, particularly in combination products or postmarketing settings, but a causal link to amlodipine alone is uncertain [^112RUdBb]. If persistent or severe diarrhea occurs, evaluate for other causes and consider alternative medications.

---

## Clinical trial data on gastrointestinal side effects

Clinical trials show that amlodipine is **generally well tolerated**, with gastrointestinal side effects — such as nausea and abdominal pain — reported infrequently [^114aVCZF]. Diarrhea is **not among the most commonly reported gastrointestinal side effects** in these trials [^1133ryY1].

---

## Postmarketing surveillance and case reports

Postmarketing surveillance has occasionally reported diarrhea with amlodipine, but these cases are **rare and often confounded by concomitant medications or underlying conditions**. For example, diarrhea has been reported with combination products containing amlodipine and other agents, such as olmesartan or atorvastatin, where the causality is unclear and may be related to the co-administered drug rather than amlodipine itself [^112RUdBb] [^111h6WYk].

---

## Mechanistic considerations

Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, primarily affects vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation and reduced peripheral resistance. It has minimal direct effects on gastrointestinal motility, making diarrhea a **biologically unlikely direct consequence** of amlodipine's pharmacological action. In contrast, other calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, are more commonly associated with constipation due to their effects on gastrointestinal smooth muscle [^114jkPmc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert opinion

Current clinical guidelines and expert reviews consistently list peripheral edema, dizziness, flushing, and fatigue as the most common side effects of amlodipine, with **constipation** being occasionally mentioned. Diarrhea is **not highlighted as a significant adverse effect** in these guidelines [^114jkPmc] [^1118vQn2].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing gastrointestinal side effects

Several patient-specific factors may influence the likelihood of experiencing gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea, while taking amlodipine:

- **Age**: Older adults may be more susceptible to gastrointestinal side effects due to altered drug metabolism and increased sensitivity.

- **Comorbidities**: Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), may be more prone to experiencing diarrhea.

- **Concomitant medications**: Concurrent use of other medications, such as antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, or other antihypertensive agents, may increase the risk of diarrhea.

---

## Management strategies for diarrhea in patients taking amlodipine

If a patient experiences diarrhea while taking amlodipine, the following management strategies are recommended:

- **Evaluate for other causes**: Assess for potential alternative causes of diarrhea, such as dietary factors, infections, or concomitant medications.

- **Monitor symptoms**: Keep track of the frequency, severity, and duration of diarrhea symptoms.

- **Adjust dosage or switch medications**: If diarrhea persists and no other cause is identified, consider adjusting the dosage or switching to an alternative antihypertensive medication under medical supervision.

- **Hydration and supportive care**: Ensure adequate hydration and provide supportive care to manage symptoms.

---

## Comparison with other calcium channel blockers

Compared with other calcium channel blockers, amlodipine has a relatively favorable gastrointestinal side effect profile. For example, verapamil and diltiazem are more commonly associated with constipation, whereas amlodipine is **less likely to cause significant gastrointestinal motility disturbances** [^114jkPmc].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

In summary, diarrhea is **not a common side effect** of amlodipine [^114aVCZF]. While rare cases have been reported, they are typically mild and self-limited. Clinicians should consider other potential causes of diarrhea in patients taking amlodipine and manage symptoms accordingly. If diarrhea persists or becomes severe, evaluate for alternative causes and consider adjusting the medication regimen.

6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Amlodipine. The following post-marketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In post-marketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine.

Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine.

Olmesartan medoxomil. The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience:

Body as a Whole: asthenia, angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, peripheral edema

Gastrointestinal: vomiting, diarrhea, sprue-like enteropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hyperkalemia

Musculoskeletal: rhabdomyolysis

Urogenital System: acute renal failure, increased blood creatinine levels

Skin and Appendages: alopecia, pruritus, urticaria

Data from one controlled trial and an epidemiologic study have suggested that high-dose olmesartan may increase cardiovascular (CV) risk in diabetic patients, but the overall data are not conclusive. The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ROADMAP trial (Randomized Olmesartan And Diabetes MicroAlbuminuria Prevention trial, n = 4447) examined the use of olmesartan, 40 mg daily, vs. placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, normoalbuminuria, and at least one additional risk factor for CV disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, delayed onset of microalbuminuria, but olmesartan had no beneficial effect on decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There was a finding of increased CV mortality (adjudicated sudden cardiac death, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, revascularization death) in the olmesartan group compared to the placebo group (15 olmesartan vs. 3 placebo, HR 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4, 17), but the risk of non fatal myocardial infarction was lower with olmesartan (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35, 1.18).

### Amlobenz [^112nWmk3]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

The peripheral edema associated with amlodipine use is dose-dependent. When benazepril is added to a regimen of amlodipine, the incidence of edema is substantially reduced.

The addition of benazepril to a regimen of amlodipine should not be expected to provide additional antihypertensive effect in African-Americans. However, all patient groups benefit from the reduction in amlodipine-induced edema.

The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in these trials in more than 1% of patients treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride are shown in the table below. Cough was the only adverse event with at least possible relationship to treatment that was more common on amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride (3.3%) than on placebo (0.2%).

PERCENT INCIDENCE IN U.S. PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIALS

*Edema refers to all edema, such as dependent edema, angioedema, facial edema.

The incidence of edema was greater in patients treated with amlodipine monotherapy (5.1%) than in patients treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride (2.1%) or placebo (2.2%).

Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials of patients treated with amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride or in postmarketing experience were the following:

Body as a Whole: Asthenia and fatigue.

CNS: Insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, and decreased libido.

Dermatologic: Flushing, hot flashes, rash, skin nodule, and dermatitis.

Digestive: Dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and esophagitis.

Hematologic: Neutropenia

Metabolic and Nutritional: Hypokalemia.

Musculoskeletal: Back pain, musculoskeletal pain, cramps, and muscle cramps.

Respiratory: Pharyngitis.

Urogenital: Sexual problems such as impotence, and polyuria.

Monotherapies of benazepril and amlodipine have been evaluated for safety in clinical trials in over 6,000 and 11,000 patients, respectively. The observed adverse reactions to the monotherapies in these trials were similar to those seen in trials of amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride.

- are going to have surgery

- are getting allergy shots for bee stings

- go for kidney dialysis

What are the possible side effects of amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules?

Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules can cause serious side effects including:

- serious allergic reactions that can be life threatening.

Stop amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride capsules and get emergency help right away if you get:

- swelling of your face, eyelids, lips, tongue or throat

- have trouble swallowing

- asthma (wheezing) or other breathing problems

These allergic reactions are rare but happen more times in people who are African-American.

- low blood pressure (hypotension). Low blood pressure is most likely to happen if you also take water pills, are on a low salt diet, get dialysis treatments, have heart problems or get sick with vomiting or diarrhea. Lie down if you feel faint or dizzy.

- liver problems. Call your doctor if:

- you have nausea

- you feel more tired or weaker than usual

- you have itching

- your skin or eyes look yellow

- you have pain in your upper right stomach

- you have flu-like symptoms

- low white blood cells. Low white blood cells happen more in people who have kidney problems and collagen vascular diseases. Low white blood cells can give you a higher chance for getting infections. Call your doctor if you get a fever, sore throat, or other signs of infection that do not go away.

### Azilsartan medoxomil: a new angiotensin receptor blocker [^112ts1Wr]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Azilsartan medoxomil is an angiotensin receptor blocker, approved on February 25, 2011 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hypertension management.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety profile, and role of azilsartan for hypertension management.

Methods

Peer-reviewed clinical trials, review articles, and relevant treatment guidelines were identified from MEDLINE and Current Contents (both 1966 to August 31, 2011) using the search terms azilsartan, TAK-491, TAK-536, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacoeconomics, and cost-effectiveness. The FDA Web site and manufacturer prescribing information were also reviewed to identify other relevant information.

Results

Compared with olmesartan 40 mg daily, azilsartan 80 mg reduced mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) by an additional 2.1 mm Hg (P = 0.038), whereas azilsartan 40 mg was noninferior to olmesartan 40 mg. Azilsartan 40 mg or 80 mg added to chlorthalidone 25 mg daily significantly reduced SBP to a greater extent than did chlorthalidone alone (P < 0.05), but there was no difference between azilsartan 40 mg and 80 mg (40 mg: -31.72 mm Hg; 80 mg: -31.3 mm Hg [P > 0.05]). When coadministered with amlodipine 5 mg daily, both azilsartan 40 mg and 80 mg + amlodipine decreased SBP significantly more than amlodipine alone (amlodipine: -13.6 mm Hg; with azilsartan 40 mg: -24.79 mm Hg; with azilsartan 80 mg: -24.51 mm Hg [P < 0.05]). Compared with ramipril 10 mg daily, both azilsartan 40 mg and 80 mg resulted in significantly (P < 0.001) greater reductions in mean SBP (-20.63 and -21.24 mm Hg, respectively; ramipril: -12.22 mm Hg). The most common adverse events reported were dizziness (4%), dyslipidemia (3.3%), and diarrhea (2%).

Conclusions

At the recommended dose of 80 mg once daily, azilsartan is reported to be an efficacious BP-lowering agent. With once-daily dosing and a favorable side-effect profile, azilsartan is an attractive option for the treatment of hypertension. There is a lack of data supporting the use of azilsartan for improvement in cardiovascular outcomes; therefore, azilsartan is not approved for indications other than the treatment of hypertension.

5.2 Increased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction

Rarely, patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, have developed documented increased frequency, duration or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated.

5.3 Hypotension

Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride can cause symptomatic hypotension. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting.

In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, start amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride therapy under close medical supervision; follow closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of the benazepril component is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased.

Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

If hypotension occurs, place the patient in a supine position, and if necessary, treat with intravenous infusion of physiologic saline. Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.

5.4 Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality

Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

Drugs that act on the renin angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when used in pregnancy. In several dozen published cases, ACE inhibitor use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Medical therapies to improve left Ventricular outflow obstruction and Diastolic function in hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy [^112aahed]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Findings from these small studies established the basis of current guideline recommendations (Dybro's study is not included). All studies demonstrated significant variability in LVOT gradient reduction, limited symptom improvement, and a significant proportion of nonresponders. Data from these studies underscore the need for larger randomized trials and alternatively, more effective pharmaceutical options, especially for nonresponders. Side effects and their unknown direct effects on the underlying pathogenesis or disease trajectory pose additional problems for the use of this medication class in oHCM.

Calcium-channel blockers

CCBs can be categorized into dihydropyridine CCB, which exert a predominant effect on vasomotor tone (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine), and nondihydropyridine CCB (eg, verapamil, diltiazem), which predominantly affect intracellular myocyte calcium, exerting a negative inotropic effect, as well as atrioventricular conduction slowing. While the effects of the latter group appear to be comparable to BBs, they do differ in their mechanism, their effect on peripheral afterload, and other smooth muscle cells (eg, gastrointestinal tract) (Figure 2). These differences raise concern for a potential deleterious effect on LVOT obstruction (from vasodilation) and their side effect profile (constipation).

### Spectrum of drug-induced chronic diarrhea [^115A2ae5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The evaluation of a patient with chronic diarrhea can be quite frustrating, as it is expensive and involves multiple diagnostic studies. Moreover, identification of a drug as a cause of chronic diarrhea is a challenge in patients taking multiple medications. The disease may either be associated with intestinal mucosal changes, mimicking diseases such as celiac disease, or purely functional, with no histopathologic change. Drug-induced diarrhea may or may not be associated with malabsorption of nutrients, and a clinical improvement may occur within days of discontinuation of the drug, or may take longer when associated with mucosal injury. Diarrhea in diabetics, often attributed to poor management and lack of control, may be due to oral hypoglycaemic agents. Chemotherapy can result in diffuse or segmental colitis, whereas olmesartan and a few other medications infrequently induce a disease that mimics celiac disease, but is not associated with gluten intolerance. In short, increased awareness of a drug, as a cause for diarrhea and a clear understanding of the clinical manifestations will help clinicians to solve this challenging problem. This article aims to review drug-induced diarrhea to (a) understand known pathophysiological mechanisms; (b) assess the risk associated with frequently prescribed medications, and discuss the pathogenesis; and

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N = 1,730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N = 1,250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in about 1.5% of patients and was not different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of adverse reactions that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows:

Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1.0% in placebo-controlled clinical trials included the following:

For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table:

Side effect profile

The most commonly reported adverse effect hindering compliance with amlodipine is peripheral oedema. However, this adverse effect can be minimised if the agent is given at bedtime, and lower doses (2.5 or 5 mg/day) are used. Indeed, the bedtime administration of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system was associated with a 93% reduction in oedema compared with morning dosing (1% vs 13%, p < 0.001, respectively). Other reported side effects include dizziness, fatigue, headache, palpitations and nausea, although these are generally not bothersome enough to cause discontinuation of the drug. Amlodipine is contraindicated in breastfeeding women, cardiogenic shock and unstable angina. Also, its vasodilatory effect can lead to decreased cardiac output in the setting of aortic stenosis.

### Gastrointestinal side effects of prescription medications in the older adult [^113JsxhF]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms resulting from either prescription medications or over-the-counter drugs are frequently encountered in geriatric practice but often mistaken for symptoms of an organic disease leading to multiple diagnostic studies. The morbidity, mortality, and medical costs associated with drug toxicity, even when restricted to the GI tract, are probably underestimated. The consequences of drug toxicity are quite variable and range from a symptom of mild discomfort (eg, drug-induced diarrhea) at one end of the spectrum, to fatal GI hemorrhage or perforation. Better awareness of the possibility of drug-induced GI tract pathology by primary care physicians improves the recognition of these adverse effects, and ultimately, improves patient care. This review focuses on the most common and well-described drug-related side effects of the GI tract.

### Thiazides in the management of hypertension in older adults-a systematic review [^114TsnW7]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Adverse events

Two trials reported on serious adverse events (SAE) using thiazides compared to placebo. In the HYVET trial, serious adverse events occurred significantly less often in the indapamide treatment group than in the placebo group, and only five SAEs were judged to be related to study medication (3 in the placebo group, 2 in the indapamide group). A RCT that compared the combination of perindopril/indapamide to placebo reported that two SAEs possibly related to study medication occurred in each group.

The SHEP trial reported that the prevalence of intolerable symptoms was higher in the chlorthalidone group compared to placebo, and the EWPHE trial found three symptoms significantly more common in patients on hydrochlorothiazide compared to placebo (dry mouth, nasal stuffiness and diarrhea) but none to the opposite. The EWPHE trial also reported that significantly more treated patients stopped the study medication because of side effects or concomitant disease compared to those taking placebo. Likewise, in the MRC-O trial withdrawals due to major side effects were considerably higher in the diuretic group than in the placebo group, partly due to increased gout, but also to significantly greater incidence of impaired glucose tolerance, skin disorders, muscle cramp, nausea and dizziness.

Less evidence was available for comparing rates of adverse events on thiazides to other antihypertensive drugs. In the SHELL study, chlorthalidone was compared to lacidipine: fatigue occurred significantly more often in the chlorthalidone group, but edema (mainly pretibial), headaches and skin rashes significantly more often in the calcium channel blocker group. Other side effects were similar in both groups. In the MRC-O trial, withdrawals due to major side effects were less frequent in the thiazide group than in the β-blocker group, although gout and muscle cramp were more common. In the SHEP trial cases of new-onset diabetes did not differ between chlorthalidone and placebo groups at years one and three. Finally, the ACCOMPLISH trial found no increased risk of SAE associated with benazepril/HCT treatment compared to benazepril/amlodipine across the main study population with a mean age of 68 years.

Long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCB) — dosing and cautions include: DHP CCBs usual doses are Amlodipine 2.5–10 mg daily, Felodipine 2.5–10 mg daily, and Nifedipine sustained release 30–120 mg daily; Non-DHP CCBs usual doses are Verapamil sustained release 120–480 mg divided daily-bid and Diltiazem sustained release 120–540 mg daily. Monitor AEs (DHP CCBs may cause ankle edema, dizziness, flushing, headache, constipation), and use with caution in patients with hepatic (CCBs) or kidney (non-DHP CCBs) dysfunction. Non-DHP CCBs may be considered for rate control in supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation/flutter. Verapamil may cause constipation; verapamil is contraindicated 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, severe LV dysfunction. Diltiazem may decrease sinus rate; diltiazem is contraindicated in 2nd or 3rd degree AV block; use with caution in LV dysfunction. Verapamil or diltiazem should not usually be used with a beta-blocker due to risk of severe bradycardia or heart block.

### Phase II trial of VEGFR2 inhibitor apatinib for metastatic sarcoma: focus on efficacy and safety [^115Kbgdj]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The most commonly reported AEs of targeted antiangiogenesis agents include HFS, HTN, proteinuria, rash, diarrhea, hyperbilirubinemia, rash/desquamation, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The most frequently observed AEs associated with apatinib were HFS, proteinuria, and HTN, which are similar to those reported in a phase I study of apatinib in patients with metastatic gastric cancer and in retrospective studies in sarcoma patients. There were no grade 4 AEs in the present study, although 14.06% of patients suffered from grade 3 AEs, mainly HTN, HFS, proteinuria, fatigue, pain, and dysgeusia. The frequencies of these AEs in the present study were similar to other data for sarcomas. HTN could be well controlled by angiotensin receptor blockers with or without calcium antagonists (such as amlodipine), in addition to dose interruption or reduction. Hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, were mild to moderate, and no dose interruption or reduction was needed during the current treatment. These results indicated that apatinib is well tolerated, although HTN, HFS, and proteinuria should be monitored.

The side effects of apatinib are manageable, in addition to which patients with HTN, proteinuria, or HFS had significantly longer OS than patients without any of these AEs, similar to the results for gastric cancers. Although the presence of these AEs did not correlate with clinical response signatures such as ORR and DCR, these results provide the first evidence for a prognostic value of these manageable toxicities in patients with sarcomas. However, the reasons for this association remain unknown. As an orally administered, small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, apatinib has potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities, and has been shown to inhibit VEGFR2 and regulate PD-L1 expression, apoptosis, autophagy, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition. However, the true mechanisms of apatinib in sarcoma treatment and the long-term effect of this treatment remain unclear. We therefore suggest that apatinib might alter the tumor microenvironment, thus affecting AEs and OS. However, further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between OS and the severity of side effects.

Case 2

A 44-year old female patient presented in December 2014 with abdominal pain. CT showed a tumor of the right kidney, 7 cm in size. The medical history was otherwise unremarkable with no concurrent medication. The tumor was radically removed in January 2015. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated pT1a clear-cell RCC. Two solitary lung metastases were diagnosed in October 2016 and resected with curative intent in November 2016. Histological examination confirmed well differentiated clear cell carcinoma. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed new multiple lung lesions in September 2017. Laboratory examinations showed no abnormality, and the patient had a good prognosis score according to IMDC. The treatment with sunitinib was initiated in September 2017 at the standard dose of 50 mg OD for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off treatment (schedule 4/2). The laboratory parameters of liver function were normal at baseline. During the first cycle of therapy the patient was suffering from grade 2 hypertension, grade 2 dyspepsia and grade 2 hypothyreodism. The patient continued with the therapy and the tolerance of the therapy gradually improved while hypertension, dyspepsia and hypothyreodism were controlled by medications including oral metoclopramide, perindopril with amlodipine and levothyroxine. Apart from mild complications such as grade 1–2 diarrhea for a short period of time during the course therapy and grade 1 hand-foot syndrome, the patient tolerated sunitinib therapy at full dose quite well achieving partial response on CT according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). In February 2020, the patient had acute bronchitis that was initially treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ambroxol with no improvement. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was replaced by clarithromycin by a physician in the emergency unit which the patient visited for worsening of the cough (Fig. 2). Ten days later, the patient visited the emergency unit again for abdominal pain and asthenia. The lab test showed grade 4 ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, while other laboratory tests were within normal range (Fig. 2). The patient received hepatoprotective medications including silymarin and essential phospholipids (Fig. 2) and was sent home to have the lab tests checked by the general practitioner. Four days later, the patients was admitted to the hospital for acute liver failure with hyperbilirubinaemia (˃ 7xULN), grade 4 ALT (˃ 40xULN) and AST (˃ 180xULN) elevation, coagulopathy and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The patient was transferred to intensive care unit (Fig. 2). Alternate causes of acute liver injury including CMV, hepatitis A, B, C, E and autoimmune hepatitis were excluded. All medications including sunitinib were interrupted upon the admission to the hospital. The patient continued with hepatoprotective medications. Liver transplantation was considered contraindicated because of active malignancy. The overall clinical status along with LTs abnormalities and other parameters gradually worsened and the patient died three days later on March 16, 2020 with clinical and laboratory signs of liver necrosis (Fig. 2). The autopsy was not performed.

### Benazepril plus amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension in high-risk patients [^117YLP9J]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

The study ACCOMPLISH was published by Jamerson K and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the trial question was: is benazepril plus amlodipine superior to benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in patients with hypertension who are at high-risk for cardiovascular events? In the ACCOMPLISH study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the population was: 11506 patients (4543 female, 6963 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events. The key exclusion criteria were acute coronary syndromes, or coronary revascularizations within 1 month of the first visit; stroke or other ischemic cerebrovascular episodes within 3 months preceding study evaluation; or hypertension that is excessively severe, known to be refractory to treatment, or known to have a secondary cause. In the ACCOMPLISH study, the interventions were: n = 5744 benazepril-amlodipine (20 mg benazepril and 5 mg amlodipine) n = 5762 benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide (20 mg benazepril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes, at a mean follow-up of 36 months (9.6% vs. 11.8%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.9). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke (5% vs. 6.3%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.92) Significant decrease in cardiovascular events (8.6% vs. 10.3%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.93). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in dry cough (20.5% vs. 21.2%) and hyperkalemia (0.6% vs. 0.6%). significant differences in peripheral edema (31.2% vs. 13.4%), dizziness (20.7% vs. 25.4%), and hypotension (2.5% vs. 3.6%). In the ACCOMPLISH study, the conclusion was: in patients with hypertension who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, benazepril-amlodipine was superior to benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide with respect to the rate of cardiovascular events and death from cardiovascular causes, at a mean follow-up of 36 months.

### Life threatening hyperkalaemia with diarrhoea during ACE inhibition [^117HBbkg]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A 67 year old woman developed acute renal failure with serum potassium 9.4 mmol/l requiring emergency dialysis after seven days of diarrhoea while taking an ACE inhibitor for vascular disease. Review of the literature, the British National Formulary, and the patient information leaflets for each of the 11 ACE inhibitors currently marketed in the UK suggests that this potentially life threatening complication of ACE inhibition is not yet widely recognised.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea [^112jdNyy]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Certainty of evidence and grading — the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for RCTs and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Evidence from RCTs starts at high certainty, and evidence derived from observational studies starts at low certainty; for each outcome, the evidence is graded as high, moderate, low, or very low. The evidence can be rated down for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, and can be rated up for large magnitude of effect or dose–response relationship. Judgments about the certainty of evidence were determined via consensus and an overall judgment of certainty of evidence was made for each PICO.

### Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride [^115wmH4e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The peripheral edema associated with amlodipine use is dose-dependent. When benazepril is added to a regimen of amlodipine, the incidence of edema is substantially reduced.

The addition of benazepril to a regimen of amlodipine should not be expected to provide additional antihypertensive effect in African-Americans. However, all patient groups benefit from the reduction in amlodipine-induced edema.

The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in these trials in more than 1% of patients treated with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride are shown in the table below. Cough was the only adverse event with at least possible relationship to treatment that was more common on amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride (3.3%) than on placebo (0.2%).

The incidence of edema was greater in patients treated with amlodipine monotherapy (5.1%) than in patients treated with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride (2.1%) or placebo (2.2%).

Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials of patients treated with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride or in postmarketing experience were the following:

Body as a Whole: Asthenia and fatigue.

CNS: Insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, and decreased libido.

Dermatologic: Flushing, hot flashes, rash, skin nodule, and dermatitis.

Digestive: Dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and esophagitis.

Hematologic: Neutropenia.

Musculoskeletal: cramps, and muscle cramps.

Urogenital: Sexual problems, such as impotence, and polyuria.

Monotherapies of benazepril and amlodipine have been evaluated for safety in clinical trials in over 6,000 and 11,000 patients, respectively. The observed adverse reactions to the monotherapies in these trials were similar to those seen in trials of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride.

### Persistence of the antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine and nifedipine GITS after two' missed doses': a randomised, double-blind comparative trial in Asian patients [^116kCPYr]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Suboptimal management of hypertension is often a result of poor patient compliance in the form of missed doses of their antihypertensive medication. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial was designed to compare the persistence of the antihypertensive efficacy of the amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) after two 'missed doses', and also to compare the drugs' overall efficacy and safety in Asian patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Following a 2-week placebo run-in period, 222 patients were randomised to receive either amlodipine (5 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 10 mg daily, n = 109) or nifedipine GITS (30 mg daily, increased after 6 weeks if necessary to 60 mg daily; n = 113) for 12 weeks. A placebo was then substituted for further 2 days with continuous ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The increases in the last 9 h of mean ambulatory BP on day 2 after treatment withdrawal were significantly less with amlodipine than with nifedipine GITS: 4.4 ± 7.0 vs 11.2 ± 11.3 mmHg for systolic BP (P ≤ 0.0001) and 2.4 ± 6.3 vs 6.0 ± 6.0 mmHg for diastolic BP (P ≤ 0.0002). Significant differences between the two drugs in mean 24-h ambulatory BP levels were already evident on day 1 after withdrawal, even though there were no significant differences on the final day of treatment. No differences in safety parameters were observed, and neither drug caused any serious or severe treatment-related adverse events. In conclusion, amlodipine provides greater protection than nifedipine GITS against loss of BP control following missed doses.

### Hypertension in cancer patients and survivors: epidemiology, diagnosis, and management [^114DH6YD]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

In individuals at high risk of volume depletion who also have proteinuria, it may be preferable to defer renin-angiotensin system–blocking drugs or, in those with transient risk of volume loss, recommend a sick-day protocol to temporarily withhold these medications on days in which they have symptoms. Correspondingly, diuretic and mineralocorticoid antagonist therapies are often added, or titrated, later in the cascade of antihypertensive therapy in patients on undergoing active cancer treatment, because these patients are at higher risk for volume depletion through reduced intake of nutrients and fluids, as well as increased volume losses from diarrhea or vomiting, predisposing them to electrolyte abnormalities and acute kidney injury. If there is no further individual-level contraindication, diuretic therapy (specifically thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics) should be considered first-line therapy in patients undergoing active surveillance and in cancer survivors. Similarly, if there is no contraindication, mineralocorticoid antagonist therapy should be used in individuals with resistant hypertension, with close monitoring for hyperkalemia.

Depending on the half-life and frequency of chemotherapy administration, some individuals may not be able to be treated with a fixed dose of antihypertensive medication. These individuals may particularly benefit from frequent home blood pressure monitoring (see the preceding section Approach to out-of-office blood pressure monitoring), including instructions on antihypertensive medication–holding parameters and appropriate supplemental dosing of antihypertensive medications for fluctuations in blood pressures related to chemotherapy administration and side effects.

Consideration of medication interactions, interfering substances, and polypharmacy

Currently, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem are avoided because they use cytochrome p450 3A4, a feature shared by many chemotherapy agents, risking potentiation of chemotherapy toxicity by inhibiting chemotherapy drug metabolism.

In some individuals undergoing active cancer treatment, the blood pressure cannot be controlled even with multiple antihypertensive agents. In this case, it is reasonable to discuss with the oncologist and the patient a trial of chemotherapy dose reduction, or a chemotherapeutic holiday period. It is also reasonable to consider dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of other therapeutic agents that may be contributing to high blood pressures, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and high-dose corticosteroids.

Polypharmacy is common in cancer patients. In individuals who require > 1 agent to achieve adequate blood pressure control, it is reasonable to use fixed-dose combinations of first-line agents to minimize pill burden and optimize adherence.

Figure 2
Incidence of Constipation per 100 Person-Years in Patients Starting Acute and Preventive Migraine Treatments

The incidence of any or serious constipation was generally at least two-fold higher in patients with migraine beginning treatment with various acute and preventive medications than in all patients with migraine. Data derived from MarketScan® Research Databases; figure reproduced with permission from Amgen. e60

A summary of GI AEs with drugs prescribed for migraine prevention is shown in Table 2. Among the antiepilepsy drugs, only topiramate and divalproex sodium are currently indicated for migraine prophylaxis, and divalproex sodium is more commonly associated than topiramate with a range of GI AEs, including constipation. The reported AE profiles are not from patients with migraine because antiepilepsy drugs are used off-label. Drug-related associations between GI comorbidities and migraine are seen across drug classes. e61, e62 Off-label use of drugs is common in the prevention of migraine; for example, antidepressants such as amitriptyline show good evidence of benefit. e63 In the European label for amitriptyline, GI disorders including constipation, dry mouth, and nausea are noted as being very common (> 1/10 treated patients). e64 Of note, low-dose amitriptyline has been used extensively off-label as a treatment for certain functional GI disorders, such as IBS. e65 The antidepressant nortriptyline is also associated with constipation. e66 In a prospective trial of 75 patients with migraine treated with topiramate, amitriptyline, or a combination of both drugs, constipation was reported in 45.5% of those in the amitriptyline group; fewer AEs were seen in the topiramate and combination groups, and no GI AEs were noted. e62 The antihypertensive therapies candesartan and lisinopril also show good evidence of benefit in migraine; e63 the European label for lisinopril cites diarrhea and vomiting as common AEs (from ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 treated patients). e67 Other medications such as the calcium channel blocker verapamil are used off-label for migraine prevention and are associated with constipation, e66 and GI AEs are reported with β-blockers used for migraine prophylaxis, although they seem to be more frequent with atenolol (constipation and GI disturbances) and metoprolol (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and nausea) and less common with nadolol and propranolol (Table 2).

Results

Study Evaluation

Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of the selection process to determine eligible studies. A total of 1345 studies were searched using the aforementioned retrieval methods, and 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were ultimately screened. In total, 4894 patients were included, consisting of 3084 patients in the medication group and 1810 patients in the placebo group. The characteristics of the 24 included studies are outlined in Table 1. All data included in the meta‐analysis were from randomized placebo‐controlled clinical trials, and the participants, clinicians, and assessors were blinded. All but 1 trial (ASSET‐1) 26 had low risk of attrition bias. On this basis, we considered the quality of the evidence to be high. A summary of the risks of bias in the included studies is shown in Figure 2.

Safety Analysis

All adverse events in the 24 trials were collected, and their absolute and relative frequencies in the treatment groups and the placebo groups were analyzed. The following adverse events were included for comparative analysis of tolerability and safety: blood and lymphatic system disorders (thrombocytopenia and anemia), cardiovascular disorders (cardiac failure, hypotension, and palpitation), gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, and nausea), general disorders (peripheral edema, chest pain, fatigue, cough, and flushing), hepatobiliary disorders (abnormal liver function), infections (sinusitis, nasopharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, infected skin ulcer, pneumonia, and bronchitis), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (pain in extremity, back pain, leg pain, myalgia, and arthralgia), nervous system disorders (headache, dizziness, and syncope), and respiratory disorders (dyspnea, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure). RRs with their corresponding 95% CIs are presented in Table 2, and heterogeneity analysis was carried out for each of the 34 adverse events selected. The most significant results of the data from meta‐analyses are discussed next.

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Amlodipine and valsartan) [^115FxvjK]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with or without food.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another angiotensin II receptor blocker) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan tablets should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on amlodipine and valsartan tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is amlodipine and valsartan tablets 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

### Side effect prediction based on drug-induced gene expression profiles and random forest with iterative feature selection [^115Vh3f5]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

One in every ten drug candidates fail in clinical trials mainly due to efficacy and safety related issues, despite in-depth preclinical testing. Even some of the approved drugs such as chemotherapeutics are notorious for their side effects that are burdensome on patients. In order to pave the way for new therapeutics with more tolerable side effects, the mechanisms underlying side effects need to be fully elucidated. In this work, we addressed the common side effects of chemotherapeutics, namely alopecia, diarrhea and edema. A strategy based on Random Forest algorithm unveiled an expression signature involving 40 genes that predicted these side effects with an accuracy of 89%. We further characterized the resulting signature and its association with the side effects using functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts in drug development for early identification of side effects to use the resources more effectively.

### Pharmacological management of diarrhea [^116hnCGW]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 2 billion annual cases of diarrhea worldwide. Diarrhea is the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years and kills 1.5 million children each year. It is especially prevalent in the developing world, where mortality is related to dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and the resultant acidosis, and in 2001, it accounted for 1.78 million deaths (3.7% of total deaths) in low- and middle-income countries. However, diarrhea is also a common problem in the developed world, with 211 million to 375 million episodes of infectious diarrheal illnesses in the United States annually, resulting in 73 million physician consultations, 1.8 million hospitalizations, and 3100 deaths. Furthermore, 4% to 5% of the Western population suffers from chronic diarrhea. Given the high prevalence of diarrhea, research has been directed at learning more about the cellular mechanisms underlying diarrheal illnesses in order to develop new medications directed at novel cellular targets. These cellular mechanisms and targets are discussed in this article.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive adverse effects and clinical considerations for older adults: Some of the adverse effects associated with antihypertensive medications include (but are not limited to) the following — thiazide-type diuretics: electrolyte disturbances, gastrointestinal discomfort, rashes and other allergic reactions, sexual dysfunction in men, photosensitivity reactions, and orthostatic hypotension; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs): cough and hyperkalemia; angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs): dizziness, cough, and hyperkalemia; calcium-channel blockers: dizziness, headache, edema, and constipation; and β-blockers: fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Accurate measurement of BP is important before initiating treatment for hypertension, some patients may have elevated BP in clinical settings, and ambulatory measurement may be appropriate; clinicians should consider treatment with nonpharmacologic options, including weight loss, dietary changes, and an increase in physical activity, initially or concurrently with pharmacologic treatment; clinicians should consider treatment burden and drug interactions when deciding on treatment options; when selecting pharmacologic therapy, clinicians should prescribe generic drugs where available; and evidence for adults who are frail or with low overall risk without multimorbidity is limited.

### Persistence of antihypertensive efficacy after missed doses: comparison of amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system [^112sAjn8]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, the antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine and nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) was compared following missed doses. Design and methods In a randomized crossover design, 42 patients were randomized to receive amlodipine (5–10 mg) or the GITS formulation of nifedipine (nifedipine GITS) (30–60 mg) once daily for 12 weeks, then vice versa. During weeks 8, 10 and 12 of each treatment period, compliance failures were simulated by patients missing 0, 1 or 2 doses of their medication, and ambulatory systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements were obtained.

Results

Following steady-state treatment (i.e. 'perfect compliance'), there was no difference between amlodipine and nifedipine GITS in SBP (140.1 versus 134.2 mmHg) or DBP (84.0 versus 85.8 mmHg) at 0–24 h post-dose. When compliance was not perfect, i.e. when one or two doses were missed, DBP was maintained at a significantly lower level with amlodipine compared with nifedipine GITS at 24–48 h post-dose (83.1 versus 86.4 mmHg, P = 0.005) and at 48–72 h post-dose (84.2 versus 89.7 mmHg, P < 0.001). Plasma concentrations of amlodipine were better maintained than those of nifedipine GITS. At 72 h post-dose, the plasma concentration of amlodipine was 61% (17.0 ± 11.2 ng/ml) compared with < 25% (28.3 ± 49.9 ng/ml) for nifedipine GITS.

Conclusion

During short periods of non-compliance, antihypertensive efficacy remains more predictable with amlodipine than with nifedipine GITS.

### Apremilast [^112jgNi9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity reactions, including cases of angioedema and anaphylaxis, have been reported during post marketing surveillance. Avoid the use of apremilast in patients with known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulation. If signs or symptoms of serious hypersensitivity reactions develop during treatment, discontinue apremilast and institute appropriate therapy.

5.2 Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting

There have been reports of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting associated with the use of apremilast. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases, patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting. Patients who reduced dosage or discontinued apremilast generally improved quickly. Consider apremilast dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.

### Prevention and management of adverse events related to regorafenib [^112FhSXE]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension

In clinical practice, hypertension is common among patients receiving regorafenib, but, when treated appropriately, the effect on quality of life is negligible. Hypertension with regorafenib is not cumulative. In our experience, regorafenib, like other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, can instead be seen as a toxicity intensifier — it may interfere with the recovery of previous cardiovascular damage, while any direct effect on cardiovascular function appears to be reversible. Regorafenib-associated hypertension is therefore temporary, and, once regorafenib is discontinued, blood pressure is likely to decrease to levels that are normal for each individual patient.

Before initiation of regorafenib treatment, blood pressure should be checked and controlled if it is found to be elevated. Blood pressure should then be monitored weekly for the first two cycles of treatment, and, if detected, hypertension should be treated. If possible, patients should measure their blood pressure at home on a daily basis — this helps to identify patients whose blood pressure is high when visiting the hospital because they are nervous, rather than because they have persistent hypertension. Table 1 describes, according to CTCAE version 4.03, five grades of hypertension based on the levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Blood pressures exceeding 140/90 mmHg (grade 2 hypertension) are very common and can be treated with antihypertensive treatment such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Blood pressures of grade 3 and higher are less common but do occur, and, if they are not controlled by ACE inhibitors, beta blockers can be added as an adjunctive therapy. If hypertension remains a problem, calcium channel blockers can be added to the ACE inhibitors and beta blockers; because of the risk of diarrhea, the use of diuretics is discouraged. Recommendations for the management of treatment-emergent hypertension, as specified in the regorafenib clinical trial protocols, are shown in Table 3.

### Racecadotril for acute diarrhoea in children [^116uANQC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors (YL and LZ) independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, which addresses six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias (Higgins 2011). We categorized the judgements as low, high or unclear risk of bias, and documented reasons for each judgement. We resolved disagreements by discussion or consulting methodologists from the Chinese Cochrane Center. We created plots of risk of bias assessment in Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) (Review Manager 5). We contacted authors of included trials for additional information if needed for risk of bias assessment.

Measures of treatment effect

We used risk ratio for dichotomous data and mean difference (standardized mean difference if the outcome was reported on different scales) for continuous data, presenting with 95% confidence intervals.

Dealing with missing data

We attempted to contact the trial authors when data were insufficient or missing. We noted proportions of participants for whom we could obtain no outcome data, and reported them in a 'Risk of bias' table. We dealt with missing data at individual study and outcome level. We checked the number of children lost to follow‐up and the reasons for missing data in each group. If, in accordance with the guidance in Guyatt 2011b, the proportion was less than 20% and meanwhile the reasons and numbers of missing were balanced in the two groups, we graded the risk of attrition bias as low; otherwise, we graded it as high. We performed sensitivity analyses based on participants originally assigned to two groups or reported results from intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses in the original clinical trials if no meta‐analysis was conducted.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We judged clinical heterogeneity based on our knowledge at patient, intervention, control and outcome level. We used the I² statistic to check statistical heterogeneity, considering an I² value of 50% or greater to denote significant heterogeneity. We used a fixed‐effect model to synthesize data when heterogeneity was not significant (I² < 50%) and a random‐effects model when heterogeneity was significant (I² ≥ 50%).

Assessment of reporting biases

We planned to examine publication bias using a funnel plot, and to use a regression approach to assess funnel plot asymmetry if more than nine trials reported the same outcome (Egger 1997). However the number of included trials failed to meet the requirements, so we did not conduct analysis of reporting bias.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^115hbdw4]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical indications, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

Amlodipine is a long-acting, lipophilic, third generation dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs that exerts its action through inhibition of calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells and myocardial cells, which results in decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of high blood pressure (BP)/HTN and angina. In addition, a number of randomised trials have ascertained its utility in angina pectoris. Amlodipine is usually dosed on a once daily basis because of its long half-life, which is favourable for patient compliance. A starting dose of 5 mg is usually recommended with a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. In the elderly population and those with hepatic failure, a starting dose of 2.5 mg is recommended. Amlodipine has a gradual onset of action and hence no significant reflex neuroendocrine activation. Activating reflex mechanisms, such as increased PVR and elevated heart rate, can cause negative effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These notable adverse effects are commonly seen with other agents including the first generation β-blockers (BBs; such as atenolol and metoprolol) and earlier generation of DHPs. Amlodipine has a high bioavailability, ranging from 60% to 80%; it undergoes hepatic metabolism and shows some impaired elimination in the setting of liver cirrhosis but no accumulation with renal failure. Amlodipine also has a slow rate of elimination over 40–60 hours. If amlodipine is discontinued, BP generally returns to baseline over 1 week without any dangerous rebound elevations in BP (unlike clonidine).

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: living with uncertainty [^114DZ7zt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Nifedipine is also available in a short/immediate‐acting capsule and a prolonged‐acting tablet that is usually prescribed 2 to 3 times daily. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and the shorter acting preparations are more likely to be associated with more rapid acute decreases in BP and reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, causing increases in heart rate and headaches, especially when used at higher doses (> 60 mg/d). 15, 16 Moreover, abrupt decreases in BP associated with nifedipine capsules are potentially more problematic for placental perfusion. 17 Dose‐related maternal adverse effects attributable to nifedipine such as headache, tachycardia, hypotension flushing, and nausea have been well documented, 15 although no comparative data exist for amlodipine in pregnancy. Amlodipine, which has a gradual onset of action, 16 is less likely to be associated with vasodilator symptoms and thus may be associated with better compliance and possibly smoother 24‐hour BP control compared with twice‐daily nifedipine tablets. 18 However, if the extended‐release preparation of nifedipine is used, the differences may not be significant in terms of 24‐hour BP control or side effects. 19 The slow onset of amlodipine also implies that antihypertensive effects are delayed (≈8 hours). 16 Limited information suggests that both nifedipine and amlodipine get into breast milk but are unlikely to be associated with adverse fetal effects. 20 Additional questions, not addressed by most studies, assess the impact of drug safety for different maternal diagnoses (eg, preeclampsia versus chronic hypertension) and pregnancy‐related changes in drug pharmacokinetics.

We are left with a situation in which some uncertainty remains regarding important safety issues when prescribing most antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy, despite documentation of use in hundreds of thousands of women. These drugs are not major teratogens, but more subtle and long‐term adverse consequences cannot be ruled out by available studies. The practitioner must carefully consider the risks versus the benefits of antihypertensive use in pregnancy, and clinical trials are needed to compare treatment of hypertension in pregnancy with and without antihypertensive drugs. The CHAP (Chronic Hypertension Associated With Pregnancy) study addresses this question and is nearing completion. In the meantime, although not the last word, Mito and colleagues 7 have contributed to our comfort with respect to amlodipine, but at present there is little reason to preferentially prescribe it over nifedipine XL in pregnant women. The uncertainties surrounding therapeutic interventions in pregnancy are a fact of life and one that is not likely to be easily resolved.

Search methods for identification of studies

We attempted to find all relevant trials regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress).

Electronic searches

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library issue 3, March 2019); MEDLINE (via OVID, 1966 to 4 March 2019); Embase (via OVID, 1980 to 4 March 2019); and LILACS (1982 to 4 March 2019), using the search terms detailed in. We also searched Clinicaltrials.gov and the search portal of the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), to identify ongoing or unpublished trials, using "diarrh", "racecadotril" and "child" as search terms. All the search work was up to 4 March 2019.

Searching other resources

We reviewed the citations of existing reviews and clinical trials obtained by the above methods. We also contacted individual researchers and pharmaceutical companies for data of unpublished trials.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two review authors (YL and LZ) independently screened the titles and abstracts of all studies identified by the search strategy and obtained the full articles for all potentially relevant trials. We independently assessed the full text using an eligibility form based on the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements by discussion until consensus was achieved. We scrutinized each of the articles to ensure that each trial was included only once. We documented the reasons for excluding trials in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. We constructed a PRISMA diagram to illustrate the study selection process.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (YL and LZ) independently extracted the data using a pre‐designed data collection form. The extracted items included: 1) authors; 2) year of publication; 3) the country where the trial was conducted; 4) number of participants randomized into each group; 5) inclusion and exclusion criteria; 6) interventions in both groups; 7) dose and duration of racecadotril; 8) outcomes; 9) source of funding. For each treatment arm, we extracted the number of participants randomized to each group and the number of analysed participants for each outcome. For dichotomous outcomes, we extracted the number of participants experiencing the event in each group of the trial; for continuous data, we extracted means and standard deviations (median and interquartile for skewed data). Studies that were published in languages other than English were translated with the help of Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.

### Comparison of efficacy and side effects of combination therapy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (benazepril) with calcium antagonist (either nifedipine or amlodipine) versus high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy for systemic hypertension [^115wHB9B]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

The present 2 multicenter studies were designed to evaluate whether patients with essential hypertension derived equal benefits from use of combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor as from doubling the dose of the calcium antagonist. After a 2-week washout and a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a total of 1,390 patients were treated with either nifedipine 30 mg (study 1) or amlodipine 5 mg (study 2) once daily for 4 weeks. The 1,079 patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained between 95 and 115 mm Hg were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/ benazepril 20 mg, nifedipine 30 mg or nifedipine 60 mg (study 1), and amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or amlodipine 10 mg (study 2). Both doses of the calcium antagonist/ACE inhibitor combination therapy lowered diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and significantly better than the lower dose of calcium antagonist monotherapy (with either nifedipine or amlodipine). However, 15% of patients in the nifedipine high-dose monotherapy group and 24% in the amlodipine high-dose monotherapy group presented with some form of edema. In contrast, the incidence of edema was similar for patients treated with both combination therapy and low-dose calcium antagonists. Thus, combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor provides blood pressure control equal to that of high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy but with significantly fewer dose-dependent adverse experiences such as vasodilatory edema.

Adverse events

Twenty-one (67.7%) studies reported any side effects of medication given. In most studies, this was not systematic, with only one study adhering to the CONSORT guidelines. Patients taking methyldopa experienced the highest level of side effects (77% of patients) although this was based on one study. Of the major antihypertensive drug classes, fewest side effects were seen with beta-blockers (8%), although total patient numbers were smaller.

Table 2 displays the percentage of common side effects and serious adverse events noted for each drug class. Given reporting was often ad hoc, we avoided attributing 'zero' incidence to adverse effects not seen or calculating risk ratios. The main differences between classes were a greater occurrence of angioedema (1%) and cough (6%) with ACEi versus headache (4%) and ankle swelling (3%) with CCB. A total number of serious adverse events were small, but BBs were associated with more cardiac events than other classes. There were only two reported incidences of acute kidney injury, both occurring with ACE inhibitors. Of the three deaths which occurred across two studies, only one death due to cerebral haemorrhage whilst taking placebo therapy was clearly related to the trial arm (Table 2).

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^116vvNYK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2	DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets

Dosage of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and hyperlipidemia. Select doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin independently.

Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of amlodipine and atorvastatin or a dose of amlodipine and atorvastatin with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect.

Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina.

Important Dosage Information

Take amlod ipine and atorvastatin tablets orally once daily at any time of the day, with or without food.

Amlodipine

The usual initial antihypertensive oral dosage of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.

Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy with candesartan cilexetil and amlodipine besilate compared with candesartan cilexetil monotherapy and amlodipine besilate monotherapy in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension: a multicenter, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study [^112LBqpK]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Blood pressure is reported to be insufficiently controlled in > 50% of patients with hypertension. Guidelines for the management of hypertension recommend using drugs with different mechanisms of action when > 1 agent is needed to achieve the blood pressure target. The combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker and a calcium channel blocker is recommended as the preferred antihypertensive medication combination, and candesartan cilexetil (CC) and amlodipine besilate (AML) are commonly used in Japan.

Objective

The objective of our study was to determine if the combination of CC 8 mg and AML 5 mg has a greater blood pressure-lowering effect than monotherapy with either component, and if the combination of CC 4 mg and AML 2.5 mg has a greater blood pressure-lowering effect than placebo.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. After receiving placebo during a 4-week run-in period in a single-blind manner, patients were randomized to receive the combination of CC 4 or 8 mg with AML 2.5 or 5 mg, CC 8 mg monotherapy, AML 5 mg monotherapy, or placebo once daily in the fasting or fed state for 12 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in trough diastolic blood pressure, and the secondary end point was change from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure at the end of treatment. Tolerability was assessed based on adverse events, vital signs, and physical findings.

Results

Of 548 patients who received placebo during the run-in period, 444 were randomized to receive CC 8 mg/AML 5 mg (CC/AML 8/5 mg) (n = 101), 8/2.5 mg (n = 36), 4/5 mg (n = 36), 4/2.5 mg (n = 35), CC 8 mg (n = 100), AML 5 mg (n = 100), or placebo (n = 36). These 444 patients included 272 men and 172 women. The mean (SD) age was 56.9 (10.7) years and the mean baseline BP was 153.4/95.7 mm Hg. The antihypertensive effect in the CC/AML 8/5 mg group (-27.4/-16.3 mm Hg) was significantly higher than in the CC 8 mg group (-13.9/-7.8 mm Hg) or the AML 5 mg group (-19.9/-11.2 mm Hg) in terms of reduction in the seated trough diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure (both P < 0.0001). The incidence and severity of adverse events in the CC/AML combination groups did not differ significantly from those in the monotherapy and placebo groups.

Conclusions

In Japanese adult patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension, CC/AML 8/5 mg combination therapy was more effective in lowering blood pressure than CC 8 mg or AML 5 mg monotherapy. These combinations were also well tolerated. Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center registration number: Japic CTI-101054.

### Quantifying side effects and caregiver burdens of pediatric pulmonary hypertension therapies [^112avG9L]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this study was to estimate the side effect profiles of the most commonly prescribed PH therapies among children and to better understand the burden on families to access care for children living with PH. Our findings indicate that several treatment combinations are employed to mitigate symptoms of PH in children, resulting in a wide range of side effects experienced by children. Over half of children living with PH were using at least 3 medications to manage their PH, thus the need for understanding treatment side effects in this population is significant. We used previously published data to compare reported side effects among medication classes. When comparing treprostinil (Remodulin) use in children to adults, we found children to report more side effects than adults for infusion site pain (95.3% vs. 85%), diarrhea (34.9% vs. 25%), rash (37.2% vs. 14%), flushing of the skin (72.1% vs. 11%) and swelling/edema (62.7% vs. 9%). For selexipag (Uptravi), the side effects reported by children in our study were lower than those reported among adults for headache (46.1% vs. 65%), diarrhea (38.5% vs. 42%), and similar for nausea (38.5% vs. 33%), yet much higher for joint/muscle pain (46.1% vs. 17%) and flushing of the skin (50.0% vs. 12%) (see Table 5). Importantly, these side effect comparisons juxtapose combination therapy use in our study to studies conducted in clinical settings, which may partially explain the differences observed as combination therapies have been associated with increased side effects. These reported differences in side effects among children and adults living with PH highlight important considerations for physicians as they prescribe these medications in an attempt to balance the management of disease symptoms and quality of life experiences.

### Amlodipine besylate and benazepril hydrochloride (Lotrel) [^111piWB4]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Lotrel has been evaluated for safety in over 2,991 patients with hypertension; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 400 were treated for more than 1 year.

In a pooled analysis of 5 placebo-controlled trials involving Lotrel doses up to 5/20, the reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 4% of patients treated with Lotrel and in 3% of patients treated with placebo.

The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Lotrel in these studies were cough and edema (including angioedema).

The peripheral edema associated with amlodipine use is dose-dependent. When benazepril is added to a regimen of amlodipine, the incidence of edema is substantially reduced.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Amlodipine and Atorvastatin

Amlodipine and atorvastatin has been evaluated for safety in 1,092 patients in double-blind placebo-controlled studies treated for co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. In general, treatment with amlodipine and atorvastatin was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse reactions have been mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials with amlodipine and atorvastatin, no adverse reactions peculiar to this combination have been observed. Adverse reactions are similar in terms of nature, severity, and frequency to those reported previously with amlodipine and atorvastatin.

The following information is based on the clinical experience with amlodipine and atorvastatin.

Amlodipine

Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N = 1,730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N = 1,250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are dizziness and edema. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a doserelated manner are as follows:

Antihypertensive drug classes in CKD — diuretics and adverse effects: Thiazide diuretics lose efficacy in diuresis and BP lowering as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) worsens, but several, including chlorthalidone, metolazone, and indapamide appear to remain effective at GFRs < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2; loop diuretics are often effective at lower GFRs (i.e., < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and when combined with a loop diuretic, thiazides are particularly effective in inducing diuresis, but they often lead to hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The most common side effects in CKD include hyperkalemia and AKI with ACEi or ARBs, edema with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), constipation and bradyarrhythmias with non-dihydropyridine CCBs used with beta-blockers, cough with ACEi, fatigue with beta-blockers, somnolence or dry mouth with central alpha-agonists, rebound hypertension if clonidine is stopped without taper, dizziness with alpha-blockers, hyperkalemia with MRA, headache with hydralazine, and edema and hirsutism with minoxidil.

### An unusual presentation of ACE inhibitor-induced visceral angioedema [^114xwRjZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

ACE inhibitors (ACEi) are common anti-hypertensive drugs that can cause angioedema. Though classic, or facial angioedema is rare, visceral angioedema is even less common. When angioedema occurs, it typically presents early, within 30 days of initiating therapy. Visceral angioedema most commonly presents with nausea, emesis, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, and thus is often mistaken for an episode of gastroenteritis. When a CT scan is obtained, it typically shows characteristic findings, including ascetic fluid, mild mesenteric oedema and thickening of the small bowel. In this case report, we present a patient who did not experience her first episode of visceral angioedema until after she had been on ACEi therapy for 5-7years. In addition, she experienced recurrent episodes of visceral angioedema that were separated by approximately 4years at a time. Both of these features make for a particularly unique presentation.

### Emerging data on calcium-channel blockers: the COHORT study [^116kFozu]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have demonstrated dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB) therapy to be appropriate for the treatment of hypertension, as is reflected in treatment guidelines such as the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in the United States and the 1999 World Health Organization-International Society of Hypertension report. As with any drug class, successful treatment with CCBs depends on good patient compliance, which often hinges on drug tolerability. The differing characteristics among the various generations of CCBs may contribute to some compounds demonstrating superior tolerability. To test this hypothesis, the COHORT trial (named for the large group of participants) was undertaken in 828 elderly hypertensive patients aged ≥ 60 years. This trial investigated the possible differences in patient tolerability between the third-generation agent amlodipine and the latest-generation agents lercanidipine and lacidipine. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage of patients reporting edema, the most common side effect associated with CCB therapy. The study results indicated that while all three treatments were similarly efficacious in lowering blood pressure, lercanidipine and lacidipine were much better tolerated than amlodipine whether they were used as single agents or as initial therapy combined with other antihypertensive drugs. These newest-generation dihydropyridine CCBs offer the potential to reduce side effects, improve patient compliance, and ultimately help patients reach target blood pressures as recommended by the aforementioned guidelines.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: rational pragmatic approaches to management [^1157LWRS]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

5 GENETIC TESTING: DOES IT HAVE UTILITY?

If one has used genetic testing and it reveals that the patient has the CACNA1C allele allowing too much intracellular calcium influx, one might consider the addition of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nimodipine (which may be effective in ultra‐rapid and ultradian cyclers). When lithium and nimodipine are used in combination, there are tentative signals that they may be more effective than either drug alone. The empirical data for the efficacy of nimodipine or isradipine do not meet the usual standards of being based on multiple RCTs or large numbers of patients; trials of the calcium channel blocker verapamil have been negative and hoped for rationale of seeing more efficacy of nimodipine in those with the CACNA1C allele (which is a dihydropyridine subunit of the voltage gated calcium channel) than in those without this allele has not yet been specifically tested. However, nimodipine can work in nongeneotyped patients when other agents do not and it has an excellent safety profile. Placebo controlled on‐off‐on‐off designs have demonstrated efficacy in some lithium refractory ultra‐rapid and ultradian cyclers. It may preliminarily be considered a lithium‐like mood stabilizer without lithium's common side effects of tremor, weight gain, or GI distress in those individuals who have failed the usual options. Thus nimodipine can be used as an adjunct to try to obtain more maximal effects of lithium when dose increases are limited by side effects or in instances of only partial responsiveness to lithium and other agents has been obtained.

New data on knockout animals of ANK3 are striking in animals that show increases in both manic‐like and depressive‐like behavior in response to defeat stress and these alterations respond to lithium and valproate. Whether the deficits in sodium channels involved in the ANK3 can be used as a predictor of clinical response or a target of new therapy remains for further study.

Another actionable genetic finding would be evidence of a deficiency in methyl‐tetrahydroreductase (MTHFR) which would indicate the need for augmentation with l‐methylfolate rather than folic acid itself. Whether the presence of the short form of the serotonin transporter increases the risk for switching into mania on antidepressants remains to be further documented, as do many other promising genetic findings. While delineating vulnerability to bipolar disorder with genetic markers would appear to be a long way off, linking them to prediction of treatment response would be more promising for enhancing immediate clinical utility.

### HIV prevention and treatment information from four artificial intelligence platforms: a thematic analysis [^111LSV7z]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

Medication side effects. Across queries there were many commonly referenced side effects. The side effects most referenced across each platform were those related to organ or bone conditions, such as kidney and liver side effects or bone loss. Although these side effects were frequently mentioned across platforms, they were noted as rare side effects that usually affected those with other underlying or co-morbid health conditions. Gastrointestinal issues were also highly referenced across platforms; common medication side effects cited were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other common side effects were related to central nervous system symptoms such as dizziness and headaches. Less commonly noted side effects included fatigue and related symptoms (e.g. insomnia, drowsiness). The least referenced side effect across platforms was lactic acidosis.

The presentation of responses for side effects occurred in a multitude of ways that differed by individual query and platform. Responses across platforms stated the side effects in a bulleted list format, a descriptive paragraph, or a single statement with no additional context, all within the same week. The responses also differed with regards to the presentation of severe side effects, especially those that could be potentially fatal. Google Bard and ChatGPT 3.5 were more likely to describe medication side effects that might cause organ damage, whereas ChatGPT 4.0 would describe the symptoms and presentation of the organ-related side effects. The HIV.gov Chatbot provided the least amount of content and briefest descriptions of medication side effects, with a particular focus on gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^114ramc6]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Role in combination therapy for HTN

While thus far amlodipine has shown to be non-inferior to many other anti-HTN therapies, the focus on HTN treatment seems to be shifting more towards combination therapy. Less than 50% of patients with stage I or II HTN are adequately controlled with monotherapy, and thus initial treatment for HTN in the majority of patients will require two agents. The classical approach to treating HTN where one first-line agent is maximised before another is added may be flawed since this is a multifactorial disease often occurring with a number of comorbidities. Many studies show that individuals with more CV risk factors generally need more anti-HTN agents to successfully manage their BP. Combination therapy using different mechanisms can lead to more effective BP lowering. In addition, combination therapies block counter-regulatory mechanisms that often limit the efficacy of monotherapy. Furthermore, using multiple agents to lower doses may reduce side effects, and thus improve patient compliance.

The issue arises as to which fixed combinations provide the most benefits. Thiazides in combination with ACEIs or ARBs have synergistic BP-lowering activity, whereas thiazides and BBs have deleterious effects on the metabolic profile. CCBs are powerful vasodilators but can result in renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, thus an ACEI or ARB counteracts this mechanism and leads to enhanced antihypertensive effect. Growing evidence from trial data also shows that CCBs with ACEIs or ARBs may provide the best long-term outcomes.

The ACCOMPLISH trial was a randomised, controlled trial in which 11 506 patients with HTN with high risk for adverse CV events were assigned amlodipine+benazepril versus HCTZ+benazepril. The primary end point was the composite of CV death or major adverse CV events. The amlodipine+benazepril combination was superior to the HCTZ+benazepril for lowering CV death and adverse events (figure 1).

Background

Current hypertension guidelines recommend combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker with a calcium-channel blocker (CCB) or a thiazide diuretic as initial antihypertensive therapy in patients with monotherapy uncontrolled hypertension. These combinations have been believed to be pharmacologically most appropriate because they are probably additive in the blood pressure lowering effect and counter-regulative in some of the side effects. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers combat the vascular and cardiac effects of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system by reducing and inhibiting angiotensin II. CCBs dilate arterials and reduce peripheral resistance. Diuretics reduce volume by increasing urinary excretion of sodium and water. These drugs reduce blood pressure via different mechanisms and may also induce various adverse reactions, such as dry cough with ACE inhibitors, ankle edema with CCBs, and hypokalemia with thiazide diuretics. There is some evidence that CCBs might reduce the incidence of dry cough induced by ACE inhibitors, and ACE inhibitors might reduce the incidence rate of ankle edema. The combination of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers with thiazide diuretics might also help in the maintenance of potassium homeostasis and reduce the risk of hyper- or hypokalemia.

Although both combinations are pharmacologically appropriate and recommended as preferred therapy by several hypertension guidelines, these two combinations can still be clinically different, especially when several major demographic and clinical characteristics of patients are taken into account. Indeed, in a recently published randomized controlled trial in patients enrolled from several African countries, combination antihypertensive therapy that contained a CCB, either with an ACE inhibitor or a diuretic, was significantly more efficacious in lowering blood pressure than a combination of an ACE inhibitor with a thiazide diuretic. The recently published International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2020 guidelines recommend the preferred use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers with CCBs in the management of hypertension on the basis of the results of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcome Trial (ASCOT) and the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial. The latter trial compared the ACE inhibitor benazepril with the CCB amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide combination and demonstrated that the benazepril and amlodipine combination was superior to the benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide combination in the prevention of cardiovascular events.
