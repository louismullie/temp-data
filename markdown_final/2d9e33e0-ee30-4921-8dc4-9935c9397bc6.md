nsaid and olmesartan use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks and management of using NSAIDs and olmesartan together. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms that create the interaction. Then, I should quantify the clinical risks, especially AKI and hyperkalemia, and identify who is highest risk. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and guideline positions. After that, I should outline a practical risk stratification and monitoring plan. Finally, I will consider alternatives, special scenarios, and a concise decision framework, making sure I verify each claim against labels and high-quality studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis of the interaction, because if I get the mechanism wrong, the downstream recommendations will be shaky. Olmesartan, an ARB, dilates the efferent arteriole and lowers intraglomerular pressure, which can reduce GFR, especially when renal perfusion is dependent on angiotensin II–mediated efferent tone, while NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and cause afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction; together, they can precipitate hemodynamic AKI in susceptible patients, and NSAIDs can also blunt the antihypertensive effect of olmesartan, which I should keep in mind for BP control [^113U2Uhm] [^111P5F3e] [^116spAVi].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and timing of AKI risk so I don't overstate it. Large nested case-control data show that the combination of diuretic plus ACEi/ARB plus NSAID ("triple therapy") increases AKI risk by about 31% overall, with the highest risk in the first 30 days of concurrent use (rate ratio around 1.82), and NSAIDs with longer half-lives may carry a greater risk; importantly, double therapy (ARB plus NSAID without a diuretic) did not show a significant overall increase, though risk still rises in high-risk subgroups, so I need to be precise about context when counseling patients [^115MdCGW] [^11186D9z] [^116WL4Ss].

> I should confirm who is highest risk so I can tailor counseling and monitoring. The elderly, those with CKD or eGFR < 60 mL/min, patients with heart failure or cirrhosis, individuals on diuretics or otherwise volume depleted, and those with diabetes are at increased risk of NSAID-induced AKI when combined with RAAS blockade; geriatric labeling for NSAIDs also highlights heightened renal risk with concomitant ACEi/ARB use, reinforcing the need for caution and close monitoring in these populations [^112FzdNJ] [^117GPxdW] [^111NimAT] [^113c171i].

> Hold on, I should verify the hyperkalemia signal because it's easy to conflate RAAS effects with NSAID effects. ARBs reduce aldosterone and can raise potassium, and NSAIDs can further impair renin-angiotensin-aldosterone physiology and reduce renal potassium excretion. Labels for potassium products advise monitoring for hyperkalemia when combined with RAAS inhibitors or NSAIDs, which supports the plausibility of an additive risk, particularly in CKD or when other potassium-raising drugs are present [^112YZed9] [^112ZcAFx] [^112ejEHq].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence and guideline positions to ensure my recommendations align with best practice. Multiple FDA labels consistently warn about NSAID–ARB coadministration risks and recommend periodic renal function monitoring, while KDIGO advises assessing creatinine and potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiating or up-titrating RAAS inhibitors. VA/DoD CKD guidance emphasizes increased AKI risk with NSAIDs in the setting of RAAS blockade and diuretics and supports more frequent eGFR monitoring when NSAIDs are used, especially if prolonged or high-dose [^116spAVi] [^117QJepm] [^11366CiG].

> Let me think about a practical risk stratification and monitoring plan, and I should double-check that it's feasible in routine care. For low-risk patients (young, eGFR ≥ 60, no heart failure, euvolemic, no diabetes), short-term NSAID use with olmesartan can proceed with counseling and baseline labs, but I should still recheck creatinine and potassium about 1–2 weeks after starting the NSAID; for high-risk patients, I should obtain baseline creatinine/eGFR and potassium, counsel on hydration, prefer the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest duration, and recheck labs within 3–7 days of initiation, then again at 2–4 weeks if therapy continues; if creatinine rises more than 30% from baseline or potassium exceeds about 5.5 mmol/L, I should reassess and often discontinue the NSAID or adjust RAAS therapy as clinically appropriate [^117QJepm] [^11366CiG] [^116spAVi].

> But wait, what if the patient truly needs ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy beyond a few days? I need to ensure I offer safer alternatives. Acetaminophen is generally preferred for analgesia when NSAID risk is high, topical NSAIDs can reduce systemic exposure, and for some chronic pain syndromes, non-NSAID options (e.g., tramadol, duloxetine, or gabapentinoids) may be reasonable depending on comorbidities; if an NSAID is unavoidable, I should favor shorter half-life agents at the lowest dose with strict time limits and explicit lab follow-up, and I should document shared decision-making about risks and alternatives [^111XtF2K] [^111NimAT] [^116mPu3s].

> I should consider special scenarios carefully. In CKD, guidelines advise avoiding NSAIDs when possible and, if used, employing the lowest dose for the shortest time with closer lab monitoring. In heart failure, adding an ARB to ACEi therapy has been associated with worse renal outcomes in some trials, so layering an NSAID on top compounds risk and should generally be avoided. In diabetes with albuminuria, RAAS blockade is indicated, but NSAIDs should still be avoided when feasible. And in older adults, the threshold for avoiding NSAIDs with ARBs should be low given elevated baseline risk and frequent polypharmacy [^11366CiG] [^116sFjxF] [^115TWhKX] [^117GPxdW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "double therapy" (ARB plus NSAID) carried a clearly increased AKI risk similar to triple therapy, but I should correct that. The best population data show no significant overall increase with double therapy, though clinically meaningful risk can still emerge in high-risk patients or with longer NSAID half-lives, so I should not falsely reassure patients in those subgroups and must individualize decisions and monitoring accordingly [^115MdCGW] [^11186D9z].

> Let me synthesize a concise decision framework and make sure it aligns with the evidence. If an NSAID is not essential, avoid it with olmesartan; if it is essential, stratify risk, correct volume status, choose the lowest dose for the shortest duration, and monitor creatinine/eGFR and potassium within 3–7 days in high-risk patients and 1–2 weeks in lower-risk patients; stop the NSAID if creatinine rises more than 30% or if potassium is elevated, and consider alternatives for chronic pain; document counseling and shared decision-making throughout [^116spAVi] [^117QJepm] [^11366CiG].

> Finally, I should confirm key counseling points to reduce preventable harm. Patients should maintain adequate hydration, avoid NSAID use during acute illness with volume depletion, and promptly report reduced urine output, weight gain, edema, weakness, or palpitations. Clinicians should proactively ask about OTC NSAID use at every visit because patients often omit these when listing medications, and this simple step can avert iatrogenic AKI in those on RAAS blockade [^11366CiG] [^112FzdNJ].

Concurrent use of NSAIDs and olmesartan increases the risk of **acute kidney injury** [^111694Lk], **hyperkalemia** [^116spAVi], and **reduced antihypertensive efficacy** [^115MdCGW]. The risk is highest in older adults, patients with CKD, heart failure, or volume depletion, and when NSAIDs are used long term or at high doses [^113c171i]. If NSAIDs are necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, monitor renal function and potassium within 1–2 weeks, and avoid in high-risk patients when possible [^11366CiG] [^111NimAT].

## Pharmacological mechanisms of interaction

### Renal hemodynamic effects

NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, causing **afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction** and reduced renal blood flow, which can precipitate **acute kidney injury (AKI)** — especially when renal perfusion depends on prostaglandins (e.g. heart failure, CKD, volume depletion) [^113c171i]. Olmesartan blocks angiotensin II, causing **efferent arteriolar vasodilation** and reduced intraglomerular pressure; when combined with NSAIDs, the loss of afferent flow and efferent tone can cause **marked GFR decline and AKI** [^111P5F3e].

---

### Electrolyte disturbances

Olmesartan can cause **hyperkalemia** by reducing aldosterone [^112ejEHq]; NSAIDs can worsen this by impairing renin release and sodium retention, further increasing potassium [^113c171i].

---

### Attenuation of antihypertensive efficacy

NSAIDs can blunt the **antihypertensive effect** of olmesartan, potentially worsening blood pressure control [^115MdCGW].

---

## Clinical evidence of adverse effects

| **Adverse effect** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|
| Acute kidney injury (AKI) | - Large nested case-control studies show a 31% higher AKI risk with triple therapy (diuretic + ACEi/ARB + NSAID) [^111694Lk], with the highest risk in the first 30 days [^116WL4Ss] <br/> - FDA warns of AKI risk with NSAIDs and ARBs, especially in elderly, volume-depleted, or those with impaired renal function [^115MdCGW] |
| Hyperkalemia | - Olmesartan can cause hyperkalemia [^116spAVi]; NSAIDs can exacerbate this by impairing renin and sodium retention [^112ZcAFx] |
| Reduced antihypertensive efficacy | - NSAIDs can attenuate ARB antihypertensive effects, worsening BP control [^115MdCGW] |

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **particularly high risk** of adverse effects from concurrent NSAID and olmesartan use:

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of AKI, electrolyte disturbances, and cardiovascular events [^113c171i].
- **Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Increased susceptibility to AKI and hyperkalemia [^11366CiG].
- **Patients with heart failure or volume depletion**: Greater risk of AKI due to reliance on prostaglandin-mediated renal perfusion [^111P5F3e].
- **Patients with diabetes mellitus**: Higher risk of renal complications and electrolyte disturbances [^111NimAT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus provide the following **recommendations**:

- **Avoid concurrent use**: Avoid NSAIDs with olmesartan when possible, especially in high-risk patients [^116sFjxF].
- **Lowest effective dose**: If NSAIDs are necessary, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^111NimAT].
- **Monitor renal function and potassium**: Check serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium within 1–2 weeks of starting NSAIDs [^notfound].
- **Alternative analgesics**: Consider acetaminophen or non-NSAID alternatives for pain control [^111XtF2K].

---

## Clinical management strategies

When NSAIDs must be used with olmesartan, the following **clinical management strategies** are recommended:

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain baseline renal function and potassium prior to initiating NSAID therapy [^111XtF2K].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients on signs of renal dysfunction (e.g. reduced urine output, swelling, fatigue) and hyperkalemia (e.g. muscle weakness, palpitations) [^11366CiG].
- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor renal function and potassium closely during concurrent therapy, especially in high-risk patients [^115MdCGW].
- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust olmesartan dosage or consider alternative antihypertensive therapy if significant renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia occurs [^112uNVfx].
- **Discontinuation**: Discontinue NSAID therapy if significant renal impairment or hyperkalemia develops [^113mghML].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

Given the risks, consider **alternative pharmacological options** for pain management:

- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred first-line analgesic for mild to moderate pain, with minimal renal impact [^notfound].
- **Topical NSAIDs**: Lower systemic absorption and reduced renal risk compared to oral NSAIDs [^notfound].
- **Opioids**: Consider for short-term use in patients with severe pain unresponsive to other therapies, with caution regarding dependence and gastrointestinal side effects [^notfound].

---

Concurrent NSAID and olmesartan use increases the risk of **AKI**, **hyperkalemia**, and **reduced antihypertensive efficacy** [^112aPrbv] [^116spAVi]. Use the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest duration, monitor renal function and potassium closely, and avoid in high-risk patients when possible [^111NimAT].

### Renoprotection: a matter of blood pressure reduction or agent-characteristics? [^111STRVJ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Data from recent clinical trials show that lowering of BP reduces the rate of renal function loss in chronic renal disease. There is evidence supporting the assertion that BP lowering obtained by intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has an additive renoprotective effect in both diabetic and nondiabetic renal diseases. However, to dissociate BP-dependent and non-BP-dependent action of RAAS blockade, the relevant trials are in many cases flawed by design, resulting in BP differences between the comparative antihypertensive strategies. This review discusses whether the relevant literature allows for the conclusion that RAAS intervention has renoprotective effects in addition to its effects on BP. In particular, the main evidence for a specific renoprotective action of RAAS blockade is provided by its consistent antiproteinuric action, which cannot completely be attributed to the reduction in BP. Indeed, other strategies that lower proteinuria without having an antihypertensive effect, such as lowering dietary protein intake or the use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, appear to have a renoprotective effect as well. Interestingly, a consistent finding across different intervention studies is that the more proteinuria is reduced the better the kidney appears to be protected. Therefore, it is concluded that agent-characteristics of RAAS intervention (i.e., antiproteinuric properties) independently influence renal function loss in addition to its BP-lowering effect. Future studies should further explore the renoprotective benefit of non-antihypertensive intervention measures, alone and in combination with antihypertensive strategies.

Conclusions and policy implications

Acute kidney injury is a major public health concern, which has been associated with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. Although the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases has been on the rise in Western countries, the proper use of antihypertensive drugs has been shown to have a favourable effect in preventing major cardiovascular events. However, the use of such therapies might be concurrent with chronic (for example, arthritis) and acute (for example, flu and flu-like syndromes) inflammatory diseases that require anti-inflammatory or analgesic drug treatment. Given that NSAIDs are widely used (40–60% as lifetime prevalence in the general population) and that a greater incidence rate of acute kidney injury was estimated among antihypertensive drugs users than in the general population, increased vigilance may be warranted when diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are used concurrently with NSAIDs. In particular, major attention should be paid early in the course of treatment, and a more appropriate use and choice among the available anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs could therefore be applied in clinical practice.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of TIVORBEX in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of TIVORBEX may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating TIVORBEX. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of TIVORBEX [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of TIVORBEX in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If TIVORBEX is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

It has been reported that the addition of the potassium-sparing diuretic, triamterene, to a maintenance schedule of indomethacin resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteers. Indomethacin and triamterene should not be administered together.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

Both indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. The potential effects of indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium levels and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.

5.7 Anaphylact ic Reactions

Indomethacin has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to indomethacin and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs.

7.2 Drug Interactions with Olmesartan Medoxomil

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets in patients with diabetes [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of aliskiren with amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

Use with Colesevelam Hydrochloride

Concurrent administration of bile acid sequestering agent colesevelam hydrochloride reduces the systemic exposure and peak plasma concentration of olmesartan. Administration of olmesartan at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride decreased the drug interaction effect. Consider administering olmesartan at least 4 hours before the colesevelam hydrochloride dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil tablets. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

These effects are usually reversible.
Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving aliskiren and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of aliskiren may be attenuated by NSAIDs.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS): The concomitant use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS such as ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients taking aliskiren and other agents that affect the RAAS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5, 5.6)].

The concomitant use of aliskiren with an ARB or an ACEI in diabetic patients is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Furosemide: Oral coadministration of aliskiren and furosemide reduced exposure to furosemide. Monitor diuretic effects when furosemide is coadministered with aliskiren.

Cyclosporine or Itraconazole: Avoid concomitant use. (5.7, 7, 12.3)
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. (7)

### Risk factors of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated acute kidney injury: evidence from clinical studies and FDA pharmacovigilance database [^115yRmai]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Until now, the present study seems to be the first study to identify risk factors of ICIs-associated AKI by a systematic review of clinical studies and analysis of data from a worldwide pharmacovigilance database. Our study suggested that concurrent drugs exposure (PPIs, ACEIs/ARBs, NSAIDs, and diuretics), coexisting diabetes mellitus, genitourinary cancers, combination therapy of ICIs, and extrarenal irAEs were associated with increased risk of AKI events in ICIs-treated cancer patients.

PPIs have been reported to increase the risk of AKI in the general population with an abundance of evidence. Deposition of PPI metabolite in the renal tubular area and interstitium may cause acute interstitial nephritis and acute kidney injury. In cancer patients with ICIs, the concomitant medication of PPIs was revealed to be a risk factor of ICIs-associated AKI in several publications, but negative results were reported as well. In our study, both results of the systematic review (including 9 studies) and analysis data from FARES suggested that concomitant medication of PPIs increased the risk of ICIs-associated AKI, indicating the caution of PPI use in cancer patients treated with ICIs. Analyzed from FAERS database, PPIs exposure in drugs of anti-PD1 as a class, anti-PDL1, and anti-CTLA4 had positive signals with AKI. Regarding of individual drugs, PPIs exposure in only nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab and ipilimumab had significant positive signals with AKI, whilst negative in other ICIs. Owing to certain relatively new drugs (cemiplimab, avelumab, tremelimumab) being approved not for a long time, the clinical results of these drugs were limited, so further investigation is still needed.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^113kt8j8]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

To our knowledge, only one observational study has specifically investigated the risk of acute kidney injury associated with the use of these drug combinations. An increased risk was observed in that study, but the study was limited by its cross sectional design and possible confounding by indication and severity (as heart failure is an independent predictor of acute kidney injury). Furthermore, the authors used mean values of blood creatinine concentrations to define the study outcome, without using a specific cut-off that is needed to identify cases of acute kidney injury. Given the limited safety data on the aforementioned combinations, we conducted a large population based study to determine whether the use of diuretics and/or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury.

European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The SUPPORT trial demonstrated that additive use of olmesartan did not improve clinical outcomes but worsened renal function in hypertensive CHF patients treated with evidence-based medications. Particularly, the triple combination therapy with olmesartan, ACE inhibitors, and β-blockers was associated with increased adverse cardiac events.

Biological mechanisms

An interesting finding of this study is an overall increased risk of acute kidney injury with a triple therapy combination but no overall increased risk with a double therapy combination. Among patients on a combination of diuretics and NSAIDs (without an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers), despite a reduction in renal blood flow and the presence of renal afferent arteriolar constriction, glomerular filtration is probably maintained as a result of the effect of angiotensin II mediated efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and sodium retention. As observed in this study, only patients exposed to diuretics and NSAIDs early in the course of treatment may be more prone to develop acute kidney injury. This result is biologically consistent with the potential effect of a drastic hypovolaemia exerted by diuretics, which is further exacerbated by the vasoconstrictive effect of NSAIDs. On the other hand, among patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and NSAIDs (without a diuretic), the afferent vasoconstrictive stimulus induced by the NSAIDs through inhibition of prostacyclins synthesis is probably insufficient to substantially increase the risk of acute kidney injury in the presence of a normal extracellular fluid volume and preserved renal blood flow.

In contrast, among users of the triple therapy combination, the decreased inflow to the glomerulus resulting from the diuretic and NSAID cannot be compensated owing to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, resulting in an increased risk of acute kidney injury. Although we did not find an effect modification by half life of NSAID, patients using NSAIDs with longer half lives have a more pronounced risk of acute kidney injury. Thus, the higher point estimates observed with NSAIDs with long half lives is suggestive of a more sustained constriction of the afferent arteriole. When we considered the duration of exposure to a triple therapy combination, the highest risk of acute kidney injury was in the first 30 days of use. Although the basis of this is still unclear, it might be explained by an early and severe deteriorating effect of NSAIDs in susceptible patients, who are heavily dependent on prostacyclins to maintain renal function. Furthermore, patients may initially use a greater number of NSAID pills early on than later, as some causes of pain may abate over time.

### Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol (Arthrotec) [^115AwBhg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.7)]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Avoid use of ARTHROTEC in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with ARTHROTEC, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with ARTHROTEC, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating ARTHROTEC. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of ARTHROTEC in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient's renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### SGLT2 inhibitors' interaction with other renoactive drugs in type 2 diabetes patients: still a lot to learn [^111FvbiT]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

The first cardiovascular (CV) safety trial conducted with a sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitor, Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), reported not only remarkable risk reductions in CV outcome, but also impressive improvements in renal outcome. Changes in renal hemodynamics could be involved in the benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal outcomes. Considering that all patients of EMPA-REG OUTCOME had established atherosclerotic CV disease at baseline, many patients were also treated with several CV drugs at baseline, including RAS blockers, diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs also impact renal physiology and possibly renal outcome, which could cause relevant drug-drug interactions. This topic is addressed in this issue of Kidney International by Mayer and colleagues. In their manuscript, the impact of empagliflozin on kidney function, renal outcome, and renal safety is presented with stratification for background therapy. Although the beneficial effects of empagliflozin and its safety profile are consistent among all groups, we wonder, do we really understand the renal effects of all these drugs in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients as studied in the large outcome trials?

In secondary analyses, we assessed whether the risk of acute kidney injury associated with double and triple therapy combinations varied according to half life of NSAIDs and duration of use (that is, length of exposure to double or triple therapy combination). Thus, patients deemed to be current users of such combinations were further categorised according to whether they used NSAIDs with short half lives (< 12 hours: aceclofenac, acemetacin, diclofenac, etodolac, fenbufen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indometacin, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, tiaprofenic acid, aspirin) or long half lives (≥ 12 hours: azaprazone, meloxicam, nabumetone, naproxen, piroxican, sulindac, tenoxicam), as well as according to duration of exposure (≤ 30, 31–60, 61–90, > 90 days). We assessed effect modification by half life of NSAID and duration of use of double and triple therapy combinations by including interaction terms between those categories and the relevant exposure groups.

### Drug class combination-associated acute kidney injury [^112McvfZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the quality of available evidence of drug class combinations and their association with the development of acute kidney injury (AKI).

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE and Embase databases was completed using the following terms: "risk factor AND (acute kidney injury or acute kidney failure) AND (drug or medication)".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Inclusion criteria were the following: English language, full-text availability, and at least 1 drug-combination. Each citation was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. The literature was evaluated using the quality of evidence component of GRADE. No standardized definition of AKI was applied throughout.

Data Synthesis

Out of 2139 total citations, 151 were assessed for full-text review, with 121 citations (6%) meeting inclusion criteria, producing76 unique drug class combinations. Overall, 56 combinations (73.7%) were considered very low quality; 12 (15.8%) were considered low quality. There were 8 (10.5%) of moderate quality, and no combination was considered high quality. 58 (76%) combinations that had a single citation, with a mean of 1.6 citations per drug class combination. The combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diuretics was reported in 10 citations, the largest number of citations.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates a lack of well-designed studies addressing drug class combination-associated AKI. The combination of NSAIDs and diuretics with or without additional renin-angiotensin aldosterone agents had the strongest level of evidence. Despite limitations, the information included in this review may result in additional scrutiny about combining certain individual nephrotoxic drugs.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^111694Lk]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To assess whether a double therapy combination consisting of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers with addition of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the triple therapy combination of two of the aforementioned antihypertensive drugs to which NSAIDs are added are associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury.

Design Retrospective cohort study using nested case-control analysis.

Setting General practices contributing data to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics database.

Participants A cohort of 487 372 users of antihypertensive drugs.

Main outcome measures Rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals of acute kidney injury associated with current use of double and triple therapy combinations of antihypertensive drugs with NSAIDs.

Results During a mean follow-up of 5.9 (SD 3.4) years, 2215 cases of acute kidney injury were identified (incidence rate 7/10 000 person years). Overall, current use of a double therapy combination containing either diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs was not associated with an increased rate of acute kidney injury. In contrast, current use of a triple therapy combination was associated with an increased rate of acute kidney injury (rate ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.53). In secondary analyses, the highest risk was observed in the first 30 days of use (rate ratio 1.82, 1.35 to 2.46).

Conclusions A triple therapy combination consisting of diuretics with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury. The risk was greatest at the start of treatment. Although antihypertensive drugs have cardiovascular benefits, vigilance may be warranted when they are used concurrently with NSAIDs.

### Need for a judicious use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to avoid community-acquired acute kidney injury [^112FzdNJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Millions of Americans use over-the-counter analgesics on a daily basis, and nearly 100 million nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescriptions are filled per year. In high-risk patients, these medications can disrupt kidney hemodynamics and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). The risk of NSAID-associated CA-AKI increases 3- to 5-fold in patients taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and diuretics concurrently. CA-AKI increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) or accelerating progression of pre-existing CKD. Importantly, many cases of NSAID-induced CA-AKI may be avoided by identifying high-risk patients and providing patient and provider education on when to avoid these medications and minimize risk.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^1156Tgxf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

Irbesartan

In patients who are elderly, volume depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Therefore, monitor renal function and blood pressure periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

7.2 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors.

Do not coadminister aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).

7.3 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.4 Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin)

Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide.

7.5 Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins

Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and the resin such that irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of the resin.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first large population based study of patients (almost 500 000) using antihypertensive drugs to have investigated the association between the use of different combinations of antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers) with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the risk of acute kidney injury. Our results indicate that the use of a double therapy combination is not associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, although the risk was modified by the duration of use of a diuretic-NSAID combination. On the other hand, the use of a triple therapy combination was associated with an overall 31% higher risk, which is driven by a nearly twofold increased risk in the first 30 days of use. Overall, these results remained consistent after several sensitivity analyses.

Comparisons with previous studies

The known risks associated with these double and triple therapy combinations are currently based on pharmacovigilance case series and a few epidemiological studies. These studies had several methodological shortcomings. The only study that specifically investigated the risk of acute kidney injury due to these double or triple therapy combinations was probably subject to confounding by indication and severity (heart failure can itself lead to acute kidney injury). On the other hand, in the others studies, the primary focus was on the association between NSAIDs and acute kidney injury, and interaction with diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and NSAIDs was a secondary outcome. These studies were not adequately powered to investigate the association between double and triple therapy combinations and the risk of acute kidney injury.

In one cross sectional study of 301 patients, the use of two or more drugs among diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment, compared with non-use. However, the authors adopted mean values of blood creatinine concentrations as the study outcome, without using a specific cut-off (such as creatinine concentration > 0.20 mmol/L) to define acute kidney injury. Thus, their outcome was not specific to identify acute kidney injury and also included subclinical renal impairments. Moreover, they were unable to adjust for potential confounders such as heart failure. The increased risk observed may thus have been partly affected by confounding by indication and severity.

### NSAIDs in CKD: are they safe? [^1137WjKP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of pain in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging for many reasons. These patients have increased susceptibility to adverse drug effects due to altered drug metabolism and excretion, and there are limited safety data for use in this population despite a high pain burden. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been regarded as dangerous for use in patients with CKD because of their risk for nephrotoxicity and thus alternative classes of analgesics, including opioids, have become more commonly used for pain control in this population. Given the well-established risks that opioids and other analgesics pose, further characterization of the risk posed by NSAIDs in patients with CKD is warranted. NSAID use has been associated with acute kidney injury, progressive loss of glomerular filtration rate in CKD, electrolyte derangements, and hypervolemia with worsening of heart failure and hypertension. The risk for these nephrotoxicity syndromes is modified by many comorbid conditions, risk factors, and characteristics of use, and in patients with CKD, the risk differs between levels of glomerular filtration rate. In this review, we offer recommendations for the cautious use of NSAIDs in the CKD population after careful consideration of these risk factors on an individualized basis.

### Risk factors of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated acute kidney injury: evidence from clinical studies and FDA pharmacovigilance database [^114HCbxS]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multisystem irAEs could be induced during the treatment with ICIs, mainly attributed to the unrestricted activation of the immune system and the off-target mode of ICIs. The irAEs could occur in the central nervous system, skin, liver, heart, lungs, musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Similar to the published observational studies, our research also suggested that extrarenal irAEs were correlated with the increased incidence of AKI. Extrarenal irAEs may reflect the degree of the immune system activated by ICIs, hence increasing the possibility of off-target immune reactions in the kidney.

There still be some limitations in our study. Firstly, all of the eligible studies were retrospective; thus, other possible confounding factors may influence the results. Secondly, a specific risk factor only reported in only one study was excluded in the present study due to it is impossible to pool the results in a meta-analysis. Thirdly, the relation between the factors with positive results and ICIs-related AKI could only be association. Further studies still need to be introduced to clarify the causal relationship. What's more, reporting to FAERS was voluntary, hence the relationship between concurrent drugs (PPIs, ACEI/ARBs, NSAIDs, and diuretics) exposure in patients with ICIs and suspected adverse event (AKI event) was not clear and definite. Also, differences in the definition of AKI were unclear. Besides, detailed clinical information such as PD-1 status, patient's baseline renal function, or other risk factors related to AKI were missing. Finally, comparisons of incidence for adverse events through a disproportionality analysis might be influenced by many confounding factors, such as reporting bias and lack of denominator data.

Following the increasing use of ICIs, AKI related to these new anti-tumor agents have been reported and prompted more investigations. Based on meta-analysis of observational studies and real-world pharmacovigilance study of FAERS, our results suggested that drugs exposure (PPIs, ACEIs/ARBs, NSAIDs, and diuretics), coexisting diabetes mellitus, genitourinary cancers, combination therapy of ICIs and extrarenal irAEs may increase the risk of AKI events in ICI-treated patients. Future studies are needed to investigate the mechanism and optimal management of ICIs-associated AKI.

Exceptions include concomitant use of thiazide-type and potassium-sparing diuretics, and thiazide-type and loop diuretics, and dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine CCB can be combined for additional BP-lowering in selected patients.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^113U2Uhm]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury is a major clinical concern. According to the World Health Organization's most recent estimates (2009), the incidence rate of hospital admissions related to acute kidney in the United Kingdom is 5 per 10 000 residents. Furthermore, among people admitted to hospital with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis support, the incidence rate of mortality related to acute kidney injury can exceed 50%.

Adverse reactions to drugs remain an important cause of acute kidney injury. Kidneys regulate the excretion of almost all drugs, which, in turn, may lead to nephropathy. In England, the rate of hospital admission for drug induced nephropathy increased almost twofold between 1999 and 2009.

Although drug related acute kidney injury is commonly associated with the use of individual classes of drugs (such as antiretroviral drugs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), little is known about the effects of drug-drug interactions on this outcome. This aspect is particularly relevant among users of antihypertensive drugs, who often need more than one drug for adequate blood pressure control. For example, in patients with heart failure and hypertension, the concurrent use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers along with diuretics is common. However, many of these patients also have chronic inflammatory diseases or chronic pain, so the add-on use of NSAIDs may be indicated.

Some case reports and pharmacovigilance analyses have suggested that the concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs can increase the risk of acute kidney injury. This risk is thought to vary with the number of antihypertensive drug classes used concurrently with NSAIDs. Specifically, patients can be exposed to a double or triple therapy combination composed of one or two of the aforementioned antihypertensive drug classes with NSAIDs.

From a pharmacological perspective, these combinations may increase the risk of acute kidney injury, as each has the potential to affect kidney function through different mechanisms. Use of diuretics can lead to hypovolaemia, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers cause a haemodynamic reduction in glomerular filtration rate due to efferent arteriolar vasodilation, and NSAIDs cause inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis (leading to renal afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction).

### Diclofenac sodium / misoprostol [^112swxPP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.7)]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient's renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

NSAID safety in chronic kidney disease (CKD) emphasizes that concomitant use of multiple agents that affect kidney hemodynamics (e.g. RAASi, diuretics, SGLT2i, finerenone) as well as volume depletion may further increase the risk of NSAID-induced AKI; consider increasing frequency of eGFR monitoring with NSAID use, especially if prolonged or high-dose. Risks of NSAIDs are likely to outweigh benefits where there is evidence of little to no benefit (e.g., chronic primary musculoskeletal or wide-spread pain syndromes); determine meaningful functional targets for the patient, using SDM, prior to a trial of NSAID therapy, and proactively educate the patients on risks of NSAIDs, both OTC and prescribed, noting that patients may use OTC NSAIDs without discussion with a provider.

### Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide (Benicar hct) [^111ZDqw4]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact
with thiazide diuretics:

Alcohol, Barbiturates, Or Narcotics –
potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

Antidiabetic Drugs (oral agents and insulin) –
dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.

Other Antihypertensive Drugs – additive effect
or potentiation.

Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins –
absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic
exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind
the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal
tract by up to 85 and 43 percent, respectively.

Corticosteroids, ACTH – intensified electrolyte
depletion, particularly hypokalemia.

Pressor Amines (e.g. Norepinephrine) – possible
decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their
use.

Skeletal Muscle Relaxants, Non depolarizing (e.g.
Tubocurarine) – possible increased responsiveness to the muscle
relaxant.

Lithium – should not generally be given with
diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high
risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations
before use of such preparation with olmesartan
medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide.

Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs – in some
patients the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can
reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of loop,
potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when olmesartan
medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide tablets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
are used concomitantly, the patients should be observed closely to determine if
the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

### A randomized clinical trial assessing the effect of automated medication-targeted alerts on acute kidney injury outcomes [^111LxZK4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) — an abrupt decline in kidney function — is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, associated with an increased hospital length of stay and a 10-fold increase in inpatient mortality –. AKI also carries an independent risk for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), end stage kidney disease, and death –.

Despite current international best practice guidelines for management of AKI focusing on avoidance of nephrotoxic exposures, studies have shown that AKI, often asymptomatic in presentation, frequently goes unnoticed, and appropriate workup and treatment is inconsistently performed –. For example, a retrospective study of 9534 hospitalized patients with severe AKI found that the rate of discontinuation of potentially nephrotoxic medications is low in the early stages of AKI, revealing an opportunity for early intervention that could potentially prevent progression to more severe forms of AKI.

Medications that affect kidney function are common contributors to AKI in hospitalized patients. However, international guidelines vary with respect to discontinuation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Observational studies have shown that NSAIDs, potentially by increasing kidney vasoconstriction, increase the risk of AKI both in and out of the hospital –. International guidelines strongly recommend the discontinuation of NSAIDs in the context of AKI. RAASi lower hydrostatic pressure at the glomerulus, thus decreasing the glomerular filtration rate and inhibiting the clearance of uremic toxins. Interestingly, RAASi may also increase kidney peritubular blood flow, potentially protecting against ischemic damage. There is thus debate regarding the utility of RAASi discontinuation during AKI, and this is reflected in guideline recommendations to "consider" discontinuation. PPIs have long been associated with the development of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), a form of AKI, and have been linked to the progression of CKD –. As AIN is likely underdiagnosed in hospitalized patients, and PPIs are likely overprescribed, there is significant interest in whether empiric discontinuation of PPI would affect the course of AKI in this population –. To date, international guidelines do not address empiric discontinuation of PPI among patients with AKI. The EL ectronic A lerts for AK I A melioration 2 (ELAIA-2) investigators set out to evaluate the aggregate and individual effect of prompting discontinuation of NSAID, RAASi, and PPI within a single trial framework to provide higher quality evidence to clinicians caring for patients with AKI exposed to these agents.

Results

Tables 2 and 3 show the characteristics of the patients who had been treated with ARB monotherapy, before and after IPTW adjustment. Before adjustment, there were significant differences among users of different ARB in the mean values of age, frequency of men, prevalence of rheumatoid and kidney disease, and the frequency of use of oral hypoglycemic drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, antipsychotics, liver disease therapeutics, steroids, NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors, and H2 blockers (Table 3). After adjustment, there was no statistically significant difference in all covariates among the ARB users. After adjustment, the mean age of losartan users was 63.4, valsartan 62.7, telmisartan 63.4, candesartan 62.4, and olmesartan 62.9 years. After adjustment, the frequency of men was 60.0% in losartan users, 61.2% in valsartan users, 59.3% in telmisartan users, 60.9% in candesartan users, and 55.8% in olmesartan users.

Table 4 shows the results of laboratory tests at baseline and during the exposure period. In losartan users, the mean level of SUA was significantly decreased in the exposure period compared with the baseline level. In users of other ARBs, valsartan, telmisartan candesartan, and olmesartan, the mean levels of SUA were significantly increased in the exposure period compared with those in the baseline.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^112js14J]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

When we stratified the cases and matched controls by prevalent user status, the results were still consistent with those of the primary analysis; the triple therapy combination was associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury in both prevalent and incident cases and controls. However, the rate ratios were higher for the new users than for the prevalent users, showing an underestimation of the effect when prevalent users were included in the overall cohort (supplementary tables E1, E2, F1, and F2). With stratification by the presence of osteoarthritis, a population for whom NSAIDs would normally be prescribed, although the triple therapy combination did not achieve statistical significance, probably owing to the fewer exposed cases (n = 126), the point estimates were comparable to those for patients without osteoarthritis, indicating that over the counter use of NSAIDs is unlikely to have caused important misclassifications of exposure (supplementary table G).

Finally, to account for immeasurable time bias, we restricted the analysis to those cases and controls who were not admitted to hospital during the current time window. The results of this sensitivity analysis were consistent with those of the primary analysis for both double (diuretics: rate ratio 1.08, 0.81 to 1.44; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers: 0.92, 0.67 to 1.27) and triple (1.33, 1.09 to 1.61) therapy combinations.

The relative merits and drawbacks of ASI remain to be delineated. Given that these agents have overlapping mechanisms of action, as well as experience with dual RAS inhibition trials showing added risk of side effects, combined use is unlikely to be examined. In addition, head-to-head trials with nsMRA versus ASI therapies are unlikely to be prioritized, even though important between-class differences may be present. For instance, ASI may provide more complete suppression of the effects of aldosterone. In addition, ASI may have a more pronounced blood pressure–lowering effect compared with nsMRA. Nevertheless, it remains to be established whether or not physiological differences impact safety or efficacy.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

7.000000000000000e+00 3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

Olmesartan medoxomil

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including olmesartan medoxomil) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Hydrochlorothiazide

In some patients the administration of a NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics. Therefore, monitor blood pressure closely.

7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin Angiotensin System

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

Exposure and measurements

The baseline measurement period (non-exposure period) was defined as within 12 months before the start of ARB monotherapy. The exposure period (outcome measurement period) was defined as between 2 and 12 months after the start of ARB monotherapy. Laboratory data of the level of SUA for each subject were collected at the date nearest the start of ARB monotherapy in the baseline period, and at the date nearest 12 months after the start of ARB monotherapy in the exposure period. The mean exposure of losartan was 264.7 days, valsartan 245.3 days, telmisartan 235.9 days, candesartan 248.9 days, and olmesartan 234.5 days.

Data elements

For each patient, we collected information of patient demographics (age and sex), medical history, use of medication, and laboratory results as baseline covariates for adjustment. Medical history included cerebrovascular disease (ICD-10 code; I60–69), ischemic heart disease (I20-I25), other heart disease (I30-I52), malignant neoplasm (C00-C97), thyroid gland disorder (E00-E07), rheumatoid disease (M5, M6), liver disease (K70-K77), kidney disease (N00-N19), hyperlipidemia (E78.0-E78.5), and proteinuria diagnosed in the 365 days preceding the first date of prescription of ARB. Drugs used during the 60 days before the start of ARB monotherapy included oral hypoglycemic drugs, immunosuppressive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs (including statins, fibrates, and other lipid-lowering drugs), thyroids drugs, antipsychotics, antithrombotic drugs, chemotherapeutic drugs, liver disease therapeutics, chronic kidney disease (CKD) therapeutics drugs, steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), proton pump inhibitors, and histamine H2 receptor blockers.

### Clinical impacts of additive use of olmesartan in hypertensive patients with chronic heart failure: the supplemental benefit of an angiotensin receptor blocker in hypertensive patients with stable heart failure using olmesartan (SUPPORT) trial [^115TWhKX]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

We examined whether an additive treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker, olmesartan, reduces the mortality and morbidity in hypertensive patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, β-blockers, or both. In this prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint study, a total of 1147 hypertensive patients with symptomatic CHF (mean age 66 years, 75% male) were randomized to the addition of olmesartan (n = 578) to baseline therapy vs. control (n = 569). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalization for worsening heart failure. During a median follow-up of 4.4 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 192 patients (33.2%) in the olmesartan group and in 166 patients (29.2%) in the control group [hazard ratio (HR) 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96–1.46, P = 0.112], while renal dysfunction developed more frequently in the olmesartan group (16.8 vs. 10.7%, HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.19–2.26, P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis revealed that addition of olmesartan to combination of ACE inhibitors and β-blockers was associated with increased incidence of the primary endpoint (38.1 vs. 28.2%, HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.11–1.95, P = 0.006), all-cause death (19.4 vs. 13.5%, HR 1.50; 95% CI 1.01–2.23, P = 0.046), and renal dysfunction (21.1 vs. 12.5%, HR 1.85; 95% CI 1.24–2.76, P = 0.003). Additive use of olmesartan did not improve clinical outcomes but worsened renal function in hypertensive CHF patients treated with evidence-based medications. Particularly, the triple combination therapy with olmesartan, ACE inhibitors and β-blockers was associated with increased adverse cardiac events. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov-NCT00417222.

Cyclosporine: Avoid coadministration of cyclosporine with aliskiren [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Itraconazole: Avoid coadministration of itraconazole with aliskiren [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors with agents that affect the RAAS, including aliskiren, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving aliskiren and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of aliskiren may be attenuated by NSAIDs.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS): The concomitant use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS such as ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients taking aliskiren and other agents that affect the RAAS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5, 5.6)].

The concomitant use of aliskiren with an ARB or an ACEI in diabetic patients is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Furosemide: Oral coadministration of aliskiren and furosemide reduced exposure to furosemide. Monitor diuretic effects when furosemide is coadministered with aliskiren.

The use of a triple therapy combination with NSAIDs with long half lives tended to be associated with a higher increased risk of acute kidney injury (≥ 12 hours: rate ratio 1.77, 1.07 to 2.93) than with NSAIDs with shorter half-lives (< 12 hours: 1.29, 1.11 to 1.51), although the P value for interaction did not reach statistical significance (table 3). With respect to duration of use, an 82% (rate ratio 1.82, 1.35 to 2.46) increased risk of acute kidney injury was observed in the first 30 days of use, whereas the adjusted rate ratio progressively decreased with longer periods of use and was no longer significant after more than 90 days of use (1.01, 0.84 to 1.23; P for interaction < 0.001).

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^1174AJwn]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether a double therapy combination consisting of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers with addition of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the triple therapy combination of two of the aforementioned antihypertensive drugs to which NSAIDs are added are associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury.

Design

Retrospective cohort study using nested case-control analysis.

Setting

General practices contributing data to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episodes Statistics database.

Participants

A cohort of 487,372 users of antihypertensive drugs.

Main Outcome Measures

Rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals of acute kidney injury associated with current use of double and triple therapy combinations of antihypertensive drugs with NSAIDs.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 5.9 (SD 3.4) years, 2215 cases of acute kidney injury were identified (incidence rate 7/10,000 person years). Overall, current use of a double therapy combination containing either diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs was not associated with an increased rate of acute kidney injury. In contrast, current use of a triple therapy combination was associated with an increased rate of acute kidney injury (rate ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.53). In secondary analyses, the highest risk was observed in the first 30 days of use (rate ratio 1.82, 1.35 to 2.46).

Conclusions

A triple therapy combination consisting of diuretics with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury. The risk was greatest at the start of treatment. Although antihypertensive drugs have cardiovascular benefits, vigilance may be warranted when they are used concurrently with NSAIDs.

### Diclofenac (xiclo) [^115oFB8s]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis, with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. Monitor for 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). To minimize potential risk for an adverse liver-related event in patients treated with diclofenac external, exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac external with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, antiepileptics).

5.4 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Avoid the use of diclofenac external in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening symptoms.

7.2 Drug Interactions with Olmesartan Medoxomil

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors):

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS):

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil Tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil Tablets in patients with diabetes [See Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of aliskiren with Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil Tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

Use with Colesevelam Hydrochloride:

Concurrent administration of bile acid sequestering agent colesevelam hydrochloride reduces the systemic exposure and peak plasma concentration of olmesartan. Administration of olmesartan at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride decreased the drug interaction effect. Consider administering olmesartan at least 4 hours before the colesevelam hydrochloride dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Lithium:

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including Amlodipine and Olmesartan Medoxomil Tablets. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

### COX-2 inhibitors and the kidney [^117JAGGv]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors are now extensively used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Several large controlled trials provide evidence to support the proposition that they cause fewer major gastro-intestinal side effects and less toxicity than routine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In view of the documented different localizations of the cyclooxygenase-1 and COX-2 enzymes in the kidney, it was initially hoped that COX-2 inhibitors would be associated with fewer renal side effects than other NSAIDs. This has not been borne out by subsequent studies. Like other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors can cause salt and water retention, leading to edema and worsening hypertension. They can also cause acute declines in renal function and glomerular filtration rate. These events are, however, uncommon in large rheumatology populations and infrequently lead to discontinuation of the medications. Judicious use of COX-2 inhibitors in high-risk patients (such as those with chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes or congestive heart failure) will lead to a decreased incidence of adverse renal events.

### Literature review: are NSAIDs harmful and is acetaminophen well tolerated? [^116mPu3s]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On the basis of previous literature, NSAID use is typically avoided in patients at risk for kidney disease, while acetaminophen has generally been considered well tolerated. However, the extent of NSAID effect on the kidneys is not clear, especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the concerns about the safety of acetaminophen have been rising. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence of the effects of NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the context of nephrology and hypertension.

Recent Findings

The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) by NSAIDs is higher with longer courses and in the presence of several factors such as older age, diabetes mellitus, lower eGFR, diuretic use and cardiovascular disease. The timing of NSAID use in relation to the onset of AKI may affect its progression. Regular NSAID use could be associated with an increased incidence of CKD, but the relation between NSAID use and CKD progression is less clear. Regular acetaminophen use was associated with increased SBP, while its use could have a renoprotective effect in certain situations.

Summary

In patients at risk of kidney disease, NSAIDs may be used cautiously after discussing possible adverse effects. Regular acetaminophen use should be reassessed in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

We included the explanatory variables (PPI use and duration of use) and all covariates in the models as fixed effects, and age was modeled a random effect to index the time. All models included random effects on the age intercept and slope, allowing the individual's initial value and longitudinal trajectory to vary with the population trajectory and average.

First, the GFR analysis was conducted using the explanatory variables of interest. We entered the covariates (sex, per-capita-household income, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and NSAIDs, ARBs and ACEs use) into the models, step by step. We maintained in the final variables considered as confounding factors, according to the literature, regardless of the p-value. Finally, the interaction terms were added: PPI use x age and duration of PPI use x age. We presented the results only from the final models.

We conducted analyzes on Stata 14.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111NimAT]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal Risks

In addition to the GI and CV effects of NSAIDs, epidemiological and pathologic data also associate NSAID use with the potential for both acute and chronic kidney disease (CKD).–Renal side effects which include sodium and water retention with edema, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury may precipitate renal failure resulting in acute dialysis. Risk factors include older age, renal impairment, heart failure, liver disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), and concurrent prescription with antihypertensive drugs (eg, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors). Again, mechanisms of NSAID-induced kidney damage relate to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and are dose- and duration-dependent. Low levels of COX-2 are constitutively expressed in the macula densa, with COX-2 inhibition leading to a reduction in renal blood flow and resulting functional impairment. NSAIDs may also accumulate in renal tubular cells during secretion. While NSAID-induced sodium retention is COX-2-mediated, NSAID-induced reductions in glomerular filtration rate are mediated via COX-1.

Consistent with the dual COX-1/COX-2-dependent mechanisms, which predict the possibility of differences in renal toxicity for different NSAIDs, there are limited data to suggest clinically relevant differences. In the MEDAL program, etoricoxib had a greater risk of renovascular adverse events than diclofenac. In PRECISION, the risk of renal events was significantly lower with celecoxib compared with ibuprofen, and was similar for celecoxib compared with naproxen. In a meta-analysis, NSAIDs with high COX-2 selectivity had a lower association with acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to NSAIDs with low COX-2 selectivity. Overall, NSAIDs have a low but tangible risk in causing AKI, electrolyte imbalances and increased BP, but their role in progressive kidney disease is associated only with long-term use in high cumulative doses. In patients with CKD, withdrawal of NSAID use is recommended by nephrology consensus groups, but initiation of alternatives such as opioids conveys different and no less important drug-related concerns. In a study conducted in China that included age- and sex-matched controls of NSAID users, long-term (≥ 48 months) use of NSAIDs was independently associated with reduced renal function. It is recommended that patients with risk factors for renal impairment have preventative strategies in place that include using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest possible time, as well as monitoring renal function, fluid retention and electrolyte abnormalities. The concomitant use of NSAIDs and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be avoided.

### Risk factors of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated acute kidney injury: evidence from clinical studies and FDA pharmacovigilance database [^115ghUox]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

ACEIs and ARBs both have effects on vasodilation of the renal efferent arterioles thus causing a reduction of glomerular filtration pressure. During the hypovolemia state, the reduced efferent vascular tone as described above may induce AKI. Nevertheless, the evidence of ACEIs/ARBs directly leading to AKI is lacking. Several guidelines still recommend to withhold ACEIs/ARBs during certain acute states, such as sepsis, hypovolemia, or hypotension. Whether the concomitant use of ACEIs/ARBs is a risk factor of ICIs-associated AKI is still controversial based on the published studies. In our study, both of the results suggested that exposure to ACEIs/ARBs is related to the increased risk of ICIs-associated AKI. From the FAERS database, regardless of the ICIs types (anti-PD1, anti-PDL1 or anti-CTLA4), ACEIs/ARBs exposure had significant positive signals with AKI. According to individual drugs, results were nearly similar with PPIs, while nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and ipilimumab show positive results. These results indicate that ACEIs/ARBs would better be replaced by other anti-hypertensive agents to reduce the risk of AKI when accompanied by ICIs.

NSAIDs were reported to be correlated with an increased risk of AKI in the general population in both children and adults. The possible reasons were as follows: NSAIDs can reduce renal blood flow; and may cause tubular obstruction owing to crystal deposition then induce direct cytotoxicity and cell-mediated immune attack. Among the published studies in which NSAIDs were mentioned, only one study found that patients with NSAIDs exposure had a higher incidence of ICIs-associated AKI. In our study we pooled data from 7 studies and found that NSAIDs exposure was associated with an increased risk of ICIs-associated AKI. Positive signals of AKI were also found in ICIs-treated patients with NSAIDs exposure, based on the analysis from FAERS. Our results indicated that, in order to minimize the risk of AKI, avoidance of NSAIDs and ICIs concurrent use is recommended.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

Olmesartan medoxomil

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including olmesartan medoxomil) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Hydrochlorothiazide

In some patients the administration of an NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics. Therefore, monitor blood pressure closely.

7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin Angiotensin System

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^112SdV6b]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Exposure assessment

For all cases and controls, we obtained information on all drugs prescribed between cohort entry and the index date, including diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and NSAIDs. We defined a double therapy combination as the concurrent use of either diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs. We defined a triple therapy combination as the concurrent use of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, along with NSAIDs. To be considered a double or triple therapy combination, the drugs of interest had to have been prescribed on the same day or, alternatively, their specified durations of use had to overlap each other for at least one day during follow-up. We calculated this by using the number of prescribed tablets combined with dosing instructions and daily dose. We divided the number of prescribed units by the daily dose to obtain the expected duration of drug use. For the antihypertensive drugs, we defined continuous use as when the duration of one prescription overlapped the date of the next prescription, allowing for a 90 day grace period between prescriptions (a grace period determined by both the pharmacokinetics and prescribing patterns of these drugs in general practice). For NSAIDs, continuous use was similarly defined, but the grace period consisted of the half life of the drug. In the special situation in which patients were prescribed more than one NSAID, we used the one with the longest half life to determine the overlap with the antihypertensive drugs.

On the basis of the above, we classified patients into one of three mutually exclusive groups: "current use", defined as a double or triple therapy combination overlapping the 90 days immediately before the index date; "past use", defined as a combination after cohort entry but ending before the 90 days before the index date; and "never use", defined as the absence of a double or triple therapy combination at any time between cohort entry and index date.

### Risk factors of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated acute kidney injury: evidence from clinical studies and FDA pharmacovigilance database [^114eUmvr]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Several risk factors of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) have been reported sporadically. To identify the risk factors of ICIs-associated AKI in a large-scale population, therefore we conducted a systematic review and a real-world retrospective study.

Methods

We search literature concerning risk factors of ICIs-associated AKI in ClinicalTrials.gov and electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase) up to January 2022. Meta-analysis was performed by using odds ratios (ORs) with 95%CIs. In a separate retrospective pharmacovigilance study by extracting data from US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, disproportionality was analyzed using the reporting odds ratio (ROR).

Results

A total of 9 studies (5927 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The following factors were associated with increased risk of ICIs-associated AKI, including proton pump inhibitors(PPIs) (OR = 2.07, 95%CI 1.78–2.42), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR = 1.56, 95%CI 1.24–1.95), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (OR = 1.29, 95%CI 1.01–1.65), diuretics (OR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.38–2.89), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.28, 95%CI 1.04–1.57), genitourinary cancer (OR = 1.46, 95%CI 1.15–1.85), combination therapy of ICIs (OR = 1.93, 95%CI 1.25–2.97) and extrarenal immune-related adverse events(irAEs) (OR = 2.51, 95%CI 1.96–3.20). Furthermore, analysis from FAERS database verified that concurrent exposures of PPIs (ROR = 2.10, 95%CI 1.91–2.31), ACEIs/ARBs (ROR = 3.25, 95%CI 2.95–3.57), NSAIDs (ROR = 3.06, 95%CI 2.81–3.32) or diuretics (ROR = 2.82, 95%CI 2.50–3.19) were observed significant signals associated with AKI in ICIs-treated patients.

Conclusions

Concurrent exposures of PPIs, ACEIs/ARBs, NSAIDs or diuretics, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary cancer, combination therapy, and extrarenal irAEs seem to increase the risk of AKI in ICIs-treated patients.

5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia

Renal Toxicity

Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury.

Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, ACE inhibitors or the ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of celecoxib may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease.

Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating celecoxib. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of celecoxib [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid the use of celecoxib in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If celecoxib is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.

Hyperkalemia

Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state.

5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions

Celecoxib has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to celecoxib and in patients with aspirin sensitive asthma. Celecoxib is a sulfonamide and both NSAIDs and sulfonamides may cause allergic type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Seek emergency help if any anaphylactic reaction occurs.

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^115c4Z8R]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Potential confounders

We adjusted the risk estimates for comorbid clinical conditions, measured before the index date, known to be associated with acute kidney injury, which could also influence the choice of antihypertensive and NSAID treatment. We thus adjusted all models for the indication for antihypertensive drug use (hypertension, heart failure, and coronary heart disease measured at cohort entry), rhythm disorders, valvular disease, diabetes, number of hospital admissions (any time before the index date), excessive alcohol use, smoking status, and body mass index (all based on the last measure before the index date). To minimise the effect of severity of hypertension, we also adjusted the models for the blood pressure value recorded at cohort entry. We defined hypertension as "mild" when systolic or diastolic blood pressure was between 140 and 159 mm Hg or 90 and 99 mm Hg, "moderate" when systolic or diastolic blood pressure was between 160 and 179 mm Hg or 100 and 109 mm Hg, and "severe" when they were 180 mm Hg or 110 mm Hg or higher. Finally, we also adjusted the models for the use of other antihypertensive drugs (α blockers, β blockers, and calcium channel blockers), digoxin, clopidogrel, anti-arrhythmics, statins, antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, paracetamol, and corticosteroids, all measured in the year before the index date.

Statistical analysis

We estimated the overall incidence rate of acute kidney injury by dividing the total number of cases that occurred during the study period by the total person years of follow-up, with 95% confidence intervals based on the Poisson distribution. We used conditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios of acute kidney injury, which, for the time matched nested case-control method used here, provides unbiased estimates of the rate ratio and 95% confidence interval. In addition to age, sex, calendar year of cohort entry, prevalent user status, and duration of follow-up on which the logistic regression was conditioned, we adjusted for the confounders described above.

In the primary analysis, we compared current users of a double therapy combination, consisting of diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs, with patients currently using these antihypertensive drugs but without NSAIDs. Likewise, we compared current users of a triple therapy combination, consisting of diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with NSAIDs, with patients currently using these antihypertensive drugs without NSAIDs. We chose these reference groups to minimise confounding by indication.

### Analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOMEtrial indicates empagliflozin may assist in preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics [^114YCBZj]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) disease, empagliflozin (EMPA) decreased progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely via a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. Due to prevalent comorbidities, such as hypertension and albuminuria, patients often receive other agents that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used by some individuals. In this exploratory, non-prespecified analysis, we investigated whether the kidney benefits of EMPA are altered in individuals already using the medications in these categories. In the BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME ®) trial, 7020 patients were essentially equally randomized to EMPA 10 mg, 25 mg or placebo added to their standard care. Differences in risk of incident or worsening nephropathy for pooled EMPA vs placebo across subgroups by baseline background medications (to which patients were not randomized) were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Risk reductions in incident or worsening nephropathy with EMPA were consistent across medication subgroups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect. As a representative example, the risk for acute renal failure was overall slightly increased in patients using ACEi/ARBs in all groups (placebo, EMPA 10 mg or EMPA 25 mg) but incidence rates were numerically lower in those assigned to EMPA. Similar patterns were observed for other medications included in this analysis. Thus, EMPA may assist to prevent CKD progression in patients with T2DM with CV disease, irrespective of common background medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, and without increasing acute renal adverse events.

Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any addition benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

Use with Colesevelam Hydrochloride

Concurrent administration of bile acid sequestering agent colesevelam hydrochloride reduces the systemic exposure and peak plasma concentration of olmesartan. Administration of olmesartan at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride decreased the drug interaction effect. Consider administering olmesartan at least 4 hours before the colesevelam hydrochloride dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Renal and cardiovascular effects of selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [^114SGTew]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was proposed as a novel anti-inflammatory and analgesic treatment with a reduced profile of gastrointestinal side effects compared with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although perceived as an inducible enzyme by inflammatory and other stimuli, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the kidney. In this review, we focus on renal and cardiovascular (CV) physiological and pathophysiological characteristics of COX-2 and renal and CV aspects of treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitors. Both clinical and experimental studies have shown that renal and CV effects of COX-2 inhibitors are similar to those of NSAIDs. These effects include sodium, potassium, and water retention and decreases in renal function, as well as mild to modest increases in blood pressure (BP) and edema. These deleterious effects are amplified in patients with volume and/or sodium depletion. The concomitant administration of COX-2 inhibitors may destabilize BP control in hypertensive patients treated with antihypertensive agents. In contrast to the normal kidney, which could constitute a target for adverse actions of COX-2 inhibitors, recent experimental studies showed increased renal COX-2 expression in several models of renal injury, such as the remnant kidney, renovascular hypertension, and diabetes, and implicated COX-2 in the progression of renal failure. This suggests that COX-2 inhibitors may confer a renoprotective effect in diverse renal disorders. These intriguing formulations must be delineated further in appropriately designed prospective clinical trials.

Geriatric patients (those 65 years of age and older), compared to younger adult patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.7)]. In addition, the risk of diclofenac-associated adverse reactions may be greater in geriatric patients with renal impairment or those taking concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [see Drug Interactions (7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Avoid use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in geriatric patients with cardiovascular and/or renal risk factors. If use cannot be avoided, use the lowest recommended dosage for the shortest duration and monitor for cardiac and renal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Monitor renal function in geriatric patients during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, especially in patients with concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Of the 2,184 patients in clinical studies with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, 557 (25.5%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in effectiveness between geriatric patients and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac and misoprostol were observed in geriatric patients compared to younger adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Diclofenac and misoprostol are primarily excreted by the kidney. Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal toxicity. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function, especially during concomitant use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Also, monitor renal function in patients with hepatic impairment. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. If use cannot be avoided in patients with advanced renal disease, use the lowest dosage for the shortest duration, monitor the patient's renal function and monitor for clinical signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil [^113SstiM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.2 Drug Interactions with Olmesartan Medoxomil

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors):

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS):

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil in patients with diabetes [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of aliskiren with amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

Use with Colesevelam Hydrochloride:

Concurrent administration of bile acid sequestering agent colesevelam hydrochloride reduces the systemic exposure and peak plasma concentration of olmesartan. Administration of olmesartan at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride decreased the drug interaction effect. Consider administering olmesartan at least 4 hours before the colesevelam hydrochloride dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Lithium:

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

7.1 Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

Use with potassium-sparing diuretics can produce severe hyperkalemia. Avoid concomitant use.

7.2 Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors

Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone, eplerenone, or aliskiren produce potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production. Closely monitor potassium in patients receiving concomitant RAAS therapy.

7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

NSAIDs may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin‑angiotensin system. Closely monitor potassium in patients on concomitant NSAIDs.

### Renal effects of cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors [^116UGwD1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Recent in-vitro and animal data show that cyclooxygenase-2 has an integral role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the kidney. Cyclooxygenase-2 regulates renin-angiotensin secretion, and thereby glomerular filtration rate and sodium homeostasis. It is also important for protecting against hypertonic stress. As a consequence, it is not surprising that clinical data verify that selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 affect renal function to a degree similar to that which has previously been documented with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Indomethacin extended-release [^115NtcNX]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Intervention:

Concomitant use of indomethacin extended-release and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. Indomethacin extended-release is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers

Clinical Impact:

· NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).

· In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.

Intervention:

· During concomitant use of indomethacin extended-release and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.

· During concomitant use of indomethacin extended-release and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^112Rd27J]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results

A cohort of 487 372 patients using antihypertensive drugs met the study inclusion criteria (fig 1); they were followed for a mean of 5.9 (SD 3.4) years, generating 3 047 813 person years of follow-up. We identified 2215 cases of acute kidney injury during follow-up, yielding an overall incidence rate of 7/10 000 (95% confidence interval 7/10 000 to 8/10 000) person years.

Table 1shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cases and matched controls. Hypertension was the main indication for use of antihypertensive drugs among cases and controls. As expected, cases were likely to have a greater number of hospital admissions and more likely to have diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, cases differed from controls in terms of use of anti-arrhythmics, digoxin, clopidogrel, statins, antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, paracetamol, and corticosteroids. Excessive alcohol use, overweight and underweight patients, and smokers were also proportionally more common among cases than controls.

Table 2shows the results of the primary analysis. Overall, current use of a double therapy combination of a diuretic or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker with NSAIDs was not associated with an increased rate of acute kidney injury. On the other hand, current use of a triple therapy combination was associated with a 31% higher rate of acute kidney injury (rate ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.53).

### Olmesartan medoxomil (Benicar) [^114k23bb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Adult Hypertension

Dosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Benicar is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Benicar may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.

For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), initiate Benicar under close medical supervision and give consideration to use of a lower starting dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Concurrent use of diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and risk of acute kidney injury: nested case-control study [^112ZqTKp]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

In a nested case-control study, Huerta and et al reported an increased risk of acute kidney injury due to diuretic-NSAIDs interaction, estimated through the synergy index (S = 2.4, 95% confidence interval 0.2 to 2.4). This measurement, as well as the relative excessive risk due to interaction index (RERI), quantifies the risk due to drug-drug interactions on an additive scale for dichotomous factors. S > 1 and RERI > 0 indicate increased risk when two or more drugs are combined versus monotherapy. However, that study was underpowered to report a firm conclusion about its results. In another study, Lafrance et al confirmed an interaction between the use of diuretics and NSAIDs (RERI = 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.51). However, neither of these two studies found an interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and NSAIDs. No previous investigations have assessed whether a duration-response relation existed for the use of double and triple therapy combinations and the risk of acute kidney injury. In this study, we specifically focused our investigation on these double and triple therapy combinations. Furthermore, we did a nested case-control analysis within a cohort of antihypertensive drug users and adjusted for their indications, thus minimising the effect of these confounders. Additionally, we adjusted the models for the blood pressure values recorded at cohort entry, thus minimising the effect of severity of hypertension. We were also able to examine the duration-response relation for both double and triple therapy combinations.

7.1 Drug Interactions with Olmesartan Medoxomil

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes [See Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of aliskiren with Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

Use with Colesevelam Hydrochloride

Concurrent administration of bile acid sequestering agent colesevelam hydrochloride reduces the systemic exposure and peak plasma concentration of olmesartan. Administration of olmesartan at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride decreased the drug interaction effect. Consider administering olmesartan at least 4 hours before the colesevelam hydrochloride dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of olmesartan or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium.

### Effects of COX inhibition on blood pressure and kidney function in ACE inhibitor-treated blacks and hispanics [^112fs5Dm]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors attenuate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and reduce kidney function. The study tests the hypothesis that these two classes of drugs have similar effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 24-hour blood pressure. The primary endpoint was change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure. Using a randomized crossover design, 25 black and Hispanic hypertensive participants (mean age 58 ± 3 years) with osteoarthritis were studied. All participants received an ACE inhibitor at baseline. Once systolic blood pressure was < 140 mm Hg, either celecoxib 200 mg/d or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily for 4 weeks was started. After measurements were obtained, all participants underwent a 2-week washout period and crossed over to the other drug for 4 weeks. A significant difference in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure was noted between groups at 4 weeks (+4.1 ± 1.1 mm Hg diclofenac versus +0.6 ± 0.6 mm Hg celecoxib; P = 0.01). However, because celecoxib has duration of action shorter than 24 hours, we compared ambulatory values at celecoxib trough and peak activities. At peak, no difference in systolic blood pressure was noted between agents (+3.6 ± 0.04 mm Hg diclofenac versus +4.2 ± 1.9 mm Hg celecoxib; P = 0.67). GFR was also differentially affected at 24 hours (-9.9 ± 2.4 mL/min diclofenac versus -0.4 ± 1.2 mL/min celecoxib; P = 0.01). We conclude that diclofenac and celecoxib increase systolic blood pressure at peak levels; however, these agents differ in their 24-hour effects. Differences observed in blood pressure response between COX inhibitors may not be related in their sensitivity but rather their dosing frequency.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^111XtF2K]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with a history of renal impairment, congestive heart failure, elevated BP and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, or the presence of unexplained anemia, consider a complete blood count and assessment of renal function prior to initiating an NSAID.

Patients at high risk of NSAID-associated adverse events may be stratified according to GI, CV and renal risk. Patients considered to be at high GI risk are those with age greater than 65 years, use of high-dose NSAIDs, history of peptic ulcer and related complications, and concurrent use of aspirin, anti-platelet therapy or anti-coagulant therapy (and especially patients receiving double anti-platelet therapy). Patients at high CV risk are those with a history of acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous/surgical coronary revascularization, stable angina and angiographic evidence of significant coronary artery stenosis, a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, documented significant carotid artery stenosis, or congestive heart failure. Patients at high renal risk are those with age greater than 75 years, impaired renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min, and concomitant administration of an antihypertensive from any of the diuretic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) classes. Analgesics such as paracetamol, tramadol or codeine may be used in place of NSAIDs if the risks of NSAID treatment outweigh the potential benefits. However, the efficacy, availability and potential adverse effects of these alternatives also need to be considered in any decision-making regarding appropriate analgesia.

Choice of NSAIDs

All oral nonselective NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors have analgesic effects of a similar magnitude, but differences may exist among individual drugs in terms of potential GI, CV, renal or liver toxicities.

This statement was a point of contention among the group and represents a compromise from the original statement, which was formulated as: GI protective therapies are generally inadequate or inappropriate in NSAID users. Consensus was not formed for this statement, necessitating rephrasing of the statement to the above wording (Level of agreement: strongly agree, 21%; agree, 43%; consensus, 64% [not reached]). In line with the revision, the group agreed that GI protective therapies (eg, PPIs) benefit patients who require an NSAID and who have a moderate to high risk for upper GI complications. There is little or no evidence to support any protection against lower GI side effects.

### Use of renal risk drugs in a nation-wide Polish older adult population: an analysis of polSenior database [^116AUtPr]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed data from the PolSenior study, a multidisciplinary research project, conducted in 2007–2011, to assess the medical, psychological, social and economic aspects of aging in Poland. Participants were selected through a multi-stage draw, planned to obtain a sample representative for Polish old population. A detailed description of the study design has already been presented elsewhere.

Renal function was assessed with glomerular filtration rate calculated with the short Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula (sMDRD) as serum creatinine concentrations were measured using the Jaffe method (modular PPE, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), and creatinine clearance (CC) calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

We analyzed regular (≥ 3 times per week) intake of medications that should be avoided, or requiring dose modification when used in subjects with moderately (eGFR < 50–60 ml/min) to severely (eGFR < 25–30 ml/min) impaired renal function. The selection of drugs chosen for analysis was based on guidelines from the American Geriatrics Society and consensus guidelines for oral dosing of primarily renally cleared medications in older adults by Hanlon et al. Additionally, several medications commonly used in older patients were analyzed based on information given by Ashley et al. Only drugs registered in Poland were assessed. Finally, 38 drugs were selected for analysis (Tab. 1). For each drug, the number and percentage of subjects taking it in the total study population were calculated. Next, the number and percentage of given drug users among individuals with kidney function below and above the level indicated in the guidelines (Tab. 1) were calculated and classified as potentially inappropriate use and renally appropriate use. Calculations were performed for both creatinine clearance calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula and sMDRD-derived eGFR. In the same manner, we analyzed potentially inappropriate combinations of drugs:

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an ACEi or ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic. Replacing thiazide-type diuretics (eg, HCTZ or bendroflumethiazide) with thiazide-like diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone and indapamide) may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection among patients with previous MI or stroke. Randomized controlled trials have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour SBP by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg when compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR < 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol, and the magnitude of reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP was greater with spironolactone than clonidine in a separate clinical trial. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects. For eplerenone, RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced CKD has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) — usual dose ranges and key precautions are as follows: Azilsartan 40–80 mg daily (40 mg with diuretic); Candesartan 8–32 mg daily; Eprosartan 400–800 mg daily (daily or divided bid); Irbesartan 75–300 mg daily; Losartan 25–100 mg/day (daily or divided bid); Olmesartan 20–40 mg daily; Telmisartan 20–80 mg daily; Valsartan 80–320 mg daily. Avoid in women who are planning to become pregnant or who are pregnant; when pregnancy is contemplated or detected, discontinue as soon as possible. Avoid concomitant use of ACEI with an ARB or direct renin inhibitor due to increased risk of hypotension, syncope, increased K+, and changes in kidney function. In general, the lower doses should be considered in patients receiving diuretics. Monitor K+ and kidney function; use caution if combined with K+ sparing diuretic, or K+ supplement. Consider interruption or discontinuation in patients who develop clinically significant decline in kidney function after initiation of therapy, until further work-up, as indicated. Compelling indications include: CKD with albuminuria; HFrEF; recent MI.

### Cyclooxygenase-2 – specific inhibitors: are they safe? [^113uhgyc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The basic tenet of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) hypothesis rests on the fact that sparing of inhibition of COX-1 should result in greater safety than if both COX isoforms are inhibited. This increase in safety should be most evident in those organs and tissues in which COX-1 alone has important, necessary physiologic functions (e.g., the stomach and platelets). Data from large clinical trials are now available to support the superior gastrointestinal safety of COX-2 inhibitors, not only for endoscopic endpoints but also for clinically significant outcomes. Additionally, lack of effect on platelets has been demonstrated at doses many times higher than being used clinically. Unfortunately, the COX-2 inhibitors still retain some of the side effects seen with traditional dual COX inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), namely, effects on the kidney that may manifest as an increased incidence of hypertension, edema, and associated clinical states. Similarly, effects on reproductive functions, endothelial function, and wound healing are theoretically possible but need to be evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^117QJepm]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, ACEis/ARBs, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to assess for changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium within 2–4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium.
