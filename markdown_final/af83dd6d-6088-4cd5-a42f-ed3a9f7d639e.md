## Question

What are the common causes of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with low RBC count?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with low RBC count, organized by mechanism and supported by guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hematologic context and how low RBC count relates to B12 deficiency. Then, I should categorize etiologies by mechanism: autoimmune, malabsorption/surgical, dietary, medication-induced, and other causes. Next, I will quantify prevalence where possible and flag high-risk populations. After that, I should verify the diagnostic approach and pitfalls, including when to use MMA and anti–intrinsic factor antibodies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy of common causes and note special scenarios that modify pretest probability, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the hematologic context. A low RBC count in this discussion typically reflects anemia, and when B12 deficiency is causal, the anemia is classically macrocytic/megaloblastic with elevated MCV and characteristic peripheral smear findings, although I should not overstate this because B12 deficiency can occasionally present with normocytic or even microcytic patterns in the setting of mixed deficiencies or comorbidities, so I need to keep an open mind and verify with smear and marrow when indicated [^117WuFCr] [^116cWQXh] [^115u8PZ8].

> Now, autoimmune causes. Pernicious anemia due to autoimmune gastritis is the most common non-dietary cause of B12 deficiency and is strongly linked to anemia, particularly in older adults; I initially thought anemia is present in most PA cases, but wait, let me verify — recent critiques of NICE suggest anemia is present in only about 15–20% of PA diagnoses, so I should correct that and emphasize that PA often presents without overt anemia, even though hematologic findings remain a key clue when present [^111wNTev] [^117NmJ5y] [^113AAYBz]. Mechanistically, anti–intrinsic factor antibodies and parietal cell autoimmunity impair B12 absorption, and PA clusters with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease, which meaningfully raises pretest probability in those populations [^114J8Dw3] [^115iAWiF].

> Next, I will examine malabsorption and surgical causes. Ileal disease or resection, especially more than 20 cm of terminal ileum, directly impairs the physiologic site of B12 absorption and is a classic cause of deficiency; I should confirm that guidelines endorse routine supplementation after such resections, which they do [^notfound]. Bariatric surgery, particularly Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and other gastric surgeries reduce intrinsic factor availability and food-bound cobalamin release, so deficiency is common without prophylaxis; I need to ensure I note that guidelines recommend indefinite B12 monitoring and supplementation after malabsorptive procedures [^114GZbL6]. Inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn's with ileal involvement, and celiac disease impair absorption and warrant periodic B12 assessment; I should double-check that ECCO and ACG endorse including B12 in anemia workups for IBD and newly diagnosed celiac patients, which they do [^112RwYCQ] [^113YJqvB] [^115E4er4].

> Let me consider dietary causes. Strict vegan or unsupplemented vegetarian diets can lead to B12 deficiency over years; I should confirm that guidance recommends supplementation rather than relying on dietary intake alone in older adults and those on plant-based diets, which it does, noting that crystalline B12 is better absorbed than food-bound forms in this context [^114GZbL6] [^114wg4C9]. Hold on, I should verify prevalence estimates; contemporary U.S. data suggest B12 deficiency in roughly 2–3% of adults overall, with higher risk in older adults and those with restricted intake, which aligns with clinical experience [^114wHVoy].

> I will now review medication-induced causes. Metformin is a well-established risk factor; long-term use reduces B12 levels via interference with calcium-dependent ileal absorption and is associated with biochemical deficiency and neuropathy risk, so I should confirm that ADA and KDIGO recommend periodic B12 monitoring in metformin-treated patients, especially with anemia or neuropathy, which they do [^111tYivt] [^1178wvMq] [^111x7sbU]. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers cause achlorhydria and impair release of food-bound cobalamin; I need to ensure I note that risk increases with prolonged use beyond 12 months, which is supported by primary care guidance [^114GZbL6]. Nitrous oxide, whether anesthetic or recreational, inactivates B12 and can precipitate acute deficiency with neurologic injury; I should double-check that case series and reviews document this, which they do [^111StV9i].

> But wait, what about other and special contexts. Chronic kidney disease and liver disease can produce multifactorial anemia in which B12 deficiency may coexist or be overlooked; I should confirm that CKD guidelines include B12 in the initial anemia evaluation and that cirrhosis guidance advises optimizing hemoglobin by correcting B12 (and iron/folate) when deficient, which they do [^117NdERU] [^117B25bm]. In older adults, age-related atrophic gastritis and food-bound cobalamin malabsorption are common; I need to ensure I mention that some data question a strong association between subnormal B12 and anemia in older populations, yet clinical judgment still supports evaluating and treating when deficiency is confirmed, especially if macrocytosis or neurologic symptoms are present [^11527GXX] [^113AAYBz].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and pitfalls. Total serum B12 is the initial test, but borderline results (often 180–350 pg/mL) warrant confirmation with methylmalonic acid, which is more specific for B12 deficiency than homocysteine; I should confirm that AAFP and hematology sources endorse this strategy, which they do [^114wHVoy] [^113mYihi]. Anti–intrinsic factor antibodies are highly specific but insensitive, so a negative test does not exclude pernicious anemia; I need to check that BSH recommends testing in suspected PA and continuing evaluation even if negative, which it does, and I should also note that anti–parietal cell antibodies have poor specificity and are not recommended for PA diagnosis alone [^112yFs6M] [^115bkLAv] [^1173YVWV]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines advise considering endoscopic evaluation for atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer risk in older patients with serologic evidence of PA, which BSG supports [^112HwH2U].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy of common causes in patients with low RBC count. Autoimmune pernicious anemia remains the leading non-dietary cause and should be high on the list when macrocytosis or autoimmune comorbidity is present, even though anemia is not universal in PA; malabsorption from ileal disease or resection, bariatric/gastric surgery, and IBD/celiac are frequent and preventable with surveillance; dietary deficiency is common in vegans and some older adults with poor intake; medication-induced deficiency from metformin and acid suppression is increasingly prevalent; and other contributors include CKD, liver disease, and nitrous oxide exposure, all of which can compound anemia of multifactorial etiology [^111wNTev] [^111StV9i] [^1176kw5T] [^112RwYCQ] [^111tYivt] [^117NdERU] [^117B25bm].

> I should double-check special scenarios that modify pretest probability. Patients with type 1 diabetes have a several-fold higher risk of PA and should prompt a lower threshold for testing; those on long-term metformin merit periodic B12 checks; older adults with macrocytosis or unexplained anemia deserve B12/MMA evaluation; post-bariatric patients require lifelong B12 monitoring; and anyone with ileal resection or extensive Crohn's disease should have B12 status tracked proactively to prevent deficiency-related anemia and neuropathy [^115iAWiF] [^111tYivt] [^113AAYBz] [^114GZbL6] [^112RwYCQ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: in patients with low RBC count, the most common causes of B12 deficiency are autoimmune pernicious anemia, malabsorption due to ileal disease or surgery, bariatric/gastric procedures, dietary insufficiency, and medication-induced deficiency from metformin or acid suppression, with CKD, liver disease, and nitrous oxide as important additional contributors; accurate diagnosis relies on B12 with confirmatory MMA and judicious use of anti–intrinsic factor antibodies, recognizing their limitations and the need to evaluate for atrophic gastritis when appropriate [^114wHVoy] [^112yFs6M] [^112HwH2U].

Vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with low RBC count is most often due to **pernicious anemia** (autoimmune intrinsic factor deficiency) [^111wNTev], **malabsorption syndromes** (celiac, IBD, post-bariatric surgery) [^112RwYCQ] [^1176kw5T], and **medications** (metformin, PPIs, H2 blockers) [^111tYivt] [^114GZbL6]. Other causes include **strict vegan diets** [^114GZbL6], chronic alcohol use, and nitrous oxide exposure [^111StV9i]. Evaluation should include CBC, serum B12, MMA, homocysteine, and anti–intrinsic factor antibodies [^114wHVoy] [^112yFs6M] to confirm deficiency and identify the cause, as treatment and prognosis depend on the underlying etiology [^113mYihi].

---

## Autoimmune causes

### Pernicious anemia

- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmune destruction of parietal cells causes intrinsic factor deficiency and impaired B12 absorption [^115NAKWf].
- **Prevalence**: ~0.1% in Europeans; higher in older adults (~2% in > 60 years) [^114J8Dw3].
- **Associated conditions**: Autoimmune thyroid disease, vitiligo, type 1 diabetes [^114J8Dw3].

---

## Malabsorption syndromes

### Gastrointestinal disorders

- **Celiac disease**: Villous atrophy impairs absorption; common in autoimmune polyglandular syndromes [^notfound].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Crohn's with terminal ileal disease reduces absorption [^114U29bo].
- **Chronic pancreatitis**: Reduced pancreatic enzymes impair B12 release from food [^notfound].

---

### Surgical interventions

After bariatric surgery — especially Roux-en-Y — **malabsorption and reduced intake** are common [^1176kw5T]; after ileal resection (> 20 cm), **loss of the absorption site** leads to deficiency [^111StV9i].

---

## Dietary insufficiency

Strict vegan diets without supplementation can cause **deficiency over years** [^111StV9i]; in older adults, **age-related malabsorption** of food-bound B12 is common [^113n9yLs].

---

## Medication-induced deficiency

- **Metformin**: Long-term use impairs ileal absorption; risk rises with duration/dose [^111StV9i] [^111UhRAv].
- **Proton pump inhibitors**: Reduced acid impairs B12 release from food [^notfound].
- **H2 receptor antagonists**: Similar acid suppression reduces availability [^notfound].

---

## Other causes

Chronic alcohol use leads to **poor intake, malabsorption, and liver disease** [^1114iuj8]; **nitrous oxide** inactivates B12 and can cause acute deficiency [^111StV9i].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Complete blood count**: Macrocytosis, anemia, hypersegmented neutrophils [^117WuFCr].
- **Serum vitamin B12**: Low levels support deficiency [^114wHVoy].
- **Methylmalonic acid**: Elevated in B12 deficiency [^113mYihi].
- **Homocysteine**: Elevated in B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5].
- **Anti–intrinsic factor antibodies**: Specific for pernicious anemia [^115bkLAv].

---

Vitamin B12 deficiency in low RBC patients most commonly reflects **pernicious anemia**, **malabsorption**, or **medication effects**; **targeted testing** for these etiologies enables timely, cause-specific therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency – an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

We represent an update on diagnosing and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anaemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency such as the elderly and patients with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is suggested as the primary analysis followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and measurement of holoTC is currently introduced in the clinical setting. No consensus exists concerning evaluation of the cause for vitamin B12 deficiency, and pros and cons on the different tests mainly aiming at evaluation of the function of the gastric mucosa are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency has been confirmed efficient treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 month or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: recognition and management [^114GZbL6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years. Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. Use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, or alter cognitive decline.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: common questions and answers [^114wHVoy]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older persons. There are a number of risk factors for vitamin B(12) deficiency, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors. No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B(12) deficiency, but high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment of a patient with suspected vitamin B(12) deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B(12) level. Measurements of serum vitamin B(12) may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B(12). Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B(12) (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B(12), patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(12) supplements, rather than attempting to get vitamin B(12) strictly from dietary sources. Administration of vitamin B(12) to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients or alter the cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

### Laboratory testing for cobalamin deficiency in megaloblastic anemia [^115oLWwy]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia in Western populations. Laboratory evaluation of megaloblastic anemia frequently includes the assessment of patient cobalamin and folate status. Current total serum cobalamin measurements are performed in the clinical laboratory with competitive binding luminescence assays, whose results may not always accurately reflect actual cobalamin stores. Surrogate markers of cobalamin deficiency such as methylmalonic acid and homocysteine have been utilized to improve diagnostic accuracy; however, the specificity of these tests by themselves is rather low. Measurement of the biologically active fraction of cobalamin, holotranscobalamin, has been proposed as a replacement for current total cobalamin assays. Although holotranscobalamin measurements appear to have slighter better sensitivity, the specificity of this assay remains to be determined. The relative merits and demerits of commonly available methods to assess cobalamin deficiency in patients with suspected megaloblastic anemia are discussed.

### Oral or intramuscular vitamin B12? [^116keXef]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin B(12) deficiency is common, becoming more so with age, and estimates of its population prevalence have ranged from 1.5% to 15%. If untreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia and irreversible neurological complications. In the UK, the usual treatment is regular intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin. High-dose oral vitamin B(12) replacement is standard practice in some other countries and less costly. Here we review issues around adopting an oral vitamin B(12) replacement regimen more widely in the UK.

Patients may also present with deficiencies in B12, folate, and other nutrients such as copper that may cause anemia, macrocytosis, dysplastic features on peripheral smear, and neurologic symptoms. In countries with folate supplementation, deficiencies are rare but should be suspected in those with severe malnourishment including severe alcohol overuse. Adults aged > 60 years are at highest risk for developing pernicious anemia (autoantibodies against intrinsic factor and parietal cells). A B12 level of < 300 pg/mL suggests B12 deficiency but does not necessarily indicate B12-deficient anemia. Elevated levels of serum methylmalonic acid suggest B12 deficiency and warrants a diagnostic trial of B12. Methylmalonic acid assays are not readily available in all laboratories and correction of borderline B12 deficiency does not always lead to hemoglobin improvement. In cases of borderline B12 deficiency (levels 200–300 pg/mL), we recommend a therapeutic trial of B12, considering the low cost and potential benefit of supplementation. Symptoms of B12 deficiency can be reversed with appropriate supplementation. Severe pernicious anemia should be corrected slowly to reduce the risk of sudden death related to shifts in potassium from extracellular fluid into maturing RBCs. Older adults with mild B12 deficiency with normal absorption usually respond to an oral B12 dose of 1000 μg, daily. Patients with impaired absorption often require parenteral B12 indefinitely.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^111kySvh]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pernicious anaemia is a form of anaemia that is undeniably associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Finding the cure for pernicious anaemia even led to the discovery of vitamin B12. Nowadays, vitamin B12 deficiency is not only associated with (pernicious) anaemia, but is also linked with other conditions such as dementia, neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Therefore, individuals with low serum concentrations of vitamin B12 are frequently given vitamin B12 supplements. Also, since low serum vitamin B12 concentrations are very common in older individuals, screening older people for vitamin B12 deficiency has often been recommended.

Although the biological role of vitamin B12 in haematopoiesis is well-defined, the outcomes of some studies cast doubt on the relationship between low vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older individuals. The association between low vitamin B12 and anaemia has become even more difficult to study because various cut-off values for serum vitamin B12 are used and serum concentrations of vitamin B12 appear not to be an accurate reflection of vitamin B12 status at the tissue level.

Therefore, in order to evaluate the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older subjects, we performed a systematic review of relevant observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal) studies and randomized placebo-controlled trials that have been published in the medical literature to date.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^117NmJ5y]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Whilst renaming PA as AIG can add confusion and uncertainty, the name PA has its own shortcomings, which is perhaps why NICE proposed to change it. The term 'pernicious anaemia' suggests that anaemia is a defining characteristic of the disease. However, anaemia is present in only 15–20% of PA diagnoses. Practitioners unfamiliar with PA are commonly misled by the term 'anaemia', as all ICD-10 (D51.0–9) codes for B deficiency incorrectly include the term anaemia. The term 'pernicious' is also an anachronism, predating the 1948 discovery of B as an effective treatment. It was first coined by Anton Biermer in 1871 to describe the fatal anaemia cases seen prior to the discovery of effective treatments. It is important to note that even though anaemia occurs in a minority of PA patients, this represents an important subgroup of patients that requires a different management approach. The current guidelines do not address how to specifically diagnose and manage this subgroup of patients, representing a significant gap in knowledge and warranting further research.

The definition and our understanding of the condition has evolved significantly since Biermer's original description. We now know that PA often presents with predominantly neurological symptoms. Therefore, if a name change is warranted, it should be one that better reflects the current clinical presentation of the disease.

The persistent use of the term 'pernicious anaemia' in both clinical practice (primary, secondary and tertiary care) and state-of-the-art research highlights a disconnect between these guidelines and current clinical practice. It is important to highlight that the adoption of new and more appropriate terminology would require universal acceptance by clinicians, carers and patients who would have lived with the name PA for most of their lives. While changing established medical terminology may take decades — potentially one to two generations of doctors — before it is fully adopted in clinical language, emphasising that such a change, if it were to happen, would be gradual and require effective dissemination.

However, a name change could offer significant advantages by reflecting the current understanding of PA and encouraging clinicians to investigate neurological symptoms associated with PA. This would be achieved through a concerted effort to educate doctors by incorporating this knowledge into the curriculum, which will dispel misconceptions commonly ascribed to PA patients by doctors and promote a deeper understanding of PA's complexity.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^112HwH2U]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to screening for gastric cancer, BSG 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing a baseline endoscopy with biopsies in ≥ 50 years old patients with laboratory evidence of pernicious anemia, defined by vitamin B12 deficiency and either positive anti-parietal cell or anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. Take biopsies from the greater and lesser curves since atrophic gastritis affects the corpus in pernicious anemia.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: the great masquerader [^115UcM5t]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is rare in children, with nonspecific symptoms including failure to thrive, vomiting, anorexia, and neurologic changes with or without hematologic disturbances. The neuropathy can be severe and irreversible. We report four cases of children with B12 deficiency secondary to adult type pernicious anemia, a presumed transport protein abnormality, and a metabolic defect. All demonstrated neurologic compromise that improved after initiation of B12 therapy. Hematologic manifestations may be preceded by constitutional, gastrointestinal, or neurologic changes, and must raise concern for B12 deficiency. Therapy should be initiated promptly in this setting to prevent irreversible neuropathy.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. In addition, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements.RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate determination of other causes of anemia that may be contributory such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10 9 /L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate between MDS, CCUS, and idiopathic cytopenia of undermined significance (ICUS). MDS is diagnosed if MDS diagnostic criteria are met. If the patient has anemia, does not meet the MDS diagnostic criteria, and has somatic mutations associated with hematologic malignancies on cytogenetics, FISH, or NGS, then the diagnosis is consistent with either CCUS if variant allele frequency (VAF) is > 2% or ICUS if VAF is < 2% (Figure 2). Overlap exists between ICUS and UAA and possibly CCUS, depending on the CCUS definition. We favor UAA if the patient is older, they have an isolated mild anemia (eg, hemoglobin less than 2 g/dL below the lower limit of normal), and, if performed, no suspicious findings on smear or BM studies of a hematologic malignancy. In this case UAA was diagnosed after other causes of anemia were excluded (Table 1).

Risk Factors for Vitamin B12 Deficiency

Approximately 30% of the elderly could be vitamin B12 deficient. Common etiologies for B12 deficiency include the autoimmune disease pernicious anemia or sequelae of gastrectomy or bowel resection. Resection of > 20cm of the ileum is associated with deficiency. Patients undergoing these resections are given vitamin B12 supplementation routinely. Those on a strict vegan diet without supplementation may develop vitamin B12 deficiency years after their lifestyle change, thus not attributing any symptoms to changes in their diet.

Other lesser-known risk factors for B12 deficiency include: achlorhydria due to proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers, gastric atrophy due to aging or chronic alcohol use, pancreatic insufficiency or bacterial overgrowth. Long term metformin use has been associated with B12 deficiency and increased risk of neuropathy. The drug is suspected to interfere with the calcium mediated uptake of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum, a process that can be reversed by calcium supplementation.

Nitrous oxide can cause a rapid onset of B12 deficiency as it renders vitamin B12 inactive via the irreversible oxidation of cobalt. The inhaled gas is used as an anesthetic. However gas cannisters of nitrous oxide, called whippets, used in the culinary industry to make foam are increasingly used as recreational drugs. Several case reports have noted acute vitamin B12 deficiency due to recreational nitrous oxide use or prolonged nitrous oxide anesthesia. Without an understanding of the underlying cause, patients presenting with a peripheral neuropathy, falls, or confusion can be attributed to irreversible complications of diabetes, dementia, or drug use.

As an aside, elevated levels of vitamin B12 can be attributed to myeloproliferative disease due to increased production of haptocorrin.

Presentation and Pathophysiology for Folate Deficiency

In contrast, folates are found in green leafy vegetables, grains, and eggs. Folate is the naturally occurring compound which can be destroyed by cooking. Folic acid is the stable synthetic form of the vitamin found in supplements and enriched products. Leucovorin or folinic acid, is a reduced form of the vitamin used to increase the cytotoxicity of 5FU and prevent deficiency in patients taking methotrexate. The vitamin is essential in DNA synthesis and by extension, hematopoiesis. Folates are absorbed in the jejunum and recirculated via the enterohepatic circulation. Isolated folate deficiency is rare and often presents with fatigue and anemia. Neurologic symptoms are not as marked as with vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^1145f2Y4]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient required for optimal hemopoetic, neuro-cognitive and cardiovascular function. Biochemical and clinical vitamin B12 deficiency has been demonstrated to be highly prevalent among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It presents with diverse clinical manifestations ranging from impaired memory, dementia, delirium, peripheral neuropathy, sub acute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, megaloblastic anemia and pancytopenia. This review article offers a current perspective on the physiological roles of vitamin B12, proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency, screening for vitamin B12 deficiency and vitamin B12 supplementation among patients with diabetes mellitus.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^116c7P8k]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The publication of the 2024 NICE guidelines on B 12 deficiency represents progress but falls short by proposing to rename 'pernicious anaemia' with 'autoimmune gastritis'.This change does not adequately address the distinct nature of PA as an advanced stage of AIG, characterised by IF deficiency requiring lifelong B 12 treatment. Although severe and life-threatening anaemia due to PA is rare today, PA remains a specific condition that requires recognition and appropriate management. The guidelines currently lack detailed protocols for diagnosing PA, especially in patients without typical gastrointestinal symptoms, and rely on tests with limited sensitivity and specificity. Despite these limitations, the guidelines do highlight the importance of a symptom-based approach and prioritise critical research initiatives to address many of the current shortcomings associated with the patient journey. Future revisions should better distinguish PA from AIG, incorporate comprehensive diagnostic pathways that can be implemented in practice, and emphasise educating medical students and professionals to improve diagnosis, effective management and prognosis of PA.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^116j6urG]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

All published cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies in older individuals (mean or median age ≥ 60 years) on the association between vitamin B12 and anaemia were considered for inclusion in this review. The exact definitions of vitamin B12 deficiency and anaemia had to be clearly stated. Observational studies with less than 50 participants were excluded.

In addition, we considered all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where subjects 60 years of age and over were treated with vitamin B12 (any dose and any form of administration) and were compared with subjects who were given a placebo. Studies in which patients had received vitamin B12 treatment prior to the study were excluded. Trials in which combinations of vitamin B12 and folic acid were administered were also excluded.

Search strategy

We used predefined clinical queries (both sensitive and specific) for aetiology and treatment as provided in PubMed (January 1949 - October 2009) and EMBASE (January 1980 - October 2009) using relevant MeSH-headings and free text words for vitamin B12 and anaemia. Case reports and letters were excluded. We restricted our search to articles published in English, French, German and Dutch. The exact search strategies are presented in Additional file 1 (PubMed) and Additional file 2 (EMBASE). Articles in which the mean or median age of the study population was less than 60 years were excluded by hand during the selection process.

Selection of studies

All titles and abstracts retrieved from the electronic databases were initially assessed by the first author. In cases of uncertainty of relevance, the titles and abstracts were also independently assessed by the second author. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. Full copies were obtained for papers that were potentially relevant to our review. Both authors independently assessed these papers and disagreement was again resolved by consensus. Furthermore, reference lists given in the full papers were scrutinized by the first author for additional relevant studies.

### Anemias beyond B12 and iron deficiency: the buzz about other B' s, elementary, and nonelementary problems [^111b1EBs]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The term "unexplained anemia" appears frequently in a request for a hematology consultation. Although most anemia consultations are fairly routine, they occasionally represent challenging problems that require an amalgam of experience, insight, and a modicum of "out-of-the-box" thinking. Problem anemia cases and pitfalls in their recognition can arise for one of several reasons that are discussed in the cases presented herein. "Anemias beyond B12 and iron deficiency" covers a vast domain of everything that lies beyond the commonly encountered anemias caused by simple deficiencies of 2 currently major hematologically relevant micronutrients. However, even these deficiencies may be obscured when they coexist or are not considered because of misleading distractions. They may also be mistakenly identified when other less common nutrient deficiencies occur. I present herein case examples of such situations: a young patient with pancytopenia and schistocytes who was responsive to plasmapheresis, but in whom pernicious anemia was not suspected because of ethnicity and age; a bicytopenic patient with anemia and myelodysplastic features caused by copper deficiency after gastric reduction surgery; and a patient with BM hypoplasia and a dimorphic blood smear who was found to have paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. These "pearls" represent but 3 examples of the many varieties of problems in anemia diagnosis and are used to illustrate potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency presenting with neurological dysfunction in an adolescent [^112SJeP9]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12 deficiency is classically encountered in the adult Caucasian population and manifests as a subacute combined degeneration in the presence or absence of macrocytic anemia. However, B12 deficiency is extremely rare in children in developed countries, and pernicious anemia is even rarer etiology of this deficiency. The clinical presentation of B12 deficiency in children is not as easily recognizable or well-characterized and may result in missed or delayed diagnosis.

Patient Description

We describe a previously healthy adolescent girl who presented with emotional lability, mental status changes, hyperreflexia, and ataxia. She was found to have megaloblastic anemia and subacute combined degeneration secondary to B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia.

Conclusion

Though B12 deficiency is uncommon in pediatrics, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion because early recognition and treatment of B12 deficiency are key to preventing long-term neurological sequelae.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^11527GXX]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pernicious anaemia is undeniably associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, but the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people is unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people.

Methods

Clinical queries for aetiology and treatment in bibliographic databases (PubMed [01/1949–10/2009]; EMBASE [01/1980–10/2009]) were used. Reference lists were checked for additional relevant studies. Observational studies (≥ 50 participants) and randomized placebo-controlled intervention trials (RCTs) were considered.

Results

25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one observational cross-sectional studies (total number of participants n = 16185) showed inconsistent results. In one longitudinal observational study, low vitamin B12 concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of anaemia (total n = 423). The 3 RCTs (total n = 210) were well-designed and showed no effect of vitamin B12 supplementation on haemoglobin concentrations during follow-up in subjects with subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations at the start of the study. Due to large clinical and methodological heterogeneity, statistical pooling of data was not performed.

Conclusions

Evidence of a positive association between a subnormal serum vitamin B12 concentration and anaemia in older people is limited and inconclusive. Further well-designed studies are needed to determine whether subnormal vitamin B12 is a risk factor for anaemia in older people.

There are also several positives for PA patients from the 2024 NICE guidelines

The guidelines' emphasis on a symptom-based approach to treatment is an urgent and necessary shift that could positively influence current practice. They also stress the importance of individualised care, suggesting that B 12 replacement dosage, frequency, and delivery method may need to be tailored to ensure treatment efficacy. However, many patients require treatment more frequently than current guidelines suggest. Survey data indicates that up to 50% of patients require more frequent injections to manage their symptoms effectively (Thain et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.30.24312837). This is consistent with findings from Hooper et al. where 65% of patients received B 12 injections according to current guidelines (every 2–3 months). Further qualitative evidence from interviews also highlights that many PA patients considered the current guidelines too restrictive, with symptoms reoccurring well before the next planned injection.

### Scope of the problem: epidemiology of anemia and use of blood transfusions in critical care [^111RhxgS]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in critically ill patients. It is caused, in part, by blood loss related to phlebotomy for diagnostic testing, occult gastrointestinal bleeding, renal replacement therapies, surgical intervention, and traumatic injuries. Reduced red cell life span and nutritional deficiencies (iron, folate, vitamin B12) may be other contributing factors. In addition, critically ill patients have impaired erythropoiesis because of blunted endogenous erythropoietin production and the direct inhibitory effects of inflammatory cytokines on red blood cell production by the bone marrow. Blood transfusions are commonly utilized for treatment of anemia in critical care, resulting in high use of blood transfusions in the intensive care unit (ICU). The percentage of patients transfused in the ICU is inversely related to admission hemoglobin and directly related to age and severity of illness. Patients with an increased length of stay in the ICU are also at increased risk for receiving blood transfusions. Studies are needed to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of ICU-acquired anemia, to determine the efficacy of blood transfusions in critical care, and to investigate alternatives to blood transfusion for the treatment of anemia in the ICU.

### Profile of anemia in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients on maintenance therapy and the effect of micronutrient supplementation [^111cQNvD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common finding and important cause of morbidity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis or during the course of its protracted treatment. We studied profile of anemia in ALL patients on maintenance therapy and evaluated specific micronutrients as cause of this anemia.

Patients and Methods

ALL patients who were on maintenance therapy and had grade ≥ 2 anemia were recruited for the study. Serum iron studies, folate, and vitamin B12 were done to identify micronutrient deficiency and to initiate supplementation with specific components if found to be deficient. Toxicities, improvement of anemia, micronutrient levels, and disease outcome were studied after 3 months.

Results

From March 2015 to September 2016, 105 ALL patients were found to be on maintenance fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Overall, the proportion of anemia was 80%(N = 84). Majority had normocytic normochromic anemia (71%). Macrocytic anemia was seen in 18% and microcytic hypochromic in 9.5%. In patients with anemia of grade ≥ 2 (N = 84), 38 patients (45%) had biochemical deficiency of serum folate, and 7 (8%) had vitamin B12 deficiency. No biochemical evidence of iron deficiency was found. Supplementation of deficient micronutrients improved anemia: mean hemoglobin significantly increased from 8.06 ± 1.63 to 10.78 ± 1.53 (p < 0.001) at 3 months; and reduced treatment toxicities, mean number of febrile neutropenia episodes (p = 0.007), and treatment interruptions of > 2 weeks (p = 0.002) were lowered. Patients with anemia had significantly more relapses (N = 14,64%) compared to patients without anemia (N = 8,36%), (p = 0.040).

Conclusion

Timely identification and correction of micronutrient deficiencies causing anemia in ALL patients on maintenance can enhance treatment outcomes.

### Neuromuscular complications of nutritional deficiencies [^116L6oFy]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

For many nutrition deficiencies, a direct cause and effect of different symptoms and diseases has been established. These are known as primary nutritional deficiencies. Secondary deficiencies occur when the vitamin or nutrient requirement may be increased, such as in patients who have pernicious anemia who lack the intrinsic factor needed to absorb vitamin B12. Less well recognized are the effects of nutritional deficiencies on chronic disease, especially acute and chronic neuromuscular diseases. This article identifies some of the causative factors and provides the reader with a guideline for what to consider in the evaluation of individuals who have neuromuscular problems.

Evaluation of related anemia — Major morbidities of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include symptomatic anemia and associated fatigue; the health care provider must also identify and treat any coexisting causes of anemia, and standard assessments should be performed to look for gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and the cause of depletion corrected, if possible, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproductive macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels, and bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^1114iuj8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is the most common complication of liver cirrhosis and is seen in 75% of cases. The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Common causes include acute and chronic blood loss due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malnutrition, hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, and impaired coagulation. Alcohol causes anemia by its direct bone marrow toxicity, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency due to poor oral intake, and intestinal malabsorption. Treatment-related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein–Barr virus. Given the diverse and sometimes multifactorial etiology (alcohol and hepatitis B) of cirrhosis, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of anemia in these groups of patients.

The most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis is normocytic normochromic anemia, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multifactorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption. However, liver cirrhosis is characteristically associated with round macrocytes, whereas B12 and folate deficiency show oval macrocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear (PBS), along with megaloblastic erythropoiesis on bone marrow examination.

Pathophysiology and causes of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease — Anemia most often occurs because of a combination of chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease) and iron deficiency, with iron deficiency arising from inadequate iron intake, excessive blood loss, poor iron absorption, and inflammation-driven blockage in reutilization of stored iron; additional contributors include vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, hemolysis, or myelosuppression from IBD drugs; iron absorption occurs at intestinal enterocytes mainly in the duodenum and dietary nonheme iron from plants and fortified foods is released in the ferric form (Fe3+); causes summarized include most common causes (iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, combined iron deficiency and chronic disease), vitamin deficiency (vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, possible vitamin A, D, B6, copper), drug-induced (mercaptopurine: bone marrow suppression, myelodysplasia; methotrexate: folate deficiency, bone marrow suppression; sulfasalazine: folate deficiency, bone marrow suppression, hemolysis), immune-mediated hemolysis, and inherited causes (hemoglobinopathy, disorders of erythropoiesis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency).

Medical management

There is limited guidance on the management of non-neoplastic complications of AIG/PA, including frequency of interval surveillance and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency and iron deficiency. Importantly, vitamin B12 deficiency can occur in the absence of anemia and if not addressed can lead to irreversible neurologic deficits. Parenteral rather than oral supplementation is preferred, especially if neurologic symptoms are present. Appropriate supplementation of vitamin B12 and iron is important, along with workup of other etiologies for these not uncommon deficiencies based on the clinical scenario.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^111EjPbA]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pernicious anaemia (PA) is an underdiagnosed complex autoimmune condition characterised by vitamin B 12 (B 12) malabsorption. This occurs secondary to gastric atrophy which leads to a reduction or absent production of intrinsic factor (IF). While PA is linked to the end stages of autoimmune gastritis (AIG), they are not synonymous. PA remains largely under-researched in clinical practice, contributing to gaps in diagnosis, management, and patient care. Its management typically involves regular and lifelong intramuscular injections of hydroxocobalamin. An injection frequency of 1 mg every 2–3 months is often 'recommended'. However, this dosing schedule does not have a strong evidence base, and many individuals with PA / B 12 deficiency / PA report requiring more frequent injections for adequate symptom relief. Furthermore, recent data, which is consistent with prior work by Hooper et al. from a large survey we conducted on over 1100 PA patients shows that 40% of PA patients wait two years or longer for diagnosis, further complicating patient outcomes and satisfaction (Thain et al. 2024, DOI: 10.1101/2024.08.30.24312837).

The 2024 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on B 12 deficiency raise important questions about PA, particularly regarding its nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, and appropriate follow-up care. Here we review the NICE guidelines, with a specific focus on their implications for PA, and highlightareas for improvement in addressing the needs of such individuals.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among adult diabetic patients in Uganda: relation to glycaemic control and haemoglobin concentration [^112E4Ndj]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 1 in 10 of adult ambulatory individuals with diabetes receiving care in a Ugandan national referral hospital. Low hemoglobin concentrations < 12 g/dl and elevated glycated hemoglobin levels ≥ 7% (suboptimal glycaemic control) were associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Elevated MCV levels and red blood cell changes like macrocytosis and hyper segmented WBCs were not as prevalent as expected in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Given the relatively high rates and known potential problems associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, we recommend screening for all adult individuals with diabetes, especially in those with suboptimal diabetes control and anemia. We also recommend a prospective representative multi-centre study to assess the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in individuals without diabetes as controls compared to those with diabetes and to examine the effect of vitamin B12 deficiency on optimal glycaemic control and worsening of insulin resistance among individuals with diabetes.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^1168LxAt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 5 — Implementation considerations for folate and vitamin B12 in CKD — states that because absorption of vitamin B12 is dependent on intrinsic factor and normal gut function and the latter is often at least partially impaired in older individuals, assessment of serum vitamin B12 may be necessary if folate supplementation is considered, and that Vitamin B deficiencies may be identified by clinical signs and symptoms and assessment of serum vitamin B12 should be considered if folate supplementation is administered. The guideline notes that high folic acid intake may mask signs of pernicious anemia and undetected progression of neurologic disease, and thus folate and vitamin B12 levels should be monitored if folate is being supplemented, and that suggested vitamin intake should be based on recommendations for the general population (eg, RDA) unless there are specific considerations requiring modification. Individualization of therapy, including supplementation of folate, should be based on monitoring of severity of nutrient depletion, and individualization should include patient age because adults older than 50 years may have increased needs due to the prevalence of atrophic gastritis in this population. For monitoring and evaluation, serum/plasma/RBC folate and serum vitamin B12 levels should be assessed as appropriate.

### Incidence and risk factors of micronutrient deficiency in patients with IBD and intestinal Behçet's disease: folate, vitamin B12, 25-OH-vitamin D, and ferritin [^112MV3bm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinically relevant micronutrient deficiencies that occur over the course of IBD disease progression include anemia (caused by iron, folate, and vitamin B12 deficiencies), bone mineral density loss (due to insufficient calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, and vitamin K levels), impaired thrombosis (caused by folate, vitamin B6, B12 deficiency) and wound healing deficits (due to deficiencies of vitamin A, C, and zinc), and carcinogenesis (related to folate, vitamin D, and calcium deficiency). Among them, anemia is the most common complication affecting up to 70% of patients with IBD, including UC and CD, and intestinal BD. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in 30–90% of patients with IBD, but folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies are also highly prevalent in these patients, especially in those with CD, compared to the general population. In addition, bone density is an important factor, which affects not only the quality of life of IBD patients but also the disease course of IBD, as it is highly related to treatment modalities such as corticosteroids as well as micronutrients. However, studies assessing micronutrient concentrations in patients with IBD are scarce, and there are currently no studies on micronutrients in patients with intestinal BD, to our knowledge. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of micronutrient deficiency in patients with IBD and intestinal BD.

3 DEFINITION OF ANAEMIA

3.1 Recommendation

The definition of anaemia in children with GI disease should be based on validated World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (level of evidence [LoE]: low; strength of recommendation [SoR]: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

3.1.1 Statement

In children with GI disease, anaemia can be classified based on pathogenic mechanisms, red cell morphology and clinical presentation (LoE: low; SoR: strong, voting: 100% agreement).

3.1.2 Practice points

1 Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) may cause hyporegenerative anaemia.
2 IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin < 30 or < 100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively.
3 ACD is multifactorial and associated with the presence of infection or inflammation.
4 Anaemia can be classified as acute or chronic according to the clinical presentation.

3.2 Summary of evidence

Anaemia is a public health problem affecting both high‐ and low‐income countries. Approximately one quarter of the world's population (almost 2 billion people) suffers from anaemia, with 39.8% of children < 5 years of age affected, equivalent to 269 million children, and with the highest prevalence rate (60.2%) observed in children living in the African region. The WHO estimates that the global prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6–59 months in European and North American children is 20.3% and 6.1%, respectively.

Anaemia is defined by a haemoglobin (Hb) level or red cell mass below the range considered normal for age and gender, which results in decreased oxygen‐carrying capacity to the body's tissues. The normal range of Hb varies with age, gender and race, and therefore, specified thresholds should be considered for diagnosis (Table 1). Anaemia can be classified based on pathogenesis, red cell morphology, and clinical presentation (Table 2). Regarding the pathogenic mechanisms, these are represented by inadequate production and loss of erythrocytes due to either bleeding or haemolysis. Based on these mechanisms, anaemia can be further subdivided into (a) hypo‐regenerative, with a decreased bone marrow production from impaired function, decreased number of precursor cells, reduced stem cell density, or lack of nutrients; and (b) regenerative, with an appropriate bone marrow response to a reduced erythrocyte mass, characterised by increased production of erythrocytes.

### Prevalence and outcome of anemia after restorative proctocolectomy: a clinical literature review [^113CohDJ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Iron and/or vitamin B12 deficiency anemias, which have adverse effects on patients' quality of life, are commonly observed and often overlooked complications after restorative proctocolectomy. We performed a systematic review of publications on the prevalence of anemia as well as on the impact of anemia on a range of clinical, functional, quality of life, and economic outcomes in restorative proctocolectomy patients. This information is important to help healthcare providers through a comprehensive overview to increase awareness about a condition that could require therapy to improve patient healthcare and quality of life.

Methods

We reviewed the English language publications on the incidence of anemia and its adverse effect after restorative proctocolectomy The United States National Library of Medicine database (MEDLINE), the Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), the Cochran Library, and the Google search engine were searched for published articles on the prevalence and impact of anemia in post-restorative proctocolectomy surgical patients.

Results

The long-term complication most frequently described after RPC is pouchitis. Pouchitis is significantly associated with iron deficiency anemia caused by pouch mucosal bleeding. Other causes are insufficient and/or impaired iron absorption. It has also been observed, however, that restorative proctocolectomy patients with underlying familial adenomatous polyposis rarely develop pouchitis yet show higher rates of iron deficiency anemia compared to those patients with underlying ulcerative colitis. Other causes shown as independent risk factors for iron deficiency anemia in restorative proctocolectomy patients are malignancy, desmoid tumors, and J-pouch configuration. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is also common after restorative proctocolectomy. About one-third of restorative proctocolectomy patients show abnormal Schilling test and 5 percent have low referenced serum cobalamin. It has been observed that the degree resection of the terminal-ileum, malabsorption, bacterial overgrowth, and dietary factors are among the known causes of cobalamin deficiency. Folate deficiency has not been reported in restorative proctocolectomy patients. Describing restorative proctocolectomy surgery and its outcomes, in patients without anemia, the quality of life is reported excellent regardless of operative technique.

Conclusions

Anemia is not uncommon following restorative proctocolectomy and has been shown to have negative effects on the patient's quality of life and the economy and may substantially increase healthcare costs. The treatment of anemia and its underlying causes is important to improving clinical and economic outcomes.

Conclusions

The studies included in this systematic review indicate that evidence of an association between a subnormal serum vitamin B12 concentration and anaemia in older people is limited and inconclusive. If anything, given the high clinical relevance of our research question, we recommend more well-designed longitudinal observational studies, in younger age groups (60–85 years) especially, and intervention studies of appropriate size and duration with timely follow-up periods to determine whether a subnormal vitamin B12 is a risk factor for anaemia in older people.

Education into practice

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

This article has been shared with Martyn Hooper, chairperson of the Pernicious Anaemia Society (PAS), for comments and feedback. Input from Martyn and other patients, some being members of the PAS, is much appreciated. They suggested recommendations for reporting specific signs and symptoms often mentioned by members/patients; however, as this is a therapeutics article, these recommendations are not included. They also reported on the barriers patients experience in healthcare (which can also be found in the scientific literature,) and several additional case descriptions.

Search strategy

We searched PubMed (NLM database) with the terms "B12" OR "cobalamin" AND "deficiency" OR "therapeutics" OR "supplementation" for relevant publications of clinical observations and studies published from 1950 to 2022. We prioritised systematic reviews and studies on the benefits, harms, and cost effectiveness of B 12 supplementation. We also searched clinical guidelines and our personal archives of references, and screened the reference lists of studies retrieved by the searches.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^115fQhob]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anemia

The anemia of AIG (with or without PA) may be microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, although macrocytic is the classic association (Figure 3). Anemia is common in AIG, with a prevalence around 50% depending on the study, with the most often etiologies iron and vitamin B12 deficiency. Gastric acid is important for enzyme activation and freeing micronutrients from dietary sources. Gastric acid is also important for the reduction and absorption of iron. As previously described, vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with AIG may be attributed to parietal cell loss as well as autoantibodies targeting IF. IF is responsible for binding vitamin B12 and facilitating uptake in the terminal ileum. Iron stores are depleted more quickly than vitamin B12 stores and thus iron deficiency anemia is often an early manifestation of AIG. While the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia often prompts an AIG workup, it should be equally appreciated that vitamin B12 deficiency has a broad differential, and more common causes should be evaluated in patients. The diagnosis of anemia may also be confounded by other underlying diseases, such as hypothyroidism. To this end, one multi-center study of 654 consecutive AIG patients, nearly 50% of whom had anemia, demonstrated that certain patient characteristics were associated with patterns of anemia.PA was more common in males and older patients, whereas iron deficiency anemia was more common in females and younger patients. Iron deficiency was present in both those with and without anemia. These findings were similar to another cohort study of 160 patients with AIG based on serologies. In this study, 83 of the 160 patients with AIG were also diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. Again, those with iron deficiency were more often women, younger (median age 41 vs 62 with macrocytic anemia), and had a higher prevalence of H. pylori (41.3% vs 28.6%).

In vitamin B12 deficiency, patients may be asymptomatic while other patients can have sequalae of symptoms as the disease progresses. This includes subtle findings including glossitis or more catastrophic symptoms of infertility, early recurrent miscarriages, or even thrombosis as well as the neurologic symptoms described above.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: a systematic review [^112rx8LK]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Although we did not find an association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people, this does not imply that patients with pernicious anaemia or age-related food-vitamin B12 malabsorption (with tissue depletion of vitamin B12 and very low vitamin B12 concentrations) will not benefit from vitamin B12 administration, especially since non-placebo-controlled studies showed (large) increases in haemoglobin concentrations or haematocrit after intramuscular or oral vitamin B12 administration in patients with pernicious anaemia or age-related food-vitamin B12 malabsorption. However, apart from the undisputed reality of pernicious anaemia, the clinical impact of a subnormal vitamin B12 level in older people is unclear, especially since several observational studies and randomized controlled trials also showed no effect of vitamin B12 administration on cognitive function.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^115crKmA]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism could be explained by the presence of antibodies to the gastric parietal cells and intrinsic factor, reduced oral intake, dyserythropoesis due to thyroid hormone deficiency and defective absorption due to reduced bowel motility, bowel wall oedema and bacterial overgrowth.

Celiac disease which is a highly prevalent autoimmune mediated gastrointestinal condition occurs in 1–16% of T1DM patients compared to 0.3–1% in the general population. Ingestion of wheat gluten and other related proteins have been documented to be the trigger factors of this condition in genetically susceptible individuals. Due to the associated enteropathy, patients often present with failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea and anemia due to micronutrient (mainly folate, vitamin B12) malabsorption.

Screening approach for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T2DM

Currently, there are no published guidelines advocating for routine screening for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T2DM. However among type 2 diabetic patients, it is clinically plausible to screen for vitamin B12 deficiency prior to initiation of metformin and later annually among elderly patients with history of long term use of metformin (≥ 3–4 years), use of high doses of metformin (≥ 2 g/day), clinically worsening diabetic distal polyneuropathy in the presence or absence of the discussed haematological abnormalities.

The screening approach for vitamin B12 deficiency among diabetic patients and the general population is similar. Measurement of the serum vitamin B12 concentrations should be the preliminary screening step for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T2DM. Concentrations < 200 pg/ml are usually diagnostic of vitamin B12 deficiency while concentrations > 400 pg/ml confirm absence of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Measurement of serum MMA or homocysteine concentrations is a more sensitive and specific approach for screening especially among type 2 diabetic patients with borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations of 200–400 pg/ml and subtle haematological manifestations. Serum homocysteine and MMA concentrations of 5–15 μmol/l and < 0.28 μmol/l are considered within the normal range respectively.

### Vitamin B [^1142nVEF]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

How is B 12 deficiency treated?

The therapeutic goals of B 12 treatment are the reversal of metabolic abnormalities and the prevention or reduction of clinical symptoms (fig 1). Treatment depends in part on the severity of symptoms and the cause of the deficiency. In individuals with symptomatic B 12 deficiency despite normal dietary B 12 intake, B 12 malabsorption is the most likely cause and should guide parenteral therapy.

The three key treatment areas are outlined below.

Insufficient dietary intake

To prevent deficiency, oral cyanocobalamin supplementation once daily 20–50 mcg or 50–150 mcg is most commonly recommended. In some countries, methyl- and adenosylcobalamin-containing preparations are available; however, one observational study suggests better efficacy with cyanocobalamin than with methylcobalamin. Exercise caution when using combination preparations to avoid excessive folate or B 6 intake. With advancing age, B 12 absorption declines, and a higher supplemental B 12 dose may be needed. Yearly monitoring of B 12 status and suitable adjustment of the supplementation dose is recommended.

For symptomatic deficiency (box 1) caused by insufficient dietary intake, intramuscular B 12 therapy is usually initiated with the aim of progressing to oral supplements once symptoms have resolved.

### Primary neurologic symptoms: have you considered pernicious anemia? [^115NAKWf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is a nutrient that is vital for metabolic function. Absorption of ingested B12 is dependent on intrinsic factor, which is secreted by parietal cells within the stomach. Pernicious anemia is caused by an intrinsic factor deficiency or autoantibodies against intrinsic factor. The presence of parietal cell antibodies can destroy parietal cells, which can also lead to a deficiency in intrinsic factor. Both lead to megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. The typical presentation of pernicious anemia includes fatigue, pale appearance, tingling sensation, depression, alterations to vision and smell, urinary incontinence, psychotic episodes, and weakness. The most effective treatment for pernicious anemia is intramuscular B12.

Case Report

A 27-year-old woman with a history of vitiligo presented to the emergency department (ED) with bilateral lower extremity weakness, clumsiness, numbness, and tingling. Physical examination revealed ataxia, no sensation below her umbilicus, decreased strength, and hyperreflexia in both lower extremities. Complete blood count in the ED revealed low hemoglobin and hematocrit and elevated mean corpuscular volume, concerning for pernicious anemia. Further laboratory testing upon inpatient admission revealed a low vitamin B12 level and parietal cell antibodies in the blood. The patient's pernicious anemia was treated with intramuscular vitamin B12 injections, which led to near complete resolution of her symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Early suspicion and detection of pernicious anemia in the ED can prevent serious and permanent hematologic and neurologic damage and the development of other autoimmune disorders.

### The relevance of vitamin and iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in patients of the Swiss IBD cohort [^116UZJz8]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background andaims

Vitamin and iron deficiencies are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as a result of chronic intestinal inflammation, increase in demand, or dietary restrictions. Here, we assessed the frequency of complications in relation to deficiency of iron, folate acid, and vitamin B12 in patients enrolled in the nationwide Swiss Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort Study (SIBDCS).

Methods

A total of 2666 patients were included in the study, 1558 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 1108 with ulcerative colitis (UC).

Results

Iron deficiency anemia was detected in 19.6% of CD patients and 21.6% of UC patients. In CD patients low BMI and nonsmoker status were positively associated with anemia. In both CD and UC, malabsorption syndrome, defined as failure of the GI tract to absorb 1 or more substances from the diet, was found to be significantly associated with anemia (6.2% and 3.8%, respectively) and current steroid use (40% CD, 52.7% UC). In CD patients with ileal (31.7% vs 20%) and colonic (29.9% vs 25%) disease location folate deficiency was significantly higher than in patients with ileocolonic CD or upper GI involvement. In CD patients, vitamin B12 deficiency was associated with the onset of stenosis and intestinal surgery (42.9% vs 32.8% and 46% vs 33% for patients with versus without B12 deficiency).

Conclusion

Our data indicate that due to frequent occurrence of deficiency states, regular monitoring and substitution of vitamins and iron are mandatory and may prevent long-term intestinal and extraintestinal complications in IBD patients.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: is routine screening and supplementation justified? [^115iAWiF]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus

Type 1 DM (T1DM) is an auto immune condition that results from auto immune destruction of insulin secreting beta cells of the pancreas. It is invariably associated with other organ and non organ specific auto immune and endocrine conditions leading to development of autoimmune polyglandular syndromes.

Pernicious anemia resulting from chronic autoimmune gastritis is highly frequent among patients with T1DM. Chronic autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia occurs in about 2% and up to 1% of the general population respectively. Among patients with T1DM, the prevalence is increased by 3 to 5 folds.

Vitamin B12 deficiency due to pernicious anemia occurs frequently among patients with T1DM. In one cross sectional study done in South India among 90 patients with T1DM, low vitamin B12 levels were noted among 45.5% of the study subjects as defined by the manufactures' cut off point of < 180 pg/ml and among 54% using the published cut off point of < 200 pg/ml. No positive correlation was noted between low vitamin B12 levels and gender, age, duration of DM and level of glycemic control.

Patients with T1DM actively exhibit auto antibodies to intrinsic factor (AIF) type 1 and 2 and parietal cell antibodies (PCA) especially those with glutamate decarboxylase-65 (GAD-65) antibodies and HLA-DQA1*0501-B1*0301 haplotype.

The PCA inhibit secretion of intrinsic factor resulting into pernicious anemia, a condition which is 10 times more prevalent among type 1 diabetic patients than non diabetic patients. Type 1 AIF result into vitamin B12 deficiency by blocking the binding of vitamin B12 to IF. This prevents its transportation to its absorption site, the terminal ileum. These auto antibodies are found in 70% of patients with pernicious anemia.

Primary autoimmune hypothyroidism and celiac disease are frequent co morbidities among patients with T1DM and directly affect vitamin B12 metabolism. In one cross sectional study among 504 ambulatory T1DM patients in South Africa, the overall prevalence of co-existing auto immune hypothyroidism was 20.2%, especially among female patients (30.9% Vs 10.1%-males, p < 0.0002). Celiac disease in this study cohort was reported in 3 (0.6%) patients.

### Dependency on host vitamin B12 has shaped Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex evolution [^113n9yLs]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In another context, our present-day society is composed by specific populations affected by deficits in B12. In developing countries, deficiency is much more common, starting in early life and persisting across the life span. In developed countries, B12 deficits affect predominantly to the elderly due to food-bound B12 malabsortion, to pregnant women, and to vegans and vegetarians improperly supplemented with B12. It is important to remark that veganism/vegetarianism does not necessarily involve a serum B12 deficit. Even if some studies linked the vegetarianism with a higher incidence of TB, these studies do not report the B12 status of the patients. Accordingly, we cannot exclude B12-independent factors linked to vegetal diets that modulate the TB status in humans.

Our study establishes a direct connection between the optimal B12 serum levels and the virulence of M. tuberculosis, which in other words might be translated to lower bacterial virulence in B12 anemic conditions. Since our results come from an animal model, it might be debated that they are challenging to translate into humans. However, we endorse the applicability to humans based on two main arguments. On the one hand, unlike other phenotypes (i.e. immunology, pathogenesis) which are multifactorial, and/or depend on the specific genetic background of the host; the B12 deficiency in our model constitute a single factor (differential B12 serum levels), which closely mimic the human scenario. On the other hand, historic evidence after a post-mortem examination of > 16.000 autopsies suggests that active TB is profoundly reduced in the context of pernicious anemia. Complementarily, more recent observations indicates a slight increase in the risk of developing TB during the first year of treatment for pernicious anemia. This antagonistic association between anemia and TB has been previously documented for other infectious diseases. A classic example is the protection afforded by sickle cell disease against malaria. Another example is the correlation between higher B12 serum concentration and rising bacterial loads in patients with lepromatous leprosy caused by M. leprae. It is key to remember that M. leprae is an obligate intracellular pathogen that has experienced a genome downsizing relative to M. tuberculosis, and consequently, B12 endogenous production is expected to be abrogated in this pathogen.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to patients on metformin, BSH 2014 guidelines recommend to consider initiating oral cobalamin 50 mcg for 1 month in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency on metformin therapy. Consider obtaining subsequent monitoring of serum cobalamin after 6 months and then at yearly intervals.

### Addressing the gaps in the vitamin B12 deficiency 2024 NICE guidelines: highlighting the need for better recognition, diagnosis, and management of pernicious anaemia [^115g1XBY]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

In one sense, this statement is correct: the term 'pernicious anaemia', when taken literally, implies a severe, life-threatening form of anaemia, which is uncommon in modern practice due to improvements in testing and treatment, such severe manifestations are typically prevented, as the condition is more likely to be diagnosed earlier or treated with B 12. However, changing the name overlooks the broader clinical context of PA, which is not just an issue of anaemia but rather a condition characterised by the autoimmune-mediated destruction of parietal cells leading to IF deficiency and lifelong B 12 malabsorption. Three other points warrant mentioning. First, there is also a separate autoimmune-mediated attack on IF that will lead to PA. Second, not all AIG diagnoses translate to PA. PA occurs in only about 15–20% of AIG patients, highlighting the inaccuracy of using AIG as a substitute for PA. The life-course of PA development has not been studied, but there is sufficient information to highlight that the timelines are highly varied among patients. For instance, some individuals may develop PA as early as 1 year after the onset of AIG, while others may not progress to PA until 15 or more years after AIG onset. Thus, whilst PA is acknowledged as a consequence of AIG, conflating the two terms risks oversimplifying the disease process and ignoring the clinical specificity of PA as an advanced manifestation. Third, over 50% of individuals with symptomatic B deficiency test negative for IF or parietal cell auto-antibodies, and the true prevalence of AIG in the UK is not known, as individuals with B deficiency rarely undergo endoscopy.

Introduction

B12 deficiency anemia due to intrinsic factor deficiency, also known as pernicious anemia, is characterized by impaired B12 uptake caused by lack of intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein produced by epithelial cells of the stomach lining. Intrinsic factor normally binds B12 and facilitates absorption in the intestinal tract. Pernicious anemia is often caused by autoimmune damage to the stomach lining (autoimmune gastritis) in which case the gastric epithelial lining is damaged or destroyed. The prevalence of pernicious anemia is around 0.1% in populations of European ancestry; however, it is more common in older people (~2% in > 60 year olds), and believed to be less prevalent in Asian populations. Symptoms of pernicious anemia range from fatigue to megaloblastic anemia and neurological abnormalities (peripheral numbness, paresthesia, and ataxia) in more serious cases.

Pernicious anemia is a complex disease with familial clustering, with a clear autoimmune basis and higher incidence of other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid conditions, vitiligo, and type 1 diabetesin both patients with pernicious anemia and their relatives. Previous studies have identified genetic variants affecting vitamin B12 levels in the general populationor associated with gastric parietal cell autoantibody positivity in type 1 diabetes patients, but it is not known whether these associate with pernicious anemia as well. Although studies focusing on HLA serotypes have been conducted for pernicious anemia, the results have been conflictingand currently there is no clear consensus on the HLA alleles or other genetic risk factors predisposing to pernicious anemia.

Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of vitamin B12 deficiency due to lack of intrinsic factor to evaluate the contribution of genetic variation to the etiology of this disease in a combined dataset of 2166 cases and 659,516 controls from three large population based biobanks — Estonian Biobank (EstBB), UK Biobank (UKBB), and FinnGen study. Our analyses identify five genome-wide significant signals, thus providing evidence for robust associations between pernicious anemia and genetic risk factors.

Diagnosing PA: the commonest non-nutritional cause of vitamin B deficiency

Given how NICE guidelines are used in practice, we find that the guidelines lack specific advice on the clinical scenarios in which practitioners should suspect AIG and PA. While they recommend considering an anti-intrinsic factor autoantibody test if AIG is suspected, the guidelines do not adequately explain why general practitioners should suspect an autoimmune basis beyond typical gastrointestinal symptoms. The presentation of AIG is highly variable, and looking only for gastrointestinal symptoms is insufficient as these present only in the later stages or not at all in most patients. Intrinsic factor auto-antibodies (IF-Ab) perform poorly as a stand-alone diagnostic marker for PA. Although they are highly specific, they have low sensitivity and present in less than 50% of PA patients. The guidelines acknowledge that a negative IF-Ab test does not rule out AIG or PA, and they suggest additional investigations when clinical suspicion remains. They further state that these should include anti-gastric parietal cell antibody (PC-Ab) tests, gastrin level measurements, CobaSorb tests, or gastroscopy with gastric body biopsy. However, despite their high sensitivity, PC-Ab has poor specificity and is present in other autoimmune conditions (e.g. autoimmune thyroid diseases) and, more generally, in approximately 10% of the general population. However, the uncertainty with this is whether it presents a pre-vitamin B12 deficiency or PA, where individuals are not yet symptomatic or are symptomatic but have a serum B12 value within the normal reference ranges. Therefore, a positiveresult will not definitively indicate PA or AIG. Additionally, PC-Ab might test positive in cases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-related chronic superficial gastritis, further complicating its diagnostic utility.

### Vitamin B deficiency from the perspective of a practicing hematologist [^111vEHnE]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

B 12 deficiency is the leading cause of megaloblastic anemia, and although more common in the elderly, can occur at any age. Clinical disease caused by B 12 deficiency usually connotes severe deficiency, resulting from a failure of the gastric or ileal phase of physiological B 12 absorption, best exemplified by the autoimmune disease pernicious anemia. There are many other causes of B 12 deficiency, which range from severe to mild. Mild deficiency usually results from failure to render food B 12 bioavailable or from dietary inadequacy. Although rarely resulting in megaloblastic anemia, mild deficiency may be associated with neurocognitive and other consequences. B 12 deficiency is best diagnosed using a combination of tests because none alone is completely reliable. The features of B 12 deficiency are variable and may be atypical. Timely diagnosis is important, and treatment is gratifying. Failure to diagnose B 12 deficiency can have dire consequences, usually neurological. This review is written from the perspective of a practicing hematologist.

### Long-term metformin use and vitamin B12 deficiency in the diabetes prevention program outcomes study [^111UhRAv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur with metformin treatment, but few studies have assessed risk with long-term use.

Objective

To assess the risk of B12 deficiency with metformin use in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)/DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS).

Design

Secondary analysis from the DPP/DPPOS. Participants were assigned to the placebo group (PLA) (n = 1082) or the metformin group (MET) (n = 1073) for 3.2 years; subjects in the metformin group received open-label metformin for an additional 9 years.

Setting

Twenty-seven study centers in the United States.

Patients

DPP eligibility criteria were: elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and overweight/obesity. The analytic population comprised participants with available stored samples. B12 levels were assessed at 5 years (n = 857, n = 858) and 13 years (n = 756, n = 764) in PLA and MET, respectively.

Intervention

Metformin 850 mg twice daily vs placebo (DPP), and open-label metformin in the metformin group (DPPOS).

Main Outcome Measures

B12 deficiency, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy.

Results

Low B12 (≤ 203 pg/mL) occurred more often in MET than PLA at 5 years (4.3 vs 2.3%; p = 0.02) but not at 13 years (7.4 vs 5.4%; p = 0.12). Combined low and borderline-low B12 (≤ 298 pg/mL) was more common in MET at 5 years (19.1 vs 9.5%; P < .01) and 13 years (20.3 vs 15.6%; p = 0.02). Years of metformin use were associated with increased risk of B12 deficiency (odds ratio, B12 deficiency/year metformin use, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.20). Anemia prevalence was higher in MET, but did not differ by B12 status. Neuropathy prevalence was higher in MET with low B12 levels.

Conclusions

Long-term use of metformin in DPPOS was associated with biochemical B12 deficiency and anemia. Routine testing of vitamin B12 levels in metformin-treated patients should be considered.

Risk Factors for Folate Deficiency

Low folate levels usually occur in the context of a restricted diet, bariatric surgery, or malabsorption. Increased cell turnover such as pregnancy, severe eczema, chronic hemolysis, or exfoliative skin disease can contribute as well. Folate losses can occur with chronic hemodialysis or external biliary drainage.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiency

Evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency often occurs simultaneously. A complete evaluation for deficiency would evaluate vitamin B12, folate, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine levels. Anti-intrinsic factor and anti-parietal cell antibodies should be considered to evaluate for pernicious anemia. Patients on chronic dialysis should have RBC folate levels evaluated rather than serum folate. Homocysteine levels are increased in both folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies however MMA is only elevated in B12 deficiency. Of note, although elevated homocysteine is associated with increased thrombosis, folic acid supplementation has not been showed to reduce the risk of such events.

A vitamin B12 value < 200pg/ml is indicative of deficiency. Vitamin B12 levels 200–300pg/ml and folate levels between 2–4ng/mL are considered borderline and may warrant further investigation. Vitamin B12 levels may be normal in those with nitrous oxide overuse as the underlying etiology is inactivation rather than deficiency. However homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels will be elevated.

Vitamin B12 repletion should factor the underlying cause and severity of symptoms. Intramuscular route is preferred in patients with malabsorption or severe hematologic or neurologic symptoms. Initial dose can range from 1000mcg of intramuscular cyanocobalamin one to three times a week for 4 weeks or once daily for the first week followed by once a week doses for 4 weeks. Once symptoms improve, patients can be maintained on intramuscular preparation of 1000mcg once a month. Oral supplementation of 1000mcg can be used in those with milder symptoms and an intact gastrointestinal tract. A supratherapeutic oral dose has been used to promote passive absorption, bypassing the active transport mediated by intrinsic factor, in those with malabsorption who are unable to take intramuscular injections.

Folate repletion can start at 1 to 5mg a day until anemia improves followed by maintenance dose of 400mcg if the reason for deficiency persists. Vitamin B12 levels should be closely monitored as prolonged high dose folic acid supplementation may improve anemia but worsen an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to neurologic damage.

GI surgery

36. IDA is common following resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel, including bariatric surgery (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

37. In new presentations of IDA, we recommend that a history of GI or bariatric surgery should not preclude a search for other causes of IDA (evidence quality — low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel generally predisposes to IDA. This includes the expanding population with a history of bariatric surgery, including sleeve gastrectomy. Reduced nutritional intake and malabsorption are probably the major underlying mechanisms, and therefore IDA in this situation may occur in the context of other nutritional deficiencies — in particular of vitamin B12.

The prevalence of IDA depends on the specific diagnostic criteria employed, but it is found in approximately a quarter of subjects 2 years following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and is markedly commoner in women, and in those with preoperative evidence of low iron stores. The figure for sleeve gastrectomy is probably lower.

Predictably, the yield of other causative lesions on BDE is lower in individuals with IDA and a history of GI surgery than in those without. Nevertheless, it is unsafe to automatically attribute IDA to previous surgery without excluding other possibilities, particularly in those at risk of underlying GI malignancy — bearing in mind that partial gastrectomy may predispose to the later development of cancer in the gastric remnant.

Without supplementation, the percentage prevalence of IDA tends to increase over the first 10 postoperative years. Long-term oral IRT is often effective, though because of underlying malabsorption this is not always the case, and intravenous therapy may be required.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114U29bo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

ACD represents the second major cause of anemia in IBD. Although its pathophysiology remains complex, three core mechanisms have been identified which jointly culminate in ACD: 1) iron redistribution out of the serum due to increased hepcidin levels, including retention in macrophages and monocytes (blurring the differentiation between ID and ACD, see above); 2) deficient maturation and proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells; and 3) a reduced erythrocyte lifespan. Additionally, several cytokines that are overexpressed in chronic diseases, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1 or interferon (IFN)-γ, further contribute to this process. In 1987, Roodmann et al were the first to report that TNF-α inhibits erythropoiesis. It is now known that TNF-α not only directly inhibits erythropoiesis, but also indirectly impairs this process by downregulation of erythropoietin. Likewise, hepcidin and IL-1 are also capable of reducing the concentration of erythropoietin. Additionally, IFN-γ further drives the development of anemia by inhibiting erythroid colony growth, shortening the lifespan of erythrocytes via increased turnover in the spleen, and increasing apoptosis mediated by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis in erythroid progenitor cells.

Aside from ID and ACD, anemia in IBD patients can result from impaired vitamin B12 and folic acid absorption. Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency is found in up to 33% and 29%, respectively, of patients with CD. Reasons include dietary restrictions, as well as impairment of ileal absorption (typically through a combination of ileal inflammation, bacterial overgrowth and/or surgical resection, leading to reduced vitamin B12 and folic acid absorption). In UC, vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency is less common but can occur in up to 16% and 8.6%, respectively. Possible causes include ileal dysfunction following proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, bacterial overgrowth and reduced intestinal transit time.

Finally, anemia can also occur as a side effect of IBD therapeutics. While toxicity of thiopurines towards the bone marrow is widely recognized and appears in approximately 3% of cases per patient/year of treatment, anemia has also been found to be related to sulfasalazine therapy through reduced folate absorption and aplasia or hemolysis, although this is rarely reported.
