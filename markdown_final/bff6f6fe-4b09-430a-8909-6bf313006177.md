## Question

And what are the symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about what symptoms are, how they differ from signs, how symptoms are measured, and how they are used in diagnosis and care, with examples across conditions and special contexts like long COVID and symptom-based disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational definition and the symptom–sign distinction. Then, I should verify the core characteristics that make symptoms clinically useful. Next, I will examine how symptoms are assessed and measured, including patient-reported outcomes. After that, I should review how symptoms inform diagnosis and differential diagnosis, including pitfalls and overdiagnosis. Finally, I will consider condition-specific examples, special populations, and synthesize a practical framework for clinical use.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't gloss over basics: a symptom is a manifestation of disease apparent to the patient, subjective and not directly observable by others, whereas a sign is objective evidence perceived by the clinician on examination or testing. This distinction is classic and still operative in contemporary practice and research frameworks.

> Wait, let me verify the core characteristics that make symptoms clinically meaningful: they are inherently subjective and require self-report, they vary in severity and quality, they have a temporal pattern (onset, duration, episodicity), they often co-occur in clusters rather than appearing in isolation, and they frequently carry prognostic weight. For example, dyspnea is not only common but also a potent predictor of outcomes, and many patients present with multiple concurrent symptoms that shape both diagnosis and prognosis [^115qXFxL] [^117AmvbA] [^113vGfCJ] [^113WucZF].

> I need to check how we actually assess symptoms in practice and research, because mismeasurement leads to misclassification. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are the gold standard for capturing symptoms, with validated instruments for specific constructs (symptom severity, functional limitations, health-related quality of life), and best practice emphasizes standardized, reliable, and responsive tools, repeated over time to track trajectories and minimize single-measure variability. Critically, when efficacy claims hinge on PROMs, blinded RCTs with appropriate controls are preferred to mitigate bias [^111EvEXC] [^113fo4v7] [^112AWAS9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis. I should confirm how symptoms feed diagnostic reasoning. In many conditions, symptoms are the primary data: history and physical examination contribute the bulk of diagnostic information, and in symptom-based disorders like IBS, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndromes, diagnoses rely on symptom clusters and exclusion of alternative causes. However, I need to ensure we avoid premature closure — overlapping symptom constellations, comorbid psychiatric contributors, and the risk of overdiagnosis mean clinicians should use probabilistic, differential approaches and resist labeling non-specific aggregates as new diseases without validation [^113vGfCJ] [^115PVfkn] [^111io4UK] [^115zNkMi] [^1168263v] [^116eveK4].

> Let me consider concrete examples to anchor this. In COPD, chronic dyspnea and cough with sputum are characteristic, yet symptoms correlate only weakly with airflow obstruction, so formal symptom scales like mMRC are required for staging and risk prediction. In asthma, symptom control instruments guide management. In cancer, standardized PROs capture fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, and cognitive effects to evaluate treatment benefit. In unexplained chronic cough, duration-based classification and validated severity tools guide evaluation and follow-up. In fibromyalgia, widespread pain with fatigue, sleep, and cognitive symptoms is typical, and patient-reported approaches support diagnosis and monitoring [^116v1E3B] [^113fqscE] [^11416wbX] [^112rDovM] [^11552WaB] [^112ZPprw].

> But wait, what if the symptom context is evolving and controversial? Long COVID illustrates both the centrality of symptoms and the challenges of specificity: WHO defines post-COVID condition by new symptoms persisting ≥ 2 months after infection that are not better explained by alternatives, yet case definitions remain heterogeneous and some symptoms lack specificity; operationalized checklists and research protocols now standardize onset windows, persistence, and core domains (cognitive, psychiatric, systemic/general) to improve comparability, while acknowledging that a single symptom can meet screening criteria and that biomarkers are still lacking [^114jpqvX] [^1118RNX6] [^111vDA9n] [^112ztkhq] [^117V7FP1].

> I should double-check special populations and settings where symptom assessment is uniquely challenging. In mechanically ventilated patients, symptoms are often under-recognized; patient-centered, dynamic assessment using self-report whenever possible is recommended, presuming common symptoms unless assessed absent; in children with progressive, non-curable conditions, parent–clinician discrepancies in symptom reporting are common, underscoring the need for structured, multi-informant tools; in primary care, a substantial fraction of symptoms lack a clear disease explanation, so prognosis-based, patient-centered care and careful avoidance of unnecessary testing are key [^1135Jb78] [^115XfQ8t] [^113vGfCJ] [^116vsX8x].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic pitfalls so I don't overstate certainty. Associative diagnostic heuristics can mislead when common diseases present atypically or when multiple conditions coexist; causal reasoning and counterfactual diagnostic models better approximate clinician thinking and may outperform purely correlational algorithms; similarly, in symptom-based disorders, emerging evidence for pathogenic autoantibodies suggests mechanistic subtypes, but I should be cautious not to overgeneralize until validated across populations and linked to treatment response [^111XnzX9] [^1137dAtL] [^11147djB].

> Next, I should review how to translate this into a practical clinical framework. First, elicit a complete symptom inventory with attention to onset, duration, episodicity, severity, and quality. Second, screen for red flags and high-risk constellations that warrant urgent evaluation. Third, use validated PROMs to quantify burden and track change. Fourth, apply duration-based classifications where relevant (e.g., acute, subacute, chronic cough). Fifth, consider comorbid psychiatric and contextual factors that amplify symptom experience. Sixth, communicate prognosis transparently and avoid premature diagnostic labeling when evidence is limited. Finally, align treatment with the patient's most bothersome symptoms and functional goals, revisiting the working diagnosis as new information emerges [^111TB45w] [^113vGfCJ] [^116DbdWp] [^115PVfkn].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis preserves the core message: symptoms are subjective patient experiences that drive care-seeking, diagnosis, and outcomes. They are best captured by PROMs, interpreted in temporal and biopsychosocial context, and used within probabilistic diagnostic reasoning that acknowledges uncertainty, avoids overdiagnosis, and remains responsive to evolving evidence and patient priorities [^111EvEXC] [^113vGfCJ] [^116eveK4].

Symptoms are **patient-reported experiences** of illness — such as pain, fatigue, cough, or nausea — that cannot be directly observed by others. They are **distinct from signs**, which are objective findings detected by clinicians (e.g. fever, rash, abnormal labs). Symptoms are the primary reason patients seek care and guide diagnosis, management, and follow-up [^113vGfCJ]; their severity and impact are best assessed with validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) [^111EvEXC] [^113fo4v7]. Because symptoms are subjective, clinicians must interpret them in clinical context, consider comorbidities, and use appropriate tools to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment [^111XnzX9] [^116eveK4].

---

## Definition and distinction from signs

A symptom is a **subjective experience** reported by the patient, such as pain, fatigue, or nausea [^112JjBgc] [^116YhTQn]. In contrast, a sign is an **objective finding** detected by the clinician, such as fever, rash, or abnormal laboratory results [^112JjBgc]. This distinction is fundamental to clinical practice, as symptoms guide initial clinical impressions and diagnostic pathways, whereas signs provide objective evidence to confirm or refute diagnostic hypotheses [^116QekKV] [^112JjBgc].

---

## Common symptoms across medical conditions

Symptoms vary widely across medical conditions, but certain symptoms are **commonly reported** across multiple diseases:

- **Pain**: Common in conditions such as osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer [^111xRodn] [^111io4UK].
- **Fatigue**: Frequently reported in chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and cancer [^115zNkMi] [^116PmEdf].
- **Dyspnea**: Characteristic of respiratory conditions such as COPD, asthma, and interstitial lung disease [^116v1E3B] [^111Yskpe] [^1132rvcM].
- **Cough**: Common in respiratory infections, chronic bronchitis, and asthma [^116g381C].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Frequently associated with gastrointestinal disorders, chemotherapy, and pregnancy [^notfound].

---

## Symptom assessment and measurement

Accurate symptom assessment is critical for diagnosis, management, and monitoring treatment response. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are **standardized tools** that capture the patient's perspective on symptom severity and impact on daily functioning [^111EvEXC]. PROMs are increasingly used in clinical practice and research to ensure patient-centered care and to evaluate treatment effectiveness [^111EvEXC].

---

## Challenges in symptom evaluation

Symptom evaluation presents several challenges, including:

- **Subjectivity**: Symptoms are inherently subjective, making accurate assessment reliant on patient communication and clinician interpretation [^112JjBgc].
- **Variability**: Symptoms can fluctuate over time, complicating assessment and management [^113vGfCJ].
- **Overlap**: Multiple conditions can present with similar symptoms, necessitating careful differential diagnosis [^1172H5kQ].
- **Psychosocial factors**: Psychological and social factors can influence symptom perception and reporting, requiring holistic assessment approaches [^1135Jb78].

---

## Clinical implications of symptoms

Symptoms have significant **clinical implications**:

- **Diagnosis**: Symptoms guide initial diagnostic impressions and inform the selection of diagnostic tests and imaging studies [^111XnzX9].
- **Management**: Symptom severity and impact influence treatment decisions, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions [^115PVfkn].
- **Prognosis**: Certain symptoms, such as dyspnea, are strong predictors of clinical outcomes and mortality risk [^117AmvbA].
- **Patient-centered care**: Understanding and addressing symptoms is essential for improving patient satisfaction, adherence, and quality of life [^11416wbX].

---

## Examples of symptom-based diagnoses

Several medical conditions are diagnosed primarily based on symptom clusters, including:

| **Condition** | **Primary symptoms** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) | - Abdominal pain <br/> - Bloating <br/> - Altered bowel habits | Symptom-based criteria (Rome criteria) [^115PVfkn] [^111Ky4zL] |
| Fibromyalgia | - Widespread pain <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Sleep disturbances | Symptom-based criteria [^1158amVz] |
| Chronic fatigue syndrome | - Persistent fatigue <br/> - Cognitive impairment <br/> - Post-exertional malaise | Symptom-based criteria [^notfound] |
| Functional gastrointestinal disorders | - Nausea <br/> - Bloating <br/> - Abdominal discomfort | Symptom-based criteria [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

Symptoms are **subjective experiences** reported by patients and are distinct from objective signs. They are central to clinical practice, guiding diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Accurate symptom assessment using validated tools and consideration of psychosocial factors are essential for effective patient-centered care [^111EvEXC].

### Post-COVID-19 condition symptoms among emergency department patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114jpqvX]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a staggering toll on global health with over 775 million documented infections. Millions of survivors have reported persistent or recurring symptoms that are debilitating. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined this condition as the Post-COVID-19 Condition (PCC), also known as Long COVID. The WHO defines PCC as a condition that "occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months, that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis". Based on conservative prevalence estimates, more than 77 million individuals could be living with PCC worldwide. Preliminary data show that people with PCC may have increased use of primary care, hospital admissions, and mortality in the months post infection. Unfortunately, the true assessment of the burden of PCC is still inaccurate because its definition and diagnostic criteria are difficult to operationalize. Currently, PCC is challenging to distinguish from other physical and mental health conditions. The WHO listed 50 symptoms associated with PCC including dyspnea, post-exertional malaise (PEM), anosmia, and cough among others. Yet, many of these symptoms could occur due to comorbidity or other viral infections. Furthermore, in 2024, fewer people are seeking or being offered diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 now that the virus is less virulent and endemic –. As a result, people who were never tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection may develop WHO PCC criteria without ever being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2.

### Somatic symptom disorder [^112JGQnS]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on somatic symptom disorder:

- **Definition**: Somatic symptom disorder, previously known as somatization disorder, is a mental health disorder characterized by multiple unexplained complaints.
- **Pathophysiology**: Somatic symptom disorder is a somatoform disorder that overlaps with a number of functional somatic syndromes and has high comorbidity with major depression and anxiety disorders.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is estimated at 6,000 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Symptoms include bodily complaints, such as pain in different locations of the body, from fatigue, or from perceived disturbances of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or other organ functions.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Somatic symptom disorder causes long-term disability in several patients, affecting QoL and work participation.

### Pain symptoms in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a literature review [^117Cr1XY]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Due to the high incidence of pain, it can be used as a symptom identified in the course of COVID-19, reminding people with pain to be vigilant and help doctors diagnose as soon as possible. In addition, it also presents important challenge to clinicians' diagnosis when treating patients with COVID-19 having mild symptoms. Considering the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the pain symptoms of COVID-19 should be systematically summarized. At present, no reviews of pain symptoms for these patients with COVID-19 have been done. This review aimed to elaborate the pain symptoms of patients with COVID-19 based on published data.

Symptoms and mMRC dyspnea scale — because there is only a weak correlation between the severity of airflow obstruction and the symptoms experienced by the patient or the impairment of their health status, formal assessment of symptoms using validated questionnaires is required; the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale was the first questionnaire developed to measure breathlessness, and the mMRC score relates well to other multidimensional health status measures and predicts future mortality risk.

### Improving the accuracy of medical diagnosis with causal machine learning [^1137dAtL]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Providing accurate and accessible diagnoses is a fundamental challenge for global healthcare systems. In the US alone an estimated 5% of outpatients receive the wrong diagnosis every year. These errors are particularly common when diagnosing patients with serious medical conditions, with an estimated 20% of these patients being misdiagnosed at the level of primary careand one in three of these misdiagnoses resulting in serious patient harm.

In recent years, artificial intelligence and machine learning have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex problems in diverse domains –. In particular, machine learning assisted diagnosis promises to revolutionise healthcare by leveraging abundant patient data to provide precise and personalised diagnoses –. Despite significant research efforts and renewed commercial interest, diagnostic algorithms have struggled to achieve the accuracy of doctors in differential diagnosis –, where there are multiple possible causes of a patients symptoms.

This raises the question, why do existing approaches struggle with differential diagnosis? All existing diagnostic algorithms, including Bayesian model-based and Deep Learning approaches, rely on associative inference — they identify diseases based on how correlated they are with a patients symptoms and medical history. This is in contrast to how doctors perform diagnosis, selecting the diseases which offer the best causal explanations for the patients symptoms. As noted by Pearl, associative inference is the simplest in a hierarchy of possible inference schemes –. Counterfactual inference sits at the top of this hierarchy, and allows one to ascribe causal explanations to data. Here, we argue that diagnosis is fundamentally a counterfactual inference task. We show that failure to disentangle correlation from causation places strong constraints on the accuracy of associative diagnostic algorithms, sometimes resulting in sub-optimal or dangerous diagnoses. To resolve this, we present a causal definition of diagnosis that is closer to the decision making of clinicians, and derive counterfactual diagnostic algorithms to validate this approach.

The commonest gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in advanced cancer are reviewed with reference to definition, pathophysiology, etiology, prevalence, severity, and management. Observation or reporting of such symptoms must lead to consideration of the multi-faceted pathophysiology. Careful assessment and an analytical detailed approach are the keystones of effective management.

### Prevalence of clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities at diagnosis of acromegaly: a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines [^112tprGD]. Pituitary (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first systematic review reporting on the prevalence of clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities at time of diagnosis of acromegaly. Acromegaly is a chronic multisystemic condition, leading to a wide variety of possible symptoms and complaints. While pathognomic symptoms are lacking, the outline of a disease specific presentation that should raise suspicion of acromegaly is of importance. Due to the current diagnostic delay, a lot of symptoms and clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities can already be present at time of diagnosis. During (physical) examination, changes in physical appearance (acral enlargement, typical facial and oral features) combined with complaints of skin changes (thicker and oilier skin, hyperhidrosis) and seem to be most disease specific. More general complaints of headache, fatigue, snoring, voice changes (hoarseness, voice deepening), arthralgia, and depression can also be found. The rate of comorbidities before treatment of acromegaly is high, mainly comprising common conditions such as hypertension, thyroid disorder and polyps of the digestive tract, while the presence of left ventricle hypertrophy, fatty liver disease, (pre)diabetes and sleep apnea were typical and more specific for acromegaly. Noteworthy, clinical presentation regarding cardiovascular comorbidities (left ventricle hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, hypertension and dyslipidemia) substantially improved over the years when comparing old versus recent studies. Carpal tunnel syndrome, colorectal and papillary thyroid carcinoma were not common, but have a higher frequency in acromegaly than in the general population.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^116ycKh2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

### Symptoms of COVID-19… [^113zDD4b]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- People with COVID-19 have a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
- Symptoms may appear 2–14 days after exposure to the virus.
- Symptoms may start as mild, and some people will progress to more severe symptoms. Signs and Symptoms The following list does not include all possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new COVID-19 variants and can vary depending on vaccination status. Possible symptoms include:

- Fever or chills
- Cough
- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
- Sore throat
- Congestion or runny nose
- New loss of taste or smell
- Fatigue
- Muscle or body aches
- Headache
- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Feeling Sick. Stay home and away from others if you have symptoms that aren't better explained by another cause.

Seek health care promptly for testing and/or treatment if you have risk factors for severe illness; treatment may help lower your risk of severe illness. When to seek emergency help Look for emergency warning signs for COVID 19:
- Trouble breathing
- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
- New confusion
- Inability to wake or stay awake
- Depending on skin tone, lips, nail beds and skin may appear pale, gray, or blue. If someone is showing any of these signs, call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility. Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. This list does not include all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. Difference between flu and COVID-19 Influenza and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses.

COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, and flu is caused by infection with one of the influenza viruses. You cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same.

### A taxonomy of early diagnosis research to guide study design and funding prioritisation [^116QekKV]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

How does the diagnostic process begin? (Prodromal feature studies)

Prodromal features are characteristics that are observed in the as-yet-undiagnosed population at a greater rate than in controls who remain disease-free. Many studies consider prodromal symptoms, but there are other possible prodromal features such as abnormal test results. Analyses of large samples of electronic health records have enabled formal identification and quantification of these early signs and symptoms in recent years, alongside their positive predictive values for cancer.

The main strength of prodromal feature studies is that known prodromal features can be used to guide the diagnostic process, for example in helping to decide whether specialist investigations or referrals are needed. There are several examples of studies estimating the predictive value of symptoms and tests supporting clinical practice guidelines.

A limitation of these studies is the variability in the length of the period during which features associated with the diagnosis are observed. Some of this variation may be appropriate as different features are likely to be predictive over different periods of time, however much literature in the field of cancer early diagnosis research uses 1- or 2-year periods a priori without justification. Formal evidence from diagnostic window studies can be useful in determining risk periods of appropriate length for studies of early signs and symptoms, particularly for conditions characterised by vague or non-specific symptoms. A new approach uses time-to-event analysis to explore how the association of a feature with diagnosis of a condition changes over time.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^113gmuYk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^11552WaB]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Subacute cough in adults — The updated management algorithm includes the suggestions that history should be sought for hemoptysis or other potential life-threatening symptoms and, if present, should be immediately addressed and evaluated; a validated cough severity or quality of life tool be routinely used to assess the outcome of therapy; environmental and occupational exposures be considered and addressed if present; and patients be routinely followed up in the clinic or by telephone within 4 to 6 weeks after the initial evaluation. If cough persists, a follow-up appointment should be arranged.

### Operationalisation of post-COVID condition case definition in a comprehensive research protocol [^117V7FP1]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We created a checklist that includes the most prevalent co‐occurring features reported in PCC, which have emerged from a systematic review as well as from clinical experience. This checklist is designed to assess whether each symptom is present and whether its timeframe of onset and persistence fulfils WHO criteria, to assess for plausible association with primary SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Based on checklist assessment, we also provided a criterion to define possible PCC cases. Other possibly relevant symptoms, whose association with PCC is less clear or established, were reported in a checklist (supplementary appendix — Data S1) for further phenotyping only (not for PCC case definition). Finally, considering target population characteristics, the most frequently reported symptoms, and reported alterations in cognitive/psychiatric domains, we devised a comprehensive protocol for cognitive, psychiatric and general symptom evaluation.

### Signs and symptoms of stroke… [^1151hVK2]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms By knowing the signs and symptoms of stroke, you can take quick action and perhaps save a life — maybe even your own. What are the signs of stroke in men and women.
- Sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body.
- Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech.
- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes.
- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination.
- Sudden severe headache with no known cause. Call 9–1–1 right away if you or someone else has any of these symptoms. When to seek emergency help Act F. A. S. T. to identify stroke Act F. A. S. T. to help stroke patients get the treatments they need. The stroke treatments that work best are available only if the stroke is recognized and diagnosed within 3 hours of the first symptoms. Stroke patients may not be eligible for these treatments if they don't arrive at the hospital in time.

If you think someone may be having a stroke, act F. A. S. T. and do the following test: F — Face: Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop. A — Arms: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward. S — Speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is the speech slurred or strange. T — Time: If you see any of these signs, call 9–1–1 right away. Note the time when any symptoms first appear. This information helps health care providers determine the best treatment. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call 9–1–1 for an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. What should I do to treat a transient ischemic attack. If your stroke symptoms go away after a few minutes, you may have had a transient ischemic attack, also sometimes called a "mini-stroke.

" Although brief, a TIA is a sign of a serious condition that will not go away without medical help. Unfortunately, because TIAs clear up, many people ignore them. But paying attention to a TIA can save your life. If you think you or someone you know has had a TIA, tell a health care team about the symptoms right away.

### Do the symptom-based, Rome criteria of irritable bowel syndrome lead to better diagnosis and treatment outcomes? The con argument [^114FFJ5M]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Some claim that symptom-based Rome criteria are diagnostic and enhance clinical practice and choice of therapy for patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. This overview focuses on lower gastrointestinal symptoms: constipation, diarrhea, pain and bloating. The main con arguments for using such criteria for diagnosis are: insufficient specificity, overlap of symptom-based categories or disorders, insufficient and therefore non-specific characterization of pain in the criteria, inability to differentiate the "mimics" of IBS-C and IBS-D, and inability to optimize treatment for IBS-M or bloating in the absence of objective measurements. While doctors may not land in trouble using "symptom diagnosis" of IBS, this should not deter them from optimizing diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^112YffQa]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical aspects of degenerative spine disease and reporting

The role of imaging is to provide accurate morphological information and influence therapeutic decision-making. The presence of degenerative change is not itself an indicator of symptoms. In the majority of cases, when patients with degenerative spine diseases are referred for imaging, clinicians are looking for answers to two simple questions: what is the cause of the patient's pain or neurological symptoms, and what treatment option should be primarily considered in this particular situation? Therefore, these imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical condition. In the majority of cases, even in advanced cases of degenerative spine disease with multilevel involvement, it is possible to identify one leading cause of the patient's problem or to provide a list of potential choices or culprits so that the referring physician can select the right answer based on the presentation, clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient.

### Disease, diagnosis or syndrome? [^1168263v]. Practical Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The advance of medical semantics is, in general, towards causation. As knowledge increases, the common consequence is the re-definition of disease. This starts with symptoms then a disorder of structure or function, abnormalities of images, genetics or biochemistry, the ultimate aim being a specific aetiological mechanism which replaces broader descriptions. But medical terminology of diseases, diagnoses and syndromes is inherently imprecise. Careless nomenclature causes confused dialogue and communication. Symptoms of uncertain cause are commonly lumped together and given a new 'diagnostic' label which also may confuse and produce false concepts that stultify further thought and research. Such medicalisation of non-specific aggregations of symptoms should be avoided. The defining characteristics of diseases and diagnoses should be validated and agreed. The pragmatic diagnoses of 'symptom of unknown cause' or 'non-disease' are preferable to falsely labelling patients with obscure or non-existent diseases. "I tried to unveil the stillness of existence through a counteracting murmur of words, and, above all, I confused things with their names: that is belief". Jean-Paul Sartre (The Words, 1964).

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115E3BJv]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — adult cough classification and management suggestions state: For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that acute cough be defined as being < 3 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that subacute cough be defined as being between 3 and 8 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of cough, we suggest that chronic cough be defined as being > 8 weeks in duration (Grade 2C). For adult patients seeking medical care complaining of cough, we suggest that estimating the duration of cough is the first step in narrowing the list of potential diagnoses (Grade 2C). For adult patients around the globe complaining of cough, we suggest that the cough be managed using evidence-based guidelines that are based upon duration of cough (Grade 2C).

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — diagnosis of menopause: We suggest diagnosing menopause based on the clinical criteria of the menstrual cycle. If establishing a diagnosis of menopause is necessary for patient management in women having undergone a hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or presenting with a menstrual history that is inadequate to ascertain menopausal status, we suggest making a presumptive diagnosis of menopause based on the presence of VMS and, when indicated, laboratory testing that includes replicate measures of FSH and serum estradiol. Table 1 summarizes other etiologies of secondary amenorrhea to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Post-acute and long-COVID-19 symptoms in patients with mild diseases: a systematic review [^112rdCSE]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

In the recent literature, a distinction is made between post-acute COVID-19 and chronic COVID-19 (i.e. long-COVID). Post-acute COVID-19 is described as symptoms extending beyond three weeks from initial symptoms and long-COVID is described as symptoms extending beyond 12 weeks from initial symptoms. The distinction between post-acute and long-COVID is somewhat arbitrary, however, it is relevant to distinguish between the phases to better understand and research the consequences of COVID-19 on the short- and long-term.

At the moment, very little is known about persistent symptoms in patients after a mild COVID-19 infection (patients managed in an outpatient setting). A lot of attention is paid to patients with severe infections (patients managed in an inpatient setting). Sparse research has been done in the much larger group with mild COVID-19 infections. Most of these patients present themselves at the GP's office and are not referred to the hospital. More attention towards this group is highly needed. Firstly, because available data indicate that the majority of people with COVID-19 has a mild disease. Secondly, it is to be expected that — congruent with other infections — a certain part of these patients will experience persisting symptoms. Because of the high prevalence of mild COVID-19 infections this, could result in a considerable number of patients with persisting symptoms.

So, it is expected that GPs are increasingly confronted with a large group of patients with post-acute COVID-19 and long-COVID after a mild COVID-19 infection. Identifying the symptoms of post-acute COVID-19 and long-COVID is important for the management of those patients since these can have a major impact on daily functioning. Describing these persistent symptoms is also important for the development of knowledge about the natural course of a COVID-19 infection. So, we aimed to describe the symptoms immediately after the initial phase (i.e. symptoms persisting longer than 3 weeks; post-acute COVID-19) and the symptoms in the chronic phase (i.e. symptoms persisting longer than 3 months; long-COVID) to create an overview of the nature and frequency of symptoms experienced by patients with mild COVID-19 after the first 3 weeks.

### Pain as a disease: an overview [^115SCS4A]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The acknowledgment of pain as a pathologic entity in its own right remains debated. Notwithstanding the data showing the burden of pain as a disease, an ultimate recognition of the pathologic nature of this condition is lacking. In this study, we analyze the notion of pain as a disease through an historical overview of its several conceptualizations and report the main evidence supporting this notion. We believe that a clear definition of pain as a disease is necessary, especially considering the enormous global burden of this condition. Indeed, the recognition of pain as a definite pathologic state is crucial to raise awareness about this neglected global health problem and to promote the exploration of new specific therapeutic approaches.

Clinical presentation of COPD symptoms — Chronic dyspnea is the most characteristic symptom of COPD. Cough with sputum production is present in up to 30% of patients. These symptoms may vary from day-to-day and may precede the development of airflow obstruction by many years. Individuals, particularly those with COPD risk factors, presenting with these symptoms should be examined to search for the underlying cause(s). Airflow obstruction may also be present without chronic dyspnea and/or cough and sputum production and vice versa.

### Assessing and diagnosing fibromyalgia in the clinical setting [^1158amVz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common and disabling condition that may be difficult to assess and diagnose owing to its wide range of symptoms and common comorbidities. The most common symptoms of fibromyalgia include widespread pain over the whole body, pain at specific tender points, fatigue, memory and other cognitive problems, sleep and mood disturbances, and impaired functioning. Accurately diagnosing fibromyalgia may require diagnostic testing and physical examinations such as tender points examinations; however, patients with longstanding symptoms may be diagnosed according to a symptom-based fibromyalgia criteria checklist. This activity provides a sample assessment and diagnosis in a clinical situation.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^115qXFxL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — definition and assessment: Dyspnea is a perceptual symptom that must be self-reported and differentiated from observable signs. The statement emphasizes that "dyspnea per se can only be perceived by the person experiencing it", explains that "Perception entails conscious recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli and their meaning", and concludes, "Therefore, as is the case with pain, adequate assessment of dyspnea depends on self-report". It further clarifies, "Because dyspnea is a symptom (i.e., perception of an abnormal or distressing internal state), it must generally be distinguished from signs that clinicians typically invoke as evidence of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and intercostal retractions", and that "Distinctive sensory qualities are important in considering the physiological mechanisms underlying the breathing discomfort, but the definition of dyspnea should be neutral with respect to any particular quality".

### Charting the territory: symptoms and functional assessment in children with progressive, non-curable conditions [^115XfQ8t]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Children with progressive, non-curable genetic, metabolic, or neurological conditions require specialised care to enhance their quality of life. Prevention and relief of physical symptoms for these children needs to begin at diagnosis, yet, little is known about their patterns of symptoms and functional abilities.

Aim

To describe these children's symptoms, as well as how the children's condition affects them physically.

Design

Cross-sectional, baseline results from an observational, longitudinal study, Charting the Territory, that followed 275 children and their families.

Setting/Participants

Seven tertiary care children's hospitals in Canada, 2 in the USA. Families were eligible based on the child's condition. A total of 275 children from 258 families participated.

Results

The 3 most common symptoms in these children were pain, sleep problems, and feeding difficulties; on average, they had 3.2 symptoms of concern. There was a pattern of under-reporting of children's symptoms for clinicians compared with parents. Regardless of use of associated medications, pain, feeding and constipation symptoms were often frequent and distressing. Children with a G/J tube had a higher total number of symptoms, and respiratory problems, pain, feeding difficulties and constipation were more likely to occur. They also tended to have frequent and distressing symptoms, and to need extensive mobility modifications which, in turn, were associated with higher numbers of symptoms.

Conclusions

These children experience multiple symptoms that have been previously documented individually, but not collectively. Effective interventions are needed to reduce their symptom burden. Future longitudinal analyses will examine which disease-modifying interventions improve, or do not improve, symptom burden.

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^111qm5Tz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### Symptom prevalence of patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease: a systematic literature review [^117MwoBN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease have a wide range of diagnoses and prognoses. Many patients can live many years with their diagnosis and some are responsive to treatments. However, a subset of patients with Progressive Idiopathic Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Diseases (PIF-ILD) such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a short disease trajectory and a similar prognosis to people with lung cancer. The clinical manifestation of advanced fibrotic Non Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP) is similar to IPF. It is important to differentiate NSIP from IPF in the early stages when the disease is potentially responsive to therapy. However, when the disease is advanced and irreversible, this becomes less important and the focus should be on symptom control.

The United Kingdom (UK) End of life care strategy aimed to promote high quality care for all adults at the end of life. In addition, the British Thoracic and NICE idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis guidance emphasize the importance of a proactive approach in managing symptoms.

Recent qualitative work in this group has shown uncontrolled symptoms, for example, shortness of breath, cough and insomnia, which impact on every aspect of patients and carers lives. However, quantitative work assessing prevalence of symptoms is limited and there has been no systematic review of this literature. Synthesising the quantitative evidence for symptom prevalence for this group will add to previous qualitative work, raise awareness of these symptoms and focus clinical intervention.

### State of the science: the relevance of symptoms in cardiovascular disease and research: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116oH4MM]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of cardiovascular disease drive health care use and are a major contributor to quality of life. Symptoms are of fundamental significance not only to the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and appraisal of response to medical therapy but also directly to patients' daily lives. The primary purpose of this scientific statement is to present the state of the science and relevance of symptoms associated with cardiovascular disease. Symptoms as patient-reported outcomes are reviewed in terms of the genesis, manifestation, and similarities or differences between diagnoses. Specifically, symptoms associated with acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, valvular disorders, stroke, rhythm disorders, and peripheral vascular disease are reviewed. Secondary aims include (1) describing symptom measurement methods in research and application in clinical practice and (2) describing the importance of cardiovascular disease symptoms in terms of clinical events and other patient-reported outcomes as applicable.

### Measuring patient-reported outcomes: moving beyond misplaced common sense to hard science [^112AWAS9]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

What do PROMs measure?

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) is an umbrella term that covers a range of different types of outcome (see Table 1). Symptoms and functioning are clearly defined as impairments and disability in the International Classification of Impairment, Disability and Handicap. Disability is now referred to as activity. PROMs should not be confused with clinical rating scales, where a clinician completes a form to rate disease severity or treatment effects. The common link between PROMs is that they collect information directly from the patient without interpretation by clinicians or others. However, this does not imply that all PROMs measure issues that are of concern or importance to the patient.

Table 1
Types of patient-reported outcome measures a

a PRO, patient-reported outcome; HRQL, health-related quality of life; QoL, quality of life; b responses to the questionnaire are used to generate a perceived utility score.

Measures of symptoms, activity limitations, health status, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and quality of life (QoL) completed by patients are all examples of PROMs. More recently, PROMs have also been used in clinical trials to address issues of patient satisfaction, compliance with treatment and treatment preferences. Each of these outcomes represents a distinct measurement construct and these should not be confused. Indeed, the term 'PRO' was coined in about 2000 specifically to avoid the misuse of, and the confusion surrounding, the term 'quality of life'. It had been (and occasionally still is) common practice for instrument developers to refer to any PROM as a measure of QoL, even where it was clearly designed to address a different outcome construct.

To summarise, PROMs that assess symptoms (that is, impairment) or functional limitations (such as disability or activity limitations) address issues that are of primary interest to the clinician, as these are most indicative of disease severity. HRQL measures are made up of scales that assess symptoms and activity limitations. In contrast, QoL scales determine outcomes that are of primary concern to the patient. Severe impairment or functional limitations may well also be of concern to the patient, but only where these affect QoL. QoL scales should provide a holistic assessment of the impact of disease and its treatment on the patient.

### Operationalisation of post-COVID condition case definition in a comprehensive research protocol [^112ztkhq]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

We divided symptoms included in the checklist into three core domains: cognitive, psychiatric, and 'systemic/general' cores. For each symptom, the checklist requires that the symptom is a new‐onset symptom (i.e. it was not present before COVID‐19) and that it fulfils the WHO onset/persistence requirements, namely, (i) it began within 3 months from acute infection resolution (i.e. from the date of the first negative nasopharyngeal swab or, if not available, from the first positive nasopharyngeal swab) and (ii) it has persisted for at least 2 months after onset.

Any single symptom fulfilling all the above‐mentioned requirements is sufficient to suspect PCC. The presence of at least one symptom belonging to the cognitive or psychiatric cores is required to define PCC with cognitive/psychiatric involvement. The checklist is reported in Figure 1, while its supplementary appendix, containing other possibly relevant symptoms, is reported in the Supplementary Materials (eFigure 1 — Data S1, a printable version of the checklist is available in the Supplementary Materials ‐ Data S3). A web‐based publicly available version of the tool (codename: screen‐PCC) is available in the RedCap shared library.

FIGURE 1
Complete symptom checklist, along with instruction for administration. Questions are phrased in plain language and are intended for direct administration (also self‐administration if deemed appropriate). PCC, post‐COVID condition.

Within the European study, we devised a protocol for patient assessment that features cognitive, psychiatric and other relevant general symptom evaluation (as outlined in Figure 2). Cognitive assessment consists of a screening test (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Psychiatric symptom evaluation features self‐administered scales for mood disorders, anxiety, stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, quality of life, and disability. The battery also includes assessments of mental health and personality traits. General symptoms, such as fatigue and new‐onset headache, are also assessed and graded. A list of the instruments used for each area of evaluation and validation/normative studies for the general population is reported in Figure 2 and in the Supplementary Materials — Data S2.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) medical screening and referral — Medical screening incorporates the findings of the history and physical examination to determine whether the patient's symptoms originate from a condition that requires referral to another health care provider, and prior to diagnosing a person with PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical conditions. Clinicians should recognize the key signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for the presence of these conditions throughout treatment, and immediately initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, and medical conditions for which physical therapy is not indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a patient's symptoms.

### Pain as a disease: an overview [^111ZBKkM]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Today, it is recognized that persistent pain entails a pathologic reorganization of the neural system. This process can be due to several factors, such as a genetic predisposition,–central sensitization mechanisms, and many other factors, which are at the core of the study of the etiology of pathologic pain conditions. However, despite the progress in the understanding of the neuropathological changes associated with persistent pain, achieved especially thanks to the contribution of neuroimaging studies, two main questions remain open: 1) Do neuroimaging studies define chronic pain as a disease?–2) Is the definition of chronic pain as a brain disease useful, especially in the clinical practice?Cohen et al challenge the view of pain as a disease, by claiming that scientific findings showing pathologic changes associated with persistent pain are not sufficient to define pain as a disease. According to the authors, there are no "'characteristic' clinical features apart from the complaint of pain" which "constitute the 'disease' of pain" and the sole presence of pathologic symptoms is not enough to define pain as a disease which, on an explanatory ground, does not tell us a lot. However, beyond controversies on the definition of pain as a disease, we agree with the authors that the primary issue to be addressed in the debate is: how defining pain as a disease would improve our approach to this condition?

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^114JuqCX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic tests including signs and symptoms to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to present research questions and settings, in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

### Classification and diagnosis of patients with medically unexplained symptoms [^114MBibW]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) have little or no demonstrable disease explanation for the symptoms, and comorbid psychiatric disorders are frequent. Although common, costly, distressed, and often receiving ill-advised testing and treatments, most MUS patients go unrecognized, which precludes effective treatment. To enhance recognition, we present an emerging perspective that envisions a unitary classification for the entire spectrum of MUS where this diagnosis comprises severity, duration, and comorbidity. We then present a specific approach for making the diagnosis at each level of severity. Although our disease-based diagnosis system dictates excluding organic disease to diagnose MUS, much exclusion can occur clinically without recourse to laboratory or consultative evaluation because the majority of patients are mild. Only the less common, "difficult" patients with moderate and severe MUS require investigation to exclude organic diseases. By explicitly diagnosing and labeling all severity levels of MUS, we propose that this diagnostic approach cannot only facilitate effective treatment but also reduce the cost and morbidity from unnecessary interventions.

### Is intolerance of uncertainty a necessary condition for anxiety symptoms in adolescents? A necessary condition analysis study [^114yE4fK]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a well-established risk factor for anxiety disorders, as higher levels of IU increase the likelihood of future maladaptive outcomes. However, the presence of low levels of IU does not imply that maladaptive outcomes will not occur, as other risk factors can still lead to the onset of anxiety symptoms. Currently, it is unknown whether IU also serves as a necessary cause for anxiety symptoms, meaning that its absence would ensure the absence of these symptoms.

Methods

A sample of 186 adolescents (58.6% boys) between 14 and 18 years of age (M = 16.58 ± 1.01) was followed for six months, with evaluations every three months. Several self-reports were administered to measure IU and general anxiety problems, derived from the Youth Self Report 11–18, and anxiety-specific symptoms, derived from the Self-Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents. The Necessary Condition Analysis approach was applied to determine the extent to which IU is a necessary condition for anxiety.

Findings

The analyses revealed that IU is a necessary condition for anxiety problems (d = .23 -.24), generalized anxiety disorder symptoms (d = .18 -.19), social anxiety disorder symptoms (d = .19 -.29), and school-related anxiety symptoms (d = .19 -.23) after three and six months. However, IU was not a statistically significant necessary condition for separation anxiety disorder symptoms. At baseline, between 29% and 70% of the sample exhibited the necessary levels of IU to potentially experience subclinical anxiety symptoms at subsequent follow-ups.

Discussion

IU is a necessary condition for the potential development of anxiety symptoms during adolescence. Recognizing necessary conditions for anxiety symptoms and mental disorders, in general, could lead to substantial progress, given its impact on enhancing our theoretical understanding and improving prevention strategies and clinical treatments.

### New diagnosis in psychiatry: beyond heuristics [^116DbdWp]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the boundary between normality and mental ill-health is difficult to define, a decision to offer treatment or not must be made. Who decides? And on what basis? Is a diagnosis necessary or helpful? In addition to 'objective', yet arbitrary criteria, the person experiencing mental distress should have their say in when help can be expected and the diagnostic process. Clinicians and funders should acknowledge this. The assignment of a diagnosis is often equated with a 'need for care', though this is not necessarily the case (Lea & Hofmann). Because diagnoses may influence identity and human rights, the process should be explicitly discussed and negotiated with the patient (Lea & Hofmann). Need for care, as reflected in distress, risk, and/or functional impairment, typically precedes a traditional DSM or ICD diagnosis or 'macrophenotype'. Clinicians should explain the syndromal basis and meaning of a diagnosis, and that early in the illness neither fixed or clear-cut diagnoses nor prognoses cannot necessarily be provided. Working or provisional diagnoses may be more useful and flexible, and suffice as guides to treatment options, including the decision that no diagnosis and no treatment are necessary.

Not being assigned a diagnosis may be confusing, frustrating, and stressful, but equally, a lack of diagnosis may be reassuring as long as it does not deny care. During the early weeks of treatment, a 'working diagnosis', complemented by a personalized formulation, which includes unique personal and contextual features, can become a focus around which to build a therapeutic alliance. If the clinical presentation is initially subtle or complex but then evolves, both clinician and patient should see that it would have been problematic to prematurely offer a hard or fixed diagnosis. This approach also reduces confusion caused by abrupt changes in diagnostic terms used, and may reduce the need for later 'dediagnosis' (Lea & Hofmann). The evolution of clinical presentation is consistent with the known natural history of mental illness and is not 'failure' by the original clinical team. What these changes mean is presently unclear. Do they have a single illness with an evolving clinical picture or are they attracting additional layers of complexity or comorbid syndromes? Such changes indicate a need to rethink and recalibrate the pattern of care required.

### Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) as proof of treatment efficacy [^113fo4v7]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

PROMs provide evidence on the effect of interventions on patient symptoms and quality of life, but by the nature of being subjective, they are prone to bias. Blinded RCTs, preferably with a placebo control, are crucial if the evidence of efficacy is to be based on PROMs. Furthermore, collecting multiple PROMS over time as "progression trajectories" may help to overcome the single measure variability. Finally, PROMs should be used in conjunction with objective outcomes, especially when assessment by blinded clinicians or researchers is not possible.

### The biology of symptom-based disorders-time to act [^11147djB]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Symptom-based disorders are conditions that are characterised mostly by somatic symptoms rather than objectively identifiable signs. They are very common, including pain and fatigue disorders, functional gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders, and others, and they cause far greater disability than diseases where signs are prominent. Such conditions may sometimes be triggered by infection, as in Post Covid Syndrome (Cabral-Marques et al., 2022; Baiocchi et al., 2022) or physical or psychological trauma. By employing passive immunoglobulin transfer experimental approaches, recent research in several 'unexplained' chronic pain conditions has demonstrated that pathogenic IgG autoantibodies can explain several of these conditions' core symptoms and are ubiquitous in patients with severe phenotypes. The promise from placing positive resources into exploring the role of 'invisible', functional, non-inflammatory autoantibodies in symptom-based disorders across additional areas of Medicine includes patient empowerment and the development of new diagnostic tests and therapies.

### Symptom cluster research: conceptual, design, measurement, and analysis issues [^113WucZF]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

Cancer patients may experience multiple concurrent symptoms caused by the cancer, cancer treatment, or their combination. The complex relationships between and among symptoms, as well as the clinical antecedents and consequences, have not been well described. This paper examines the literature on cancer symptom clusters focusing on the conceptualization, design, measurement, and analytic issues. The investigation of symptom clustering is in an early stage of testing empirically whether the characteristics defined in the conceptual definition can be observed in cancer patients. Decisions related to study design include sample selection, the timing of symptom measures, and the characteristics of symptom interventions. For self-report symptom measures, decisions include symptom dimensions to evaluate, methods of scaling symptoms, and the time frame of responses. Analytic decisions may focus on the application of factor analysis, cluster analysis, and path models. Studying the complex symptoms of oncology patients will yield increased understanding of the patterns of association, interaction, and synergy of symptoms that produce specific clinical outcomes. It will also provide a scientific basis and new directions for clinical assessment and intervention.

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^111io4UK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

### Symptom assessment in cancer patients [^115hiDre]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with cancer suffer from a multitude of symptoms. Effective treatment strategies are available for a number of the common symptoms. A major reason for inadequate symptom relief is lack of effective symptom assessment. Accurate assessment of symptoms is necessary before any treatment can be undertaken. Although there are many complexities involved in the assessment of symptoms, simple, effective tools are available for identification and scoring of symptoms in clinical practice. This review describes recent advances in the study of symptom assessment in cancer patients. Several common symptoms are presented individually, followed by an overview of efforts addressing the assessment of multiple symptoms. Also, new tools in the evaluation of symptoms, including computer-based questionnaires, are discussed.

### Diagnosing respiratory long COVID: a practical approach [^112yWRb2]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID or a post-COVID condition, defined as the persistence of symptoms at least 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection, is a novel condition in which a definitive diagnostic marker and treatment have yet to be found. This condition, which has been estimated to impact > 65 million individuals worldwide, manifests with multisystem involvement, most commonly presenting with fatigue, brain fog, dyspnea, cough, or a combination thereof. The burden of these symptoms can range from mild to severe, with many patients reporting an inability to return to usual activities. Herein, we present several hypothetical but clinically representative case reports to allow discussion around how we approach the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms of long COVID in those with and without chronic lung disease.

### Post-COVID-19 condition symptoms among emergency department patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113o8GJt]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Symptoms of the Post-COVID-19 Condition are often non-specific making it a challenge to distinguish them from symptoms due to other medical conditions. In this study, we compare the proportion of emergency department patients who developed symptoms consistent with the World Health Organization's Post-COVID-19 Condition clinical case definition between those who tested positive for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 infection and time-matched patients who tested negative. Our results show that over one-third of emergency department patients with a proven acute infection meet Post-COVID-19 Condition criteria 3 months post-index visit. However, one in five test-negative patients who claim never having been infected also report symptoms consistent with Post-COVID-19 Condition highlighting the lack of specificity of the clinical case definition. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the acute phase of a suspected infection should continue until specific biomarkers of Post-COVID-19 Condition become available for diagnosis and treatment.

### When the chief complaint is (or should be) dyspnea in adults [^111Yskpe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Dyspnea, "a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", is an important and challenging complaint associated with a wide variety of adverse clinical outcomes, including hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac mortality. Although up to 85% of cases are caused by asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, or psychogenic disorders, a systematic approach can help to identity uncommon, but important, causes of dyspnea. In this review that includes clinical examples as well as a didactic review of currently available information, we suggest a step-wise approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with dyspnea. It is also important to avoid 3 possible pitfalls: accepting a cause for dyspnea in which the element identified is only part of a syndrome which includes that element; accepting a single cause for dyspnea when the cause is multifactorial; and failing to recognize a diagnosis and cause of dyspnea is incorrect and has been assumed without rigorous confirmation, when a patient with a specific diagnosis is referred for "failing to respond to treatment".

### Symptoms and risk factors for long COVID: a cross-sectional study in primary care [^113RGQry]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

A significant number of patients experience heterogeneous sequelae following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, commonly known as Long COVID. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the lasting effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) as a "condition that occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID‐19, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis". The WHO consensus definition also specifies that common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, but also others, and they may fluctuate or relapse over time.

The reported prevalence of Long COVID varies considerably. Differences in methods, population, and classification of cases (settings, severity, duration, number, and sets of symptoms) make it difficult to summarize the findings across studies. While the highest burden is among those patients with a history of mild to moderate COVID‐19 illness, the vast majority of studies following severe COVID‐19. Additionally, there is the paucity of evidence on Long COVID among nonhospitalized patients from low‐ and middle‐income countries and from primary care.

Timely diagnosis of prolonged health problems following acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is key for preventing chronic or life‐debilitating conditions. However, there is a debate about whether the list of possible symptoms reported in people who experienced Long COVID is too long to implement an effective diagnosis. Over 200 different symptoms have been identified as related to this illness, with some symptoms (e.g. fatigue, cognitive and mental dysfunction symptoms) being more frequent than others. To address the high heterogeneity of findings in Long COVID research, the Core Outcome Measurement in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative defined the core outcome set (COS), which was suggested to be measured and reported in studies of Long COVID. The authors noted that this minimum set of outcomes does not prohibit researchers from including other relevant outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to determine the occurrence and risk factors for persistent symptoms after mild to moderate SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in patients who were presented in primary care during the 2021 pandemic. To overcome the possible heterogeneity of self‐reported Long COVID symptoms, a cross‐sectional survey was conducted using a questionnaire with a set of eighteen validated clinical outcomes.

### Chronic fatigue: symptom and syndrome [^115zNkMi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue is common, is difficult to measure, can be associated with considerable morbidity, and is rarely a subject of controversy. The chronic fatigue syndrome also presents problems in definition and measurement, is associated with even more morbidity than chronic fatigue itself, and is often controversial. Particularly unclear is the way in which chronic fatigue and the chronic fatigue syndrome relate to each other: Is one the severe form of the other, or are they qualitatively and quantitatively different? We know that many things can cause chronic fatigue, and this is probably true for the chronic fatigue syndrome, too. We can anticipate that discrete causes of the chronic fatigue syndrome will be found in the future, even if these causes are unlikely to fall neatly along the physical-psychological divide that some expect. The causes of chronic fatigue are undoubtedly many, both in a population and in any individual person, even when a discrete cause, such as depression or cancer, is identified. Social, behavioral, and psychological variables are important in both chronic fatigue and the chronic fatigue syndrome. Interventions that address these general variables can be successful, and currently they are often more successful than interventions directed at specific causes.

### Symptom science in kidney disease [^111HKgaj]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Physical and emotional symptoms are highly prevalent among patients with kidney disease and are directly linked to impaired health-related quality of life. Symptom science is a field of research aimed at advancing knowledge of the holistic mechanisms driving symptoms, how best to assess symptoms accurately, and developing novel and patient-centered approaches to symptom management. Patients with kidney disease have identified symptom science as a top research priority, and opportunities abound for ongoing patient engagement in symptom-related research efforts and clinical care. This review describes the burden of symptoms experienced by patients with kidney disease, explores the spectrum of patient engagement in symptom care and research, and discusses approaches for symptom assessment and management, taking into consideration the multitude of factors that may contribute to symptoms.

### Operationalisation of post-COVID condition case definition in a comprehensive research protocol [^1118RNX6]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Post‐COVID‐19 condition (PCC) is a prevalent and high‐burden sequela of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Because of the complexity of its manifestations, PCC case definition currently lacks standardisation and reproducibility. We aimed to devise a simple screening tool to boost reproducibility and comparability of PCC case definition across PCC studies, and to provide a framework in which to reliably identify suspected PCC cases. We also developed a comprehensive assessment protocol based on the most frequently reported PCC characteristics.

Methods

Within a European multi‐centre study and based on the conclusions of a previous systematic review, we devised a checklist to assess the presence of PCC‐associated symptoms and their temporal relationship with COVID‐19.

Results

The checklist was developed to include three symptom cores (cognitive, psychiatric, and general). For each symptom, onset is assessed within 3 months after COVID‐19 resolution and persistence for at least 2 months. Any symptom fulfilling this criterion is sufficient to prompt suspicion of PCC. At least one symptom is required in the cognitive or psychiatric domains to suspect PCC with neuropsychiatric involvement. Our protocol features an extensive neuropsychological evaluation and self‐administered scales for mood, anxiety, stress‐related symptoms, sleep disorders, quality of life, disability, mental health, and personality traits; scales for quantitative assessment of fatigue and headache are also included.

Conclusions

Consistent identification of PCC cases is crucial to correctly include patients in research and clinical studies. We propose a simple, reproducible, and flexible screening tool and a proposal for a comprehensive assessment that could be employed to enhance standardisation and comparability.

### Somatic symptom disorders without known physical causes: one disease with many names? [^115DL4kH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients complaining of pain or fatigue in the absence of known physical diseases constitute a high percentage of those seeking general medical care. Depending upon the type of physician/specialist consulted, those individuals may receive disease labels that range from an implied psychological origin such as somatoform or psychosomatic disease, or to a presumed physical disease such as fibromyalgia. Although all these conditions are regularly associated with fatigue, we have provided a new label suggesting another disease category, "systemic exertion intolerance disease", which replaces the previous "chronic fatigue syndrome". All these conditions have common, overlapping features that usually consist of both fatigue and pain, and, in the absence of definitive objective confirmation, might be best classified under one heading such as somatic symptom disorder. Management of these disorders is challenging, but suggestions for proper identification and treatment are presented.

### Operationalisation of post-COVID condition case definition in a comprehensive research protocol [^115ge2UX]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

To operationalise the case definition that emerged from our systematic review on PCC, we developed a tool to screen suspected PCC cases that integrates an evidence‐based symptom checklist and the assessment of the temporal relationship with primary infection, as suggested by NICE and the WHO. We wanted to make this tool sufficiently simple and rapid to administer in order to boost its adoption and enhance administration reliability.

We believe a shared definition, rooted in evidence, may enhance not only comparability across studies but also the reliability of case definition itself. This, in turn, increases the chances of study success, as it facilitates reliable and reproducible discrimination between PCC cases and non‐PCC controls.

Since PCC comprises several non‐specific symptoms, and because the biological relationship with COVID‐19 has still to be demonstrated for most of these, we decided to propose a broad sensitive criterion (a single symptom is sufficient to classify the participant as a PCC case) that is mainly intended to raise PCC suspicion (without providing any degree of certainty to the diagnosis). This is crucial because, at this time, we cannot distinguish symptoms that are likely to be underpinned by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection from manifestations that are possibly associated with intervening and/or pre‐existing psychosocial factors. For these same reasons, it is important to have a screening tool that is not only useful for raising suspicion of PCC diagnosis but has also been devised to collect data to further stratify our patients in the future. Accordingly, our screening tool is built with flexibility in mind, as symptoms may be added or removed from the checklist based on evidence that may become available in the future. Indeed, we have already provided a checklist appendix to score symptoms whose relevance to the syndrome is still to be reliably and consecutively assessed.

### Patient-reported outcome measure development and validation: a primer for clinicians [^111EvEXC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

A comprehensive definition of health includes the assessment of patient experiences of a disease and its treatment. These patient experiences are best captured by standardized patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments. A PRO is reported directly by the patient (or caregiver) and provides the patient's perspective into how a disease and its treatment impact their lives. PRO instruments are typically standardized, validated questionnaires with items that are scaled and can be combined to represent an underlying health-related construct such as physical, social, and role functioning, psychological well-being, symptoms, pain, and quality of life. Over the past few decades, PROs have become increasingly used in clinical trials as endpoints to better understand treatment benefits from the patient's perspective and in clinical practice to identify unmet needs of patients, health risk surveillance, and monitor outcomes of care. In this paper, we describe the process for developing standardized PRO instruments, from conceptual model development through instrument validation.

### Prevalence of symptoms ≤ 12 months after acute illness, by COVID-19 testing status among adults-United States, December 2020-March 2023 [^1159JdNL]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective, multicenter study of 1,296 persons with acute COVID-like illness, approximately 16% of participants reported persistent symptoms 12 months after their illness, irrespective of their SARS-CoV-2 test result status at baseline. A higher proportion of COVID test–positive than COVID test–negative participants reported symptoms in each symptom category at baseline. The prevalence of symptoms declined substantially in both groups from baseline to the 3-month follow-up assessment and continued to gradually decrease at the 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up assessments; persistence of any symptom prevalence at 12 months was not statistically significantly different between the COVID test–positive (18.3%) and COVID test–negative (16.1%) participant groups.

These findings expand the understanding of post-COVID conditions. Previous studies have reported symptom prevalence estimates across varied, nonstandardized periods or at a single point in time, resulting in challenges comparing studies and difficulty distinguishing among the presence of reported persistent symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, those that resolved and then reemerged, and those that emerged after initial recovery. Few previous longitudinal studies have compared symptoms in COVID test–positive participants with those in persons with a COVID-like illness and who received negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. By conducting serial measurements of emerging and ongoing symptoms, this study was able to ascertain that participants who were symptomatic at a given time point included participants with ongoing symptoms as well as those with emerging symptoms (i.e. symptoms that were not present 3 months earlier). The inclusion of participants with COVID-like illness and negative test results guides discussions on characterizing symptoms associated with post-COVID conditions. This differentiation adds nuance and clarity to the natural history of post-COVID conditions and characterizes the fluctuating nature of symptoms over time and recognizes that these symptoms are not unique to COVID-19 or to post-COVID conditions. Many participants experienced new symptoms ≥ 6 months after the acute illness, suggesting that the prevalence of emerging symptoms in the months after acute COVID-like illness might be considerable. Cognitive difficulties and extreme fatigue were two common symptoms that emerged after 6 months and are often reported to occur with post-COVID conditions. Differentiating between symptoms that resolve and emerge over time helps to characterize post-COVID conditions and suggests that measurements at single time points underestimate or mischaracterize the true effects of disease.

### Assessing the symptoms of cancer using patient-reported outcomes (ASCPRO): searching for standards [^112rDovM]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2006 draft guidance on "Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims" has engendered wide discussion about patient-reported outcome (PRO) domains that should be endpoints in clinical trials. Reducing the severity and impact of symptoms is a natural intervention endpoint for cancer, a condition associated with considerable symptom burden. Because symptoms are best described by patients who have them, including PROs as measures of treatment effectiveness or the differences among treatments provides essential information about the efficacy and toxicity of a treatment and its effects on function. The FDA guidance provides a framework for addressing such issues as clinical significance, study design, and statistical methods as they relate to applications for labeling claims; however, no set of recommended approaches for assessing specific symptoms by patient report in clinical trials exists, other than for pain. Accordingly, an interdisciplinary workgroup, Assessing the Symptoms of Cancer using Patient-Reported Outcomes (ASCPRO), has been formed to generate evidence-based recommendations for the assessment of patient-reported cancer-related symptoms and the use of that information to facilitate clinical research and decision making. ASCPRO is among the first working groups to focus primarily on nonpain symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, depression, cognitive impairment, and shortness of breath. ASCPRO members are stakeholders in optimal symptom assessment, including patient advocates, academics, clinicians, those who pay for symptom control and monitor quality of care, and those who produce products that palliate cancer-related symptoms but that may also engender treatment-related symptoms.

### Are multiple physical symptoms a poor prognostic factor or just a marker of depression severity? Secondary analysis of the genPod trial [^114TkLjF]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

6 Conclusions

Multiple baseline physical symptoms appear to predict poor response to antidepressants, but not after adjustment for depression severity. Multiple physical symptoms may represent severe depression rather than a poor prognostic factor. Clinicians should ask about mood symptoms and explore psychosocial issues in patients with multiple physical symptoms. If considering a diagnosis of depression in someone with multiple physical symptoms, clinicians should treat it as a moderate to severe depression. This is essential in order to avoid inappropriate investigation and treatment of physical symptoms, which could lead to iatrogenic harm. Reboxetine does not confer any advantage over citalopram in this group, and it is less well tolerated. Since there is no evidence that physical symptoms are a moderator of treatment in patients with multiple physical symptoms when a clinician chooses an antidepressant they should take account of the side effect profile, rather than depend on physical symptoms.

Introduction

Post-COVID conditions, or long COVID, comprise a range of symptoms that persist or develop ≥ 4 weeks after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, and which are associated with substantial morbidity and reduced quality of life. Estimates of prevalence vary across settings, periods, and patient populations; and many studies lack comparison groups. Symptom trajectory over time using serial measurements has received little attention. Symptoms might either persist or emerge, and previous prevalence estimates typically include both persisting and emerging symptoms, without distinguishing between them.

### Symptom prevalence of patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease: a systematic literature review [^1132rvcM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Those affected by advanced fibrotic interstitial lung diseases have limited treatment options and in the terminal stages, the focus of care is on symptom management. However, quantitatively, little is known about symptom prevalence. We aimed to determine the prevalence of symptoms in Progressive Idiopathic Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease (PIF-ILD).

Methods

Searches on eight electronic databases including MEDLINE for clinical studies between 1966 and 2015 where the target population was adults with PIF-ILD and for whom the prevalence of symptoms had been calculated.

Results

A total of 4086 titles were screened for eligibility criteria; 23 studies were included for analysis. The highest prevalence was that for breathlessness (54–98%) and cough (59–100%) followed by heartburn (25–65%) and depression (10–49%). The heterogeneity of studies limited their comparability, but many of the symptoms present in patients with other end-stage disease were also seen in PIF-ILD.

Conclusions

This is the first quantitative review of symptoms in people with Progressive Idiopathic Fibrotic Interstitial Lung Diseases. Symptoms are common, often multiple and have a comparable prevalence to those experienced in other advanced diseases. Quantification of these data provides valuable information to inform the allocation of resources.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^116vsX8x]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that prognosis can now provide the framework in which clinicians and researchers organise evidence and information to support decisions about management. This extends calls for a risk-centred approach to many syndromes and chronic conditions and parallels proposals that public health should be organised around achievable outcomes rather than disease categories. Such a framework shifts the focus of clinical practice to improving outcomes for patients in their total biological, psychological, and social environment and away from an exclusive and narrow focus on underlying disease as the determinant of outcome.

Although biomedical diagnosis is often a crucial driver of treatment selection, especially in acute life-threatening illness such as infection and trauma, diagnostic labelling and subgrouping for many ill people is about providing prognostic information to support decisions about targeted individual long-term care. A broader prognostic framework could integrate such information with evidence about other pathophysiological, psychological, behavioural, and environmental factors that affect patient outcomes, to avoid overdiagnosis and support doctors and their patients in probability-based decision-making in clinical practice.

Prognosis is not a panacea for all the problems we have discussed in relation to diagnosis, and there must be continuing debate about the benefits, value, limits, harms, and costs of medicalization and medical care. However, because prognostic classification incorporates a much wider range of information than diagnosis and disease factors alone, and because such information is expanding rapidly in volume and availability, prognosis can provide a realistic, practical, and useful framework for clinical and public health practice.

### Stirring the POTS: finding symptom patterns in long COVID [^116GGR7M]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of long COVID

The prevalence of Long COVID varies widely depending on definitions and measurement methods. Some studies have suggested that 40% to 50% of individuals may experience persistent symptoms lasting more than 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine defines Long COVID is an infection-associated chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months as a continuous, relapsing and remitting, or progressive disease state that affects one or more organ systems, which notably using the term "disease state" rather than "syndrome". This deliberate choice reflects an effort to underscore the legitimacy and seriousness of the condition and to counteract the phenomenon of "medical gaslighting", wherein patients' symptoms are downplayed or dismissed due to their vague or poorly understood nature. Additionally, there are 2 particularly notable aspects of this new definition. First, a diagnosis of Long COVID can be made based solely on clinical course, without requiring documentation of prior infection. This reflects the realities of the pandemic — limited testing capacity early on, variable test sensitivity, and a decrease in testing rates in the later phases. Second, the definition is explicitly designed to be dynamic, with the expectation that it will evolve as further evidence emerges. This underlines the importance of continuous data collection from diverse clinical and patient-reported sources.

- **Pathophysiology**: Constipation is caused by pelvic floor dysfunction, slow colonic transit, metabolic disorders (hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism), medications (opiates, CCBs, antipsychotics), neurological disorders (diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury), IBS, and primary colonic disorders (strictures, cancer, anal fissure, proctitis).
- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of constipation in the US is 16%.
- **Disease course**: Anomalous regulation of neuromuscular components within the colon and anorectum, and disruption in the corresponding ascending and descending pathways in the brain-gut axis result in infrequent bowel movements, excessive straining, a sense of incomplete evacuation, failed or lengthy attempts to defecate, digital manipulation to evacuate stools, abdominal bloating, and hard consistency of stools.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic constipation decreases QoL and ability to function; however, only approximately 25% of patients consult physicians or use medications to manage associated symptoms.

### Clinical assessment of asthma symptom control: review of current assessment instruments [^11416wbX]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Health care providers are increasingly shifting asthma management from treating acute attacks to achieving symptom control to return patients to full functioning and improve their quality of life. Assessment instruments have been developed that quantify asthma patients' symptom control and quality of life. Several instruments are described in this review in terms of domains, psychometric qualities, ease of use, and ability to accurately reflect patients' overall condition. Problems with applicability and feasibility have limited the use of currently available instruments mainly to research settings or sporadic use in selected practices, generally leaving clinicians without the potential benefits of such tools to aid their routine clinical management of patients.

### Presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis: evidence from a cross-sectional, population-based study [^1112maUS]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Furthermore, evaluation of the effect of single and multiple symptoms separately indicates that the presence of multiple symptoms is a poor predictor of stage IV disease. The nature of the symptom appears to be more important than the number of reported symptoms. This observation is reassuring, given that public health education campaigns typically do not focus on symptom combinations.

Symptom awareness and appraisal by patients and doctors is an important determinant of timely presentation and investigation, but the optimal design of early diagnosis interventions aimed at earlier recognition of possible cancer symptoms by members of the public and health-care professionals remains unclear. Alongside considerations such as cancer site incidence, psychosocial barriers to presentation, and the predictive value of symptoms, evidence about the associations between presenting symptoms and stage at diagnosis can help to guide the design of early diagnosis interventions. Our findings provide support for such interventions, and counter concerns that they simply expedite the detection of advanced-stage disease.

JAMA. 1968; 206: 1063–1065. doi: 10.1001/jama.1968.03150050051011 Most physicians, if asked to distinguish between signs and symptoms, would reply in a fashion something like this: A symptom is a manifestation of disease apparent to the patient himself, while a sign is a manifestation of disease that the physician perceives. The sign is objective evidence of disease; a symptom, subjective. Symptoms represent the complaints of the patient, and if severe, they drive him to the doctor's office. If not severe, they may come to light only after suitable questions. The patient perceives, for example, subjective pains and discomforts, or disturbances of function, or some simple appearance. But the physician, as a skilled observer, can discern what the patient cannot.

### Diagnostic reasoning in challenging cases [^111XnzX9]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning relies on cognitive heuristics to recognise patterns of symptoms and signs in order to arrive at a diagnosis. These rules of thumb allow us to rapidly diagnose common conditions that present in typical ways. However, they may lead us astray when common conditions present atypically or when a patient has a rare condition or multiple conditions causing their constellation of symptoms, signs, and test results, rather than having a single diagnosis to explain them all. This article describes strategies to help counteract diagnostic pitfalls, to expand diagnostic possibilities and to make diagnostic progress with complex, multielement cases.

### Endometriosis: diagnosis and management [^115UeYbU]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2010). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for endometriosis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, SOGC 2010 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- symptoms of endometriosis may vary, but certain hallmark symptoms may be more likely to suggest endometriosis; recognize the atypical presentations

- endometriosis can be a chronic, relapsing disorder, which may necessitate a long-term follow-up

- adolescent patients with endometriosis are more likely than adult patients to present with acyclic pain

- physical examination of adolescent patients with endometriosis will rarely reveal abnormalities, as most will have early-stage disease

- endometriosis in adolescent patients is often early-stage and atypical.

### Diagnosis and management of IBS [^115PVfkn]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

IBS is a common gastrointestinal condition characterized by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits. IBS is considered a functional bowel disorder (that is, not defined by structural or biochemical abnormalities) and is diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Limited and judicious use of diagnostic testing is recommended, particularly in patients with typical symptoms of IBS without alarm signs and symptoms. Management of IBS is based on a multifactorial approach and includes establishment of an effective patient-provider relationship, education, reassurance, dietary alterations, pharmacotherapy, behavioral and psychological treatment. Patient-centered care is recommended, in which management is focused on the patient's most bothersome and impactful symptoms, their preferences and previous experiences with treatment, and addressing factors associated with the onset and exacerbation of symptoms. Pharmacotherapy is typically targeted against the predominant symptom. This Review discusses the current evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of IBS. An improved understanding of the recommended diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IBS will lead to greater patient satisfaction, as well as reduced health-care costs.

### Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome [^111Ky4zL]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Because there are no reliable biological or laboratory markers associated with the condition, the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome(IBS) is based on patient descriptions of common symptoms such as abdominal pain accompanied by changes in stool form or frequency and associated symptoms such as bloating and distension. With the development and refinement of symptom-based criteria for the diagnosis of IBS, the traditional need for a negative diagnostic evaluation has been questioned. This article evaluates the diagnostic characteristics of various symptom-based criteria in routine clinical practice and reviews the data regarding the yield of the multiple commonly used diagnostic tests in patients with suspected IBS.

### Studying symptoms: sampling and measurement issues [^1139kQ6b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, but the specific causes and treatments of many common symptoms are frequently not well established. Because clinical research has primarily targeted specific diseases, symptoms-based research is still an emerging field of scientific inquiry, and optimal methods are still being developed. This paper considers eight important issues in sampling and measurement. First, recognition of the exceptionally high base rates of many symptoms is an essential primary step in selecting appropriate case-patients and controls. Second, the type of population studied (community, primary care clinic, subspecialty clinic, or symptom clinic) can greatly influence the severity and other characteristics of the symptom being evaluated. Third, symptom detection relies on three types of symptoms: documented, elicited, and volunteered. Fourth, temporal factors include recency of onset, episodicity, and duration. Fifth, severity can be assessed with single- or multiple-item symptom-specific scales as well as evaluation of generic functional status and health-related quality-of- life measures. Sixth, recognition of a symptom's cause can be strengthened by explicit criteria, uniform assessment protocols, and multiple raters. Seventh, comorbidity that should be assessed includes medical disorders, psychiatric disorders, and other symptoms. And eighth, since death and serious illness are uncommon, alternative outcomes that might be measured include symptom alleviation, health-related quality of life, patient and provider satisfaction, and health care costs.

### Broadening risk factor or disease definition as a driver for overdiagnosis: a narrative review [^116eveK4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

After discussing the impact of overdiagnosis and overtreatment in numerous contexts, it becomes clear that we need a paradigm shift in how diseases are defined. What could be done to address this problem?

Undoubtedly, the first step would be estimating the overdiagnosis dimension across common conditions and the respective harm and waste. Research on tests and treatments should aim to better identify treatment thresholds where benefits are likely to outweigh harms and consider most medical conditions as a spectrum of severity rather than simple dichotomous identities. For example, when assessing a new diagnostic test, there should be an evaluation of its capacity of detecting clinically meaningful abnormalities, rather than only its sensitivity and specificity and predicted values. The same applies to treatment, where the approach should focus, wherever possible, on meaningful outcomes that matter to people rather than a blind improvement on real or surrogate markers.

### Post-COVID-19 symptoms and conditions among children and adolescents-United States, March 1, 2020-January 31, 2022 [^114pmoL2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Post–COVID-19 (post-COVID) symptoms and conditions * are new, recurring, or ongoing health problems that occur 4 or more weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Previous studies have characterized and estimated the incidence of post-COVID conditions among adults, but data among children and adolescents are limited. Using a large medical claims database, CDC assessed nine potential post-COVID signs and symptoms (symptoms) and 15 potential post-COVID conditions among 781,419 U.S. children and adolescents aged 0–17 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (patients with COVID-19) compared with 2,344,257 U.S. children and adolescents without recognized COVID-19 (patients without COVID-19) during March 1, 2020–January 31, 2022. The analysis identified several symptoms and conditions with elevated adjusted hazard ratios among patients with COVID-19 (compared with those without). The highest hazard ratios were recorded for acute pulmonary embolism (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99), venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32), and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this study population. Conversely, symptoms and conditions that were most common in this study population had lower aHRs (near or below 1.0). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely than were patients without to experience respiratory signs and symptoms, symptoms of mental conditions, muscle disorders, neurological conditions, anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood disorders, and sleeping disorders. COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligible children and adolescents, are critical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent illness, including post-COVID symptoms and conditions.

### Operationalisation of post-COVID condition case definition in a comprehensive research protocol [^111vDA9n]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) is a prevalent and high-burden sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of the complexity of its manifestations, PCC case definition currently lacks standardisation and reproducibility. We aimed to devise a simple screening tool to boost reproducibility and comparability of PCC case definition across PCC studies, and to provide a framework in which to reliably identify suspected PCC cases. We also developed a comprehensive assessment protocol based on the most frequently reported PCC characteristics.

Methods

Within a European multi-centre study and based on the conclusions of a previous systematic review, we devised a checklist to assess the presence of PCC-associated symptoms and their temporal relationship with COVID-19.

Results

The checklist was developed to include three symptom cores (cognitive, psychiatric, and general). For each symptom, onset is assessed within 3months after COVID-19 resolution and persistence for at least 2months. Any symptom fulfilling this criterion is sufficient to prompt suspicion of PCC. At least one symptom is required in the cognitive or psychiatric domains to suspect PCC with neuropsychiatric involvement. Our protocol features an extensive neuropsychological evaluation and self-administered scales for mood, anxiety, stress-related symptoms, sleep disorders, quality of life, disability, mental health, and personality traits; scales for quantitative assessment of fatigue and headache are also included.

Conclusions

Consistent identification of PCC cases is crucial to correctly include patients in research and clinical studies. We propose a simple, reproducible, and flexible screening tool and a proposal for a comprehensive assessment that could be employed to enhance standardisation and comparability.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: a narrative review [^113vGfCJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without "normalizing" the symptom.
