## Question

how depression affects global functioning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how depression affects global functioning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and whether functional impairment is integral to the diagnosis. Then, I should quantify the magnitude of disability at a population level. Next, I will delineate which domains of functioning are most affected and why. After that, I need to examine mechanisms, including symptoms, cognition, and comorbidity. I will then assess persistence of deficits after symptom remission, identify moderators, review treatment effects on functioning, and finally address measurement challenges and clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm definitions and the core relationship. Major depressive disorder is defined by mood and behavioral changes with associated cognitive alterations and requires that symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment, so impairment is both definitional and a key outcome that clinicians should aim to restore to normal functioning, not merely reduce symptoms [^114DNCbX].

> I should quantify the magnitude next, but wait, let me verify the burden estimates and cost figures to avoid misattribution. Depression is a leading global cause of disability, with WHO analyses placing it among the top drivers of disease burden, and US economic costs have been estimated above $83 billion; I initially noted the reference as 1f4f5f38, but hold on, I should correct that citation to 1f4f5e38 to ensure accuracy [^114YGujM] [^111oRGx7].

> Now, I will delineate specific domains of functional impact. Let me think about occupational, social, family, daily living, and cognitive roles; evidence shows broad decrements in work productivity, social participation, and family role performance, with measurable deficits in activities of daily living in older adults and robust associations between even subsyndromal depressive symptoms and lower global functioning, highlighting that cognitive deficits in executive function, attention, memory, and processing speed contribute directly to disability [^117MjtiT] [^1153k4cQ] [^117CcpzN] [^111cWpUQ] [^113CaffX].

> I need to check mechanisms linking symptoms to functioning. Direct effects of core depressive symptoms such as anhedonia, fatigue, and psychomotor change constrain capacity, while both objective neuropsychological impairment and perceived cognitive difficulties independently predict disability; but wait, I should verify the role of negative cognitive bias and the contribution of accelerated accumulation of chronic diseases, which further compounds functional decline, especially in late life [^114YGujM] [^111cWpUQ] [^1135mi1U] [^117NtYJA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about recovery just because mood improves. Functional improvement often lags behind symptomatic response, and cognitive deficits can persist in remission; I should double-check that residual functional impairment increases relapse risk and that symptom-based remission thresholds may be too lenient if our goal is normalization of functioning, with data suggesting a HAM-D cutoff of 5 better aligns with normal social and occupational function than 7 [^116U3jpU] [^114kYzbH] [^115BzP1v].

> Next, I should review moderating factors determining the degree of disability. Greater symptom severity, suicidality, and anhedonia predict worse functioning; let me also consider demographic and contextual factors, as female sex, older age, lower education, unemployment, and stressful life events are linked to poorer functional outcomes, and comorbid medical illness and treatment resistance further worsen disability, necessitating individualized plans that account for these modifiers [^117MjtiT] [^115SkDob] [^116CMxb6] [^1137zVc3].

> I will now examine treatment effects on functioning, but I need to ensure I distinguish symptom versus functional trajectories. Antidepressants and psychotherapies improve functioning, though functional gains often trail symptom reductions; combined treatment can be superior to monotherapy in adolescents, while adjunctive exercise yields additional benefits for functioning and quality of life, and collaborative care in late life improves physical functioning and instrumental activities of daily living, supporting models that target both symptoms and functional recovery over adequate durations [^116U3jpU] [^116h654j] [^113eMWx8] [^1164NdiB] [^113HFndY] [^117CcpzN].

> But wait, measurement and conceptual issues can obscure interpretation, so I should verify our tools and endpoints. Functioning has been undermeasured in trials, often < 5%, and clinicians sometimes conflate functioning with quality of life despite their distinct meanings; scales like the GAF and Sheehan Disability Scale are useful yet variably applied, and mapping symptom scales to clinical status suggests more stringent symptom thresholds are needed to reflect functional normalization, so routine parallel tracking of symptoms and functioning is essential for accurate clinical decision-making [^112ZcgzE] [^116h654j] [^117CHzuY] [^113o9P5V].

> Let me synthesize and ensure nothing critical is missing. Depression degrades global functioning through direct symptom burden, persistent and perceived cognitive deficits, and interaction with medical comorbidity, producing disability that often outlasts mood symptoms; accordingly, clinicians should set patient-centered functional goals, address cognitive contributors, mitigate comorbidities and life stressors, and use integrated care models while monitoring both symptoms and functioning as co-primary targets throughout treatment to reduce relapse risk and restore real-world capability [^114DNCbX] [^111cWpUQ] [^116U3jpU] [^1137zVc3].

Depression causes **broad, persistent functional impairment** [^115weCuF] across occupational, social, and daily living domains [^114YGujM], with severity and chronicity closely linked to disability [^117MjtiT]. Cognitive deficits (attention, memory, executive function) [^114kYzbH] and fatigue/apathy drive reduced productivity, social withdrawal, and impaired self-care, often persisting after mood remission [^114kYzbH]. Functional recovery typically **lags symptom improvement** [^116U3jpU], and residual impairment increases relapse risk. Effective treatment [^114DNCbX] improves functioning [^116h654j], but comprehensive, individualized plans targeting both symptoms and function are essential for full recovery.

---

## Occupational functioning

Depression markedly impairs **occupational functioning** [^112ZcgzE], leading to reduced productivity [^1153k4cQ], absenteeism [^111oRGx7], and presenteeism. Cognitive deficits — impaired attention, memory, and executive function [^111cWpUQ] — decrease work performance and increase errors [^114kYzbH]. Fatigue [^115sgx5Y] and lack of motivation further worsen impairment, often resulting in job loss or stalled career advancement.

---

## Social functioning

Depression profoundly affects **social functioning** [^115weCuF], causing withdrawal, reduced participation [^114YGujM], and strained interpersonal relationships [^112ZcgzE]. Social isolation and diminished support networks are common [^115SkDob], further exacerbating symptoms and perpetuating a vicious cycle of worsening impairment.

---

## Daily living activities

Depression significantly impairs **daily living activities** [^111NrAca], including self-care [^117CHzuY], household tasks, and financial management. Many individuals experience difficulty maintaining personal hygiene, managing household responsibilities, and adhering to daily routines. These impairments can lead to greater dependence on others and reduced autonomy.

---

## Cognitive functioning

**Cognitive impairment** is a core feature of depression [^113CaffX], affecting attention, memory, and executive function [^114kYzbH]. These deficits often persist after mood symptoms remit [^111cWpUQ], significantly impacting daily functioning and quality of life. They are also associated with increased relapse risk and greater chronicity.

---

## Quality of life

Depression significantly reduces **quality of life** [^117579m7] across physical, psychological, and social domains [^111PdzQ9]. Affected individuals report lower life satisfaction [^112vw6KV], reduced enjoyment of activities, and impaired overall well-being. This impairment often persists after symptomatic remission [^116U3jpU], underscoring the need for comprehensive treatment that addresses both symptoms and functioning [^114bpQFV].

---

## Severity and chronicity of depression

The **severity and chronicity** of depression are strongly associated with the extent of functional impairment [^115weCuF]. Severe, chronic depression leads to greater disability, higher healthcare utilization, and increased economic burden [^111oRGx7], with impairment often persisting even after symptomatic improvement [^113Z7qFM].

---

## Treatment and functional recovery

Effective treatment — including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and combined approaches [^113eMWx8] — significantly improves **global functioning** [^114bpQFV] [^113HFndY]. However, functional recovery often lags symptomatic improvement [^113Z7qFM], and residual impairment is common [^116U3jpU]. Comprehensive plans that address both symptoms and functional impairment are essential for achieving full recovery [^114DNCbX].

---

## Measurement of functional impairment

Functional impairment in depression is commonly assessed with **standardized instruments** such as the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) [^117CHzuY] [^116hLBLJ], World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) [^111NrAca], and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) [^116U3jpU]. These tools provide valuable information on the extent of impairment and guide treatment planning [^114DNCbX].

---

## Societal and economic impact

Depression significantly impacts **society and the economy** [^114YGujM], contributing to higher healthcare costs, reduced productivity [^111oRGx7], and more disability claims. The economic burden is substantial [^115weCuF], underscoring the importance of effective treatment and prevention strategies.

---

Depression significantly **impairs global functioning** across occupational, social, and daily living domains [^114YGujM]. Cognitive impairment [^114kYzbH], severity, and chronicity of depression contribute to persistent functional impairment, even after symptomatic remission. Effective treatment [^114bpQFV] improves functioning [^116h654j], but comprehensive approaches addressing both symptoms and functional impairment are essential for full recovery.

### The efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination on functioning and quality of life in depression: a meta-analysis [^114bpQFV]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This study has to be viewed in light of certain limitations. First, half of the included trials were of low quality, which questions the robustness of the results. However, our sensitivity and subgroup analyses did not reveal significant differences in effects between high and low-quality studies. Second, the number of studies in some individual analyses was insufficient to generalize the results. Moreover, only overall improvements in functioning and quality of life (QoL) were assessed. There was a lack of domain-specific reporting that could have provided information on the effects of interventions on specific areas of functioning and QoL.

This meta-analysis was based on study-level data. An individual patient-level meta-analysis, using original datasets from the included studies, could have uncovered differences among initial cases of depression and recurrent depression, the level of severity, or provided better analysis of predictors of depression. A further limitation was our inability to analyze long-term outcomes and their interactions due to the lack of follow-up data. Follow-up data would allow for investigating long-term effects of interventions and temporal relationships between changes in functioning, QoL, and severity of symptoms. Future longitudinal epidemiological studies could fill this research gap and provide important information on the course of functioning in depression. Lastly, only articles in English were considered, which might have omitted relevant information.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides comprehensive evidence that existing

### Cognitive function following a major depressive episode: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kYzbH]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence suggests that cognitive deficits might persist after remission of a major depressive episode. However, results are inconsistent regarding the importance, pattern, severity, and moderating factors of this impairment. We aimed to determine how cognitive function following a major depressive episode compares with normal function, to specify the pattern and severity of persistent cognitive dysfunctions, and to examine the potential moderator effect of ten pre-specified clinical and demographic variables.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published research. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, and relevant reviews identified by our database search. We searched for research published from January 1, 1972, to January 31, 2018, focusing on studies of patients with past depression. We included all independent studies of patients assessed while in remission from a major depressive episode, with at least one cognitive test and a healthy control group assessed with either the same test(s) as the major depressive episode group or a standardized test with published age-stratified normative data. The main outcome was the difference in cognitive performance between major depressive episode remitters and healthy controls. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models for cognitive outcomes classified into 18 standard domains. Moderators of between-study variability were assessed using mixed-effects subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.

- **Findings**: Of 10,126 citations evaluated in this review, conclusions were drawn on the cognitive performance difference between individuals who have remitted from a major depressive episode and healthy controls.

### Restoring function in major depressive disorder: A systematic review [^116U3jpU]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Functional impairment contributes to significant disability and economic burden in major depressive disorder (MDD). Treatment response is measured by improvement in depressive symptoms, but functional improvement often lags behind symptomatic improvement. Residual deficits are associated with relapse of depressive symptoms.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted using the following terms: "major depressive disorder", "functional impairment", "functional outcomes", "recovery of function", "treatment outcome", "outcome assessment", "social functioning", "presenteeism", "absenteeism", "psychiatric status rating scales", and "quality of life". Search limits included publication date (January 1, 1995 to August 31, 2016), English language, and human clinical trials. Controlled, acute-phase, non-remission MDD treatment studies in adults were included if a functional outcome was measured at baseline and endpoint.

- **Results**: The qualitative analysis included 35 controlled studies. The Sheehan Disability Scale was the most commonly used functional assessment. Antidepressant treatments significantly improved functional outcomes. Early treatment response predicted functional improvement, while baseline disease severity did not.

- **Limitations**: Clinical studies utilized various methodologies and assessments for functional impairment and were not standardized or adequately powered.

- **Conclusions**: The lack of synchronicity between symptomatic and functional improvement highlights an unmet need for MDD. Treatment guided by routine monitoring of symptoms and functionality may mitigate these challenges.

### Functional impairment and improvement in depression [^113Z7qFM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Functional impairment is inherent to depression, but frequently these impairments are more resistant to treatment than the actual symptoms of depression. Unfortunately, a patient cannot truly overcome depression until these impairments are addressed. A number of validated instruments are available to help clinicians assess functional impairment and monitor it throughout treatment. Clinicians must work with patients to develop personalized short-term and long-term functional goals and determine whether pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or rehabilitative treatment is needed.

### Impact of untreated major depressive disorder on cognition and daily function [^111cWpUQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Cognitive symptoms are an emerging clinical focus in patients with major depressive disorder. Deficits in executive function, memory, attention, and processing speed, as well as negative cognitive bias, can contribute to low mood symptoms and reduced occupational and social functioning. Both patient reports and objective measures demonstrate that cognitive symptoms are common in patients with depression. Cognitive dysfunction may be present even before the first depressive episode and may remain after mood symptoms have remitted. Clinicians must assess cognitive symptoms in their patients with major depressive disorder, monitor symptoms throughout the course of the disorder and after remission, and understand how these symptoms affect daily function.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (third edition) [^114DNCbX]. APA (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for major depressive disorder — specifically with respect to functional evaluation — the APA 2010 guidelines recommend aiming to maximize the patient's level of functioning. It also suggests helping the patient set specific goals appropriate to existing functional impairments and symptom severity when developing a treatment plan.

### One (effect) size does not fit at all: Interpreting clinical significance and effect sizes in depression treatment trials [^112MgfhY]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

There are reasons to doubt the validity of this seven-point cut-off signifying 'minimal improvement' in an individual patient. First, the authors of the original analysis did not suggest the seven-point cut-off; rather, they commented that '[a] CGI-I score of 3 ("minimally improved") corresponds to a reduction from baseline in the total HAMD-17 score of between 25% and 35%'. By choosing a relative cut-off, the authors recognized that those with less severe illness require a smaller absolute decrease in HDRS scores for a clinically significant difference. The lower estimate, 25%, means the seven-point cut-off would be appropriate for people with a baseline score of 28, which is far higher than the average for people participating in antidepressant treatment trials.

Second, most depression treatment trials enforce a minimum HDRS score as an inclusion criterion, and this is usually known to the HDRS rater. Because there is often pressure to recruit patients, this practice can lead to inflated baseline scores. If HDRS baseline scores are inflated, then all subsequent HDRS change scores are as well, and consequently, HDRS change scores corresponding to specific CGI-I categories, such as the 'minimally improved' category, will also be inflated.

Third, although knowing the HDRS and CGI correlation is interesting, a 'minimal improvement' in CGI-I is still an approximation. We do not necessarily know its meaning, for example, in terms of functioning.

### Depression [^114YGujM]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Major depression is a common illness that severely limits psychosocial functioning and diminishes quality of life. In 2008, WHO ranked major depression as the third cause of burden of disease worldwide and projected that the disease will rank first by 2030. In practice, its detection, diagnosis, and management often pose challenges for clinicians because of its various presentations, unpredictable course and prognosis, and variable response to treatment.

### Ecological momentary assessment versus weekly questionnaire assessment of change in depression [^112qfizR]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Low credibility.

Studying the effects of a 6-week antidepressant trial, Targum et al. discovered that continuous EMA of changes in depression significantly predicted clinician-rated outcomes. To corroborate these findings, we analyzed the validity of EMA and WQA in predicting changes in global functioning. We examined them in separate models (EMA or WQA) and in combined models incorporating both predictors (EMA and WQA). Changes in depressive symptoms and RNT assessed with WQA significantly predicted changes in global functioning in both the separate and combined models. In contrast, the results for EMA were mixed. Specifically, changes in depressive symptoms assessed with EMA emerged as a significant predictor in the separate model, but not in the combined model, and EMA-assessed changes in RNT failed to significantly predict change in global functioning in either the separate or combined model. The results are consistent with those of Targum et al. in that EMA-assessed changes in depression significantly predict clinician ratings. Nevertheless, our hypothesis, asserting that EMA-assessed changes in depressive symptoms and RNT could be stronger predictors of clinician-rated changes in global functioning, was not supported by the results. A plausible explanation for our findings could be the shared time reference of questionnaires and clinician ratings, as both, unlike EMA, rely on retrospective recall.

### Subsyndromal depression is associated with functional impairment in patients with bipolar disorder [^115xHvH4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether a relationship exists between mild depressive symptoms and overall functioning in subjects with bipolar disorder.

- **Method**: Twenty-five male subjects with bipolar I disorder (DSM-III-R criteria), who had not experienced a DSM-III-R episode of mania, hypomania, or major depression for 3 months, as determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, were evaluated for degree of depressive symptoms using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and for overall functional status using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF, DSM-IV Axis V).

- **Results**: GAF scores were significantly negatively correlated with HAM-D scores (r = -0.61, df = 23, p = .001), despite the fact that no patient had a HAM-D score high enough to be considered clinically depressed.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study support a relationship between subsyndromal depressive symptoms and functional impairment in bipolar subjects, despite their not meeting threshold criteria for a major depressive episode. These findings raise the possibility that in some patients with bipolar disorder, subsyndromal depressive symptoms might contribute to ongoing functional impairment.

### The impact of depression on functioning: Relation to medication response and other predictors [^117MjtiT]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Low credibility.

Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, profoundly impairing occupational, social, and family functioning. We aimed to identify socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with functional impairment across these domains in patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), with a particular focus on treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A total of 755 patients with MDD, treated with antidepressants for at least four weeks, were included from the multicentric study of "Group for the Study of Resistant Depression".

Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (retrospective and current), while functional impairment was measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Univariate and multivariate models adjusted for age, sex, and depression severity were used. Across all domains, higher depression severity, particularly marked by suicide risk, anhedonia, and inpatient status, was strongly linked to higher disability.

In non-TRD patients, somatic comorbidities, including diabetes, were significant predictors of social and family functioning impairment. In TRD patients, family-related factors such as a higher number of children and living alone were associated with impaired functioning. These findings underscore the heterogeneous determinants of disability in depression and suggest that tailored treatment approaches addressing both clinical severity and specific socio-demographic factors may improve functional outcomes.

### Late-life depression and multimorbidity trajectories: The role of symptom complexity and severity [^117NtYJA]. Age and Ageing (2023). Low credibility.

Depression in old age has negative consequences for quality of life and well-being, but it is also detrimental for somatic health. Individuals with depression exhibit a higher risk of developing several somatic diseases, and those already presenting with diseases experience worsening of their clinical status and premature mortality. Although unhealthy behaviors, common in depressed individuals, may partly explain such findings, depression is also believed to reflect accelerated biological aging due to immune-inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular dysregulations.

The co-occurrence of multiple chronic diseases, i.e. multimorbidity, embodies one of the defining features of the aging process. The speed at which diseases accumulate over time has been proposed as a metric of aging, expressing the underlying homeostatic dysregulation and loss of resilience of biologically old individuals. Although emerging evidence suggests that individuals with depression in young adulthood and midlife may accumulate diseases more rapidly, this relationship is yet to be fully examined in old age. Uncovering the extent to which late-life depression is associated with the speed of disease accumulation would advance our understanding of the interplay between mental and somatic health, likely contributing to improved management and care of older adults with complex health issues.

Any assessment of the impact of depression on chronic disease accumulation must consider its specific manifestation in old age. Older adults often present depressive symptoms without fulfilling the operational criteria…

### The efficacy of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination on functioning and quality of life in depression: a meta-analysis [^116h654j]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A considerable number of meta-analyses published in the last decade have clearly shown that both psychological and pharmacological treatments are efficacious for reducing symptoms in depression (Cuijpers et al; Spielmans et al.). Recent literature, however, suggests that improvement in functioning and quality of life (QoL) might be equally important for people with depression as symptom amelioration (Zimmerman et al; IsHak et al; Lam et al.). The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) highlighted the need for evidence-based interventions that demonstrate improvement in functioning (Lam et al.). From a clinical perspective, patients prioritize functional over symptomatic outcomes and consider the return to a normal level of functioning at work, home, or school as a significant factor for remission in depression (Zimmerman et al.). Furthermore, improvement in QoL is considered the ultimate outcome measure that indicates whether certain treatments have succeeded (IsHak et al.).

Despite the importance given to functioning and QoL, both dimensions remain under-researched in interventional studies (Kamenov et al.). The terms have been used interchangeably in previous studies, but there is agreement that these concepts are not identical (Lam et al.). Generally, functioning refers to one's performance in daily or social activities, and QoL refers to one's satisfaction with these activities and perception of his/her health (IsHak et al.).

The conclusions drawn from the few published meta-analyses on functioning are limited.

### The prevalence and impact of depression [^111oRGx7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Depression affects up to 25% of women and 12% of men and is a highly chronic disorder. Further, the more episodes patients have, the more likely they are to have additional episodes, subsequently worsening the course of the disorder with each occurrence. Even after patients recover from an index episode of depression, their chances of maintaining that recovery are drastically diminished over time. Because of the highly prevalent and recurrent nature of depression, the impact of the disorder is felt globally. Depression is a major cause of disability worldwide and accounted for more than $83 billion in US costs in 2000.

To combat these negative consequences, clinicians need to be as steadfast as ever to control this disorder and help patients lead symptom-free lives.

### Severity of depressive symptoms and response to antidepressants and placebo in antidepressant trials [^112dwj9p]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Although increased pre-treatment severity of depressive symptoms is thought to suggest a better outcome with tricyclic antidepressants, it is unclear if such a pattern exists among those depressed patients treated with newer antidepressants. If such a pattern with newer antidepressants were observed, it would have implications for the design and conduct of future antidepressant trials.

We reviewed the data from 329 depressed adult patients who were part of 15 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled antidepressant clinical trials at our center. Based on patients' pre-treatment scores on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), patients were sub-grouped into one of four severity of depression groups: low moderate, high moderate, moderately severe, and severe. The effect size was 0.51 in the low moderate group, 0.54 in the high moderate group, 0.77 in the moderately severe group, and 1.09 in the severe group.

An analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant interaction between treatment and severity of depressive symptoms. A correlational analysis revealed that in the group of depressed patients assigned to antidepressants, higher levels of pre-treatment depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater changes in response to antidepressant treatment. Although a similar pattern was seen among the depressed patients assigned to placebo, it did not reach statistical significance. The results of this study suggest that antidepressant-placebo differences may be larger among those depressed outpatients with higher pre-treatment HAM-D scores.

### Psychosocial and quality of life assessment in kidney transplant recipients: A focus on anxiety, depression, and clinical correlates [^115gJeFy]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health issue, affecting millions worldwide. It is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function, leading to complications such as cardiovascular diseases, anemia, and mineral bone disorders. The prevalence of CKD has been increasing globally, driven by factors such as population growth, aging, and the rising incidence of diabetes and hypertension. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, the global prevalence of CKD was estimated to be 359 million cases, representing a 92% increase since 1990. CKD is a progressive condition that can ultimately lead to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), at which point the kidneys are no longer able to function adequately on their own, and renal replacement therapy — such as dialysis or kidney transplantation (KT) — is required for survival.

KT plays a crucial role in managing ESKD, offering significant advantages over dialysis in terms of survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. It is recognized as the preferred treatment option, particularly for patients with chronic renal failure, as it can substantially reduce mortality rates associated with chronic dialysis programs. The significance of psychosocial factors, particularly anxiety and depression, in post-transplant care is increasingly recognized as critical for improving patient outcomes. These factors can adversely affect the quality of life, treatment adherence, and overall survival rates of kidney transplant recipients.

The evidence overwhelmingly supports the superiority of KT.

### A longitudinal analysis of the relationship between emotional symptoms and cognitive function in patients with major depressive disorder [^113CaffX]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent condition that affects approximately 280 million individuals globally [World Health Organization]. It is a leading cause of disability worldwide and significantly contributes to the global burden of disease [GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators]. A study on first-episode drug-naive patients with MDD found that 13.7% of the patients exhibited suicide attempts within 1 month of the study [Li et al.]. Annually, more than 700,000 individuals die by suicide due to depression [World Health Organization].

Cognitive impairment is a significant manifestation of MDD; however, its relationship with depressive symptoms remains unclear. Diagnostic criteria, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), recognize cognitive disturbances as associated features of MDD. A meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, memory, and attention in patients with MDD; it also found that these cognitive impairments are fundamental aspects of the disorder, rather than mere epiphenomena secondary to low mood symptoms [Rock, Roiser, Riedel, & Blackwell]. Although cognitive symptoms are traditionally thought to be influenced by the depressive state, research indicates that these deficits can persist even in remitted states [Preiss et al; Rock et al.], negatively impacting patients' overall functionality [Evans, Iverson, Yatham, & Lam]. Our previous study found that difficulty with concentration and decision-making was the core residue of cognitive impairment in patients with MDD.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^114Fe3PT]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, particularly with respect to elderly patients, the management of major depression is guided by the APA 2019 guidelines. These guidelines recommend offering any of the following options as initial treatment for older adult patients with depression, in the context of shared decision-making with the patient:

- **Treatment options**: Either group life review treatment or group CBT (either alone or added to usual care), combined pharmacotherapy and interpersonal psychotherapy. Use a second-generation antidepressant due to the reduced risk of side effects.

### Self-report versus clinician examination in early Parkinson's disease [^114boaYH]. Movement Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Both explanations are supported by findings in previous studies. Indeed, the treatment of depression was associated with improved self-reported quality of life and less self-reported functional motor-related impact on the UPDRS-ADL score, but no change in the UPDRS motor score. Weintraub and colleagues also reported that nonmotor symptoms (i.e. signs of depression or cognitive impairment), but not physician-assessed motor sign severity, were significant predictors of functional disability in PD as measured by the self-reported UPDRS-ADL subscale. Others have reported positive correlations between depression and higher self-reported functional disability, motor impairment, and disease severity. These findings could support the first explanation; for example, someone who suffers from depression may perform daily (motor) activities slowly or with more difficulty due to apathy or subjective fatigue.

In line with the second explanation, depression may also change the degree to which patients recognize, perceive, or are impacted by any motor difficulties that make activities more difficult.

### The associations between depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life, in patients with major depression: Undirected and Bayesian network analyses [^112dhETN]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

This study was strengthened by a large, multi-site sample of individuals suffering from MDD and the use of network models that are appropriate for describing complex dynamic systems. However, our study has some limitations that need to be mentioned.

- **Causal inference limitations**: Even though the DAG provides preliminary clues to both the strength and direction of the possible connections among the variables under analysis, caution is required as causal inference is only fully defensible when all assumptions are completely met. Longitudinal studies focusing on disease development are needed for further validation.

- **Potential confounders**: Although a wide range of clinical dimensions were assessed, these network structures must be explained under the assumption of the absence of unmeasured confounders or selection variables. Variables such as shame, self-esteem, or cognitive biases may need to be included in future network-based studies to enrich MDD research.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The study excluded patients with suicidal ideation item score > 2 (considered high risk for suicide), which may impact the relationship of suicidal ideation with other depressive symptoms, QOL, and functioning.

Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this study was the first to elucidate the associations between depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and QOL in patients with MDD at the level of individual symptoms. We found that functional disability mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and QOL.

### Functioning and quality of life in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) [^113eMWx8]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2006). High credibility.

To test whether a 12-week treatment of major depression improved the level of functioning, global health, and quality of life of adolescents, the Treatment for Adolescents With Depression Study was conducted. This was a multisite, randomized clinical trial involving fluoxetine, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), their combination (COMB), or clinical management with placebo in 439 adolescents with major depression. Functioning was measured using the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), global health with the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA), and quality of life with the Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ-LES-Q). Random-effects regression models were applied to analyze the data.

Results compared COMB with placebo, showing effectiveness on the CGAS (p < .0001), HoNOSCA (p < .05), and PQ-LES-Q (p < .001). Fluoxetine was superior to placebo on the CGAS only (p < .05). Additionally, COMB was superior to fluoxetine on the CGAS (p < .05) and PQ-LES-Q (p = .001). Fluoxetine also proved superior to CBT on the CGAS (p < .01). CBT monotherapy did not differ statistically from the placebo group on any assessed measures. Treatment effects were mediated by improvement in depressive symptoms, measured on the Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised.

In conclusion, the combination of fluoxetine and CBT effectively improved functioning, global health, and quality of life in depressed adolescents. Fluoxetine monotherapy improved functioning as well.

### The associations between depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life, in patients with major depression: undirected and Bayesian network analyses [^115SkDob]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Stability of centrality indices**: Figure 3 shows point estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) determined by average correlations between the centrality indices of networks sampled with patients dropped and the original sample. Lines indicate the means, and areas indicate the range from the 2.5th quantile to the 97.5th quantile.

- **Gender difference in network strength**: The analysis indicated that the global network strength was larger in the female network than in the male network (S = 2.202, p = 0.0278), without differences in network structure (M = 0.149, p = 0.1008). Depressed mood symptoms play a more central role in the female network, while somatic symptoms are more central in the male network. Detailed results can be found in the online supplementary material (Figs S4–S6).

- **Bayesian network analysis**: Figure 4 illustrates the directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the Bayesian network analysis, showing connections between depressive symptoms, functional disabilities, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Edge thickness indicates the importance of connections in terms of network structure; the position of items shows predictive priority. Depressed mood was positioned at the highest level, suggesting causal priority, predicting activation of functional impairment, including disability related to work, activities, social life, and family life, thus affecting QOL. In another branch, the depressed mood node triggered anxiety, including psychological and somatic anxiety.

### Impact of severity and type of depression on quality of life in cases identified in the community [^116CMxb6]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The impact of different levels of depression severity on quality of life (QoL) is not well studied, particularly regarding ICD-10 criteria. The ICD classification of depressive episodes into three levels of severity is also controversial. The less severe category, mild, has been considered unnecessary and not clearly distinguishable from non-clinical states. The present work aimed to test the relationship between depression severity according to ICD-10 criteria and several dimensions of functioning as assessed by the Medical Outcome Study (MOS) 36-item Short Form general health survey (SF-36) at the population level.

A sample of 551 participants from the second phase of the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study, comprising 228 controls without depression and 313 individuals fulfilling ICD criteria for a depressive episode, was selected for a further assessment of several variables, including QoL related to physical and mental health as measured with the SF-36.

Statistically significant differences between controls and the depression group were found in both physical and mental markers of health, regardless of the level of depression severity. However, there were very few differences in QoL between levels of depression as defined by ICD-10. Regardless of the presence of depression, disability, widowed status, being a woman, and older age were associated with worse QoL in a structural equation analysis with covariates. Furthermore, no differences were observed according to the type of depression (single-episode versus recurrent).

### The associations between depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and quality of life, in patients with major depression: Undirected and Bayesian network analyses [^112jHkHJ]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

We performed an online supplementary analysis and discovered a significant gender disparity among participants, with only 32% being male. Depression was more prevalent in females, and certain factors, such as family factors, varied by gender. It was crucial to examine whether the findings differed between males and females. We utilized the Network Comparison Test (NCT), a recently developed test that allows researchers to assess differences in global network strength (i.e. the overall level of connectivity of the network) and global network structure (i.e. the overall structure of the network) between two networks.

The Q-LES-Q-SF comprises 16 items and contains identical content to the general activities section of the longer version. No criteria were found to categorize the items into dimensions. Including all individual items of the Q-LES-Q-SF as nodes in the network analyses would be challenging to interpret; therefore, only the total score of the Q-LES-Q-SF was incorporated. The results of the undirected network analysis, in which items of the Q-LES-Q-SF were included, are available in the online supplementary material [Online Supplementary Fig. S7].

Additionally, we used follow-up data at week 4 to verify the results of the DAG analysis. To thoroughly analyze the results, we also incorporated longitudinal data (at baseline and week 4) to examine the associations found in the DAG analysis. Among the variables identified in the DAG branch, the levels of th…

### Clinical effectiveness: The importance of psychosocial functioning outcomes [^112ZcgzE]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with significant impairment in quality of life and psychosocial functioning, including social and occupational/role functioning. Evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of treatments for depression must include improvement in these important functional outcomes. However, clinical trials for depression have primarily focused on the reduction of symptoms, as measured by symptom severity scales such as the HDRS and MADRS, or by standard definitions of response and remission.

- **Method**: The rationale and necessity for accessing both symptom and functional outcomes in clinical trials for MDD are reviewed, and examples of validated scales for measuring quality of life (QoL) and social and occupational functioning are provided.

- **Results**: Emerging data suggest that treatment effects assessed with functioning scales may differ from those captured by symptoms scales. Many validated scales are available to measure global and specific aspects of functional outcomes, including QoL, psychosocial functioning, and occupational functioning. Nevertheless, systematic reviews have shown that functional outcome scales are used in fewer than 5% of trials.

- **Conclusions**: Given the importance of psychosocial functioning for individuals with MDD as well as for society, greater attention must be focused on the assessment of functional outcomes in clinical trials for MDD, as well as in the clinical management of people with depression.

### My patient might be depressed - can I still screen for MCI? Exploring cognitive performance on the MoCA in older people screened for depressive symptoms with the PHQ-9 [^1157oQEk]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is used globally to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as it has high sensitivity and specificity and can be administered easily and quickly. Detection of MCI is essential for early treatment, as MCI is a prodromal stage to dementia and describes the decline in a person's cognitive functioning as they transition from normal aging to dementia. Thus, people with MCI are at significantly higher risk of developing dementia than cognitively healthy people. However, it seems that not only MCI but also affective disorders, such as depression, impact participants' cognitive performance on the MoCA, at least in a clinical setting.

Depression is a mental disorder affecting over 300 million people of all ages worldwide. In the older population (people 60 years of age and older), the prevalence is estimated to range from 17.5% to 31.7%. Among other symptoms, impaired cognitive functioning, such as memory difficulties or limited concentration, can be present in people with depressive disorders. Therefore, distinguishing between depressive symptoms and early signs of dementia is complex, especially among older people, but clinically important. Depressive symptoms are assumed to be a risk factor for dementia and can also emerge during the prodromal stage of dementia.

- **Performance in cognitive dimensions**: Lower performance has been reported in memory, language, and executive as well as visuospatial functioning in older people with depression compared with non-depressed controls.

### Rating depression over brief time intervals with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: Standard vs. abbreviated scales [^117LfwhC]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2015). Low credibility.

Although antidepressant trials typically use weekly ratings to examine changes in symptoms over six to twelve weeks, antidepressant treatments may improve symptoms more quickly. Thus, rating scales must be adapted to capture changes over shorter intervals. We examined the use of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) to evaluate more rapid changes.

Data were examined from 58 patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder enrolled in double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies. These patients received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo over 40 minutes, then crossed over to the other condition. The HDRS subscales, a single HDRS depressed mood item, and a visual analogue scale were used at baseline, following a brief interval (230 minutes), and one week post-infusion.

Effect sizes for the ketamine-placebo difference were moderate (d > 0.50), but one and two-item HDRS subscales had the smallest effects. Response rates on active drugs were lowest for the complete HDRS (43%); the remaining scales had higher response rates to active drugs, but the shortest subscales had higher response rates to placebo. Correlations between the changes from baseline to 230 minutes post-ketamine across scores were similar for most subscales (r = 0.82–0.97), but correlations using the single items were lower (r < 0.74).

Overall, effect sizes for drug-placebo differences and correlations between changes were lower for one- and two-item measures. Response rates were lower with the full HDRS scale. The data suggest that, to best identify rapid antidepressant effects, a scale should have more comprehensive measures rather than relying on single-item or abbreviated scales.

### Novel and emerging treatments for major depression [^117VwM4k]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Depression is common, costly, debilitating, and associated with an increased risk of suicide. It is one of the leading global public health problems. Although currently available pharmacological treatments can be effective, their onset of action can take up to six weeks, side effects are common, and recovery can require treatment with multiple different agents. Although psychosocial interventions might also be recommended, more effective treatments than those currently available are needed for people with moderate or severe depression.

In the past 10 years, treatment trials have developed and tested many new targeted interventions. In this review, we assess novel and emerging biological treatments for major depressive disorder, evaluate their putative brain and body mechanisms, and highlight how close each might be to clinical use.

### What does the HAMD mean [^113o9P5V]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Little is known about the clinical relevance of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) total scores. It is unclear how total scores translate into clinical severity, or what commonly used measures for response (reduction from baseline of ≥ 50% in the total score) and remission (total HAMD-17 score ≤ 7) mean from a clinical perspective.

We therefore compared:

- **Percentage and absolute change**: The percentage and absolute change in the HAMD-17 total scores with Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I).
- **Absolute and percentage change**: The absolute and percentage change in the HAMD-17 total scores with Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) absolute change.
- **Subgroup comparative analysis**: The percentage and absolute change in the HAMD-17 total scores with CGI-I in the subgroups of patients with ≤ median and > median HAMD-17 total scores at baseline.

The method used was equipercentile linking of HAMD-17 and CGI ratings from 43 drug trials in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n = 7131). Our results confirm the validity of the commonly used measures for remission and response in MDD trials: a CGI-I score of 2 ('much improved') corresponded to a reduction from baseline of > 50% and 75% and < 85%. The CGI-S score of 1 ('normal, not at all ill') corresponded to the HAMD-17 total score of < 5, and the CGI-S score of 2 ('borderline mentally ill') corresponded to the score between 6 and 8. An effect of baseline illness severity was observed.

### Late-life depression symptom dimensions and cognitive functioning in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) [^115LgnPq]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional studies conducted in non-clinical populations using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) suggest that lower levels of depressed affect and somatic symptoms were related to better performance on tasks assessing speed, attention, and executive function, whereas higher levels of positive affect were related to poorer verbal fluency performance; higher levels of positive affect (but not lower levels of depressed affect, somatic symptoms, or interpersonal difficulties) were related to better everyday problem-solving. Positive affect was the most robust predictor of cognitive performance across a variety of tasks assessing memory, processing speed, verbal fluency, visual retention, temporal orientation, and global cognition.

Studies using the Euro-D depression scale found that verbal fluency performance was more strongly associated with motivational symptoms of depression than with affective suffering symptoms. Cross-sectional studies conducted in persons with MDD suggest that greater levels of apathy on the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression were associated with lower executive function and processing speed performance; greater levels of motivational symptoms on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology were associated with poorer episodic memory and processing speed, whereas greater levels of mood symptoms were associated with poorer working memory and processing speed.

A longitudinal study suggests that lower levels of positive affect on the CES-D scale predicted a decline in global cognition and episodic memory.

### Development of a clinical global impression scale for fatigue [^115sgx5Y]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Physical, cognitive, and affective components of fatigue are often associated with depression and other Axis I psychiatric disorders. We developed two single-item global assessment scales to specifically evaluate symptoms of fatigue. A total of 101 subjects visiting a clinical trial site consented to participate in this reliability and validity study. Diagnoses included major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

There were two clinic visits during which the modified Clinician and Patient Impressions of Fatigue rating instruments were administered in conjunction with the MGH cognitive and physical functioning questionnaire (MGH-CPFQ), a validated patient-rated 7-item scale.

- **CGI-Severity and PGI-Severity correlation**: CGI-Severity and PGI-Severity for fatigue were well correlated at two separate visits (p < 0.00005). At visit 1, the mean CGI-S for fatigue was 3.33 ± 1.53 (SD) and the PGI-S for fatigue was 3.57 ± 1.70 (r = 0.75; p = 0.000).

- **MGH-CPFQ scores**: At visit 1, the total MGH-CPFQ score was 21.66 ± 6.92. Both CGI-S and PGI-S measures for fatigue were highly correlated with the MGH-CPFQ: CGI-S (r = 0.76; p < 0.00005); PGI-S (r = 0.62; p < 0.00005).

- **Temporal stability and convergent validity**: Both the PGI-S and CGI-S for fatigue revealed temporal stability and convergent validity for the MGH-CPFQ (r = 0.83 for CGI-S and 0.73 for PGI-S).

- **Internal consistency**: There was high internal consistency between the two independent CGI raters at visit 2, as demonstrated by a kappa statistic = 0.971 (CGI-S) and 0.868 (CGI-I), and Cronbach's alpha = 0.998 (CGI-S) and 0.941 (CGI-I).

As shown here, the modified CGI and PGI instruments for fatigue are reliable measures of fatigue, and both measures are validated.

### Measuring cognitive function in MDD: emerging assessment tools [^116nMfjP]. Depression and Anxiety (2015). Low credibility.

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) are clinician-administered assessments of depressive symptoms that are the most frequently used depression rating scales in clinical trials. However, neither of these scales evaluates cognition in any depth and both rely on a clinician's subjective opinion based upon a patient's report. On the HAM-D, a single item assesses psychomotor functioning, whereas a single item on the 10-item MADRS assesses concentration. The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-16) assesses both of these items but is also based on a subjective rating.

The patient-reported Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ) assesses multiple cognitive symptoms in patients with MDD and is simple enough to be suitable for use in routine clinical practice. However, it is important to note that a patient's subjective experience of cognitive dysfunction is not always related to performance on objective neuropsychological measures. A recent study compared outcomes using the clinician-administered Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) with results from the CPFQ in patients with MDD, noting no significant correlation between the severity of impairment measured with the SCIP and patient reports of cognitive symptoms. Although the SCIP is not validated in MDD, similar observations were made in patients with BD who complained of cognitive impairment.

### Treatment of depression improves physical functioning in older adults [^117CcpzN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). High credibility.

To determine the effect of collaborative care management for depression on physical functioning in older adults, a multisite randomized clinical trial was conducted across eighteen primary care clinics from eight healthcare organizations. The study involved 1,801 patients aged 60 and older with major depressive disorder.

Patients were randomized to the Improving Mood: Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) intervention (n = 906) or to a control group receiving usual care (n = 895). Control patients had access to all health services available as part of usual care. Intervention patients had access for 12 months to a depression clinical specialist who coordinated depression care with their primary care physician.

Measurements included the 12-item short form Physical Component Summary (PCS) score, ranging from 0 to 100, and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), ranging from 0 to 7.

The results indicated that the mean patient age was 71.2 years, 65% were women, and 77% were white. At baseline, the mean PCS was 40.2, and the mean number of IADL dependencies was 0.7; 45% of participants rated their health as fair or poor. Intervention patients experienced significantly better physical functioning at 1 year than usual-care patients, as measured by between-group differences on the PCS of 1.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.96–2.46) and IADLs of -0.15 (95% CI = -0.29 to -0.01). Intervention patients were also less likely to rate their health as fair or poor (37.3% vs 52.4%, p < 0.001). Combining both study groups, patients whose depression improved were more likely to…

### The trajectories of depression and multimorbidity affect the patterns of cognitive decline: a prospective cohort study [^113prQRa]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

The course of decline in global cognitive function is heterogeneous, with patterns varying among individuals. The influence of depression, functional limitations, and multimorbidity on the patterns of decline in global cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults remains unknown. This study examines the relationship between these health conditions and the course of decline in global cognitive function.

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort of 4,032 participants aged ≥ 60 years at baseline was constructed using the Health and Retirement Study (2006–2020), with surveys conducted every two years. Information on depression, functional limitations, and multimorbidity was collected from 2006 to 2012. Data on cognitive function were gathered between 2012 and 2020. Latent class trajectory models were employed to identify latent trajectories, and multinomial logistic regression models analyzed the association between these trajectories and cognitive function.

- **Results**: Different trajectories were identified for depression (low-stable, decline-rise, and rise-decline); activities of daily living (ADLs; low-stable, decline-rise, and rise-decline); instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; low-stable and rise); and multimorbidity (stable and rise). Three trajectories of cognitive decline were identified: high stable, modest, and later steep. The trajectories of depression (for decline-rise: OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.11–1.95; for rise-decline: OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.24–2.38) and multimorbidity (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.08–2.46) increased the risk of cognitive decline.

- **Conclusion**: The trajectories of depression and multimorbidity significantly affect the patterns of cognitive decline in older adults, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions in this population.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113cZ2TD]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, particularly with respect to elderly patients with cognitive impairment, the APA 2019 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend the combination of individual behavioral activation therapy alongside usual treatment over usual treatment alone for depressive symptoms in older adult patients with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment.

### Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales [^116exCtp]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Due to the heterogeneity of depressive symptoms — which can include depressed mood, anhedonia, negative cognitive biases, and altered activity levels — researchers often use a combination of depression rating scales to assess symptoms. This study sought to identify unidimensional constructs measured across rating scales for depression and to evaluate these constructs across clinical trials of a rapid-acting antidepressant (ketamine).

- **Methods**: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on baseline ratings from the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Rating Scale (SHAPS). Inpatients with major depressive disorder (n = 76) or bipolar depression (n = 43) were participating in clinical ketamine trials. The trajectories of the resulting unidimensional scores were evaluated in 41 subjects with bipolar depression who participated in clinical ketamine trials.

- **Results**: The best solution, which exhibited excellent fit to the data, comprised eight factors: Depressed Mood, Tension, Negative Cognition, Impaired Sleep, Suicidal Thoughts, Reduced Appetite, Anhedonia, and Amotivation. Various response patterns were observed across the clinical trial data, both in treatment effect (ketamine versus placebo) and in degree of placebo response, suggesting that use of these unidimensional constructs may reveal patterns not observed with traditional scoring of individual instruments.

- **Limitations**: Limitations include: 1) small sample (and related inability).

### Association of depressive symptoms with worse functioning in schizophrenia: A study in older outpatients [^112hA78j]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Subsyndromal depressive symptoms are highly prevalent and associated with substantial impairments in daily function in the general population. Depressive symptoms are common in schizophrenia. However, few studies have examined the relationship between functioning, well-being, and the presence of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia.

- **Method**: 202 middle-aged or elderly outpatients with schizophrenia (DSM-III-R or DSM-IV criteria) were categorized by the severity of depressive symptoms using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) with previously validated cutoff points. Patients were classified into groups with HAM-D total scores of ≥ 17 (high). Additional assessments included the severity of positive and negative symptoms, movement disorders, neurocognitive performance, daily functioning, and health-related quality of well-being using standardized measures.

- **Results**: A total of 11.4% of patients had HAM-D scores ≥ 17, while 56.4% had scores ranging from 7 to 16. After adjusting for the severity of other psychopathology, patients with more severe depressive symptoms showed significantly worse everyday functioning (p < .02), excluding physical functioning, and poorer health-related quality of well-being (r = -.365, p < .001) compared to those with lower HAM-D scores. These differences were independent of demographics, extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, neurocognitive performance, or the number of physical illnesses.

- **Conclusion**: The results suggest the importance of evaluating schizophrenia patients for the presence of depressive symptoms. The effectiveness of adjunct treatment should also be considered.

### Physical exercise improves quality of life, depressive symptoms, and cognition across chronic brain disorders: a transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1164NdiB]. Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

One hundred and twenty-two studies, including 7,231 patients, demonstrated a significant medium-size effect (ES = 0.40) of exercise as an add-on therapeutic intervention on quality of life (QoL) (k = 64, n = 4,334), a large effect (ES = 0.78) on depressive symptoms (k = 60, n = 2,909), and a small but significant effect (ES = 0.12–0.24) on improving function in several cognitive domains. The effects for QoL and depression were well powered. The included number of patients was lower for cognition (k = 36, n = 2,125), making these results more sensitive to new findings. From the studies that reported on safety (k = 18), low incidences of complications related to exercise interventions were found, which had no lasting consequences for participation in and completion of the exercise interventions.

### The actual process of rating the global assessment of functioning scale [^117CHzuY]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2001). High credibility.

The Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) was developed for the overall assessment of psychological, social, and occupational functioning. While the advantage of the GAF lies in this comprehensiveness, questions have been raised about whether clinicians rate appropriately. To clarify this issue, the actual process of how clinicians assign GAF scores was investigated.

A total of 2,462 inpatients from 19 psychiatric hospitals in Japan were assessed by their primary psychiatrists using the following rating scales: GAF, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), World Health Organization Psychiatric Disability Assessment Schedule (DAS), and Physical Activities of Daily Living (ADL) index. A tree-based model analysis, also referred to as Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) or Classification and Regression Tree (CART), was used to construct a statistical model with the GAF score as the dependent variable.

The statistically best-fitted tree to predict the GAF score is as follows: The first split is based on the "conceptual disorganization" score in the BPRS, followed by splits based on DAS item scores, such as "conversation" and "underactivity". The tree model obtained suggests that Japanese clinicians judge the level of global functioning by integrating information on both the severity of psychiatric symptoms and the level of impaired behavior and social functioning. This logical structure was clinically acceptable and agreed well with the concept of the GAF.

### Explaining heterogeneity in disability with major depressive disorder: Effects of personal and environmental characteristics [^1153k4cQ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with disability, yet some patients function surprisingly well. The reason for this heterogeneity between patients is unclear. Building on the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) model, this study aims to examine the effects of personal and environmental characteristics on disability with MDD, over and above illness characteristics.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from 573 patients with a diagnosis of MDD. Three measures for disability were used, varying in objectivity and specificity: 'WHODAS disability', 'days out of role', and 'work absence'. Univariate and stepwise multivariate regression analyses were conducted.

- **Results**: WHODAS disability was best explained by the study variables. Illness characteristics were clearly the strongest correlates of WHODAS disability, whereas personal and environmental characteristics were less influential. Personal and, more restrictedly, environmental characteristics were almost equally important to illness characteristics in explaining days out of role and work absence. High conscientiousness, high neuroticism, low level of physical activity, and high work stress were the strongest predictors of disability among MDD patients.

- **Limitations**: Due to the cross-sectional design of the present study, we could not draw conclusions about causal relationships between our predictor variables and disability.

- **Conclusions**: Personal characteristics appeared to be almost equally important to illness characteristics in explaining heterogeneity in disability when measured objectively.

### Asking patients about their general level of functioning: Is it worth it for common mental disorders [^111NrAca]? Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Functional disability (FD) is a diagnostic criterion for the psychiatric diagnosis of many mental disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive episode (MDE). We aimed to assess the contribution of measuring FD to diagnosing GAD and MDE using clinical (Global Assessment of Functioning, GAF) and self-reported methods (Analog scale of functioning, ASF, and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS 2.0). Patients seeking professional help for mood/anxiety symptoms (N = 244) were evaluated. The MINI interview was used to determine the presence of common mental disorders. Symptoms were assessed with two short checklists. Logistic and hierarchical logistic models were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy and the added diagnostic value of FD assessment in detecting GAD and MDE.

For GAD, FD alone had a diagnostic accuracy of 0.79 (GAF), 0.79 (ASF), and 0.78 (WHODAS), while for MDE it was 0.83, 0.84, and 0.81, respectively. Self-reported measures of FD improved the diagnostic performance of the number of symptoms (4% AUC increase) for GAD, but not for MDE. If assessed before symptom evaluation, FD can discriminate well between patients with and without GAD/MDE. When assessed together with symptoms, self-reported methods improve GAD detection rates.

### Quality of life outcomes among patients with depression after 6 months of starting treatment: Results from FINDER [^112vw6KV]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data in depression are limited. We studied the impact of antidepressant (AD) treatment on HRQoL outcomes in depressed patients and investigated factors associated with these outcomes in routine practice settings.

- **Methods**: The Factors Influencing Depression Endpoints Research (FINDER) study was a 6-month, European, prospective, observational study designed to estimate HRQoL in 3,468 adult patients with a clinically diagnosed episode of depression at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after commencing AD treatment. HRQoL was assessed by the Medical Outcome Short-Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). Regression analysis identified baseline and treatment variables independently and significantly associated with HRQoL outcomes.

- **Results**: Most HRQoL improvement occurred within 3 months of starting treatment. Better HRQoL outcomes were strongly associated with fewer somatic symptoms at baseline, AD treatment taken without switching to different AD groups, education, and occupational status. Depression variables, such as the number of previous depressions and episode duration, were consistently associated with worse HRQoL outcomes. Self-rated depression severity was associated with poorer outcomes on the SF-36 mental component only.

- **Limitations**: As this was an observational study, the important finding that between and within AD group switching impacted HRQoL will need to be investigated in more controlled settings.

- **Conclusions**: Receiving an AD treatment was associated with large improvements in HRQoL within the first 3 months. Other factors influencing outcomes included somatic symptoms, AD adherence, education level, and occupational status.

### Quality of life across domains among individuals with treatment-resistant depression [^111PdzQ9]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression affects millions of people worldwide and is a leading cause of disability and suicide. Studies of treatment-resistant depression outcomes have traditionally focused on depressive symptoms and functional impairment, while quality of life (QoL) has not been well described. This study aimed to measure QoL in individuals with treatment-resistant depression and to determine how QoL relates to traditional measures of symptoms and social functioning.

- **Methods**: We used a reliable, cross-culturally validated questionnaire, the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF), to prospectively measure QoL in 79 patients with treatment-resistant depression who were referred for electroconvulsive therapy at a United States tertiary-care medical center. QoL was characterized in four domains: physical, psychological, social, and environmental. QoL domains were examined for association with demographic variables, patient-reported depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and childhood adversity, as well as clinician-rated scales.

- **Results**: Relative to published international norms, mean QoL scores were low in physical (standardized score, z = -2.0), psychological (z = -2.6), and social (z = -1.0) domains, but not in the environmental domain (z = 0.2). After controlling for age and income, patient-rated depressive symptoms correlated with physical (Pearson correlation, r = -0.26) and psychological (r = -0.43) QoL, whereas adverse childhood experiences correlated with environmental QoL (r = -0.33).

### Major depressive disorder [^115weCuF]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on major depressive disorder:

- **Definition**: MDD is a mood disorder characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness that represents a change from previous functioning, often accompanied by loss of interest and alterations in cognition, sleep, and appetite.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of MDD is complex and remains poorly understood. Heritability is estimated at 35%. Predisposing genetic vulnerabilities interact with adverse and protective environmental factors to produce disease. At least some of the environmental effects are mediated through epigenetic mechanisms.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of MDD are estimated at 10.4% and 20.6%, respectively.

- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations include alterations in behavior and mood, impaired cognitive function, and suicidal ideation.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: MDD increases the risk of mortality by 60–80%. The contribution of MDD to all-cause mortality is estimated at up to 10%.

### On the nature of objective and perceived cognitive impairments in depressive symptoms and real-world functioning in young adults [^1135mi1U]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairments in depression contribute to disability. According to prevailing cognitive theories, one's perception related to cognitive ability can cause and maintain depression and related outcomes. Here, we investigate the degree to which perceived cognitive impairment predicts functional impairment above and beyond objective neurocognition. A sample of young adults (n = 123) completed a battery of tests measuring objective cognitive ability, perceived cognitive function (e.g. Perceived Deficits Questionnaire), disability (e.g. World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule), and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-2).

Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested the incremental variance that perceived cognitive impairment accounts for above and beyond neuropsychological test measures and disability related to depression. Results show that perceived cognitive impairment accounts for significant incremental variance in depressive symptoms beyond neuropsychological test scores; disability measures were significantly associated with depressive symptoms, as was perceived cognitive impairment. Individuals with depression and related disorders are more likely to report cognitive impairments and experience diminished cognitive ability — relative to healthy controls — regardless of objective impairments. This finding highlights the importance of considering, measuring, and treating perceived cognitive impairment, known as Cognitive Impairment Bias.

### Automated classification of depression from structural brain measures across two independent community-based cohorts [^111hBvsx]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Low credibility.

Depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is a prevalent psychiatric condition which affects, on average, between 10% and 15% of the general population over their lifetime in countries around the world. It is among the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and was estimated to cost €92 billion in Europe and $210 billion in the United States in 2010. Reliable diagnosis of depression remains a challenge, and recent research indicates a particularly low rate of diagnostic agreement between specialists. This emphasizes the importance of developing better, more reliable, and objective diagnostic methods for the illness.

### Quality of life assessments in major depressive disorder: A review of the literature [^117579m7]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

According to the DSM-IV classification, a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is possible only when there is evidence of significant interference with functioning. Despite the high prevalence of MDD in the general population, it is uncommon for clinicians to assess overall functioning systematically before making such a diagnosis. An important correlate of functioning is quality of life, typically defined as "patients' own assessments of how they feel about what they have, how they are functioning, and their ability to derive pleasure from their life activities".

In the present article, we review studies focusing on the relationship between depression and quality of life, particularly focusing on the impact of the treatment of depression on quality of life. Candidate studies published between 1970 and recently were initially identified by PubMed and Ovid searches, cross-referencing the terms "quality of life" and "psychosocial functioning" with "major depression" and "treatment".

A number of studies report poorer quality of life in MDD patients compared to controls. Several studies also report an improvement in quality of life measures during various phases of treatment with antidepressants and/or psychotherapy. However, trials comparing the role of newer psychopharmacologic agents in the acute phase of treatment and the role of newer psychotherapies in the continuation and maintenance phases of treatment in restoring psychosocial functioning and improving the quality of life in MDD are lacking.

### Life events and treatment prognosis for depression: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^117CEk85]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The study underscores the importance of understanding patient history when treating depression. Depressed patients reporting severely stressful life events had worse prognoses. Reporting three or more such events was associated with considerably worse outcomes. This negative association held for patients with long-standing conditions and those experiencing a first depressive episode. However, effects were attenuated by variables potentially influenced by these life events. Clinicians should routinely inquire about patients' life events and assess their impact on treatment outcomes.

### Evaluating the effect of exercise-based interventions on functioning in people with transdiagnostic depressive symptoms: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^113HFndY]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Depressive symptoms are associated with various conditions and can exacerbate the outcomes of somatic diseases. Transdiagnostic symptom-based approaches provide treatment flexibility, and exercise has demonstrated benefits beyond clinical symptoms. This work aimed to synthesize and establish the effects of exercise-based interventions on global functioning and quality of life in adults with transdiagnostic depressive symptoms, as well as their impact on clinical symptoms.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to April 2023. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials involving adults with transdiagnostic depressive symptoms who received exercise-based interventions and provided details of the interventions. Comparators included treatment as usual or other active control groups. The Cochrane quality assessment tool was used for quality assessment.

- **Results**: Fifteen articles involving 2064 participants were included. Data on study design, sample, intervention characteristics, and outcomes were extracted. Several trials demonstrated the expected positive effects of exercise on functioning (7/15). Most results supported the benefits of adjunctive exercise interventions on illness outcomes.

- **Limitations**: The studies had methodological limitations, including small sample sizes and underrepresentation of somatic diseases.

- **Conclusions**: The functional consequences of exercise-based interventions targeting depressive symptoms are often understudied.

### Optimal cutoff point of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression according to normal levels of social and occupational functioning [^115BzP1v]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

The main goal in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) is to achieve remission, defined as the resolution of symptoms and the return to normal levels of functionality. However, the clinical assessment of remission is usually merely based on scores of symptomatic rating scales. One of the most widely used scales to measure remission is the HAM-D(17), in which remission is defined as a score ≤ 7. Nevertheless, several studies have shown that this cutoff could be too high when functioning is also considered.

This is a post-hoc analysis of a 6-month prospective study performed over a sample of 292 Spanish patients with MDD to find the optimal cutoff in the HAM-D(17) scale, considering normal levels of functionality evaluated by the SOFAS, by means of plotting Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves. Our results show that a score of ≤ 5 maximized both sensitivity and specificity for identifying normal levels of functionality with respect to other scores and thus agree with previous works, which suggest that a cutoff ≤ 7 might be too high to consider remission in patients with MDD when normal levels of functioning are taken into account.

### Life events and treatment prognosis for depression: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^115NLXiu]. Journal of affective disorders (2022). High credibility.

Stressful life events are common; in the present sample, over 70% reported at least one event in the past 6 months. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to it have resulted in increases in people experiencing major life events, particularly serious illness, bereavement, unemployment, and problematic debt. We would expect that, on average, people experiencing such events will be more likely to feel distressed and will be at greater risk of becoming depressed, whether that be with a first lifetime episode or a recurrent one.

This study has shown that life events may play a role in prognosis for patients seeking treatment for depression in primary care, regardless of treatment type, and whether or not they had chronic depression or were presenting with a first lifetime depressive episode. However, the effects were largely shared with variables that might have been affected by the events (depressive severity, social support, marital status, employment status, and financial strain), and there are a number of important problems with the use of solely self-report checklist measures of life events. It may be most informative for prognosis to first assess clinical, socio-demographic, and contextual prognostic factors. When considering life events, a more thorough method of assessment should be used to consider the ongoing impact of any life events at the point the patient presents. This does not mean that clinicians should not ask their patients about experiences of any such life events; indeed, it is important to do so to gather comprehensive information about the patient's condition and potential prognosis.

### Life events and treatment prognosis for depression: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^115AYpuD]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Use of a standardized outcome has been criticized, but the results using the z-score outcome were similar to those with the log outcome and the secondary and sensitivity outcomes, suggesting no substantive impact on the results. Alternative outcomes may be of use in future research. For example, if studies incorporate more regular outcome measurement schedules, they could provide a more fine-grained assessment over time of the impact of major life events on outcomes. Indeed, it would be informative for future research to address the hypothesis that severely stressful acute events lead to a longer time to remission, even if they do not greatly impact overall prognosis 3–4 months after commencing treatment.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1137zVc3]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, especially in elderly patients with comorbidities, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients with both depression and a complicating factor:

- **Combination of CBT (individual) and usual care**: For minor or major depressive disorder with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- **Multicomponent intervention (individual)**: For treating symptoms of depression in temporarily homebound African American adults.

- **Coping improvement (group)**: Rather than psychotherapy on request (individual), for older adults with mild-to-severe depressive symptoms and HIV.

### Depression, violence and socioeconomic outcomes among refugees in EAST Africa: Evidence from a multicountry representative survey [^111ov8Pk]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). Low credibility.

Following recent advances in clinical depression research, we considered two measures related to depression: symptoms and functioning.

We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms. The PHQ-9 has been validated and widely used in various settings in African countries, including among refugees from Somalia, South Sudan, and DR Congo. We consider and compare two measures in the analysis: the continuous score and a dichotomized score using the cut-off score of 10, indicating moderate to severe depressive symptoms. The internal consistency of the PHQ-9 was good, with a Cronbach's α of 0.88 for the whole sample.

We used six questions from the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) to measure functional impairment in four domains of life: mobility, life activities, cognition, and participation. WHODAS 2.0 has shown good reliability and validity and has been tested in various cultural settings. The internal consistency of the WHODAS 2.0 in our sample was high (0.82).

The distribution of these variables by nationality is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2:

- **Measures of mental health and functioning**: Note: (A) shows the average PHQ-9 score for each refugee strata. (B) shows the proportion of respondents from each refugee strata that have a PHQ-9 score of 10 or above, which is an indicator of moderate to severe depression. (C) presents the average of the functional impairment score, which aggregates respondents' answers to six questions of the WHODAS 2.0 instrument. Data come from the Refugee Economies Dataset.

### The burden of recurrent depression: causes, consequences, and future prospects [^115hNDKC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Depression represents one of the most profound human problems currently facing the global health care system. It is a prevalent clinical condition and is estimated to rival virtually every other known medical illness in burden of disease morbidity early in this millennium. Understanding the chronic nature of this illness is key to the development of a more informed, longitudinal perspective on the diagnosis and treatment of depression. In this report, the morbid impact of depression is reviewed, from the perspectives of illness symptoms, societal impact, and emerging evidence of critical neurobiological consequences of the untreated condition. Reconceptualizing major depression from this longitudinal and multidimensional perspective is crucial to providing an effective response to this critical public health challenge.

### The symptom and function dimensions of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale [^116hLBLJ]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The objective was to investigate the validity and clinical impact of the symptom and function dimensions of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition. Is there any need for revision with respect to the DSM, Fifth Edition?

The sample comprised 2,695 patients consecutively admitted to 14 different treatment units participating in the Norwegian Network of Personality-Focused Treatment Programs from 1998 to 2007.

- **Methods**: Convergent and discriminant validity of the symptom and function dimensions of GAF was analyzed by their associations with demographic variables, diagnostic status, and other self-reported variables assessing symptom distress, interpersonal problems, work and social impairment, and quality of life.

- **Results**: The validity of the separate GAF dimensions was confirmed by discriminant and convergent associations to other relevant clinical measures. However, the traditional GAF measure, based on the lower score of either symptom or function level, was found to serve well as a global indicator of symptom distress and social dysfunction. A substantial difference between the symptom and function score of GAF was found in about 10% of the cases; when differences were found, functional impairment was most often more severe.

This study confirms the validity of the two GAF dimensions. However, substantial differences between these dimensions rarely occur. We therefore recommend that the GAF scale be prolonged in the DSM, Fifth Edition.
