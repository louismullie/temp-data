## Question

How do the treatment strategies differ between transient AF and PAF?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how treatment strategies differ between transient AF and paroxysmal AF, with a clear plan and verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions to anchor the distinction. Then, I should verify the core principle for stroke prevention and how it differs by scenario. Next, I will review rhythm-control versus rate-control implications, including pill-in-the-pocket, early rhythm control, and ablation. After that, I should examine anticoagulation for cardioversion and the special case of device-detected subclinical AF. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and pitfalls in real-world practice.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because conflating transient and paroxysmal AF leads to mismanagement. Paroxysmal AF is recurrent, intermittent AF that terminates spontaneously within 7 days, typically under 48 hours, and it remains a chronic disorder with likely recurrence over time [^113bahiS] [^1157WEdH]. Transient AF is not a formal classification in major guidelines; it colloquially refers to a single, self-limited episode, often triggered by acute illness, surgery, or electrolyte derangement, and importantly it is excluded from standard antithrombotic recommendations, so I need to be careful not to label a one-off episode as AF requiring long-term therapy [^1152zuv3]. Hold on, I should verify the pattern-based framework: contemporary guidelines categorize AF as paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent, and they discourage legacy terms like "chronic" or "lone AF", reinforcing that PAF is a pattern, not a transient event [^116WJdoc] [^1138h2Ev].

> Now, I need to check the stroke-prevention principle, because this drives the biggest divergence. For established AF, including paroxysmal, anticoagulation decisions are based on stroke risk scores (CHA2DS2-VASc), not on the temporal pattern of AF; thus, PAF patients with elevated stroke risk should receive oral anticoagulation regardless of intermittent episodes [^111113pp] [^1139acHb]. Wait, let me verify that both US and European guidance align here: ACC/AHA and ESC both state therapy should be risk-based, independent of paroxysmal versus persistent designation, which confirms this foundational point [^111113pp] [^1139acHb]. I should double-check the rationale: even PAF carries nontrivial stroke risk comparable to persistent AF in many cohorts, which is why withholding anticoagulation in PAF solely due to intermittent episodes is inappropriate [^114wFy3c].

> For transient AF, I initially thought, "no AF, no anticoagulation", but wait, that is too categorical; I should correct myself. The more precise principle is that a single, self-limited episode attributable to a reversible precipitant generally does not warrant long-term anticoagulation, yet stroke risk still needs assessment in context and the episode warrants documentation and follow-up because recurrence may occur; this nuance prevents undertreatment of evolving AF and over-treatment of isolated events [^1152zuv3]. Hold on, I should verify secondary prevention nuances: after a cryptogenic stroke or TIA, even device-detected brief AF shifts the calculus toward anticoagulation, so "transient" in that setting is not the same as a one-off postoperative episode without cerebrovascular disease [^113A2u6n] [^111rzXiD].

> Next, I will examine rhythm strategy, because symptom burden and AF burden often steer management in PAF. In symptomatic PAF, rhythm control can improve quality of life; options include antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation, with contemporary data supporting ablation as a first-line option in selected patients, particularly younger individuals with few comorbidities and when symptoms are significant [^114u3ypp] [^111xPLCQ]. Let me consider pharmacologic rhythm control: a "pill-in-the-pocket" approach with flecainide or propafenone is reasonable for highly symptomatic, infrequent PAF episodes after inpatient safety confirmation, aligning treatment with episodic needs and patient preference [^116U9NKv]. But wait, what if AF burden is increasing? Earlier rhythm control, including early after diagnosis, is associated with better outcomes in observational and randomized data, so timing matters in PAF trajectories [^116b62ru].

> For transient AF, I should confirm that rhythm control is usually unnecessary once the precipitating factor is corrected. Once electrolytes, infection, hypoxia, or perioperative triggers are addressed, observation and treatment of the underlying condition suffice; prolonged antiarrhythmic therapy is generally not indicated for a single, self-limited episode without evidence of recurrent AF, though I need to ensure there is no unrecognized substrate or recurrence before concluding definitive management [^notfound]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "never treat transient AF", but I should verify exceptions: if a transient episode is profoundly symptomatic or hemodynamically compromising, acute rate or rhythm strategies may be warranted acutely even if long-term therapy is not planned, which preserves clinical flexibility [^115TCGPH].

> I will now review ablation, since this is where PAF and "transient AF" diverge meaningfully. In PAF, pulmonary vein isolation achieves higher success than in persistent AF, and contemporary guidelines endorse ablation as first-line to improve symptoms and reduce progression in appropriately selected patients, supported by randomized trials and meta-analyses showing superior arrhythmia-free survival versus antiarrhythmic drugs [^114u3ypp] [^115F3FkG]. Let me double-check timing considerations: earlier ablation in the disease course is increasingly favored to forestall atrial remodeling, though patient selection and shared decision-making remain essential given procedural risks and variable natural history [^112yR4Cj]. In contrast, for a true single transient episode, ablation has no role and should not be offered, reinforcing the definitional boundary that separates transient events from established AF patterns [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify anticoagulation around cardioversion, because that intersects with both scenarios. If AF duration is 48 hours or unknown, guidelines require therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 weeks before and at least 4 weeks after cardioversion, or a TEE-guided strategy with heparin bridging; this applies to any AF pattern, including paroxysmal, and remains relevant when PAF episodes are prolonged enough to meet these thresholds [^114Xzh5h]. For truly brief transient AF under 48 hours with clear onset and no structural heart disease, cardioversion without prolonged anticoagulation may be reasonable, but I need to ensure there are no additional risk factors and that local expertise supports this approach to avoid thromboembolism [^114Xzh5h].

> I should also consider device-detected subclinical AF, because it blurs the "transient" versus "established AF" boundary. Brief, asymptomatic AF detected by pacemakers or implantable devices is associated with increased stroke risk proportional to burden, and stroke prevention should follow CHA2DS2-VASc–based risk rather than dismissing these episodes as "transient", which argues for structured surveillance and anticoagulation when indicated rather than watchful waiting [^1128tw2z] [^111Q1eza]. Let me reconsider whether guidelines address burden thresholds; while exact cutoffs remain debated, the direction is clear that risk-based anticoagulation is appropriate when subclinical AF is present and stroke risk is elevated, reinforcing that "transient" in this context does not equal negligible risk [^111Q1eza].

> Next, I should review real-world pitfalls to ensure the clinical translation is sound. Despite guideline direction, patients with PAF are less likely to receive appropriate oral anticoagulation than those with persistent AF, even at similar stroke risk, leading to preventable thromboembolism; this gap mandates vigilance in applying CHA2DS2-VASc consistently across AF patterns [^113HaQW9]. But wait, what if the label is "resolved AF"? Even then, patients remain at elevated stroke risk and should generally continue anticoagulation according to pre-resolution risk unless a compelling reason exists, which cautions against premature cessation of therapy after cardioversion or ablation [^114tK5C8] [^112sgN5b].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the decision framework is explicit. For paroxysmal AF, treat as chronic AF: base stroke prevention on CHA2DS2-VASc, individualize rate versus rhythm control based on symptoms and patient factors, consider early rhythm control in appropriate candidates, and offer ablation as first-line in selected symptomatic patients; for a true transient AF episode, correct the precipitant, avoid long-term anticoagulation, and arrange follow-up to detect recurrence that would reclassify the patient and alter management [^111113pp] [^114u3ypp] [^1152zuv3]. Hold on, let me verify that this synthesis aligns with major guidelines: yes, both ACC/AHA and ESC endorse risk-based anticoagulation regardless of AF pattern and support early rhythm control or ablation strategies in suitable PAF patients, while transient, reversible episodes are managed expectantly with risk reassessment if AF recurs [^111113pp] [^114u3ypp].

Transient AF and paroxysmal AF differ in **duration and recurrence** [^113bahiS], so their management also diverges. Transient AF is a single, self-limited episode [^1152zuv3] triggered by acute illness or reversible causes; management focuses on **treating the trigger** and **no routine anticoagulation** unless the patient is high risk. Paroxysmal AF is recurrent, with episodes ≤ 7 days [^113bahiS]; management includes **stroke risk assessment** (CHA₂DS₂-VASc) [^111113pp] with anticoagulation for scores ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women [^notfound], and rhythm control with antiarrhythmics or ablation [^114u3ypp] if symptomatic [^112DfBym]. Anticoagulation is guided by **stroke risk**, not AF pattern [^111Q1eza] [^111aD7uv].

## Definitions and clinical characteristics

| **Attribute** | **Transient af** | **Paroxysmal af** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Single, self-limited episode triggered by acute illness or reversible causes (e.g. surgery, infection, electrolyte imbalance) [^1152zuv3] | Recurrent AF episodes ≤ 7 days, terminating spontaneously or with intervention [^114dzjBT] |
| Recurrence | No recurrence after trigger resolution | Recurrent episodes over time |
| Clinical context | Acute illness or reversible precipitant | Chronic arrhythmia with intermittent episodes |
| Stroke risk | Generally low unless high-risk features present | Stroke risk similar to persistent/permanent AF; risk-based anticoagulation recommended [^113HaQW9] |

---

## Management strategies

### Transient AF

Transient AF management centers on **identifying and treating the underlying trigger** — such as infection, electrolyte disturbance, or hypoxia — and on supportive care, including rate control and monitoring. Anticoagulation is not routine [^111Q1eza]; it is considered only when high-risk features are present (e.g. prior stroke/TIA, high CHA₂DS₂-VASc) [^111Q1eza].

---

### Paroxysmal AF

Paroxysmal AF management includes **stroke risk assessment** using CHA₂DS₂-VASc [^111113pp], with anticoagulation for men with scores ≥ 2 and women with scores ≥ 3 [^notfound]. Rate control uses beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin [^notfound], and rhythm control employs antiarrhythmics (flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, dronedarone, amiodarone) [^116U9NKv] or catheter ablation [^114u3ypp], particularly for symptomatic patients or when rhythm control is desired [^111xPLCQ]. Lifestyle and risk-factor modification address hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, alcohol, and diabetes [^notfound].

---

## Anticoagulation considerations

Transient AF does not require routine anticoagulation [^notfound] unless high-risk features are present, in which case it should be individualized [^111aD7uv]. In contrast, paroxysmal AF warrants **risk-based anticoagulation** [^111113pp] according to CHA₂DS₂-VASc, independent of AF pattern [^1139acHb].

---

## Role of catheter ablation

Transient AF does not involve catheter ablation, as it is a single, self-limited episode. Paroxysmal AF considers ablation for **symptomatic patients** [^112gUYx7], particularly as first-line therapy in selected patients [^111xPLCQ], to reduce symptoms, recurrence, and progression [^114u3ypp].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Transient AF requires follow-up to ensure trigger resolution and monitor for recurrence, with ECGs or ambulatory monitoring as indicated. Paroxysmal AF necessitates **regular follow-up** to assess symptoms, recurrence, and stroke risk, with ECGs, ambulatory monitoring, or implantable devices when indicated [^111113pp].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **Transient af** | **Paroxysmal af** |
|-|-|-|
| Recurrence | Single episode | Recurrent episodes |
| Anticoagulation | Only if high-risk features | Risk-based (CHA₂DS₂-VASc) |
| Ablation | Not indicated | Considered if symptomatic |
| Follow-up | Monitor for recurrence | Regular monitoring |

---

Transient AF and paroxysmal AF differ in duration and recurrence, which drives distinct management. Transient AF focuses on **trigger treatment** and **no routine anticoagulation**, whereas paroxysmal AF uses stroke risk assessment, anticoagulation, and rhythm control strategies [^111113pp].

### Overview of the management of atrial fibrillation: what is the current state of the art? [^114VTEob]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Management of Atrial Fibrillation. There are three fundamental approaches to the management of atrial fibrillation (AF): rate control, rhythm control, and anticoagulation. Selecting a course of treatment requires a thorough knowledge of these therapeutic alternatives. This article explores treatment options, including the relative benefits of rate control versus rhythm control, which are complicated by the lack of highly effective and safe antiarrhythmic drugs. Anticoagulation is also an important issue in AF management, and warfarin effectively reduces the incidence of thromboembolic events in AF patients. The use of warfarin, however, presents its own complications. We conclude that individualization of therapy is paramount when treating AF.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive disorder, often transitioning from intermittent to continuous arrhythmia. Patients experiencing episodic AF, self-terminating within 7 days, are said to have paroxysmal AF; patients whose arrhythmia persists beyond 7 days (or requires intervention to terminate) are considered to have persistent AF. Several prior studies have documented symptomatic, physiologic, and anatomic differences between patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF. This categorization of AF can also have important implications for approaches to maintain sinus rhythm. All the patients with AF are at an increased risk of thrombo-embolism (stroke or systemic embolism) compared with patients without AF, and anticoagulation therapies are recommended in all patients with AF who are at moderate-to-high risk of stroke. The distinction between paroxysmal and persistent AF has not been used to guide choice of stroke prophylaxis, as it remains unclear whether patients with persistent AF are at higher risk compared with those with paroxysmal AF, particularly in patients with additional risk factors for stroke. The objectives of the current analysis were to (i) measure the differences, if any, in outcomes between anticoagulated patients with persistent vs. paroxysmal AF who had additional risk factors for stroke, and (ii) determine whether there was a difference in treatment effect between rivaroxaban and warfarin in these groups.

### Towards a new classification of atrial fibrillation detected after a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack [^113qYdwE]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Globally, up to 1·5 million individuals with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack can be newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation per year. In the past decade, evidence has accumulated supporting the notion that atrial fibrillation first detected after a stroke or transient ischaemic attack differs from atrial fibrillation known before the occurrence of as stroke. Atrial fibrillation detected after stroke is associated with a lower prevalence of risk factors, cardiovascular comorbidities, and atrial cardiomyopathy than atrial fibrillation known before stroke occurrence. These differences might explain why it is associated with a lower risk of recurrence of ischaemic stroke than known atrial fibrillation. Patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack can be classified in three categories: no atrial fibrillation, known atrial fibrillation before stroke occurrence, and atrial fibrillation detected after stroke. This classification could harmonise future research in the field and help to understand the role of prolonged cardiac monitoring for secondary stroke prevention with application of a personalised risk-based approach to the selection of patients for anticoagulation.

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^113hdVtZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — Goals and endpoints for pharmacological therapy: "Whether paroxysmal or persistent, AF is a chronic disorder, and recurrence at some point is likely in most patients". Pharmacological therapy "is indicated in patients who have troublesome symptoms related to paroxysmal AF or recurrent AF after cardioversion who can tolerate antiarrhythmic drugs and have a good chance of remaining in sinus rhythm over an extended period". Study endpoints and quality vary: "The number and quality of studies with each drug are limited; endpoints vary", and "because of clustering of recurrences in the first few weeks after cardioversion, the median time to first recurrence detected by transtelephonic monitoring may not differ between 2 treatment strategies". Importantly, "Recurrence of AF is not equivalent to treatment failure", and "Underlying heart disease or extracardiac disease is present in 80% of patients with persistent AF". Trials "included few patients at risk of drug-induced HF, proarrhythmia, or conduction disturbances".

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — recurrence and predictors: An AFFIRM substudy found that with AF recurrence, if one is willing to cardiovert and continue or change the antiarrhythmic drug, about 80% of all patients will be in sinus rhythm by the end of 1 y. Most patients with AF, except those with postoperative or self-limited AF secondary to transient or acute illness, eventually experience recurrence, and risk factors for frequent recurrence of paroxysmal AF (more than 1 episode per month) include female gender and underlying heart disease. In one study of patients with persistent AF, the 4-y arrhythmia-free survival rate was less than 10% after single-shock direct-current cardioversion without prophylactic drug therapy, with predictors of recurrences including hypertension, age over 55 y, and AF duration longer than 3 mo. Serial cardioversions and prophylactic drug therapy resulted in freedom from recurrent AF in approximately 30% of patients, and with this approach predictors of recurrence included age over 70 y, AF duration beyond 3 mo, and HF; other risk factors include LA enlargement and rheumatic heart disease.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: translating clinical trial data into clinical practice [^115kRx1A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

### Meta-analysis of cryoballoon ablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs as initial therapy for symptomatic atrial fibrillation [^115F3FkG]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal first-line approach for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. We compared the efficacy and safety of cryoballoon ablation (CBA) and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in the initial management of symptomatic AF.

Hypothesis

CBA is superior to AAD as initial therapy for symptomatic AF.

Methods

We searched the EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CBA with AAD as first-line treatment for AF from the date of database establishment until March 18, 2021. The risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as a measure of treatment effect.

Results

Three RCTs that enrolled 724 patients in total were included in this meta-analysis. Majority of the patients were relatively young and had paroxysmal AF. CBA was associated with a significant reduction in the recurrence of atrial arrhythmia compared with AAD therapy, with low heterogeneity (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49–0.71; p < .00001; I² = 0%). There was a significant difference in the rate of symptomatic atrial arrhythmia recurrence (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.29–0.65; p < .0001; I² = 0%); however, the rate of serious adverse events was similar between the two treatment groups (RR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.71–1.97, p = .53; I² = 0%). Transient phrenic nerve palsy occurred in four patients after the CBA procedure.

Conclusion

The current meta-analysis suggests that CBA is more effective than AAD as initial therapy in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF. Serious iatrogenic adverse events are uncommon in CBAs.

Clinical response outcomes in the minimum set — treatment and management targets are defined: Three clinical response measures are included in the minimum set and are divided into 'Treatment Response' and 'Overall Management Response'; AF, atrial flutter (AFL), or atrial tachycardia (AT) recurrence and AF progression (paroxysmal to persistent AF) are recommended to capture treatment response for treatments such as catheter ablation, surgical ablation, or antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and thromboembolic events, defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolism, should be measured to assess clinical response with respect to AF management.

### A contemporary look at classic trials in atrial fibrillation: what do they really show and how might they apply to future therapies? [^1118epK3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia associated with significant morbidity, decreased exercise tolerance, and impairment of quality of life (QOL). Primary treatment objectives are either to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm or to achieve satisfactory rate control. There are 5 landmark randomized trials comparing rhythm and rate control strategies that have reported equivalence in overall survival, and data from several trials suggest that the appropriate use of either approach leads to improvement in QOL. Study limitations (eg, trial design, analytic methodology, patient selection criteria, and lack of specificity of therapeutic intervention), however, have made the applicability of findings to a general AF patient population difficult. Although the optimal strategy remains unclear, an important first step in AF management is the proper identification and stratification of patients who require therapy. Given the currently available pharmacologic agents and procedures, as-needed therapy may be a reasonable approach in patients with intermittent AF, whereas the pursuit of sinus rhythm may be warranted in the balance of patients who remain symptomatic despite rate control therapy. The overarching treatment goal should be to provide individualized care based on patient characteristics at presentation, with appropriate consideration given to potential treatment-related adverse effects. Importantly, as the armamentarium of AF management strategies is broadened, the risk/efficacy balance must continue to be evaluated on a patient-specific basis.

Hypothesis

CBA is superior to AAD as initial therapy for symptomatic AF.

Proposed management strategies — Management of patients with AF requires knowledge of its pattern of presentation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent), underlying conditions, and decisions about restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, control of the ventricular rate, and antithrombotic therapy, and these issues are addressed in the various management algorithms for each presentation of AF.

### Arrhythmia termination versus elimination of dormant pulmonary vein conduction as a procedural end point of catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a prospective randomized trial [^112vdZxA]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background —

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is still associated with a substantial number of arrhythmia recurrences in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). This prospective, randomized study aimed to compare 2 different procedural strategies.

Methods and Results —

A total of 152 patients undergoing de novo ablation for paroxysmal AF were randomized to 2 different treatment arms. The procedure in group A consisted of PVI exclusively. In this group, all isolated PVs were challenged with adenosine to reveal and ablate dormant conduction. In group B, PVI was performed with the patient either in spontaneous or in induced AF. If AF did not terminate with PVI, ablation was continued by targeting extra-PV AF sources with the desired procedural end point of termination to sinus rhythm. Primary study end point was freedom from arrhythmia during 1-year follow-up. In group A, adenosine provoked dormant conduction in 31 (41%) patients with a mean of 1.6 ± 0.8 transiently recovered PVs per patient. Termination of AF during PVI was observed in 31 (65%) patients, whereas AF persisted afterward in 17 (35%) patients. AF termination occurred in 13 (76%) patients by AF source ablation. After 1-year follow-up, significantly more group B patients were free of arrhythmia recurrences (87 versus 68%; P = 0.006). During redo ablation, the rate of PV reconduction did not differ between both groups (group A: 55% versus group B: 61%; P = 0.25).

Conclusions —

Elimination of extra-PV AF sources after PVI is superior to sole PV isolation with the adjunct of abolishing potential dormant conduction.

### Differences in anticoagulant therapy prescription in patients with paroxysmal versus persistent atrial fibrillation [^113HaQW9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation experience a similar risk of thromboembolism. Therefore, consensus guidelines recommend anticoagulant therapy in those at risk for thromboembolism irrespective of atrial fibrillation classification. We sought to examine whether there are differences in rates of appropriate oral anticoagulant treatment among patients with paroxysmal vs persistent atrial fibrillation in real-world cardiology practices.

Methods

We studied 71,316 outpatients with atrial fibrillation and intermediate to high thromboembolic risk (CHADS2 score ≥ 2) enrolled in the American College of Cardiology PINNACLE Registry between 2008 and 2012. Using hierarchical modified Poisson regression models adjusted for patient characteristics, we examined whether anticoagulant treatment rates differed between patients with paroxysmal vs persistent atrial fibrillation.

Results

The majority of outpatients (78.4%, n = 55,905) had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In both unadjusted and multivariable adjusted analyses, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were less frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant therapy than those with persistent atrial fibrillation (50.3% vs 64.2%; adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.76). Instead, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were prescribed more frequently only antiplatelet therapy (35.1% vs 25.0%; adjusted RR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.69–1.86) or neither antiplatelet nor anticoagulant therapy (14.6% vs 10.8%; adjusted RR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.26–1.44; P < .0001 for differences across all 3 comparisons).

Conclusions

In a large, real-world cardiac outpatient population, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a moderate to high risk of stroke were less likely to be prescribed appropriate oral anticoagulant therapy and more likely to be prescribed less effective or no therapy for thromboembolism prevention.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — scope and applicability — excludes recommendations for patients with AF around surgical or invasive procedures, at presentation with acute stroke, with prosthetic heart valves, or who are pregnant; recommendations apply to persistent and permanent AF and to PAF but not to a single, transient, self-limited AF episode associated with acute illness. For patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease, intracoronary stent placement, or recent ACS (section 3.1–3.3), the effect of treatment options on nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) was also considered.

### Rhythm versus rate control trials in atrial fibrillation [^116sBWFF]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

The recent completion of five trials comparing the strategy of rhythm control versus the strategy of rate control in the management of recurrent atrial fibrillation has advanced considerably our understanding of the treatment of this common clinical problem. The background to this research question is outlined, followed by an overview of the five trials and their results. Data on important clinical events from four of the trials are pooled and presented. The aggregate results of the trials do not demonstrate any clear advantage of the rhythm control approach. The findings elevate rate control to the position of an acceptable primary therapy in the types of patients studied and underline the concept that the primary goal of antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation at this time is control of symptoms. Under these circumstances, a "safety first" approach is prudent and monitoring for adverse drug effects is mandatory. The results underscore the importance of continuous anticoagulation in patients with stroke risk factors. Finally, the results from these trials help to set the agenda for future research on rhythm management in atrial fibrillation.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111113pp]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation — synopsis and supportive text — states that prevention "is important in patients with AF to maximize survival, health, and QOL", and therapy selection "should be guided by the patient's risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and individual preferences". Decisions "should" be based on stroke risk "regardless of the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent)" and "should be periodically reassessed since a patient's risk, eligibility, and preferences can change over time". Supportive text adds that although risk is higher with more persistent AF, therapy "should be based on the risk of stroke and not the pattern of AF", and that "Treatment effects with oral anticoagulation are consistent across AF patterns". Ongoing follow-up is emphasized: "Typically, periodic assessment should be performed once a year but might need to be performed more frequently" with clinical changes such as "reduction in renal function or development of additional risk factors".

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1158Lr4Q]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke varies considerably across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Antithrombotic prophylaxis for stroke is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

We used the methods described in the Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines article of this supplement.

Results

For patients with nonrheumatic AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are (1) at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS(2) [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack] score of 0), we suggest no therapy rather than antithrombotic therapy, and for patients choosing antithrombotic therapy, we suggest aspirin rather than oral anticoagulation or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; (2) at intermediate risk of stroke (eg, CHADS(2) score of 1), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, and we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and (3) at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS(2) score of ≥ 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest dabigatran 150 mg bid rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF at high risk of stroke (CHADS(2) score of ≥ 2). At lower levels of stroke risk, antithrombotic treatment decisions will require a more individualized approach.

Figure 4 — AF stages: evolution of atrial arrhythmia progression defines AF subtypes and management prompts. Paroxysmal AF (3A) is AF that is intermittent and terminates within 7 d of onset; Persistent AF (3B) is AF that is continuous and sustains for ≥ 7 d and requires intervention; Long-standing persistent AF (3C) is AF that is continuous for ≥ 12 mo in duration; and Successful AF ablation (3D) is freedom from AF after percutaneous or surgical intervention to eliminate AF. Permanent AF is described as no further attempts at rhythm control after discussion between patient and clinician. Management prompts include Treat Modifiable Risk Factors, Consider heightened surveillance, Ongoing monitoring as clinically appropriate for AF burden, and Stroke risk assessment and therapy if appropriate.

### Risk of stroke and transient ischaemic attack in patients with a diagnosis of resolved atrial fibrillation: retrospective cohort studies [^112WxTUQ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with a fivefold increase in risk of stroke. Treatment with anticoagulants reduces the risk by about two thirds.

Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is categorised into three subtypes: paroxysmal if normal rhythm is restored spontaneously; persistent if the episode lasts more than seven days or is terminated earlier using drug or direct current cardioversion; and permanent if cardioversion fails to restore normal heart rhythm. Catheter or surgical ablation may be used when cardioversion fails or there is evidence of an underlying electrophysiological disorder.

Atrial fibrillation can be characterised as resolved once normal rhythm is restored, but subsequent recurrence is possible after spontaneous resolution or cardioversion. Similarly, long term success rates of ablation might be as low as 20%. Patients in whom atrial fibrillation is considered resolved might in fact have paroxysmal or persistent subtypes, or atrial fibrillation that might recur. Such patients might remain at an increased risk of stroke and continue to benefit from anticoagulant prophylaxis.

In the United Kingdom no clear guidance exists on how to treat patients with resolved atrial fibrillation. In clinical guidelines commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, patients with resolved atrial fibrillation are not explicitly mentioned, although for patients who have undergone ablation, the guidelines briefly state that the authors "believe that common clinical practice is to continue to treat patients in accordance with their pre-ablation stroke risk score". In England, however, patients with a record of resolved atrial fibrillation are excluded from the Quality and Outcomes Framework atrial fibrillation register, a scheme that incentivises appropriate management of patients with atrial fibrillation in primary care; guidance issued by NHS England states that patients with resolved atrial fibrillation should be "removed from the register" — the implication being that these patients do not require further monitoring or anticoagulant treatment. European, Canadian, and US guidelines make no reference to patients with resolved atrial fibrillation; however, while noting a lack of evidence, they do recommend that anticoagulant treatment be continued after cardioversion or after ablation in patients at high risk of stroke.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Out-of-hospital initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in atrial fibrillation — A frequent issue is whether to initiate therapy in hospital or on an outpatient basis, with concern for serious adverse effects including torsades de pointes; virtually all pharmacological cardioversion studies (except those with low-dose oral amiodarone) have involved hospitalized patients, but one study provided a clinically useful approach with out-of-hospital patient-controlled conversion using class IC drugs. The pill-in-the-pocket strategy consists of self-administration of a single oral dose shortly after the onset of symptomatic AF to improve quality of life, decrease hospital admission, and reduce cost. Recommendations differ for paroxysmal versus persistent AF: for paroxysmal AF the aims are to terminate an episode or prevent recurrence, whereas for persistent AF the aims are to achieve pharmacological cardioversion, obviate direct-current cardioversion, or enhance its success by lowering the defibrillation threshold and prevent early recurrence. In patients with lone AF without structural heart disease, class IC drugs may be initiated on an outpatient basis, and for other selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, pill-in-the-pocket administration of propafenone and flecainide outside the hospital becomes an option once treatment has proved safe in hospital.

### Newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation after transient ischemic attack versus minor ischemic stroke in the POINT trial [^113aNCGg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, in a large sample of patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial, there was no substantial difference in rates of AF detection after a high‐risk TIA versus after a minor ischemic stroke. Consideration of whether the index event was a minor stroke or high‐risk TIA did not serve as a good predictor of subsequent AF diagnosis, implying that patients with high‐risk TIA should undergo similar heart‐rhythm monitoring strategies as patients with minor ischemic stroke. Randomized clinical trials have found that continuous heart‐rhythm monitoring of at least a few weeks' duration significantly increases the detection of AF after cerebrovascular ischemia, 1, 2 and current guidelines state that prolonged monitoring for approximately a month is reasonable. 7 In almost all cases, detection of AF in the POINT trial prompted a switch from antiplatelet to anticoagulant therapy, and in the context of such treatment strategies, patients with newly diagnosed AF did not appear to face a significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke. Our findings may help inform decisions about optimal heart‐rhythm monitoring strategies and the treatment of any resultant findings, which at the moment remain challenging given numerous gaps in the evidence base.

### Atrial fibrillation ablation timing: where is the sweet spot? [^112yR4Cj]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Convincing evidence for the efficacy of ablation as first-line therapy in paroxysmal AF (PAF) and its clear superiority to medical therapy for rhythm control in both PAF and persistent AF (PsAF) has generated considerable interest in the optimal timing of ablation. Based on this data, there is a widespread view that the principle of 'the earlier the better' should be generally applied. However, the natural history of AF is highly variable and non-linear, and for this reason, it is difficult to be emphatic that all patients are best served by ablation early after their initial AF episodes. Sufficient evidence exists to indicate a conservative approach is reasonable in patients with infrequent and non-progressive episodes (i.e. absence of progressive increase in burden culminating in PsAF) in whom symptoms remain mild and well-controlled. A conservative management phase should be marked by assiduous attention to risk factor modification, changes in frequency and duration of AF episodes, and patient preferences. If and when AF does begin to progress, accumulating evidence indicates that early ablation accompanied by ongoing attention to risk factors provides the best outcomes.

### Risk of stroke and transient ischaemic attack in patients with a diagnosis of resolved atrial fibrillation: retrospective cohort studies [^114tK5C8]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with a diagnosis of resolved atrial fibrillation have increased as a proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation. They remain at a 60% greater risk of stroke or TIA than patients without atrial fibrillation. These patients would benefit from continued anticoagulant prophylaxis, but treatment rates in this group are extremely low. It is recommended that national and international guidelines are updated to advocate continued use of anticoagulant treatment in patients with resolved atrial fibrillation.

### Controversies in atrial fibrillation [^116fK9eo]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and contributes greatly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the management of atrial fibrillation remain controversial. We address nine specific controversies in atrial fibrillation management, briefly focusing on the relations between mechanisms and therapy, the roles of rhythm and rate control, the definition of optimum rate control, the need for early cardioversion to prevent remodelling, the comparison of electrical with pharmacological cardioversion, the selection of patients for long-term oral anticoagulation, the roles of novel long-term anticoagulation approaches and ablation therapy, and the potential usefulness of upstream therapy targeting substrate development. The background of every controversy is reviewed and our opinions expressed. Here, we hope to inform physicians about the most important controversies in this specialty and stimulate investigators to address unresolved issues.

### Arrhythmia termination versus elimination of dormant pulmonary vein conduction as a procedural end point of catheter ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a prospective randomized trial [^111kMYa4]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is still associated with a substantial number of arrhythmia recurrences in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). This prospective, randomized study aimed to compare 2 different procedural strategies.

Methods and Results

A total of 152 patients undergoing de novo ablation for paroxysmal AF were randomized to 2 different treatment arms. The procedure in group A consisted of PVI exclusively. In this group, all isolated PVs were challenged with adenosine to reveal and ablate dormant conduction. In group B, PVI was performed with the patient either in spontaneous or in induced AF. If AF did not terminate with PVI, ablation was continued by targeting extra-PV AF sources with the desired procedural end point of termination to sinus rhythm. Primary study end point was freedom from arrhythmia during 1-year follow-up. In group A, adenosine provoked dormant conduction in 31 (41%) patients with a mean of 1.6 ± 0.8 transiently recovered PVs per patient. Termination of AF during PVI was observed in 31 (65%) patients, whereas AF persisted afterward in 17 (35%) patients. AF termination occurred in 13 (76%) patients by AF source ablation. After 1-year follow-up, significantly more group B patients were free of arrhythmia recurrences (87 versus 68%; P = 0.006). During redo ablation, the rate of PV reconduction did not differ between both groups (group A: 55% versus group B: 61%; P = 0.25).

Conclusions

Elimination of extra-PV AF sources after PVI is superior to sole PV isolation with the adjunct of abolishing potential dormant conduction.

### Rhythm control versus rate control and Clinical outcomes in patients with Atrial fibrillation: results from the ORBIT-AF registry [^116wJCZm]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study sought to evaluate clinical outcomes in clinical practice with rhythm control versus rate control strategy for management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Background

Randomized trials have not demonstrated significant differences in stroke, heart failure, or mortality between rhythm and rate control strategies. The comparative outcomes in contemporary clinical practice are not well described.

Methods

Patients managed with a rhythm control strategy targeting maintenance of sinus rhythm were retrospectively compared with a strategy of rate control alone in a AF registry across various U.S. practice settings. Unadjusted and adjusted (inverse-propensity weighted) outcomes were estimated.

Results

The overall study population (N = 6,988) had a median of 74 (65 to 81) years of age, 56% were males, 77% had first detected or paroxysmal AF, and 68% had CHADS 2 score ≥ 2. In unadjusted analyses, rhythm control was associated with lower all-cause death, cardiovascular death, first stroke/non-central nervous system systemic embolization/transient ischemic attack, or first major bleeding event (all p < 0.05); no difference in new onset heart failure (p = 0.28); and more frequent cardiovascular hospitalizations (p = 0.0006). There was no difference in the incidence of pacemaker, defibrillator, or cardiac resynchronization device implantations (p = 0.99). In adjusted analyses, there were no statistical differences in clinical outcomes between rhythm control and rate control treated patients (all p > 0.05); however, rhythm control was associated with more cardiovascular hospitalizations (hazard ratio: 1.24; 95% confidence interval: 1.10 to 1.39; p = 0.0003).

Conclusions

Among patients with AF, rhythm control was not superior to rate control strategy for outcomes of stroke, heart failure, or mortality, but was associated with more cardiovascular hospitalizations.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111vvtzm]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation baseline stroke risk — patterns and independent risk factors — is described by defining paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), and permanent AF as follows: PAF episodes terminate spontaneously "within 7 days and usually in < 48 h", persistent AF "does not self-terminate within 7 days or is terminated by cardioversion", and permanent AF is present when cardioversion "either has failed or has not been attempted". Risk-based treatment recommendations apply to PAF as well as persistent and permanent AF. Independent factors associated with increased stroke risk in AF include a prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, older age, hypertension, and diabetes; impaired left ventricular systolic function is a risk factor, but whether congestive heart failure per se increases ischemic stroke risk is conflicting, and low-quality evidence suggests atherosclerotic vascular disease (such as complex aortic plaque on transesophageal echocardiography or peripheral arterial disease) may independently predict stroke risk.

Regarding specific circumstances for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to patients with AF, anticoagulant therapy, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate oral anticoagulation, such as apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin, to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a TIA and NVAF.
Initiate oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke regardless of the pattern of AF, i.e. paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.

### The complexity of atrial fibrillation newly diagnosed after ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack: advances and uncertainties [^11228tHg]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose of review

Atrial fibrillation is being increasingly diagnosed after ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Patient characteristics, frequency and duration of paroxysms, and the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation detected after stroke and TIA (AFDAS) may differ from atrial fibrillation already known before stroke occurrence. We aim to summarize major recent advances in the field, in the context of prior evidence, and to identify areas of uncertainty to be addressed in future research.

Recent findings

Half of all atrial fibrillations in ischemic stroke and TIA patients are AFDAS, and most of them are asymptomatic. Over 50% of AFDAS paroxysms last less than 30 s. The rapid initiation of cardiac monitoring and its duration are crucial for its timely and effective detection. AFDAS comprises a heterogeneous mix of atrial fibrillation, possibly including cardiogenic and neurogenic types, and a mix of both. Over 25 single markers and at least 10 scores have been proposed as predictors of AFDAS. However, there are considerable inconsistencies across studies. The role of AFDAS burden and its associated risk of stroke recurrence have not yet been investigated.

Summary

AFDAS may differ from atrial fibrillation known before stroke in several clinical dimensions, which are important for optimal patient care strategies. Many questions remain unanswered. Neurogenic and cardiogenic AFDAS need to be characterized, as it may be possible to avoid some neurogenic cases by initiating timely preventive treatments. AFDAS burden may differ in ischemic stroke and TIA patients, with distinctive diagnostic and treatment implications. The prognosis of AFDAS and its risk of recurrent stroke are still unknown; therefore, it is uncertain whether AFDAS patients should be treated with oral anticoagulants.

### Age-related differences in presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with Atrial fibrillation in Europe: the EORP-AF general pilot registry (EURObservational Research programme-atrial fibrillation) [^116i3Bxb]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to compare age-related differences in presentation, treatment, and outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a wide cohort of European subjects.

Background

AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the elderly.

Methods

We evaluated all patients enrolled in the EORP-AF (EURObservational Research Programme-Atrial Fibrillation) General Pilot Registry in 70 centers of 9 European countries.

Results

Among 3,119 subjects, 1,051 (33.7%) were age ≥ 75 years. Permanent AF was significantly more common in the elderly, who had a higher prevalence of hypertension, valvular diseases, chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior hemorrhagic event or a transient ischemic attack. Common diagnostic tests were underused in older subjects. Despite their higher stroke risk, the use of oral anticoagulants was significantly lower in the elderly (76.7% vs. 82.8%; p = 0.0012), whereas aspirin and clopidogrel alone or in combination were more often prescribed. Rate control was the management of choice in the older group, with electrical cardioversion and catheter ablation performed less frequently than in the younger age group. Antiarrhythmic drugs were significantly less prescribed in the elderly (29.8% vs. 41.7%; p < 0.0001). At the 1-year follow-up, mortality (11.5% vs. 3.7%; p < 0.0001) and the composite of stroke/transient ischemic attack, systemic thromboembolism, and/or death (13.6% vs. 4.9%; p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in the ≥ 75 years of age cohort.

Conclusions

In older patients, AF is more often associated with comorbidities. Rate control is the preferred therapeutic approach. Despite a higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score, the use of oral anticoagulation is suboptimal. In elderly subjects, the rate of adverse events is higher at follow-up.

### Atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke [^111rzXiD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is a leading preventable cause of recurrent stroke for which early detection and treatment are critical. However, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and likely to go undetected and untreated in the routine care of patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Methods

We randomly assigned 572 patients 55 years of age or older, without known atrial fibrillation, who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months (cause undetermined after standard tests, including 24-hour electrocardiography [ECG]), to undergo additional noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring with either a 30-day event-triggered recorder (intervention group) or a conventional 24-hour monitor (control group). The primary outcome was newly detected atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting 2.5 minutes or longer and anticoagulation status at 90 days.

Results

Atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer was detected in 45 of 280 patients (16.1%) in the intervention group, as compared with 9 of 277 (3.2%) in the control group (absolute difference, 12.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 8.0 to 17.6; P < 0.001; number needed to screen, 8). Atrial fibrillation lasting 2.5 minutes or longer was present in 28 of 284 patients (9.9%) in the intervention group, as compared with 7 of 277 (2.5%) in the control group (absolute difference, 7.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 11.3; P < 0.001). By 90 days, oral anticoagulant therapy had been prescribed for more patients in the intervention group than in the control group (52 of 280 patients [18.6%] vs. 31 of 279 [11.1%]; absolute difference, 7.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.6 to 13.3; P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Among patients with a recent cryptogenic stroke or TIA who were 55 years of age or older, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was common. Noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring for a target of 30 days significantly improved the detection of atrial fibrillation by a factor of more than five and nearly doubled the rate of anticoagulant treatment, as compared with the standard practice of short-duration ECG monitoring.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — catheter ablation outcomes and evolution — early linear radiofrequency strategies had approximately 40% to 50% success with relatively high complications; in a 45-patient series with paroxysmal AF, 62% were free of symptomatic AF over a mean 8 mo but 70% required multiple procedures, and another study reported 86% success over 6-mo follow-up. With pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, in a series of 70 patients, 73% were free from AF without antiarrhythmic medications over 4 mo but 29 needed a second procedure; transient postablation AF may occur in the first 2 mo. Advances using antral PV isolation with a circular mapping catheter reported approximately 80% freedom from recurrent AF or atrial flutter after the first 2 mo in paroxysmal AF, though success was lower with cardiac dysfunction. A nonfluoroscopic guidance system delivering circumferential energy outside PV ostia showed, in 26 patients, 85% free of recurrent AF during 9 mo with 62% on no antiarrhythmic medications. Accumulated experience spans nearly 4000 patients, with approximately 90% success in paroxysmal AF and 80% in persistent AF. Targeting complex fractionated electrograms reported 91% efficacy at 1 y. Restoration of sinus rhythm after catheter ablation improved LV function, exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life usually within the first 3 to 6 mo, and another study associated catheter ablation with reduced mortality and morbidity due to HF and thromboembolism.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) pattern classification — Clinicians should distinguish a first-detected episode of AF, and AF is considered recurrent when a patient has had 2 or more episodes. If the arrhythmia terminates spontaneously, recurrent AF is designated paroxysmal; when sustained beyond 7 d it is designated persistent, and termination with pharmacological therapy or direct-current cardioversion does not change the designation. First-detected AF may be either paroxysmal or persistent, and both paroxysmal and persistent AF may be recurrent. Patterns include episodes that generally last 7 d or less (most less than 24 h) and episodes that usually last longer than 7 d. Persistent AF also includes long-standing AF (e.g., greater than 1 y), usually leading to permanent AF, in which cardioversion has failed or has not been attempted. This terminology applies to episodes that last more than 30 s without a reversible cause, although episodes of AF briefer than 30 s may be important in certain clinical situations.

Atrial fibrillation pattern definitions — 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is defined as "a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation and ineffective atrial contraction". Pattern categories include first detected AF — the first documentation of AF, regardless of previous symptoms; paroxysmal AF — AF that is intermittent and terminates within ≤ 7 d of onset; persistent AF — AF that is continuous and sustains for > 7 d and requires intervention; long-standing persistent AF — AF that is continuous for > 12 mo in duration; and permanent AF — used when the patient and clinician make a joint decision to stop further attempts to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

Causes of Recurrences

The pathophysiological mechanisms of these early recurrences are attributed to various mechanisms: primarily incomplete isolation of the PVs, acute inflammatory changes owing to energy delivery, recovery of conduction in a previously isolated PV, modification of the ANS, changes in the atrial substrate, and delayed effect of RF ablation due to lesion consolidation.

Early Recurrence as a Predictor of Failure

The occurrence of atrial arrhythmias early after ablation does not necessarily indicate treatment failure later during follow-up. Nevertheless, early recurrences have been shown to predict arrhythmia recurrences late after catheter ablation of AF in some patients.,

Management of early recurrences is controversial and has been treated by AADs, corticosteroids, early cardioversion, or repeat catheter ablation.

Antiarrhythmic Drugs

Because early AF recurrence usually peaks within the first few weeks following PVI, the temporary routine administration of AADs in the immediate postablation period has been proposed as a potential preventive strategy. Although the true efficacy of this approach is unknown, studies have suggested that transient AAD use does not prevent late arrhythmia relapses. The 5A study randomized 110 consecutive patients with PAF undergoing ablation to empirical AAD therapy vs no AAD therapy for the first 6 weeks after RF catheter ablation. The authors noted a significantly lower incidence of clinically significant atrial arrhythmias (AF > 24 hours or associated with severe symptoms), cardioversions, and arrhythmia-related hospitalization during the 6-week treatment period (13% vs 28% in the AAD vs non-AAD group; P < .05); however, there was no difference in the 6-month freedom from recurrent AF (72% vs 68%; p = 0.84). As noted earlier in this document, the writing group also recognizes that the usefulness of initiation or discontinuation of AAD therapy during the postablation healing phase in an effort to improve long-term outcomes is unclear (Class IIb, LOE C-LD, Table 3).

### Comparing efficacy and safety in catheter ablation strategies for atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis [^111pHSYn]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Differences in efficacy between different CA strategies

PVI has proved to be an effective treatment strategy for AF patients to control symptoms. However, the AF population is heterogeneous and for a subset of patients, PVI alone is not sufficient.

As a result, various treatment hypotheses have evolved to different ablation strategies. The rationale for these strategies has support from previous reports that are in clinical use. When summarized, PVI has become the cornerstone for AF ablation, but additional strategies are often used, especially in patients with non-PAF.

The value of additional ablation has been questioned, especially since the publication of the STAR AF 2 study, showing the lack of benefit associated with additional ablation. A possible explanation for the results could be that more extensive ablation may cause new areas of arrhythmogenesis. That is, unnecessary ablation and incomplete lines may increase the risk for AF recurrence or atrial tachycardia after the procedure. However, the success of PVI as a stand-alone treatment remains limited, especially in patients with non-PAF. Summarizing our results from evaluating more than 24 RCTs including PVI in combination with additional lines, PVI is a more effective therapy than AADs, and no less, there is support for completing this approach with additional lines to enhance the efficacy of the procedure without hampering safety. A sensitivity analysis excluding RCTs with only PAF patients confirmed that the addition of lines to PVI is more efficacious to PVI alone in this category of patients (Additional file 13, analysis 3). These findings are supported by a newly published NMA focusing only on patients with persistent AF. However, in a subgroup analysis (Additional file 11, analysis 5) including only studies with a PAF population, no strategy outperformed PVI alone in efficacy. However, the number of studies in this subgroup analysis was limited, and the result can depend on the lack of power.

Risk-based selection of oral anticoagulation — In patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have an estimated annual risk of stroke or thromboembolic events ≥ 2%, selection of therapy to reduce the risk of stroke should be based on the risk of thromboembolism, regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent (COR 1, LOE B-R). In patients with AF at risk for stroke, reevaluation of the need for and choice of stroke risk reduction therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risk, net clinical benefit, and proper dosing (COR 1, LOE B-NR).

### Improvement in quality of life after catheter ablation for paroxysmal versus long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation: a prospective study with 3-year follow-up [^114Hhqde]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Symptom reduction and improvement in quality of life (QoL) constitute the major incentives for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). – Postablation QoL improvement has been demonstrated in prior trials including in patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF) – or persistent AF. – Although some studies of persistent AF included certain proportions of patients with long‐standing persistent AF (LSPAF), data on QoL after catheter ablation for purely LSPAF are limited. This lack of data is reflected in current guidelines by different indications for catheter ablation for persistent AF and LSPAF. – Generally lower ablation efficacy and doubts about the reversibility of hemodynamic and functional impairment associated with LSPAF continue to raise concerns about clinical benefits from successful LSPAF ablation beyond the restoration of sinus rhythm (SR).

We have recently shown a significant hemodynamic, functional, and QoL postablation improvement in a large population with LSPAF. However, QoL improvement between patients with LSPAF and PAF has not been compared. In this long‐term prospective study, we hypothesized that the postablation improvement in QoL and morbidity is not inferior in LSPAF patients with primary extensive ablation compared with PAF patients, who mostly undergo pulmonary vein isolation alone. We also hypothesized that QoL improvement is dependent not only on good arrhythmia control but also on patients' baseline characteristics, which may help preprocedural patient selection for invasive procedures.

Ablation Outcome

Although extensive/repeat ablation(s) can effectively control heart rhythm even in patients with persistent AF, outcomes of LSPAF ablation have been generally worse compared with those for PAF ablation. –, In this study, ablation efficacy in the PAF group was consistent with recent less optimistic observations from studies with longer follow‐upand comparable to the LSPAF group. Favorable outcome in our LSPAF patients can be first explained by aiming SR restoration at the initial ablation and by finalizing the predefined set of linear lesions even in the case of AF termination at an earlier stage of the procedure. Such an extent of ablation with a strict procedural end point was not used in the majority of previous studies. Second, repeat ablation instead of medical therapy was the preferred treatment option in case of AF/AT recurrences, and arrhythmia noninducibility was always the desired end point. Third, operators with high‐volume AF‐ablation experience were predominantly involved in ablation procedures for LSPAF. Importantly, comparable final outcomes in both groups provided a favorable background for the intergroup QoL comparisons.

Symptoms and QoL

Several prior studies of primarily PAF patients have demonstrated significant QoL improvement after catheter ablation. – This improvement was shown to persist > 2 years. – In contrast, data on purely LSPAF are missing. Amelioration of postablation QoL was observed in mixed populations of persistent AF and LSPAF patients or persistent AF patients only –; however, translation of these findings to selected populations with LSPAF in general may not be valid. One study demonstrated postablation decrease in symptom severity score by 10 ± 5 points in LSPAF patients, which corresponds to the postablation improvement reported by large multicenter studies in PAF patients. Another study comprising 91% subjects with persistent/permanent AF and left ventricular dysfunction showed a significant postablation increase in physical (24 ± 21 points) and mental (21 ± 21 points) scores, exceeding the magnitude of postablation improvement attained in other studies of purely PAF. –

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

### Treatment timing and the effects of rhythm control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^116b62ru]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the strategy of initiating rhythm control treatment in patients with early atrial fibrillation (within one year after the diagnosis) was associated with a decreased risk of death from cardiovascular causes, ischaemic stroke, admission to hospital for heart failure, or acute myocardial infarction in comparison with rate control (absolute decrease in risk 1.82 events per 100 person years), consistent with the findings of the EAST-AFNET 4 trial. Secondly, a rhythm control strategy initiated one year after diagnosis of atrial fibrillation was not significantly associated with the risk of outcomes. Thirdly, earlier timing of initiating rhythm control was linearly associated with more favourable cardiovascular outcomes in comparison with rate control. Fourthly, for safety outcomes, no differences were found between the rhythm control and rate control strategies, regardless of the timing of treatment

Comparison with other studies

In the meta-analyses of previous randomised trials comparing rhythm control with rate control strategies, no significant difference was seen in all cause mortality or thromboembolic outcomes between the two strategies, although a non-significant trend in favour of a rate control approach was found. In our study, early rhythm control was associated with less frequent cardiovascular events, which might be largely attributable to a lower risk of stroke in the rhythm control group (absolute decrease in risk, 1.00 events per 100 person years). This result is in line with a post hoc analysis of the ATHENA trial, which showed that dronedarone was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. In addition, using a population based observational cohort, Tsadok et al reported that rhythm control treatment started within one week after discharge of patients from hospital was associated with lower rates of stroke/transient ischaemic attack than with rate control treatment.

### Atrial fibrillation therapy now and in the future: drugs, biologicals, and ablation [^1167eAuj]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex disease with multiple inter-relating causes culminating in rapid, seemingly disorganized atrial activation. Therapy targeting AF is rapidly changing and improving. The purpose of this review is to summarize current state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for treatment of AF. The review focuses on reviewing treatment as it relates to the pathophysiological basis of disease and reviews preclinical and clinical evidence for potential new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, including imaging, biomarkers, pharmacological therapy, and ablative strategies for AF. Current ablation and drug therapy approaches to treating AF are largely based on treating the arrhythmia once the substrate occurs and is more effective in paroxysmal AF rather than persistent or permanent AF. However, there is much research aimed at prevention strategies, targeting AF substrate, so-called upstream therapy. Improved diagnostics, using imaging, genetics, and biomarkers, are needed to better identify subtypes of AF based on underlying substrate/mechanism to allow more directed therapeutic approaches. In addition, novel antiarrhythmics with more atrial specific effects may reduce limiting proarrhythmic side effects. Advances in ablation therapy are aimed at improving technology to reduce procedure time and in mechanism-targeted approaches.

Pharmacological versus electrical cardioversion — effectiveness, timing, and anticoagulation considerations: Cardioversion may be achieved by means of drugs or electrical shocks, and although drug use has increased, disadvantages include the risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes; pharmacological cardioversion is less effective than direct-current cardioversion when biphasic shocks are used, while electrical cardioversion requires conscious sedation or anesthesia. There is no evidence that the risk of thromboembolism or stroke differs between pharmacological and electrical methods, and recommendations for anticoagulation are therefore the same for both methods. Pharmacological cardioversion seems most effective when initiated within 7 d after the onset of an episode of atrial fibrillation; a large proportion of patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation experience spontaneous cardioversion within 24 to 48 h, whereas spontaneous conversion is less frequent with longer than 7-d duration and efficacy of drug cardioversion is markedly reduced. Pharmacological therapy may accelerate restoration of sinus rhythm but the advantage over placebo is modest after 24 to 48 h and is much less effective in persistent atrial fibrillation, and some drugs have a delayed onset with conversion not occurring for several days after initiation. Antiarrhythmic drugs can interact with vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants when added or withdrawn, and when anticoagulation is initiated for elective cardioversion, adding an antiarrhythmic may perturb the intensity of anticoagulation beyond the intended therapeutic range, raising the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^114Xzh5h]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Guidelines Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations indicate that most patients would make the same choice and Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range 2.0–3.0, unless otherwise noted). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have had a prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, because of the high risk of future ischemic stroke faced by this set of patients (Grade 1A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have two or more of the risk factors for future ischemic stroke listed immediately below, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1A). Two or more of the following risk factors apply: age > 75 years, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure. In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, with only one of the risk factors listed immediately above, we recommend long-term antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1A), either as anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A), or as aspirin, at a dose of 75–325 mg/d (Grade 1B). In these patients at intermediate risk of ischemic stroke we suggest a VKA rather than aspirin (Grade 2A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, age ≤ 75 years and with none of the other risk factors listed above, we recommend long-term aspirin therapy at a dose of 75–325 mg/d (Grade 1B), because of their low risk of ischemic stroke. For patients with atrial flutter, we recommend that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF (Grade 1C). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA at an intensity appropriate for the specific type of prosthesis (Grade 1B). See CHEST 2008; 133(suppl):593S-629S. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, for 3 weeks before elective cardioversion and for at least 4 weeks after sinus rhythm has been maintained (Grade 1C). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacological or electrical cardioversion, we also recommend either immediate anticoagulation with unfractionated IV heparin, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or at least 5 days of warfarin by the time of cardioversion (achieving an INR of 2.0–3.0) as well as a screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). If no thrombus is seen, cardioversion is successful, and sinus rhythm is maintained, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks. If a thrombus is seen on TEE, then cardioversion should be postponed and anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely. We recommend obtaining a repeat TEE before attempting later cardioversion (Grade 1B addressing the equivalence of TEE-guided vs non-TEE-guided cardioversion). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without prolonged anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or LMWH at presentation (Grade 2C).

Aims

To assess the relation between the atrial fibrillation (AF) subtype and thrombo-embolic events.

Methods and Results

The observational Euro Heart Survey on AF (2003–04) enrolled 1509 paroxysmal, 1109 persistent, and 1515 permanent AF patients, according to the 2001 American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines definitions. A 1 year follow-up was performed. Permanent AF patients had at baseline a worse stroke risk profile than paroxysmal and persistent AF patients. In paroxysmal AF, the risk for stroke, any thrombo-embolism, major bleeding and the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, any thrombo-embolism, and major bleeding was comparable with persistent and permanent AF, in both univariable and multivariable analyses. Compared with AF patients without stroke, patients suffering from a stroke had a comparable frequency and duration of AF attacks, but tended to have a worse stroke risk profile at baseline. During 1 year following cardioversion, paroxysmal AF patients had a higher risk for stroke (P = 0.029) and any thrombo-embolism (P = 0.001) than persistent AF patients.

Conclusion

In the Euro Heart Survey, paroxysmal AF had a comparable risk for thrombo-embolic events as persistent and permanent AF. This observation strengthens the guideline recommendation not to consider the clinical AF subtype when deciding on anticoagulation.

### Catheter ablation vs. antiarrhythmic drug treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation: a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial (SARA study) [^112VuHGr]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Catheter ablation (CA) is an effective therapy for the treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) when medical therapy fails, and is considered a Class I indication under current guidelines (level of evidence A). However, its use in patients with persistent AF remains controversial. The evidence in favour of ablation derives from non-randomized trials and is weak (Class IIa indication; level of evidence B). Long-term CA success in patients with non-paroxysmal AF is largely dependent on patient characteristics, and most studies consider persistent and long-standing persistent AF together. The present study is the first randomized, controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of rhythm control of CA vs. antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT) in patients with symptomatic persistent AF, specifically excluding long-standing persistent AF and patients with advanced remodelling stage (left atrial diameter > 50 mm).

5 CONCLUSION

Compared to AADs, first‐line CBA can effectively prevent atrial arrhythmia recurrence and lower the incidence of persistent AF. Furthermore, this strategy can improve QoL and reduce hospitalization rates without increasing the incidences of SAEs in PAF patients. Although our research has certain limitations, our findings provide valuable insights into new treatment strategies for PAF.

The observed crude incidence rate ratio for stroke or TIA in patients with atrial fibrillation versus those without atrial fibrillation was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 2.0 to 2.5) (although it should be noted that both groups were matched to the exposure group, atrial fibrillation resolved, rather than to each other). This is similar to the relative rates observed in other routinely collected primary care datasets, in which many patients with atrial fibrillation are prescribed anticoagulant drugs in accordance with clinical guidelines.

While successful ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation might lead to the restoration of normal heart rhythm in the short term, evidence from studies with long term follow-up suggests that atrial fibrillation may recur in up to 80% of patients. Several studies have investigated long term outcomes in patients who have undergone ablation, with results indicating reduced stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation who have undergone ablation versus those who have not undergone ablation, and versus those who have undergone cardioversion. Few, however, have compared stroke rates to those in patients with no history of atrial fibrillation; one exception is a cohort study in the United States, which found that stroke rates in patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent ablation were similar to those in patients with no history of atrial fibrillation, although no data were available to indicate whether or not patients were prescribed anticoagulants. A study using international data, which included patients with atrial fibrillation and a moderate to high risk of stroke and taking warfarin or rivaroxaban, found no difference between stroke rates before and after cardioversion or ablation; however, the study population and the number of outcome events were small.

Ablation may be one of several reasons to categorise atrial fibrillation as having resolved; in our dataset, only 1.2% of patients with resolved atrial fibrillation had a recent record of ablation. No studies investigating the prognosis of patients with resolved atrial fibrillation more broadly have been identified.

This lack of evidence might explain the limited guidance offered in UK and international guidelines concerning the treatment of patients with resolved atrial fibrillation, this being restricted to brief notes on patients who have undergone ablation; remarks that generally conflict with the fact that patients coded as "atrial fibrillation resolved" are explicitly excluded from atrial fibrillation registers in England. In light of the evidence produced by this study, it is recommended that clinical guidelines and schemes designed to incentivise appropriate management of patients with atrial fibrillation are updated to promote continuation of anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with resolved atrial fibrillation, or, alternatively, to deprecate continued use of this specious categorisation.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^117Nc5DT]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Since the 2012 update of this consensus paper, multiple randomized and nonrandomized studies including a large-scale registry have been published that compared CBA against point-by-point RF ablation with respect to rhythm outcome in patients with PAF. The majority of these studies revealed that CBA was similarly effective in the prevention of arrhythmia recurrences, with arrhythmia-free survival ranging from 54% to 85% in patients undergoing cryoablation and from 55% to 88% in patients undergoing RF ablation after 1 to 2 years of follow-up. In particular, there was no difference in efficacy when the second-generation CB was compared with advanced-generation RF catheters featuring CF measurements for improved wall contact.

In the FREEZE-AF study, 315 patients with PAF were randomized to open irrigated radiofrequency ablation or CBA for PVI. Cryoablation was exclusively performed with the first-generation CB catheter. The primary endpoint was freedom from atrial arrhythmia recurrence with absence of persistent complications. At 12 months, the primary endpoint was met by 70.7% of the patients in the RF ablation group and by 73.6% of the patients in the cryoablation group after at least one ablation procedure with similar rates of redo procedures in both groups (19.5% vs 19.9%). Periprocedural complications occurred more frequently in the cryoablation group compared with the RF ablation group (12.2% vs 5.0%), which was largely driven by 9 transient PN injuries (5.8%) in the cryoablation arm.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116WJdoc]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Obsolete atrial fibrillation terminology — 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline: Chronic AF has had variable definitions and should be abandoned, replaced by the "paroxysmal", "persistent", "long-standing persistent", and "permanent" terminology. The classification of AF as "valvular" or "nonvalvular" should no longer be considered for defining etiology, and "valvular and nonvalvular terminology should be abandoned". Lone AF previously referred to younger patients without structural heart disease at a lower risk for thromboembolism, but this term does not enhance patient care, is not currently used, and should be abandoned.

### Higher risk of death and stroke in patients with persistent vs. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: results from the ROCKET-AF trial [^113ACVRy]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The lower risk of thrombo-embolic events and death in patients with paroxysmal AF, compared with persistent AF, was particularly pronounced in two subgroups — patients with the diagnosis of AF > 6 months prior to baseline, and those with rhythms other than AF or atrial flutter on baseline ECG (P interaction < 0.05 for each). While these remain hypothesis-generating results only, there are potential explanations that deserve further study. The effect of AF duration may reflect diagnostic biases in patients with more recent diagnoses, but both AF duration and ECG rhythm may also reflect measures of burden of AF arrhythmia. Patients not in AF or atrial flutter at baseline represent those with AF less likely to be captured on any single ECG. Burden of AF has been an intensely studied topic, and one of great debate. The Asymptomatic Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Evaluation in Pacemaker Patients and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pacing Trial (ASSERT) study suggested as little as 6 min of AF increased stroke risk, and additional studies have demonstrated some dose–response effect — that is, more AF portends worse thrombo-embolic outcomes. Yet to date, neither AF type nor AF burden is included in guideline-recommended risk stratification for thrombo-embolism prophylaxis. This is likely due in part to the difficulties of defining and measuring paroxysmal episodes of AF, and additional studies of the implications of AF burden for treatment decisions are required. However, patients with paroxysmal AF remain at significant risk of stroke, relative to patients without AF, and current evidence does not support withholding anticoagulation in these patients. In contrast, our data suggest that the use of more aggressive stroke prevention in patients with persistent AF, who are otherwise at lower risk, deserves further study.

The treatment effects of rivaroxaban vs. adjusted-dose warfarin were not different between patients with paroxysmal vs. persistent AF. This finding is consistent with prior data, suggesting both groups benefit from oral anticoagulation, particularly among patients at high risk of stroke at baseline. However, those patients at the highest risk of adverse outcome often derive the greatest benefit from aggressive therapies; in our analysis, patients with persistent AF were at substantially higher risk of thrombo-embolic events and death. This may explain, in part, the variance in the hazards of rivaroxaban vs. dose-adjusted warfarin by AF type. However, none of the differences was statistically significant and wider confidence intervals indicate relatively under-powered assessments.

### Risks and benefits of rate control versus maintenance of sinus rhythm [^115rkqJn]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

There are 2 fundamental approaches to managing patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF): to restore and maintain sinus rhythm with cardioversion and/or antiarrhythmic drugs, or to control the ventricular rate only. Over the past few years, there have been several important prospective clinical trials comparing rate control with rhythm control in patients with recurrent AF. The Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was the first prospective randomized study to test the hypothesis of equivalency between the 2 management strategies for AF. The trial demonstrated that rate control was not inferior to rhythm control with respect to symptoms, quality of life, or number of hospitalizations in patients with persistent AF. The Strategies of Treatment in Atrial Fibrillation (STAF) trial was a pilot study that enrolled approximately 200 patients with AF who were randomized to either ventricular rate control or cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. The results showed that over a 1-year period there was little difference in outcome in terms of morbidity or symptoms. In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, patients with AF and risk factors for stroke were randomized to either rhythm control or rate control, with both groups receiving anticoagulation with warfarin. There was no difference in the composite end point of death, disabling stroke or anoxic encephalopathy, major bleeding, or cardiac arrest between the 2 arms. In addition, no major differences were noted in functional status or quality of life. The Rate Control Versus Electrical Cardioversion (RACE) trial also reached a similar conclusion. Thus, rate control is an acceptable primary strategy for management of patients with recurrent AF.

### Predictors of progression of recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation in REgistry on cardiac rhythm disORDers assessing the control of atrial fibrillation (recordAF)-United States cohort [^116XH24r]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The progression of atrial fibrillation (AF) to a more sustained form is associated with increased symptoms and morbidity. The aims of the REgistry on Cardiac Rhythm DisORDers Assessing the Control of Atrial Fibrillation (RecordAF)-United States (US) cohort study were to identify the risk factors of AF progression and the effects of management approaches. RecordAF is the first worldwide, 1-year observational study of the treatment of community-based patients with recent-onset AF. We assessed AF progression at 12 months in the US cohort. AF progression was defined as a change of AF to a more sustained form (either paroxysmal becoming persistent or permanent, or persistent becoming permanent). The US cohort included 955 patients, with mean age of 68.9 years; 56.8% were men and 88.8% were white. At entry, 59.6% of patients were selected for rate-control and 40.4% for rhythm-control therapy. At 12 months, the management strategy was unchanged for 68.2% of the patients in the rate- and 77.7% of the patients in the rhythm-control groups. Overall, AF progression had occurred in 18.6% of patients at 12 months. The progression rate was significantly greater in the rate-control (27.6%) than in the rhythm-control (5.8%) group (p < 0.001). Progression to permanent AF occurred in 16.4% of patients. In addition to a rate-control strategy, older age, AF rhythm at entry, persistent AF at baseline, and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack independently predicted AF progression. Rate control was associated with AF progression, with a propensity score adjusted odds ratio of 2.67 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, rate control was the preferred treatment of recent-onset AF in the US but was associated with more AF progression than rhythm control.

### Device-detected atrial fibrillation: what to do with asymptomatic patients? [^1128tw2z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia and conveys an increased risk of stroke, regardless of whether it is symptomatic. Despite multiple studies supporting an association between subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) detected by cardiac implantable electronic devices and increased risk of thromboembolic events, clinical intervention for device-detected AT remains sluggish, with some clinicians delaying treatment and instead opting for continued surveillance for additional or longer episodes. However, the 2014 updated clinical practice guidelines on AF recommend use of the CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score for nonvalvular AF, with oral anticoagulation recommended for scores ≥ 2, regardless of whether AF is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent. This paper reviews the epidemiology of AF and mechanisms of stroke in AF, and discusses device-detected AF and its clinical implications.

### Improvement in quality of life after catheter ablation for paroxysmal versus long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation: a prospective study with 3-year follow-up [^113CKP3N]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Limitations

There is a lack of consensus on how to evaluate QoL in AF patients and how to administer QoL surveys. Although previous studies mainly used a different Short Form 36, the descriptive capacity of Short Form 36 and EQ‐5D can be regarded as comparable. Further, although the support for the use of "self‐assessment" of individual well‐being is limited with the risk of bias by adaptation behavior, patients in fact may respond more truthfully to a self‐report questionnaire than to interviewer‐administered surveys.

It may be also speculated that patients anticipating an invasive procedure may report a lower QoL. In addition, placebo effect has been suspected to overestimate the postablation QoL change. However, the "objective" EQ‐5D index is constructed to guide the responder to assess a longer period than merely preablation status. Finally, any error would be comparable in all patients and unlikely to introduce bias in favor of a particular study group.

The lack of more sensitive disease‐specific measure of AF‐related QoL is another limitation of our study. However, because patients with major structural heart diseases or other serious comorbidities were not included, it is likely that other (eg, orthopaedic) conditions impacted the generic EQ‐5D to a lesser extent.

Our study did not include a control group. However, superiority of ablation strategy over AAD treatment for QoL end point was consistently demonstrated in multiple randomized studies in symptomatic PAF patients. – In our study, comparative design can, in part, substitute for the need of control group. The QoL benefit from ablation in LSPAF patients can only be suggested indirectly because of comparable or greater effect in LSPAF versus PAF patients.

Patients with LSPAF enrolled in our study represented a selected cohort of highly symptomatic subjects. The proportion of such patients in general population is unknown. Different criteria for patient selection in different centers may significantly impact the final QoL benefit. Consequently, the generalizability of our 2‐center study should be interpreted with caution.

### Screening for atrial fibrillation: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113FG6fN]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The prevalence of AF increases with age, from less than 0.2% in adults younger than 55 years to about 10% in those 85 years or older, with a higher prevalence in men than in women. It is uncertain whether the prevalence of AF differs by race and ethnicity. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of stroke. Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with AF are first diagnosed with AF at the time of the stroke or shortly thereafter.

Objective

To update its 2018 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the benefits and harms of screening for AF in older adults, the accuracy of screening tests, the effectiveness of screening tests to detect previously undiagnosed AF compared with usual care, and the benefits and harms of anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of screen-detected AF in older adults.

Population

Adults 50 years or older without a diagnosis or symptoms of AF and without a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF. (I statement).

### Outcomes associated with familial versus nonfamilial atrial fibrillation: a matched nationwide cohort study [^117Mz674]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

A complete understanding of atrial fibrillation (AF) and its pathophysiology is lacking. Since 1997, several single‐point genetic loci have been correlated to AF, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 suggesting a genetic etiology for AF, at least in some cases. Three specific genomic regions associated with AF were identified recently through genomewide association studies of chromosome 4q25, 16q22, and 1q21. 6, 7, 8, 9 In addition, recent studies showed that AF aggregates in families. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 These studies indicated that family history of AF may be considered an important risk factor for AF. Furthermore, patients with first‐degree relatives diagnosed with AF (familial AF) have been shown to be younger and to have less comorbidity than AF patients without a family history of AF. 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 Nevertheless, no long‐term outcome data exist for familial AF.

Death and thromboembolism are important long‐term complications of AF; for example, AF is associated with a 5‐fold increased risk of stroke. 18 Antithrombotic treatment is used to prevent thromboembolic complications in these patients, and the treatment strategy is independent of family history of AF. Information regarding potential differences in these outcomes among familial and nonfamilial AF patients is needed to help clarify whether these 2 patient groups would benefit from different treatment strategies.

The aim of this study was to examine all‐cause mortality and thromboembolic risk (stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic thromboembolism) in AF patients with familial AF compared with patients with nonfamilial AF.

### Catheter ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation [^1128qQM1]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Early rhythm control therapy

More and more electrophysiologists are opting to perform AF ablation early in the course of the AF journey in an attempt to reduce AF burden and limit AF-induced atrial damage. Consistent with this trend are the recommendations by both the ESC AF Guidelines and also the AHA/ACC/HRS AF consensus document that catheter ablation of paroxysmal AF may be considered as first-line therapy, based on patient preference and when performed in experienced centres. While published trials, relying on antiarrhythmic drug therapy and often accepting interruption of oral anticoagulation after sinus rhythm restoration, have not shown a prognostic benefit of rhythm control therapy over usual care, there is biological reason to believe that sinus rhythm maintenance could help to prevent these cardiovascular events. – Intermittent periods of sinus rhythm may reverse some of the underlying adaptive processes ('electrical' and 'structural' remodelling). Activation patterns in the fibrillating atria are heterogeneous and highly variable over time. The complexity of electrical activity in AF, described as drivers, epicardial break through, – rotor, or AF cycle length, increases with longer duration of continuous AF. A novelty of the rhythm control approach in In EAST — AFNET 4 is the mandate for an early rhythm control therapy intervention, informed by the observation that AF-induced atrial remodelling may facilitate recurrent AF during later stages of the disease. It remains to be seen if this early intervention approach bear can also help to prevent strokes and other major cardiovascular outcomes in AF patients.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — implications of the rhythm-control versus rate-control trials: Theoretically, rhythm control should have advantages over rate control, yet a trend toward lower mortality was observed in the rate-control arm of the AFFIRM study and did not differ in the other trials from the outcome with the rhythm-control strategy. The RACE and AFFIRM trials did not address AF in younger, symptomatic patients with little underlying heart disease, in whom restoration of sinus rhythm by cardioversion antiarrhythmic drugs or nonpharmacological interventions still must be considered a useful therapeutic approach. One may conclude from these studies that rate control is a reasonable strategy in elderly patients with minimal symptoms related to AF, and an effective method for maintaining sinus rhythm with fewer side effects would address a presently unmet need.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116JH2Bw]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack — treatment recommendations include that in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke or TIA, oral anticoagulation (e.g., apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin) is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with AF and stroke or TIA, oral anticoagulation is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent; in patients with stroke or TIA and AF who do not have moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban is recommended in preference to warfarin to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with atrial flutter and stroke or TIA, anticoagulant therapy similar to that in AF is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with AF and stroke or TIA, without moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, who are unable to maintain a therapeutic INR level with warfarin, use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with stroke at high risk of hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of AF, it is reasonable to delay initiation of oral anticoagulation beyond 14 days to reduce the risk of ICH; in patients with TIA in the setting of nonvalvular AF, it is reasonable to initiate anticoagulation immediately after the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; in patients with stroke or TIA in the setting of nonvalvular AF who have contraindications for lifelong anticoagulation but can tolerate at least 45 days, it may be reasonable to consider percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage with the Watchman device to reduce the chance of recurrent stroke and bleeding; in patients with stroke at low risk for hemorrhagic conversion in the setting of AF, it may be reasonable to initiate anticoagulation 2 to 14 days after the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; and in patients with AF and stroke or TIA who have end-stage renal disease or are on dialysis, it may be reasonable to use warfarin or apixaban (dose adjusted if indicated) for anticoagulation to reduce the chance of recurrent stroke.

### Comparing efficacy and safety in catheter ablation strategies for atrial fibrillation: a network meta-analysis [^114qE85S]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The main goal of treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF) is to treat symptoms and/or arrhythmia-induced heart failure. Primarily this involves pharmacological treatment and optimization of comorbidity, followed by antiarrhythmic treatment.

Cather ablation (CA) of AF became a treatment option after Haissaguerre's seminal study, where ectopic areas adjacent to the pulmonary veins were found to initiate AF and thus objectified an ablation target for the treatment of AF. Since then, ablation procedures for AF have become an important treatment option and the number of interventions is increasing worldwide.

The clinical problem is that the AF population is heterogeneous, and pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone is not the solution for all patients. As a result, different approaches or CA strategies have been suggested, but robust data are scarce, and randomized direct comparisons are rare.

Commonly used CA strategies include linear lesions, left atrial (LA) posterior wall isolation, substrate modification, electrocardiogram (EGM)-based approaches, along with ablation of trigger sites and ganglia-plexi (GP), mainly as add-ons to PVI. Yet, the efficacy of different CA ablation strategies as stand-alone or add-on to PVI has been ambiguous.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of all different CA strategies for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal (PAF) and non-paroxysmal AF (non-PAF). To assess treatments that have not been directly compared in previous trials, we employed a network meta-analysis (NMA). NMA is a statistical method that enables the possibility to evaluate multiple treatments in a single analysis, combining not only direct but also indirect comparisons of treatments.

Compared to a conventional meta-analysis that is limited to evaluate two interventions at a time and only compares interventions evaluated directly in head-to-head trials, the NMA provides the possibility to evaluate multiple treatments in a single analysis. This is possible by combining direct and indirect evidence (i.e. comparisons can be made even if two strategies have not been directly compared in a single study). NMA is robust and has already been applied in several medical fields supporting guidelines and decision-making at different levels.

Outpatient "pill-in-the-pocket" efficacy — among 268 patients with minimal heart disease, 58 patients (22%) were excluded because of treatment failure or side effects; using resolution of palpitations within 6 h after drug ingestion as the criterion of efficacy, treatment was successful in 534 episodes (94%) during 15–16 mo follow-up, with conversion occurring over a mean of 2 h; among patients with recurrences, treatment was effective in 84%, adverse effects were reported by 7% of patients, and 5% dropped out; this approach appears feasible and safe for selected patients with atrial fibrillation, but the safety of this approach without previous inpatient evaluation remains uncertain.

### Challenges in the classification of atrial fibrillation [^1128uPPr]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) are increasing worldwide. AF is of public health importance because it accounts for substantial morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. AF may be transient initially, but many patients have progressive disease marked by increasing frequency and duration of episodes. Various classification schemes for AF have been proposed, although current guidelines are based on temporal rhythm-based patterns. We discuss existing schemes for the classification of AF, focusing on the advantages and limitations of the pattern-based scheme, in the context of new knowledge about AF pathophysiology, AF patterns, and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we address gaps in knowledge that present opportunities to re-examine the current pattern-based classification of AF. A future classification scheme should ideally combine elements such as the risk of stroke, an assessment of symptoms, and the degree of impairment of the atrial substrate.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

2014 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines — antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: In patients with AF, antithrombotic therapy should be individualized based on shared decision-making after discussion of the absolute and RRs of stroke and bleeding, and the patient's values and preferences (Class I, Level of Evidence: C), and selection of antithrombotic therapy should be based on the risk of thromboembolism irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). In patients with nonvalvular AF, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended for assessment of stroke risk (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with AF who have mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended and the target international normalized ratio (INR) intensity (2.0 to 3.0 or 2.5 to 3.5) should be based on the type and location of the prosthesis (Class I, Level of Evidence: B). For patients with nonvalvular AF with prior stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater, oral anticoagulants are recommended, with options including warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban. Among patients treated with warfarin, the INR should be determined at least weekly during initiation of antithrombotic therapy and at least monthly when anticoagulation (INR in range) is stable (Class I, Level of Evidence: A). For patients with nonvalvular AF unable to maintain a therapeutic INR level with warfarin, use of a direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban) is recommended (Class I, Level of Evidence: C).

### A randomized trial of circumferential pulmonary vein ablation versus antiarrhythmic drug therapy in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: the APAF study [^115zJafe]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We compared ablation strategy with antiarrhythmic drug therapy (ADT) in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation strategy is superior to ADT in patients with an initial history of PAF, but its role in patients with a long history of AF as compared with ADT remains a challenge.

Methods

One hundred ninety-eight patients (age, 56 ± 10 years) with PAF of 6 ± 5 years' duration (mean AF episodes 3.4/month) who had failed ADT were randomized to AF ablation by circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA) or to the maximum tolerable doses of another ADT, which included flecainide, sotalol, and amiodarone. Crossover to CPVA was allowed after 3 months of ADT.

Results

By Kaplan-Meier analysis, 86% of patients in the CPVA group and 22% of those in the ADT group who did not require a second ADT were free from recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias (AT) (p < 0.001); a repeat ablation was performed in 9% of patients in the CPVA group for recurrent AF (6%) or atrial tachycardia (3%). At 1 year, 93% and 35% of the CPVA and ADT groups, respectively, were AT-free. Ejection fraction, hypertension, and age independently predicted AF recurrences in the ADT group. Circumferential pulmonary vein ablation was associated with fewer cardiovascular hospitalizations (p < 0.01). One transient ischemic attack and 1 pericardial effusion occurred in the CPVA group; side effects of ADT were observed in 23 patients.

Conclusions

Circumferential pulmonary vein ablation is more successful than ADT for prevention of PAF with few complications. Atrial fibrillation ablation warrants consideration in selected patients in whom ADT had already failed and maintenance of sinus rhythm is desired.

### Update on medical management of atrial fibrillation in the modern era [^116UKMQL]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation involves control of the ventricular response rate, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and attempts to maintain sinus rhythm. The approach to patients with atrial fibrillation has become increasingly complex as therapeutic options have expanded. The ultimate reasons to treat atrial fibrillation include improvement in symptoms, reduction in adverse outcomes and improvement in survival. Despite increasing interest in non pharmacological approaches to treat and potentially cure atrial fibrillation, drugs remain the primary method to treat most patients. This review updates the present state-of-the-art regarding medical management of atrial fibrillation based on present and emerging evidence.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116kUep8]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Progression and safety context for rhythm control and ablation — in patients with subclinical AF < 24 hours, progression to overt AF or episodes > 24 hours occurs at a rate of 8.8% per year and those who develop AF are more likely to be hospitalized for HF; in one trial, serious adverse events associated with ablation were observed in 8% of patients; the treatment effect of rhythm control was largest in those who underwent catheter ablation for rhythm control, particularly in those with paroxysmal AF and LA diameters ≤ 50 mm; in a post hoc analysis of EAST-AFNET 4, the benefit of rhythm control on the primary composite outcome was independent of symptom status, and catheter ablation for rhythm control was used in approximately 20% of patients, whether symptomatic or not.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^116Sv4ab]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation in patients with asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) — the writing group believes that AF ablation may be considered in select asymptomatic patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF when performed by an experienced operator and following a detailed discussion of the risks and benefits (Class IIb, LOE C-EO), whereas AF ablation is not recommended for patients with asymptomatic long-standing persistent AF; efficacy is dramatically reduced in those with continuous AF for 2 or more years, and small studies report that in one comparison of 54 asymptomatic subclinical AF patients versus 486 drug-refractory symptomatic AF patients, no difference in safety or efficacy was observed at the 24-month follow-up.

### 2011 ACCF / AHA / HRS focused update on the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (updating the 2006 guideline): a report of the American college of cardiology foundation / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines [^113SbWHZ]. Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — catheter ablation evidence and selection criteria note that catheter ablation to maintain sinus rhythm has been reported in trials and meta-analyses including data from more than 6900 patients. Patients undergoing ablation are a selected population characterized by symptomatic paroxysmal AF refractory to one or more antiarrhythmic drugs, normal size or mildly dilated atria, normal or mildly reduced ventricular function, and absence of severe pulmonary disease, and most are free of recurrent, paroxysmal AF for 1 year or more after ablation. In the ThermoCool randomized multicenter trial of 167 symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF who had not improved with at least one antiarrhythmic drug, radiofrequency catheter ablation with pulmonary vein isolation resulted in significantly fewer recurrent AF episodes than additional antiarrhythmic drugs, with quality-of-life and symptom severity scores significantly better after 3 months; major treatment-related adverse events were similar between groups at 30 days. More than 5000 patients were screened to recruit the 167 subjects, and important exclusions included AF > 30 days' duration, ejection fraction < 40%, left atrial diameter > 5 cm, severe pulmonary disease, recent MI, and coronary artery bypass.
