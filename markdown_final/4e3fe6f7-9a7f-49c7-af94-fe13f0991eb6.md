## Question

Target cells

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to identify, interpret, and act on target cells (codocytes) on a peripheral blood smear, including their morphology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, pitfalls, and the role of digital and AI tools. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise morphological definition and how to distinguish target cells from mimics. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms that generate target cells. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline a practical diagnostic algorithm. After that, I need to check for pitfalls, artifacts, and confounders that can mislead interpretation. Finally, I will consider the role of digital microscopy and computational cytomorphology, and close with a concise clinical takeaway and next steps for confirmation and management.

> Let me first confirm the morphological definition so I don't jump to conclusions: target cells are RBCs with a bull's-eye appearance due to a central, round, dark-staining hemoglobin spot separated from a peripheral rim by a pale intermediate zone. They are typically slightly smaller than normal RBCs and can be confused with spherocytes or stomatocytes, so I should double-check the central pallor and the concentric ring pattern before calling them codocytes [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not conflate mechanisms — target cells reflect increased surface-area-to-volume ratio from membrane excess or decreased hemoglobin content. I need to ensure I'm not overcalling spherocytes, which are round, dense, and lack central pallor, or stomatocytes, which have a slit-like central pallor rather than a round target spot, so careful oil-immersion review in the monolayer is essential to avoid misclassification [^113bksJN] [^114oVbFu].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology to anchor the differential: membrane excess states such as thalassemia (alpha or beta), hemoglobinopathies like HbC or HbE, and liver disease with altered cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratios all increase membrane relative to hemoglobin mass. Decreased hemoglobin content, as in iron deficiency, can also create a relative membrane excess and a target phenotype, so I need to correlate with MCV, RDW, and iron studies before concluding [^115kc4Fs] [^112yC3La].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis and prioritize it by likelihood and clinical impact: thalassemia trait or disease, iron deficiency anemia, hemoglobin C disease or trait, hemoglobin E disease or trait, sickle cell disease, liver disease (cholestasis/cirrhosis), asplenia or hyposplenism, and malnutrition. Wait, let me verify that target cells are indeed common in iron deficiency and thalassemia — yes, quantitative studies show frequent target cells in both, though they are not specific for distinguishing iron deficiency from thalassemia minor, so I should not overinterpret their presence in isolation [^115kc4Fs] [^112yC3La].

> Let me think about a practical diagnostic algorithm so I don't miss a "can't miss" diagnosis: first, confirm true target cells on a well-prepared smear in the monolayer. Second, review the CBC indices (MCV, RDW, hemoglobin) and reticulocyte count. Third, order iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation) and hemoglobin analysis (HPLC or electrophoresis) to distinguish iron deficiency from thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies. Fourth, assess liver function tests and consider abdominal imaging if liver disease is suspected. Fifth, evaluate for asplenia with Howell-Jolly bodies, thrombocytosis, and clinical history. Finally, if morphology is atypical or the clinical picture is discordant, escalate to digital review or expert consultation to avoid anchoring bias [^113bksJN] [^114oVbFu] [^111qT6NT].

> But wait, what if the "target cells" are artifacts or mimics? I should double-check slide preparation quality, because poor spreading, thick films, or drying artifacts can distort RBCs. I also need to ensure I'm not mistaking spherocytes for targets, and I should correlate with the clinical context — target cells in a patient with microcytosis and low ferritin point to iron deficiency, whereas targets with normal iron and low MCV suggest thalassemia trait. I should also remember that target cells alone cannot reliably distinguish iron deficiency from thalassemia minor, so I must integrate indices and hemoglobin studies before concluding [^113bksJN] [^114oVbFu] [^112yC3La].

> Next, I should review how digital microscopy and AI can augment, but not replace, expert review: digital whole-slide imaging facilitates standardized review, archiving, and remote consultation, though resolution limits at high power can occasionally obscure subtle features. Emerging computational pipelines like Haemorasis can quantify RBC morphometrics and detect disease-associated cytomorphologies, but I need to ensure the monolayer is analyzed and that results are interpreted in clinical context, as these tools complement rather than substitute for trained morphologists [^1159iutE] [^1149qiXj] [^1111NnBM].

> Let me reconsider the immediate clinical implications so I don't under- or over-react: if target cells are accompanied by microcytosis and iron deficiency, initiate iron therapy and investigate the cause. If they occur with normal iron and low MCV, evaluate for thalassemia trait with hemoglobin analysis and consider genetic counseling. If asplenia is suspected, confirm with imaging and administer pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccinations. If liver disease is suspected, pursue hepatology workup. And if the smear shows additional abnormal morphologies (e.g., schistocytes, blasts), escalate urgently to avoid missing hemolysis or leukemia [^115kc4Fs] [^111qT6NT] [^113bksJN] [^114oVbFu].

> In summary, I need to ensure that I identify true target cells by their central hemoglobin spot and peripheral rim, correlate with CBC indices and iron studies, and use a stepwise algorithm to distinguish iron deficiency, thalassemia, hemoglobinopathies, liver disease, and asplenia. I should double-check for artifacts and, when needed, leverage digital tools or expert review to validate subtle findings, because accurate morphologic interpretation directly informs timely, appropriate management and avoids misdiagnosis [^113bksJN] [^114oVbFu] [^115kc4Fs] [^112yC3La].

Target cells (codocytes) are **red blood cells with a central dark spot and pale outer rim** [^115kc4Fs], giving a bull's-eye appearance. They are most often seen in **thalassemia, iron deficiency anemia, and liver disease** [^112yC3La], and can also occur with hemoglobinopathies (Hb C, Hb E), asplenia, or splenic dysfunction [^115kc4Fs]. Target cells reflect increased membrane-to-volume ratio or altered hemoglobin synthesis [^notfound] and are identified on peripheral smear; they are not specific and should be interpreted with clinical context and additional tests (CBC, iron studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis, liver function) [^notfound]. Management targets the underlying cause, not the cells themselves [^notfound].

---

## Morphological characteristics

- **Appearance**: Central dark spot (hemoglobin) with a pale outer rim, resembling a bull's-eye [^notfound].
- **Size**: Normal or slightly larger than normal RBCs.
- **Shape**: Round, flat, and thin [^notfound].
- **Central pallor**: Prominent, well-defined central pallor [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

Target cells arise from **increased membrane-to-volume ratio** or altered hemoglobin synthesis [^notfound]. Mechanisms include:

- **Membrane excess**: Liver disease (cholestasis, cirrhosis) increases membrane cholesterol, expanding the membrane relative to volume [^notfound].
- **Hemoglobin defects**: Thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies (Hb C, Hb E) reduce hemoglobin content, increasing the membrane-to-volume ratio [^notfound].
- **Splenic dysfunction**: Loss of splenic remodeling (asplenia, hyposplenism) allows abnormal RBC shapes to persist [^111qT6NT].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with target cells

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Thalassemia (alpha and beta) | Reduced hemoglobin synthesis, membrane excess [^notfound] |
| Iron deficiency anemia | Reduced hemoglobin content, membrane excess [^notfound] |
| Liver disease (cholestasis, cirrhosis) | Increased membrane cholesterol, membrane excess [^notfound] |
| Hemoglobinopathies (Hb C, Hb E) | Abnormal hemoglobin structure, reduced hemoglobin content [^notfound] |
| Asplenia or hyposplenism | Loss of splenic remodeling, membrane excess [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic significance

Target cells are identified on **peripheral blood smear** by their characteristic morphology [^11195BrJ]. They are not specific and should be interpreted with clinical context and additional laboratory tests:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, RDW [^114TG4fG] [^11617974].
- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron [^111qT6NT].
- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: Detect hemoglobinopathies [^notfound].
- **Liver function tests**: Assess liver disease [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Target cells themselves are not harmful; management focuses on the **underlying cause**:

- **Thalassemia**: Genetic counseling, supportive care, transfusion as needed [^notfound].
- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Iron supplementation, address underlying causes [^notfound].
- **Liver disease**: Manage underlying liver condition [^notfound].
- **Asplenia**: Vaccination, antibiotic prophylaxis, patient education [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and pitfalls

- **Non-specificity**: Target cells are not diagnostic of a single condition; interpretation requires clinical context [^115kc4Fs].
- **Artifactual occurrence**: Improper smear preparation or staining can mimic target cells [^notfound].
- **Clinical correlation**: Always correlate with clinical history, symptoms, and laboratory findings [^114oVbFu].

---

Target cells are a morphological marker of increased membrane-to-volume ratio or altered hemoglobin synthesis [^notfound]. They are identified on peripheral smear and guide diagnosis of thalassemia, iron deficiency anemia, liver disease, and hemoglobinopathies [^115kc4Fs]. Management targets the **underlying cause**, not the cells themselves [^notfound].

### Sensitivity of peripheral blood smear review for the diagnosis of Candida fungemia [^113zx4r9]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Case reports have described detection of candidemia by examination of peripheral blood smears. It is unclear whether this method has wider applicability for early detection of fungemia.

Objective

To determine the sensitivity of smear review for detecting candidemia.

Design

Normal and cytopenic blood was spiked with increasing concentrations of yeast. Smears were prepared and reviewed by a pathologist and by technical staff. Staff members blinded to the purpose of the study first performed a routine slide review and then a targeted review for yeast.

Results

The pathologist detected isolated yeast forms at a concentration of 1 to 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. When blinded to the purpose of the study, technical staff could detect Candida in most samples when the yeast concentration was 1 to 5 x 10(7) CFU/mL, but found it in only a small fraction of samples with lower concentrations. When asked to examine the smears specifically for yeast, they could detect it in most samples containing 1 to 5 x 10(6) CFU/mL.

Conclusions

Detection of candidemia by peripheral blood smear examination requires a yeast concentration of 1 to 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL or greater. This degree of fungemia is unusual; therefore, detection of candidemia by blood smear review will not be possible in most cases. Sensitivity of smear review for yeast detection is greatly increased if the microscopist is specifically directed to look for the presence of yeast.

Establishment of expansion protocol

Our patient had been analyzed with respect to hematologic parameters such as red cell surface expression, peripheral blood smear, and globin expression pattern. For the present study, erythroid cells were expanded from PBMC using an ex vivo culture system. This culture system contains stimulatory cytokines along with the critical inclusion of dexamethasone to enable efficient expansion of the small number of erythroid progenitors present in a typical mononuclear cell preparation. Using this protocol we established and expanded erythroid cells from the CDA type IV patient in parallel with a normal control. Morphological examination (Figure 1) reveals that the expanded patient cells exhibit bi- and multi-nucleated cells with abnormal nuclei (approx. 40%) as seen in the original bone marrow and blood smears of the patient. These are observed in approximately 5% of cells from the normal control.

Figure 1.
Morphological assessment. (A) Bone marrow aspirate of patient. (B) (Left) Cytospin of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells after expansion for 11 days; (right) similar analysis for normal patient sample performed in parallel. Analysis of multiple slides revealed abnormal nuclei in 42.7% of CDA cells, and 5.6% of normal cells. (C) Quantification via cellular morphology of wild-type (WT) and patient cells categorized as proerythroblast (ProE), basophilic erythroblast (Baso), polychromatophillic erythroblast (Poly), or orthchromatic erythroblast (Ortho). Multiple cytospin slides from two experiments were separately quantified by two investigators.

Similar to the limitation in studying erythropoiesis in murine Klf1-null cells, expression of many of the cell surface markers for differentiation are quite low and not informative for staging purposes, as they are KLF1 targets. As a result, we assessed and compared the range of cellular morphologies in the d11 proliferating samples, and find these are not significantly different (Figure 1C).

### Nuclear-targeting autoantibodies induced nuclear PARP cleavage accompanied by more pronounced decrease of peripheral white blood cells than Ro / SSA and La / SSB antigen-targeting autoantibodies [^115Fh4oM]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Autoantibody production and leukocytopenia may be linked in patients with lupus erythematosus (LE). Unclear is the ability of different autoantibody species to induce apoptosis and cell loss. Laboratory routine analyses (white blood cell counts, autoantibody detection), and flow cytometry (annexin V, CD3, CD4, CD8) have been performed in 126 consecutive LE-patients. Nuclei of PBMC were investigated flow cytometrically for the presence of the 85 kDa poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) fragment. Peripheral total white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes, T-cells, CD3+ CD4+, and CD3+ CD8+ cells were significantly decreased in patients with LE (P from 1.2 x 10(-14) to P < .0008). In the presence of either antinuclear (P from 1.2 x 10(-14) to P < .0008) or anti-dsDNA antibodies (P from 2.9 x 10(-12) to P < .007) were significantly diminished. Differences in cell numbers in LE patients with versus without anti-Ro/SSA were less pronounced: significant differences could be only obtained in lymphocytes and T-cells (P < .02). Anti-La/SSB antibodies were accompanied by significant increased leukocytes (P < .02). PARP cleavage (85 kDa) in nuclei was preferentially observed in cases with nuclear targeting autoantibodies. These results indicate that nuclear targeting autoantibodies are associated to lower peripheral blood cells counts than Ro/SSA, and La/SSB cytoplasmic targeting autoantibodies. This provides an explanation for the pathogenesis of cytopenias associated with SLE.

### Perturbational phenotyping of human blood cells reveals genetically determined latent traits associated with subsets of common diseases [^112vZU4z]. Nature Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Over 3,300 traits have been investigated using GWAS in more than 1 million participants, with current studies continuing to increase sample sizes to improve statistical power. While the techniques are robust, it remains difficult to identify underlying biological effects. One major bottleneck is a generalizable strategy to move from a locus to a genetic target and mechanistic insights, limiting translation toward therapeutic development. We outline an approach that combines cellular phenotyping with GWAS to uncover previously latent, large effect-size genetic loci with direct implications for cell biology. Using multigenic models based on selected cellular phenotypes, we then identified clinical phenotypes with substantially altered disease risks related to these intermediate phenotypes.

We focused on cellular responses in peripheral blood, as such samples are highly accessible and have long been used as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, and technologies are broadly available for subsequent scaling of any useful findings. In addition to clinically available assays of cross-sectional cellular counts, we assessed blood cell properties under 36 perturbation conditions, aiming to elicit phenotypes that are latent at baseline, and thus likely to be previously unmeasured. We chose this approach to favor the identification of new disease-related endophenotypes, from which we could select those associated with large effect size common alleles that might represent rigorous drug targets. We expanded the phenotypic space from 29 blood parameters used in previous studies to over 4,000 cell readouts. We were able to identify alleles associated with key cellular processes, such as neutrophil activation and apoptosis, which have roles in common complex diseases beyond hematopoietic disorders. Evoked cellular response traits in peripheral blood offer a complementary approach to existing phenotyping with the potential to identify genes and pathways with translational and clinical relevance.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^114zZFHA]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia — referral and deferring invasive procedures: If after examination of a peripheral blood smear, it is determined that the patient will require immediate referral to another institution with expertise in the management of acute leukemia for treatment, the initial institution should, whenever possible, defer invasive procedures including bone marrow aspiration and biopsies to the treatment center to avoid duplicate procedures, associated patient discomfort, and additional costs. The panel does not suggest that care be delayed or prohibited; however, the panel strongly believes that patients will benefit from having the treating center take the primary role in performing invasive procedures.

Acute leukemia specimen handling and alternatives when material is limited: If sufficient bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood material is not available for FCI, immunohistochemical studies may be used as an alternative method for performing limited immunophenotyping, and a second bone marrow core biopsy can be obtained and submitted unfixed in tissue culture media for disaggregation for genetic studies and flow cytometry. Optimally, the same physician should interpret the BM aspirate smears and the core biopsy specimens, or the interpretations of these specimens should be correlated if performed by different physicians.

Acute leukemias — specimen choice and alternatives — are addressed as follows: "Bone marrow is the preferred specimen for acute leukemias, but peripheral blood can be used when the percentage of circulating neoplastic cells exceeds the analytical sensitivity of the assay".

How to best assess treatment response and follow longitudinal tumour evolution?

Apart from guiding diagnosis and prognosis, genotypic and phenotypic characterisation of malignant clones at diagnosis provides prerequisites to monitor haematological disease during treatment. Capturing remaining disease at low levels offers an opportunity to follow treatment response and progression and to enable swift treatment initiation and adjustment, if needed. An increasingly utilised method to do this is by assessment of MRD. MRD refers to the presence of a detectable small population of malignant cells upon treatment and has revolutionised the possibility to assess disease progression and treatment response. MRD positivity indicates that there are still remaining malignant cells in the body while MRD negativity means that no cancer cells are detectable even using very sensitive methods. MRD negativity is associated with longer remissions and potentially longer rates of survival for certain haematological malignancies. In general terms, MRD testing can show how well patients respond to treatment and it can be used to monitor remission, predict relapse and identify patients in need of alternative therapies. Depending on the specific malignancy, some or all of these potential goals can be met when measuring MRD, but technological considerations and improvements, as well as careful clinical studies in specific disease entities, are warranted for successful clinical implementation.

By definition, MRD methods are highly sensitive and can detect very low amounts of malignant cells in a large background of normal cells, at levels under morphologic detection. The most widely used methods are based on cells using flow cytometry (FC), genome detection with NGS, quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), among others. The choice of MRD markers and choice of tissue to examine often varies by type of malignancy and specific clinical needs. FC is widely used in most haematological malignancies and measures protein markers at the surface of individual malignant cells and often a fresh bone marrow sample is required. Immunophenotypic evaluation by multiparameter FC can detect one malignant cell in 10 3–10 5 normal cells, as it uses a combination of leukaemic specific markers. The advantages of FC methods include its fast turnaround time, within 1 day, but it requires skilled pathologists and standardised procedures.

### Systematic evaluation of hematologic parameters and blood smear findings in patients with SARS-CoV-2 vs other viral respiratory infections [^115r3i6Z]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated and compared the peripheral blood findings in patients with acute COVID-19 vs other viral respiratory infections.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed peripheral blood counts and smear morphology in patients with a positive viral respiratory panel (VRP) or SARS-CoV-2 test.

Results

A total of 97 peripheral blood samples (COVID-19 infection, 53; VRP positive, 44) from 50 patients (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [20.8] years; females 52%) were reviewed. There were no statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics between the 2 groups. The most common peripheral blood abnormalities were anemia, thrombocytopenia, absolute lymphopenia, and reactive lymphocytes. The following peripheral blood findings were significantly associated with other viral respiratory infections compared with COVID-19 infection: low red blood cell count, low hematocrit, high mean corpuscular volume, thrombocytopenia, low mean platelet volume, high red cell distribution width, band neutrophilia, and toxic granulation in neutrophils.

Conclusions

Our study showed that there are several peripheral blood count and morphologic abnormalities seen in patients with COVID-19, but most of these findings lack specificity as they are also seen in the other viral respiratory infections.

### Distribution and clinical significance of circulating CD8CD28regulatory T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [^112LvB4z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in the peripheral blood of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) may be closely related to the progression of PTB. In this study, the distribution characteristics and clinical importance of CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells in patients with tuberculosis were systematically analyzed, and the role and importance of CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells in influencing the immune response and progression of tuberculosis were discussed, which will provide immunological indices and reference values for the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Methods

Flow cytometry, sputum smears and computed tomography imaging were used to analyze the distribution characteristics of CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells in the peripheral blood of patients with PTB and the correlation between CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells and clinical and immune indices.

Results

The percentages of CD4 + CD25 high and CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells in the peripheral blood of patients with PTB were significantly higher than those in the healthy control (HC) group. Further analysis showed that the percentage of CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells in the Stage II group was significantly higher than that in the HC group. The percentages of CD4 + CD25 high and CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells increased significantly in patients in the Stage II group. The proportion of CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells was directly proportional to the degree of positivity in sputum smears, while CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells did not exhibit this trend. The correlations between the percentage of CD4 + CD25 high and CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells and the percentage of lymphocyte subsets were examined. The percentage of CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells was negatively correlated with the percentage of CD4 + T cells and positively correlated with the CD8 + T cell percentage in the HC and PTB groups. The percentage of CD4+CD25 high Treg cells was positively correlated with the percentage of CD4 + T cells only in the PTB group.

Conclusions

This study was the first to show that the proportion of CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells in the peripheral blood of patients with PTB was significantly increased, and the increase in CD8 + CD28 - Treg cells was related to the progression of PTB, which may affect the proportion of immune cell subsets by inhibiting the immune response, resulting in the progression of PTB.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^113kf1WJ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Across all cohorts, for each PBS we detected an average of 26,000 (range 70 to 133,916) RBC per PBS (a total of 12,042,425 RBC) and around 1,400 (range 12 to 39,862) WBC/PBS (a total of 646,952; Fig. 2e)). The cellular density for the MLL cohort was on average smaller by 44% for RBC/mm 2 and 10.5% for WBC/mm 2 compared to CUH (Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Fig. S3a). Further heterogeneity was observed across conditions, with controls having the highest WBC density and the lowest RBC density (28.9 WBC/mm 2, 189 RBC/mm 2), anemia having the highest RBC density (383 RBC/mm 2) and MDS having the lowest WBC density (13.8 WBC/mm 2; Supplementary Fig. S3b). Lastly, we also noted that automated blood films produced a higher fraction of good tiles compared to manually prepared slides while controlling for cohort and condition — an additional 5%, highlighting the utility of standardization (Supplementary Fig. S3c).

In line with the findings in Fig. 1c, we extracted on average more cells in controls than in individuals with either MDS or anemia (Supplementary Table S4), although heterogeneity across slides rendered this trend statistically insignificant. Generally, the cellular density of detected WBC in the PBS correlated with WBCCs from automated analysers, validating our detection protocol through an orthogonal approach (robust; Fig. 2f), and demonstarting that we detect a representative number of WBC in PBS. Finally, we characterized all individual cells using morphological features used in other morphometric software programs – (Supplementary Table S5; Supplementary Fig. S3). For each cell, we quantified its size, shape, color distribution and texture and for WBCs we also characterized their nuclear size and shape (Supplementary Fig. S4). We note here that our method for WBC nuclei segmentation underperforms in conditions of low contrast (where nucleus and cytoplasm are hard to distinguish) or high granularity (particularly for eosinophils and basophils; Supplementary Fig. S5), leading us to focus on cases of high contrast and avoiding conclusions pertaining to eosinophils or basophils.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^1133Ar1S]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

- Fellows should have a methodology for PBS review and be competent in identifying morphology suggestive of both common and morbid diagnoses.
- Curricular emphasis should be placed on the competency of identifying morphologic features of acute leukemias and hemolytic anemias.

### The prognostic and diagnostic value of intraleukocytic malaria pigment in patients with severe falciparum malaria [^117MCSrR]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The utility of counting the proportion of pigment containing PMNs in patients with suspected severe malaria has to be understood in the context of delivering critical care in busy resource-limited hospitals and health centres. In higher transmission settings differentiating severe malaria from other causes of severe childhood febrile illness is difficult, even for experienced clinicians, because the key clinical signs are not specific, and asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia is so common. Thus, many children are diagnosed as having severe malaria, whereas in fact they have another severe illness (usually bacterial sepsiswith incidental parasitaemia). Finding a high proportion of pigment-containing PMNs supports the diagnosis of severe malaria and it identifies those patients in need of intensive care or, if this is unavailable, close monitoring. Prognosis and diagnosis are linked: if malaria is not the cause of severe illness, then potential sources of sepsis need to be investigated and parenteral antibiotics need administering rapidly. This dilution by a different cause of fatal illness explains why the prognostic value of the intraleukocytic malaria pigment counts in African children is less than in Asian adults and children (Fig. 2). In the latter group the specificity of malaria parasitaemia as an indicator that malaria is the cause of severe illness is substantially higher. However, the proportion of PMNs containing malaria pigment is a better diagnostic and prognostic indicator than the commonly reported malaria parasite count. Overall the peripheral blood parasite density is a poor prognosticator in African children with severe malariabecause there is a 'U-shaped' relationship with in-hospital mortality and because it is a poor measure of the sequestered parasite burden. Although it is recommended that both thin and thick blood films are taken from patients suspected of having severe malaria, in many centres only a rapid test or a thick blood film is performed. Quality thin films require clean glass slides, filtered stains, anhydrous methanol, and good technique (see). But they are much easier to read, they provide more accurate counts in high-density infections, and they allow more accurate staging of parasite development, and counting of pigment-containing leukocytes. Thick films take time to dry, and are more difficult to evaluate accurately because cellular morphology is contracted, and artefacts and stain precipitates may be mistaken for malaria pigment. The speed and simplicity of counting pigment-containing PMNs is particularly valuable in rural settings with limited access to laboratory support, and thus limited capability of providing other prognostic information. Health systems should support maintenance of quality microscopy. New inexpensive cell phone-adapted automated methods of microscopy cell counting are now being developed and evaluated. These may be adaptable to parasite counting, staging and neutrophil pigment assessment but they are still years from being implementable in remote areas. Where there is a microscope, thin film assessment should be a routine part of the assessment of any patient suspected of having severe falciparum malaria.

### Histiocytic neoplasms, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^11539kZV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Langerhans cell histiocytosis — tissue biopsy analysis summarizes morphology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and molecular testing. Morphology describes histiocytes with grooved nuclei and eosinophilia. IHC includes CD1a+, Langerin (CD207)+, S100+, cyclin D1+, and BRAF V600E (VE1) ±, with the immunophenotype key indicating ±: positive or negative; +: positive; -: negative, and at minimum, the IHC panel recommended should include CD1a, S100, and Langerin; cyclin D1 and BRAF V600E (VE1, preferred antibody if possible). Molecular testing lists target capture, next-generation sequencing (NGS) including BRAF V600E, MAPK, and related pathway mutations on tissue, and molecular testing for somatic mutations and fusions can be performed in a stepwise manner or in parallel; allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BRAF V600E mutations can be the first step if BRAF V600E (VE1) IHC is not available or is equivocal. Targeted NGS panel testing should cover the common somatic mutations involving the MAPK pathway; RNA-based molecular panel including fusion testing should cover BRAF, ALK, RET, and NTRK1 rearrangements, and if there is clinical concern for ALK-positive histiocytosis, ALK IHC and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using ALK break-apart probe should be performed. Specimen guidance states fresh or paraffin-embedded tissue is used for NGS study; peripheral blood may be informative in multisystem disease, and the NGS panel should cover the common MAPK pathway mutations (ie, BRAF, ARAF, NRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1/2) and other related pathway mutations (eg, PIK3CA, CSF1R). When biopsy is not possible because of location or risk factors, mutational analysis of the peripheral blood is an option. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Developing a standardized approach for assessing mast cells and eosinophils on tissue biopsies: a Work group report of the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee [^116JaxPj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Bone marrow biopsy technique and specimen utility — A bone marrow biopsy is usually performed at the iliac crest and involves 2 stages: an aspirate and a core biopsy, and for adequacy at least a 1.5-cm length of the bone marrow core is required. It is essential to collect peripheral blood for a complete blood count with differential and peripheral blood smear evaluation before or shortly after the bone marrow biopsy for correlation of findings, and due to the excellent cellular detail and single-cell suspension of the aspirate smear it is the preferred specimen for performing a differential cell count and determining the percentage of individual cell types in the bone marrow.

CAP/ASH acute leukemia initial diagnostic workup — Statement 4 directs that the treating clinician or pathologist should obtain a fresh bone marrow aspirate for all patients suspected of acute leukemia, using a portion to make bone marrow aspirate smears for morphologic evaluation; if performed, the pathologist should evaluate an adequate bone marrow trephine core biopsy, bone marrow trephine touch preparations, and/or marrow clots in conjunction with the bone marrow aspirates. If bone marrow aspirate material is inadequate or there is a compelling clinical reason to avoid examination, peripheral blood may be used for diagnosis and ancillary studies if sufficient numbers of blasts are present.

### Whole blood stabilization for the microfluidic isolation and molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells [^112ucrHG]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral blood contains a tremendous amount of cellular and molecular information relating to the entire body, and the investigation of blood-borne cells is of broad significance to clinical medicine and basic research. In particular, recent innovations in rare-cell and molecular technologies are rapidly advancing our ability to isolate and characterize circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for the noninvasive detection and monitoring of cancer. CTC-based liquid biopsy technologies have now expanded into a wide spectrum of applications in precision oncology, including predictive biomarker discovery, understanding mechanisms of drug resistance and metastasis, and personalized testing of drug efficacy –.

However, similar to any procedures involving live tissues, blood degradation during the handling of samples and laboratory manipulations imposes practical constraints and represents a major roadblock to the translation of modern liquid biopsy technologies. Once removed from its native environment, a host of degenerative processes including hemolysis, platelet activation, cytokine and oxidative bursts, and neutrophil extracellular trap formationinflict collateral damage to the entire blood specimen. These problems are exacerbated by the extreme rarity and fragility of CTCs, not only because the target cells are buried in such a hostile environment but also due to the breakdown of stringent rare-cell sorting mechanisms when challenged with disintegrated blood cells, extracellular DNA, as well as altered cellular morphology and marker expression. Controlled studies using spiked tumor cells have documented a > 60% loss in CTC yield within 5 h of blood draw, and significant RNA degradation occurs within 2–4 hours –. In clinical studies where short-term storage for 3–4 h is common, ~ 40% of isolated single cells failed RNA quality control for profiling; within 12 h, RNA degradation could be found in 79% of cells. Although modern transfusion medicine has established protocols for the banking of purified blood components, these techniques fall short of preserving whole blood for rare-cell applications. For instance, cryogenic storage requires high concentrations of toxic cryoprotectants (e.g. 40% glycerol or dimethylsulfoxide) with complicated slow-freezing and washing protocols that are not practical for routine clinical workflow and quality control. Conditions optimized for one cell type are not necessarily beneficial to others — for example, low temperatures used for red blood cell (RBC) preservation (2–6 °C) lead to spontaneous platelet activation, which causes nonspecific binding and aggregation. Alternatively, commercial platforms, including CellSearch, the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared CTC platform, rely on fixatives to stabilize whole blood for up to 96 h to accommodate specimen storage and transportation for multicenter studies –. The tradeoff, however, is that fixation not only sacrifices cell viability but also degrades RNAdue to chemical crosslinking, fragmentation, and chemical modifications. Preservation of whole blood in an unaltered state is therefore critical for acquiring clinically actionable information such as gene expression profiling as well as establishing ex vivo cultures and xenograft models.

### Capture-based targeted sequencing using a T-cell control in myeloid malignancies and idiopathic cytopenias [^111Q9LoJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

We report on a study of next-generation sequencing in 257 patients undergoing investigations for cytopenias. We sequenced bone marrow aspirates using a target enrichment panel comprising 82 genes and used T cells from paired blood as a control. One hundred and sixty patients had idiopathic cytopenias, 81 had myeloid malignancies and 16 had lymphoid malignancies or other diagnoses. Forty-seven of the 160 patients with idiopathic cytopenias had evidence of somatic pathogenic variants consistent with clonal cytopenias. Only 39 genes of the 82 tested were mutated in the 241 patients with either idiopathic cytopenias or myeloid neoplasms. We confirm that T cells can be used as a control to distinguish between germline and somatic variants. The use of paired analysis with a T-cell control significantly reduced the time molecular scientists spent reporting compared to unpaired analysis. We identified somatic variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in a higher proportion (24%) of patients with myeloid malignancies or clonal cytopenias compared to less than 2% of patients with non-clonal cytopenias. This suggests that somatic VUS are indicators of a clonal process. Lastly, we show that blood depleted of lymphocytes can be used in place of bone marrow as a source of material for sequencing.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^114Z1RPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with SARS‐CoV‐2. The key target condition for this review was current COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms include breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia); or critical (requiring respiratory support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require distinctive patient management, and it is important to be able to identify these patients.

In this review, we focus on COVID‐19, without making the distinction between mild to moderate and severe disease.

Index test(s)

We collated evidence on all routine biomarker tests reported in the identified studies. These can be classified into:

full blood count, haemoglobin and red blood cells;
coagulation markers;
liver markers, cardiac markers and kidney function markers;
general inflammatory markers; and
metabolic markers.

### Evaluating pathologist practices in peripheral blood smear review: a comprehensive practice survey [^112tuZbc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Widely accepted standardized criteria for peripheral blood (PB) smear review do not exist. The aim of this study was to collect data regarding PB smear review practices across multiple institutions, with a focus on pathologist review.

Methods

A 23-question survey was developed by members of the Society for Hematopathology (SH) Education Committee and distributed to SH members. The survey included questions on practice environment and PB smear review practices, including trainee involvement.

Results

Of 725 members contacted, 137 (19%) completed the entire survey. Over half of practices examined 5 to 20 smears a day. All respondents reported using complete blood count/differential leukocyte count data and clinical history as part of smear review. The reported proportion of laboratory-initiated vs clinician-requested reviews varied across respondents. Clinician-requested smear reviews were more likely to be billed and issued as a separate pathology report. Glass slide review (as opposed to digital microscopy) was used by most respondents. All respondents affirmed that PB smear review is an essential component of pathology training programs. Numerous free-text comments were submitted by respondents regarding their own experiences with PB smear review and suggested improvements.

Conclusions

This survey elucidated the spectrum of practice patterns for pathologist review of blood smears and identified potential areas for process improvement.

### Technical competency assessment of peripheral blood smears: tools and trends learned from 2 college of American pathologists Q-probes studies [^117LKKRy]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Morphologic evaluation of peripheral blood smears provides valuable information to diagnose and manage a variety of hematologic disorders.

Objective —

To measure the competency of the technical staff in the morphologic evaluation of peripheral blood smears and provide performance trends.

Design —

Participating technologists accessed 10 whole slide-imaged peripheral blood smears through a web-based imaging tool in 2 separate studies. Participants performed a 100-cell differential and morphologic evaluation for each slide image. Grading criteria, determined by 3 hematopathologists, were weighted according to their clinical significance (score range, 0–100 for each case). Each institution and participant answered a questionnaire to assess the impact of current practices and educational programs on competency scores.

Results —

A total of 776 technologists from 92 institutions participated in study 1 and 1495 technologists from 179 institutions participated in study 2. Median performance scores for institutions were 78.9 and 87.6 for studies 1 and 2, respectively, encompassing a range of hematologic disorders. Based on results of the questionnaire for study 1, higher performance scores were seen when institutions required a specific number of continuing education credits per year through an agency (P = 0.005). In study 2, institutions with remediation procedures following a failed competency demonstrated higher performance scores (P = 0.03).

Conclusions —

Medical technologist competency of peripheral blood smears improves with level of experience and is positively impacted through attending educational programs. Whole slide images offer a convenient means of assessing technical competence and provide data to allow institutions to appropriately focus their procedures and educational efforts.

### Peripheral blood lymphocyte appearance in a case of I cell disease [^112p6dJM]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

In general, peripheral blood smears are performed to obtain information with regard to various morphological features as an aid in the diagnosis of infection or malignancy. This report presents a patient with I cell disease (inclusion cell disease), a fatal lysosomal storage disorder caused by a defect in an enzyme responsible for the transfer of mannose-6-phosphate ligands to precursor lysosomal enzymes. As a consequence, most lysosomal enzymes are transported outside the cell instead of being correctly targeted into the lysosomes, resulting in the storage of macromolecules in lysosomes. I cell disease, with its heterogeneous clinical presentation, can be diagnosed by the presence of intracellular vacuole-like inclusions in lymphocytes and fibroblasts, high serum lysosomal enzyme activities, and a defect of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. This report describes the morphological aspects of peripheral lymphocytes in a blood smear of a patient, the first clue to the final diagnosis of I cell disease. The observed vacuole-like inclusions in lymphocytes of this patient were negative for periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and Sudan black B staining, in contrast to earlier reports.

### CAR T cells: engineering immune cells to treat cancer… [^113R3viL]. NCI (2013). Low credibility.

Making these treatments begins with collecting blood from the patient and separating out the T cells. These cells are then sent to one of the treatment manufacturer's laboratories, where they are genetically engineered to produce special proteins on their surfaces called chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs. The CARs help the cells to latch on to specific proteins, known as antigens, that are present on cancer cells. They also enhance the T cells' ability to kill cancer cells. After the infusion, if all goes as planned, the T cells will continue to expand in the patient's body and, with guidance from their special receptors, kill any cancer cells that have the target antigen on their surfaces. CAR T-cell therapies for adults and children More than 80% of children diagnosed with ALL that arises in B cells are cured by intensive chemotherapy.

But for many years there were no effective treatments for children whose cancers returned, or relapsed, after chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant. And in clinical trials involving people with large cell lymphoma, the most common form of the disease, more than 30% of participants were alive without any evidence of cancer 5 years after treatment. Closing in on CAR T-cell therapy for solid tumors In contrast to the advances in CAR T-cell therapies for blood cancers, progress in developing them for solid tumors has lagged. Part of the problem is that researchers have struggled to identify antigens that are present on the surface of cancer cells in solid tumors but not on healthy cells and are also good candidates to target with a CAR, Dr. Rosenberg said. Solid tumors of the same cancer type can be molecularly quite different from patient to patient, and even within a patient.

For example, there may be no targetable antigens on some tumor cells, or not enough of them for CAR T cells to function as intended. But the tide may be about to turn for solid tumors. Because these CAR T cell therapies use donated T cells, however, they require additional genetic engineering to prevent patients' immune systems from recognizing the T cells as foreign and attacking them. Researchers are also investigating using CAR T-cell therapies earlier in treatment, instead of reserving them until multiple other treatments have stopped working. The approved uses of two CAR T-cell therapies have already been expanded so that they can be used as so-called second-line treatments — that is, after the initial, or first-line, treatment has stopped working — for adults with some blood cancers.

First, the digitized PBS goes through a deep-learning-based quality control (QC) algorithm that filters out parts of the PBS which are too high or low in cellular density or too blurred. Then, white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC) are detected separately — WBC are detected using a U-Net model, a deep-learning algorithm for segmentation, while RBC are detected using simple computer vision methods and filtered using machine-learning. Following this, each individual cell is characterized in terms of shape, texture and color distribution, and annotated for visualization in QuPath. b U-Net performance on WBC segmentation.

### Normal and pathological erythropoiesis in adults: from gene regulation to targeted treatment concepts [^111tXU8X]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Pathological erythropoiesis with consequent anemia is a leading cause of symptomatic morbidity in internal medicine. The etiologies of anemia are complex and include reactive as well as neoplastic conditions. Clonal expansion of erythroid cells in the bone marrow may result in peripheral erythrocytosis and polycythemia but can also result in anemia when clonal cells are dysplastic and have a maturation arrest that leads to apoptosis and hinders migration, a constellation typically seen in the myelodysplastic syndromes. Rarely, clonal expansion of immature erythroid blasts results in a clinical picture resembling erythroid leukemia. Although several mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal erythropoiesis and the pathogenesis of related disorders have been deciphered in recent years, little is known about specific markers and targets through which prognosis and therapy could be improved in anemic or polycythemic patients. In order to discuss new markers, targets and novel therapeutic approaches in erythroid disorders and the related pathologies, a workshop was organized in Vienna in April 2017. The outcomes of this workshop are summarized in this review, which includes a discussion of new diagnostic and prognostic markers, the updated WHO classification, and an overview of new drugs used to stimulate or to interfere with erythropoiesis in various neoplastic and reactive conditions. The use and usefulness of established and novel erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for various indications, including myelodysplastic syndromes and other neoplasms, are also discussed.

### Myeloid subsets impede the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer (WJOG10417GTR study) [^1167vKRc]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and deadly malignant diseases worldwide. Despite revolutionary advances, the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1/PDL1 monoclonal antibodies in advanced GC is still low due to the emergence of innate and acquired resistance to treatment. Myeloid cells represent the majority of human immune cells. Therefore, their increase, decrease, and abnormality could have a significant impact on the patient's immune system and the progression of cancer, and reprogramming, inhibiting, and eliminating the tumor-supportive types may improve the immunological situation and efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the significance of myeloid cells in anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy remains unclear in GC. In the WJOG10417GTR study on GC, we sought to identify myeloid determinants that could predict anti-PD1 therapeutic efficacy and also serve as potential therapeutic targets.

Methods

We collected tumor tissues and peripheral blood from 96 patients with advanced GC before and 1month after anti-PD1 nivolumab monotherapy, and the isolated whole leucocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry for various immune cell populations, including many myeloid subsets. Then, the relationship between the cellular levels and progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) was statistically analyzed.

Results

We found that high levels of several myeloid subsets expressing molecules that have been targeted in drug discovery but not yet approved for clinical use were significantly associated with shorter PFS/OS as compared with low levels: PDL1 + and CTLA4 + myeloid subsets within tumors at baseline, PDL1 +, B7H3 + and CD115 + myeloid subsets in peripheral blood at baseline, and LAG3 +, CD155 + and CD115 + myeloid subsets in peripheral blood at post-treatment.

Conclusions

This study revealed that these myeloid subsets are significant risk factors in nivolumab therapy for advanced GC. Targeting them may be useful as diagnostic biomarkers to predict potential anti-PD1 therapeutic efficacy, and also as therapeutic targets for accelerating the development of new drugs to improve clinical outcomes in immunotherapy for GC.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^114oVbFu]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Manual review of the PBS via light microscopy or digital whole slide imaging is strongly preferred over single high-power field images. Independent use of the compound light microscope is a mandatory skill that should be attained by graduation. Expertise in the identification of normal morphology aids in the recognition of more subtle pathology on PBS. Trainees should be wellversed in the identification of both normal and pathologic cytoplasmic and nuclear characteristics. The identification of staining and preparation artifact is necessary to allow for proper clinical reasoning. Curricula should emphasize the utility of PBS in the context of contemporary testing as it can augment or eliminate the need for other diagnostic testing, minimize medical waste, and reduce time to diagnosis. Adept fellows will contextualize PBS morphology within the greater clinical context of the patient's clinical history, laboratory, and pathologic data; and harbor an understanding of how positive and negative PBS findings affect Bayesian reasoning. Trainees should have a thorough and reproducible methodologic approach to PBS evaluation, although all educators need not be expected to teach a uniform approach across all ACGME training institutions. Specific emphasis should be placed on distinction of malignant and benign etiologies of leukocytosis and lymphocytosis. Finally, trainees should identify morphology suggestive of hemolytic anemias and suspect specific diagnoses based on PBS review with otherwise limited clinical information. In the institutions, participants practice with high resource availability and low exposure to tropical diseases. It was felt that the outsized global impact of malaria (247 million cases, and 619 000 deaths in 2021) warranted specific attention.

Broad consensus existed on the specific morphologies and diagnoses within the fellow's purview. This is an important development that can guide PBS curricular design (Tables 3 and 4). The high interrater agreement on included morphology and diagnoses indicates that hematologists likely have a shared mental model of what constitutes fellow competency, despite the lack of current formally accepted theory.

Qualitative data from the focus group sessions offer potential insights into the importance that participants place in various aspects of fellow competency. The high proportion of time spent on the specific diagnoses of acute leukemia and TMA possibly indicates a bias among attending hematologists to place heightened emphasis on the recognition of these conditions. The domains of PBS review do not appear to be weighted equally in the minds of hematologists, with an excess of attention focused on conditions that predispose patients to a high risk of short-term morbidity and mortality. Similarly, the relatively minimal discussion on the identification of abnormal platelet morphology and primary disorders of platelets potentially indicates a relative perceived lack of importance.

### Mesothelin-targeted CAR T-Cell therapy for the treatment of… [^1117zUV6]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

cancer that has come back after a period of improvement or that has spread from where it first started to other places in the body, including the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers most organs in the abdomen. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells are changed in the laboratory so they will attack tumor cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein, such as MSLN, on the patient's tumor cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a CAR. Large numbers of the modified CAR T-cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain tumors.

M28z1XXPD1DNR CAR T-cells may be safe, tolerable, and/or effective in treating patients with MSLN-positive recurrent or metastatic esophagogastric cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis.
- Untreated or active central nervous system metastases. Patients with a history of treated CNS metastases are eligible if all of the following criteria are met: Radiographic demonstration of improvement upon completion of CNS-directed therapy and no evidence of interim progression between completion of CNS-directed therapy and the screening radiographic study Completion of radiotherapy ≥ 4 weeks before the screening radiographic study.
- Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment within 1 year before leukapheresis Note: Replacement therapy is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed.
- Active interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis or a history of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis requiring treatment with systemic steroids
- Baseline pulse oximetry < 90% on room air at the screening time point
- Known active infection requiring antibiotic treatment 7 days before leukapheresis Note: Treatment can be delayed at the discretion of the treating physician to allow the patient to recover from the infection.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^111gL3Y2]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Interpretation of the PBS is an essential skill of a practicing hematologist. To the best of our knowledge, through this study we have developed and proposed CR that are the first to appear in a peer-reviewed publication. The methodology described herein offers a potential framework for others to discuss and propose consensus on analogous visuospatial and object recognition tasks within the medical specialties.

Several themes emerge from our CR. First, all fellows in ACGME accredited hematology and hematology-oncology training programs should meet minimum levels of competency upon graduation. A trainee's desire to specialize in a nonhematology focused field should not obviate the need for training in PBS review. Learners are likely to benefit most from interactions with a core group of educators. The exact qualifications and scope of practice of these educators is best determined locally because it is possible that there will be significant variability in expertise among clinical hematologists and hematopathologists across training programs. Curricula should be designed to ensure a broad level of education, and when possible, incorporate patient cases under trainee care. The use of "slide libraries" is of specific importance in the case of rare diagnoses, or common diagnoses that may not be seen owing to referral bias. Specifically, a trainee may not encounter patients with sickle cell disease, or endemic parasitic infections unless they are trained at a center with sufficient sample volume.

In summary, we performed perturbational blood cell phenotyping using a widely available cytometry device that is primarily designed for robust whole-blood cell counts. This framework incorporating human genetic data, primary cellular phenotyping and deep clinical traits enables the iteration of genetic risk locus discovery, systematic target validation and subsequent drug discovery. Implementing such a method in routine clinical settings will facilitate the development of refined clinical trajectories and identification of large effect size common variants contributing to human disease and clinical outcomes.

### Iron deficiency anemia, β-thalassemia minor, and anemia of chronic disease: a morphologic reappraisal [^112yC3La]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

We observed increased numbers of an infrequently referenced poikilocyte, the prekeratocyte, in iron deficiency anemia (IDA) compared with beta-thalassemia minor and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and, therefore, chose to quantify these cells and other morphologic features in these anemias. Prekeratocytes were observed in 31 (78%) of 40 IDAs vs 11 (37%) of 30 beta-thalassemias (P = 0.001) and 5 (13%) of 40 ACDs (P < .001) and averaged 0.78 per 1,000 RBCs in IDA vs 0.21 in beta-thalassemia (P < .001) and 0.075 in ACD (P < .001). Pencil cells also were more commonly seen and more numerous in IDAs than in beta-thalassemia or ACD. Target cells were present in most IDAs and thalassemia and in similar numbers. Basophilic stippling was seen in only 5 (17%) of the beta-thalassemias. Our results lend quantitative support to prekeratocytes and pencil cells as morphologic features favoring the diagnosis of IDA but fail to support the diagnostic usefulness of target cells and basophilic stippling in discriminating IDA and beta-thalassemia minor.

### EuroFlow antibody panels for standardized n-dimensional flow cytometric immunophenotyping of normal, reactive and malignant leukocytes [^114YTjpv]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

For more than two decades, immunophenotyping has been providing relevant information for the diagnosis, classification and monitoring of hematological malignancies. Together with cyto/histomorphology and molecular (cyto)genetics, immunophenotyping is crucial for the identification, enumeration and characterization of leukemia and lymphoma cells. Consequently, it has acquired a prominent position in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematological malignancies. Preferably, the immunophenotypic profiles of suspected cells should be compared with those of normal hematopoietic cells. Immunophenotypic similarities between the suspected cells and their potential normal counterparts allow the assignment of such cells to a given hematopoietic cell lineage and maturational stage, as well as the identification of aberrant phenotypes, such as leukemia-associated immunophenotypes. Such immunophenotyping requires careful selection of unique combinations of individual markers based on their degree of specificity for the identification of a given cell lineage, maturation stage and aberrant phenotype, as well as the selection of appropriate antibody clones and fluorochrome conjugates to be used in multicolor combinations; the performance of these marker combinations is even more relevant than that of the individual markers. Consequently, such careful selection of reagents is essential for the design of standardized multicolor antibody combinations that provide unique staining patterns for each normal or aberrant cell population in a given sample.

Each marker combination should be designed to answer one or multiple relevant clinical questions, through the identification, enumeration and characterization of the relevant cell populations in a sample. As the target cell population may not be known in advance or might have been defined previously, a different strategy is required in each situation. In the former situation, a rapid screening step based on a limited number of antibodies (preferably in a single tube) directed at differential identification of all relevant cell subsets in the sample is generally most efficient, (Figure 1). In the latter situation, usage of a full antibody panel is recommended for the characterization and diagnostic classification of the suspected cells, using several (common) backbone markers for reliable and reproducible identification of the target cells in each multicolor combination of the antibody panel, (Figure 1). Preferably, the single-tube screening antibody panels and the multi-tube disease-classification antibody panels fit in a diagnostic algorithm with entries defined by clinical and laboratory parameters. Such a diagnostic algorithm is proposed here by the EuroFlow Consortium (Figure 1) as a critical prerequisite in the design of optimal antibody panels for diagnostic immunophenotyping.

Objective

- To present proof of concept for an image-based approach to complete blood count, based on a new slide preparation technique. A preliminary data comparison with the current flow-based technology is shown.

Design

- A prototype instrument uses a proprietary method and technology to deposit a precise volume of undiluted peripheral whole blood in a monolayer onto a glass microscope slide so that every cell can be distinguished, counted, and imaged. The slide is stained, and then multispectral image analysis is used to measure the complete blood count parameters. Images from a 600-cell white blood cell differential count, as well as 5000 red blood cells and a variable number of platelets, that are present in 600 high-power fields are made available for a technologist to view on a computer screen. An initial comparison of the basic complete blood count parameters was performed, comparing 1857 specimens on both the new instrument and a flow-based hematology analyzer.

Results

- Excellent correlations were obtained between the prototype instrument and a flow-based system. The primary parameters of white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet counts resulted in correlation coefficients (r) of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98, respectively. Other indices included hemoglobin (r = 0.99), hematocrit (r = 0.99), mean cellular volume (r = 0.90), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (r = 0.97), and mean platelet volume (r = 0.87). For the automated white blood cell differential counts, r values were calculated for neutrophils (r = 0.98), lymphocytes (r = 0.97), monocytes (r = 0.76), eosinophils (r = 0.96), and basophils (r = 0.63).

Conclusions

- Quantitative results for components of the complete blood count and automated white blood cell differential count can be developed by image analysis of a monolayer preparation of a known volume of peripheral blood.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^116kgUiu]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Platelet agglutinates in a peripheral blood smear in EDTA. Blood was taken from a patient with fever and cough. Her platelet count was 38x10 9 /L in EDTA and 176x10 9 /L in CPT. An activated lymphocyte is visible. The final diagnosis was upper airway infection. EDTA: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; CPT: citrate, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, tris. Reproduced, with permission, from Nagler M, et al.

Diagnosis of pseudothrombocytopenia

PTCP must be suspected in subjects with severely decreased platelet counts and no bleeding diathesis. In cases of mildly or moderately decreased platelet counts, which are not usually associated with an overt bleeding diathesis even in patients with true thrombocytopenia, the presence of platelet clumps in blood samples could be suspected based on specific warning flags and histogram patterns provided by electronic counters. However, the accuracy of currently available counters at detecting platelet clumps has been shown to be inadequate,20, lacking acceptable sensitivity and specificity. For example, small platelet clumps may be mistaken for leukocytes by the counter, resulting in the lack of platelet flags and in spurious leukocytosis, Although strategies are being implemented to increase their sensitivity, the absence of platelet flags will likely never allow the certain exclusion of PTCP in a sample with a low platelet count. For these reasons, the diagnosis of PTCP must rely solely on the microscopic examination of blood smears of EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples (possibly the same one on which blood cell counts had been performed), which allows the visual detection of platelet clumps (Figure 3). After all, therefore, the diagnosis of PTCP does not require any specific diagnostic procedure in addition to those recommended for thrombocytopenia and any other kind of abnormalities in the complete blood cell count, which all require the visual inspection of blood smears as the first step in the diagnostic work-up. According to the consensus of the Groupe Francophone d'Hématologie Cellulaire, a clump of platelets is defined as a cluster of at least five attached platelets, which are usually easily detected at the margins and the tail of the blood smear. Visual inspection of blood smears carrying platelet clumps in the primary care laboratories that first identify a subject displaying a low platelet count will decrease the undue referral of patients to specialized centers for the diagnostic work-up of thrombocytopenia.

### Comparative analysis reveals potential utility of digital microscopy in the evaluation of peripheral blood smears with some barriers to implementation [^1159iutE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear (PBS) is an essential diagnostic test in current medical practice. We aimed to evaluate the use of digital microscopy for the examination of PBS as an option to provide expert interpretation to remote sites and in "on-call" situations.

Methods

We collected 100 Wright-Giemsa-stained PBS slides representing normal and abnormal findings seen at a community-based hospital. Four hematopathologists independently evaluated the cases using conventional light and digital microscopy.

Results

When comparing digital vs light microscopy, most of the cellular features evaluated showed at least a moderate degree of agreement in at least three of the reviewers. Discrepancies in final diagnosis were identified in a minority of the cases, most of which were attributed to the poorer resolution of digital microscopy at high magnification (×400).

Conclusions

These results support the limited use of digital microscopy for evaluation and triage of peripheral blood smears as a practical option to obtain expert opinion in locations where experienced staff is not available on site. Our results indicate that while digital microscopy is well suited for basic triage of these blood smears, limitations in quality of imaging at higher magnification as well as large file size may limit its utility in certain settings and situations.

### Morphological evaluation of monocytes and their precursors [^112EP3h1]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

The monocyte is still the most difficult cell to identify with confidence in the peripheral blood or in the bone marrow in healthy individuals as well as in patients with infections, and in those with leukemic proliferations. The goal of this study was to establish morphological definitions so that monocytes, including immature monocytes, could be separated from the spectrum of monocyte precursors. Cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow were selected to provide a large panel of normal and leukemic cells at different maturational stages and were submitted to 5 experts, who had previously reached a consensus, on the basis of microscopy, in defining 4 subtypes: monoblast, promonocyte, immature monocyte, mature, monocyte. They achieved a good concordance rate of 76.6% and a high kappa rate confirming that the criteria for defining the 4 subtypes could be applied consistently. It has now to be established whether these monocyte subtypes correlate with immunological or molecular markers and are clinically relevant.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^1149qiXj]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of hematological malignancies relies on expert cytomorphological examination of blood, bone marrow and/or other tissue biopsies, together with molecular analyses that aid subclassification and prognosis. For example, anemias, characterized by reduced hemoglobin concentration (Hb) and altered red blood cell (RBC) numbers, can be both a disease and a feature of other conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms that can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) –. For this reason, the diagnosis and further subtyping of MDS requires the detection of cytopenias, changes to white blood cell (WBC) and RBC maturation blood cell through cytomorphologic analysis of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood slides (PBS), cyto- and histochemistry, karyotyping and immunophenotyping –.

### Automatic recognition of different types of acute leukaemia in peripheral blood by image analysis [^112HHKi7]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Morphological differentiation among different blast cell lineages is a difficult task and there is a lack of automated analysers able to recognise these abnormal cells. This study aims to develop a machine learning approach to predict the diagnosis of acute leukaemia using peripheral blood (PB) images.

Methods

A set of 442 smears was analysed from 206 patients. It was split into a training set with 75% of these smears and a testing set with the remaining 25%. Colour clustering and mathematical morphology were used to segment cell images, which allowed the extraction of 2,867 geometric, colour and texture features. Several classification techniques were studied to obtain the most accurate classification method. Afterwards, the classifier was assessed with the images of the testing set. The final strategy was to predict the patient's diagnosis using the PB smear, and the final assessment was done with the cell images of the smears of the testing set.

Results

The highest classification accuracy was achieved with the selection of 700 features with linear discriminant analysis. The overall classification accuracy for the six groups of cell types was 85.8%, while the overall classification accuracy for individual smears was 94% as compared with the true confirmed diagnosis.

Conclusions

The proposed method achieves a high diagnostic precision in the recognition of different types of blast cells among other mononuclear cells circulating in blood. It is the first encouraging step towards the idea of being a diagnostic support tool in the future.

### The impact of pathologist review on peripheral blood smears: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study of 22 laboratories [^113F2gtb]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

The aim of the study was to determine the impact of peripheral blood (PB) smear review by a pathologist when requested by a technologist or provider to measure the rate of pathologist-detected clinically relevant findings.

Objective —

To report and analyze the results of clinically relevant morphologic findings on PB smears that were pathologist reviewed because of either a request from a technologist or an order from a provider.

Design —

During a 4-week study period, participants enrolled in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes program submitted data on PB smear reviews including review request source, reason for review request, and if the pathologist's review resulted in a clinically relevant morphologic finding.

Results —

Twenty-two institutions submitted data on 835 eligible PB smears. Pathologists identified clinically relevant findings on a median 53.4% of technologist-requested PB smear reviews and a median 14.3% of provider-ordered PB smear reviews. The most frequently identified pathologist finding on technologist-requested PB smear reviews was "blasts" in 91 of 532 (17.1%) followed by "atypical (possibly neoplastic) lymphocytes" in 74 of 532 (13.9%); the most frequent finding on provider-ordered reviews was "other" in 55 of 315 (17.5%) followed by "immature cells/left shift in myeloid cells or monocytes" in 12 of 315 (3.8%). Pathologists agreed with technologists' indications for review in 458 of 513 requested reviews (89.3%). Institutions that conducted postanalytic follow-up on previously reviewed PB smears had a higher rate of clinically relevant findings detected on technologist-requested smears.

Conclusions —

Pathologist review of PB smears flagged by technologists for review frequently yielded clinically relevant findings. This was higher in institutions that conducted postanalytic reviews. Provider-ordered reviews resulted in clinically relevant findings in a median of 14.3% of smears.

### Next-generation morphology, a novel multilayer morphometric digital analysis, reveals both the basic topology and new trends of myelodysplasia of peripheral blood specimens [^116N5H8j]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Traditional microscopy compromises between resolution and field of view, limiting its diagnostic sensitivity. We present here next-generation morphology (NGM), a novel five-layer analytical approach leveraging a physical solution that enables high-resolution, large-field digital imaging, data mining and analysis of blood specimens. To test NGM performance, peripheral blood smears (PBS) from 37 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and 30 age-matched controls were analysed. PBS topology was mapped to identify regions optimal for analysis. Red blood cells (RBCs) displayed a gradient distribution with a narrow zone suitable for accurate morphological assessment. NGM facilitated direct morphometric measurements of individual red and white blood cells (RBCs and WBCs), which were correlated with clinical variables. Significant morphometric differences were found between MDS and controls, particularly in RBC size, shape and neutrophil granularity and subpopulations profile. WBC differentials based on 1000 WBC significantly elevated blasts detection compared to conventional 100-WBC counts. Multivariate analysis linked RBC morphometrics with high-risk MDS. In summary, NGM overcomes traditional microscopy limitations, offering high-resolution, large-field imaging for sensitive digital morphometry of PBS. This technology can enhance the detection and quantitative characterization of haematological abnormalities, thereby contributing to the understanding of MDS physiology, and may support early detection of dysplasia in PBS.

### Revisiting the full blood count: circulating blood cells and their role in coagulation [^113Lw5Eg]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

There has been an expansion in our understanding of the multifaceted roles of circulating blood cells in regulating haemostasis and contributing to thrombosis. Notably, there is greater recognition of the interplay between coagulation with inflammation and innate immune activation and the contribution of leucocytes. The full blood count (FBC) is a time-honoured test in medicine; however, its components are often viewed in isolation and without consideration of their haemostatic and thrombotic potential. Here, we review how the individual components of the FBC, that is, haemoglobin, platelets and leucocytes, engage with the haemostatic system and focus on both their quantitative and qualitative attributes. We also explore how this information can be harnessed into better management of people with multiple long-term conditions because of their higher risk of adverse clinical events.

### Molecular techniques in haematopathology: what and how? [^113ZhN1Y]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Schematic work‐flow of sequencing platforms. (A) Sanger sequencing is based on the selective incorporation of chain‐terminating dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) by DNA polymerase during DNA replication. During the chain termination PCR, DNA polymerase incorporates deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) into the growing DNA strand. When a fluorescently labelled ddNTP is incorporated, the strand elongation is terminated as ddNTPs lack a 3′‐OH group required to form a phosphodiester bond with the next nucleotide. The resulting terminated DNA fragments of various lengths are then separated by capillary electrophoresis. The fluorescence of the terminating ddNTPs is detected, and the DNA sequence is determined by the order of the fluorescence peaks recorded, which corresponds to the nucleotide sequence in the DNA strand. (B) Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) is a high‐throughput methodology that allows for the simultaneous sequencing of millions of DNA targets from multiple patient samples. Here, Illumina sequencing chemistry is depicted. During NGS library preparation, DNA is fragmented into smaller pieces. Sequencing adapters and indexes are ligated to the ends of these DNA fragments. The indexes enable sample identification within pooled data. Depending on whether targeted NGS or whole‐genome sequencing (WGS) is desired, a target enrichment step may be included. Libraries from multiple samples are pooled together and loaded onto a flow cell coated with oligonucleotides complementary to the sequencing adapters. The library DNA is then immobilized on the surface and undergoes bridge amplification, generating clusters of amplified DNA. These clusters augment the fluorescent signal during sequencing cycles. During sequencing, fluorescently labelled nucleotides are added. Each incorporated nucleotide emits a fluorescent signal that is detected and recorded. This process is repeated for each nucleotide in the sequence. This sequencing is performed in parallel across millions of clusters, enabling the massive parallel sequencing of multiple targets from multiple patients. (C) Error‐corrected NGS enhances sequencing accuracy by incorporating molecular barcodes and consensus sequence analysis to correct errors introduced during sequencing and amplification, making it especially useful in MRD assessment. During library preparation, molecular barcodes of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are attached to each DNA fragment before amplification. After sequencing, reads sharing the same UMIs are grouped and analysed. This allows for the identification of true mutations (e.g. "A" in all reads of the orange read group) and distinguishes them from random errors (e.g. "G", "T", "A" in a subset of reads in the green and red read groups). (D) Long‐read sequencing. Various platforms exist and Oxford Nanopore technology is depicted here. Nanopore array is submerged in an electrolyte solution and an electric potential is applied across the membrane. Double‐stranded DNA is unwound by the motor protein and the single‐strand molecule passes through the nanopore one at a time. As each nucleotide passes through the nanopore, it causes characteristic disruptions in the ionic current flowing through the pore. These disruptions generate a unique signal for each nucleotide. The device detects and records these electrical signals in real‐time, producing raw signal data that corresponds to the nucleotide sequence of the DNA molecule.

### Laboratory productivity and the rate of manual peripheral blood smear review: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study of 95, 141 complete blood count determinations performed in 263 institutions [^112JaYDv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Automated laboratory hematology analyzers are capable of performing differential counts on peripheral blood smears with greater precision and more accurate detection of distributional and morphologic abnormalities than those performed by manual examinations of blood smears. Manual determinations of blood morphology and leukocyte differential counts are time-consuming, expensive, and may not always be necessary. The frequency with which hematology laboratory workers perform manual screens despite the availability of labor-saving features of automated analyzers is unknown.

Objective

To determine the normative rates with which manual peripheral blood smears were performed in clinical laboratories, to examine laboratory practices associated with higher or lower manual review rates, and to measure the effects of manual smear review on the efficiency of generating complete blood count (CBC) determinations.

Design

From each of 3 traditional shifts per day, participants were asked to select serially, 10 automated CBC specimens, and to indicate whether manual scans and/or reviews with complete differential counts were performed on blood smears prepared from those specimens. Sampling continued until a total of 60 peripheral smears were reviewed manually. For each specimen on which a manual review was performed, participants indicated the patient's age, hemoglobin value, white blood cell count, platelet count, and the primary reason why the manual review was performed. Participants also submitted data concerning their institutions' demographic profiles and their laboratories' staffing, work volume, and practices regarding CBC determinations. The rates of manual reviews and estimations of efficiency in performing CBC determinations were obtained from the data.

Setting

A total of 263 hospitals and independent laboratories, predominantly located in the United States, participating in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes Program.

Results

There were 95,141 CBC determinations examined in this study; participants reviewed 15,423 (16.2%) peripheral blood smears manually. In the median institution (50th percentile), manual reviews of peripheral smears were performed on 26.7% of specimens. Manual differential count review rates were inversely associated with the magnitude of platelet counts that were required by laboratory policy to trigger smear reviews and with the efficiency of generating CBC reports. Lower manual differential count review rates were associated with laboratory policies that allowed manual reviews solely on the basis of abnormal automated red cell parameters and that precluded performing repeat manual reviews within designated time intervals. The manual scan rate elevated with increased number of hospital beds. In more than one third (35.7%) of the peripheral smears reviewed manually, participants claimed to have learned additional information beyond what was available on automated hematology analyzer printouts alone.

Conclusion

By adopting certain laboratory practices, it may be possible to reduce the rates of manual reviews of peripheral blood smears and increase the efficiency of generating CBC results.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^111qT6NT]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

We herein report on a 26‐year‐old Caucasian female who was referred to our outpatient clinic with a history of abnormal blood count, including thrombocytosis and monocytosis known for the last 7 years. No family history of hematological disorders was reported. Her past medical history was significant for a papillary thyroid carcinoma that was treated with surgery and radioiodine therapy, obtaining a complete remission; the patient is currently taking levothyroxine. Her physical exam was normal and no signs and/or symptoms of infection were noticed.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 450 × 10 9 /L, is a common finding in routine blood tests and a common cause of referral to hematologists for further investigation. Causes of thrombocytosis can be grouped into primary, secondary, and spurious (Table 1). To find out the etiology of the thrombocytosis, the clinical hematologist should take into consideration data from familial and medical history, physical examination, results of hematological exams, clonal genetic abnormalities and bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy for morphological features, flow cytometric data, and cytogenetic and molecular markers of clonality.

TABLE 1
Causes of thrombocytosis

During the visit, we performed additional blood tests. A complete blood count revealed the following values: Hemoglobin 150 g/L, hematocrit 42.8%, mean cell volume 88 fL, white blood cell count 10.23 × 10 9 /L, and platelet count 582 × 10 9 /L. Differential white blood cell count revealed a normal absolute neutrophil count and a slightly increased number of monocytes (1.2 × 10 9 /L). Morphological examination of peripheral blood smear confirmed the higher‐than‐normal platelet count with no significant platelet clumping and also showed several target cells, acanthocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies within red blood cells (Figure 1 A). C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results within the normal range. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were normal. Serum level of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was within the normal range. A chest X‐ray revealed no abnormalities attributable to pulmonary infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of infection and reported limited visualization of the spleen. The BCR‐ABL rearrangement was absent in peripheral blood. No mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes were found in DNA from peripheral blood granulocytes.

### Diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis using peripheral blood microscopy in Ethiopia: a prospective phase-III study of the diagnostic performance of different concentration techniques compared to tissue aspiration [^1119yuST]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal parasitic disease. Unfortunately, diagnosis of VL in east Africa currently relies on aspiration of tissue from the spleen or bone marrow, which is painful and potentially dangerous. We sought to determine whether peripheral blood could be used instead of invasive tissue aspirates to diagnose VL, using three parasite concentration techniques. Three hundred and one consecutive people suspected of having VL were recruited. Compared with microscopy of tissue aspirates, the diagnostic accuracy of peripheral blood microscopy was as follows: whole blood thin smear sensitivity 1.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0–8.3) and specificity 100% (95% CI 76.8–100); buffy-coat smear sensitivity 19.5% (95% CI 14.3–25.6) and specificity 98.9% (95% CI 94.1–100); peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) smear sensitivity 33.7% (95% CI 27.3–40.5) and specificity 95.7% (95% CI 89.6–98.6). Sensitivity of PBMC smears was significantly higher in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients (N = 48/301); two-sample test of proportions, P = 0.0097; sensitivity 55.9% (95% CI 37.9–72.8) and specificity 92.9% (95% CI 66.1–99.8), and correlated with the degree of parasite load in the tissue. Combining the results from smears of both PBMC and buffy coat yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 67.6% (95% CI 49.1–82.6) and 92.9% (95% CI 66.1–99.8), respectively, in HIV-coinfected patients. In this setting, VL could be ruled-in with peripheral blood microscopy in a substantial number of VL suspects and may reduce the number of tissue aspirations performed, particularly in HIV-coinfected patients. More sensitive and logistically feasible methods than light microscopy are needed to detect Leishmania donovani parasites present in blood.

2.4 Staining and multispectral imaging

Traditionally, blood smears are stained with Wright‐Giemsa stains and their variants, which have a century‐long track record in the differential identification of peripheral blood cell populations. However, these stains suffer from a number of drawbacks, including significant incubation times, the requirements for washing steps, the need for fixation (which disrupts morphology) and variability in stain appearance between preparations. These shortcomings prove challenging in the POC context, where speed, automation and a compact form‐factor are desired. It is for this reason that Sight OLO departs from traditional staining methods and employs a novel staining and imaging approach.

Sight OLO uses a combination of brightfield and fluorescence microscopy, so that the identification of different cell populations can be aided by their optical and chemical signatures. In total, five illumination wavelengths are used to generate multispectral images of blood samples: violet (405 nm), green (517 nm) and red (633 nm) brightfield channels as well as ultra‐violet (365 nm) and blue (460 nm) fluorescent channels. Two fluorescent reagents are included in OLO's sample preparation process and mixed with blood as it undergoes the dilution process. The first of these reagents stains cell nuclear DNA while the other stains DNA, RNA and acidic cell organelles. Additionally, violet illumination, which is highly absorbed by hemoglobin, assists in identifying RBCs and quantifying cellular hemoglobin content. Characteristic images of different normal and abnormal blood cell types as acquired by OLO are presented using false coloring in Figure 1.

2.5 Scanning hardware

Sight OLO contains a fully automated fluorescence microscope which rapidly collects high‐quality images of the blood smear present within its single‐use test cartridge. The analyzer automatically scans at least 200 non‐overlapping fields within the sample, and at each field it acquires the several channels of fluorescent and brightfield imaging. In order to simplify manufacturing constraints on cartridge flatness, OLO automatically refocuses on the sample at every field. Each blood sample is thus "digitized" into approximately 6 GB of image data.

In addition to microscopy, the Sight OLO also measures hemoglobin using an unlysed, reagent‐free process utilizing four wavelengths to account for absorption and scattering. The hemoglobin chamber is directly filled with undiluted whole blood using capillary action and contains several measurement areas, which differ by optical path length. These areas are used to derive differential measurements in order to normalize for system parameters such as illumination intensity and manufacturing tolerances.

### Stem cells deliver chemo to metastatic breast cancer-NCI… [^115p7jtz]. NCI (2017). Low credibility.

Modified Stem Cells Deliver Chemotherapy to Metastatic Tumors, by NCI Staff Researchers have used modified stem cells to deliver a cancer drug selectively to metastatic breast cancer tumors in mice. The stem cells specifically targeted metastatic tumors by homing in on the stiff environment that typically surrounds them. Compared with nonmodified stem cells, the modified stem cell treatment shrank metastatic breast tumors in mice and improved their rate of survival. The study results were published July 26 in. Science Translational Medicine. Components in the area surrounding tumors, called the tumor microenvironment, can directly affect cancer progression and metastasis. Now, the research team believes, they may have found a way to take advantage of the tumor microenvironment.

In contrast to other therapies that target cancer cells directly, "we demonstrated that you can actually target the 'home' where cancer cells reside — the tumor microenvironment, " said the study's lead investigator, Weian Zhao, Ph. D., of University of California, Irvine. In addition, MSCs preferentially settle near tumors, and some researchers think that the stiff microenvironment may help recruit them. Because of the properties of MSCs, Dr. Zhao and his team reasoned that these cells might be used to specifically target tumors. While the researchers focused on metastatic tumors in their current study, their approach could theoretically "target primary tumors as well, " Dr. Zhao said. To manipulate MSCs into delivering cancer therapy to tumors, the researchers modified the cells so that they would express the gene for a key enzyme only when they encounter a stiff microenvironment.

The enzyme, called cytosine deaminase, converts the chemical flucytosine into the chemotherapy drug fluorouracil. Fluorouracil is commonly used to treat breast cancer. But like other chemotherapy drugs, it can damage healthy tissues and lead to toxicity when given systemically. The team's hope was that by modifying MSCs to express the CD enzyme only in the stiff tumor microenvironment, the chemotherapy drug would be activated specifically near tumors, preferentially killing cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. Targeting Metastatic Tumors In lab experiments, the researchers mixed the modified MSCs, breast cancer cells, and flucytosine on different surfaces. They found that the modified MSCs expressed CD and reduced breast cancer cell growth when placed on a stiff glass surface but not when placed on a soft gel surface.

Babesiosis in highly immunocompromised patients — treatment duration and resistance considerations include that a subgroup of highly immunocompromised patients required at least 6 consecutive weeks of antibiotic therapy, including 2 final weeks during which parasites were no longer detected on peripheral blood smear. Eleven of 14 patients had B cell lymphoma or another B cell malignancy, of whom 10 were being treated with rituximab. A few cases of relapse despite at least 6 consecutive weeks of atovaquone plus azithromycin demonstrate that resistance to atovaquone and/or azithromycin can emerge in highly immunocompromised patients during an extended course of this antibiotic combination, and therapeutic failure in these cases was attributed to amino acid substitutions in the regions of B. microti proteins that are targeted by atovaquone and azithromycin.

Although larger amounts of nucleic acids appear in the serum, these have been demonstrated to be from lysed residual white blood cells, and the peripheral blood white cell DNA can present a significant problem for identification of ctDNA because it is present in great excess and can decrease sensitivity of detection; several commercial blood collection tubes for extracellular DNA and RNA are available, but they are not used in most protocols.

T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) — diagnostic criteria and morphology: "The diagnosis of T-PLL is established if all three major criteria (T-lymphocytosis, > 5 x10^9/L cells of T-PLL phenotype in peripheral blood or bone marrow; T-cell clonality confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or by flow cytometry; abnormalities in chromosome 14 or overexpression of TCL-1 or MTCP-1 oncogene) or if the first two major criteria and any one of the minor criteria… are present". Morphology and immunophenotyping are pivotal, as "Morphologic examinations of peripheral blood smear, as well as adequate immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, are essential to establish the diagnosis of T-PLL". Typical cells are common: "In most cases (approximately 75%), the typical morphology comprises medium-sized prolymphocytes… ", whereas "in approximately 20% to 25% of cases, the cell is small and the nucleolus may not be readily visible". Bone marrow findings include that "Diffuse infiltration in the bone marrow is typically observed with T-PLL, but diagnosis is difficult to establish based on bone marrow evaluation alone", and "In general, bone marrow biopsy is not essential for establishing a diagnosis of T-PLL though should be used to confirm remission to therapy".

### Cell-free tumour DNA testing for early detection of cancer-a potential future tool [^1169SdM4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years, detection of cell-free tumour DNA (ctDNA) or liquid biopsy has emerged as an attractive noninvasive methodology to detect cancer-specific genetic aberrations in plasma, and numerous studies have reported on the feasibility of ctDNA in advanced cancer. In particular, ctDNA assays can capture a more 'global' portrait of tumour heterogeneity, monitor therapy response, and lead to early detection of resistance mutations. More recently, ctDNA analysis has also been proposed as a promising future tool for detection of early cancer and/or cancer screening. As the average proportion of mutated DNA in plasma is very low (0.4% even in advanced cancer), exceedingly sensitive techniques need to be developed. In addition, as tumours are genetically heterogeneous, any screening test needs to assay multiple genetic targets in order to increase the chances of detection. Further research on the genetic progression from normal to cancer cells and their release of ctDNA is imperative in order to avoid overtreating benign/indolent lesions, causing more harm than good by early diagnosis. More knowledge on the sources and elimination of cell-free DNA will enable better interpretation in older individuals and those with comorbidities. In addition, as white blood cells are the major source of cell-free DNA in plasma, it is important to distinguish acquired mutations in leukocytes (benign clonal haematopoiesis) from an upcoming haematological malignancy or other cancer. In conclusion, although many studies report encouraging results, further technical development and larger studies are warranted before applying ctDNA analysis for early cancer detection in the clinic.

### Using peripheral smear review, age and absolute lymphocyte count as predictors of abnormal peripheral blood lymphocytoses diagnosed by flow cytometry [^113gyBXN]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Absolute lymphocytosis in the elderly raises the possibility of malignancy and generally warrants further investigation. To better correlate clinical variables with the frequency of neoplastic lymphoid processes in this population, we retrospectively reviewed archived flow cytometric analyses from peripheral blood specimens on patients of 50 years of age and older that had been deemed suspicious for a lymphoproliferative process after peripheral smear review. Age, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), white blood cell count and relative lymphocyte count were correlated with the results of flow cytometry. Of 71 total cases, 42 (59%) had an abnormal immunophenotype. Independent variables that showed significant differences between normal and abnormal immunophenotype were mean age (p = 0.001) and ALC (p = 0.0032). We combined age and absolute lymphocyte count variables to look for the best possible cutoff values to predict the likelihood of an abnormal immunophenotype. ALC cutoff values of ≥ 4 x 10(9) cells/L for patients over 67 years of age, and > 6.7 x 10(9) cells/L for patients between 50 and 67 years of age, had a high sensitivity for detecting an abnormal immunophenotype.

Although several mechanisms underlying normal and pathological red cell production in the bone marrow have been identified in recent years, little is known about disease-related markers and targets through which prognostication and therapy may be improved in anemic or polycythemic patients. In order to discuss novel markers, targets and mechanisms as well as new therapeutic approaches and strategies in various erythroid disorders, a workshop was organized in Vienna in April 2017 (April 28–29). The discussion in this meeting focused on pathological (neoplastic) erythropoiesis in adults. The outcomes of this workshop are summarized in this review.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111yJwn9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) — diagnosis — requires the presence of an expanded clonal population of T- or NK-cell large granular lymphocytes, and the diagnosis of T-LGLL should be based on clinicopathologic findings. Morphologic examinations of peripheral blood smear, flow cytometry with adequate immunophenotyping, and assessment of T-cell clonality are essential to confirm T-LGLL, and small, clinically non-significant clones can occur in bone marrow failure disorders; therefore, it is essential to rule out reactive large granular lymphocytosis in patients with autoimmune or bone marrow failure disorders. TRBC1 expression by flow cytometry has been reported as a highly sensitive method for assessing T-cell clonality with good correlation with molecular methods.

### Orientia tsutsugamushi in peripheral white blood cells of patients with acute scrub typhus [^116RmU9B]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2001). Low credibility.

Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is an acute illness that occurs in many parts of Asia. Clinical manifestations range from inapparent to organ failure. Organisms disseminate from the skin to target organs, suggesting that they may enter the peripheral circulation. Here, peripheral blood cell smears from patients with acute scrub typhus were obtained before treatment and for 2 days after treatment and reacted with antibodies specific for O. tsutsugamushi. White blood cells from 3 of 7 patients with acute scrub typhus stained positively for O. tsutsugamushi. Cells containing O. tsutsugamushi were mononuclear and were detected on each day of sampling. The presence of O. tsutsugamushi in peripheral white blood cells of patients with acute scrub typhus is a new finding with clinical and pathogenic implications.

### CRLF3 plays a key role in the final stage of platelet genesis and is a potential therapeutic target for thrombocythemia [^114hZixV]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Crlf3 deficiency leads to ineffective thrombopoiesis

Preplatelets released into the BM sinusoids resemble proplatelet shafts, barbell platelets or giant platelets. Preplatelets were rarely seen on the blood smears of control mice (Supplemental Figure 4A) but were easily identified on Crlf3 -/- samples. Remarkably some of these were several hundred microns in length with the classical "beads on a string" appearance which has been reported before in culture but not in the peripheral circulation (fig.2A and Supplemental Figure 4A). We confirmed that these structures were preplatelets using immunofluorescence staining for specific platelet cell surface markers (CD41) and proteins contained in platelet α-granules, vWf (fig.2B), and by scanning (fig.2C and Supplemental Figure 4B) and transmission (fig.2D and Supplemental Figure 4C) electron microscopy. We hypothesized that lack of CRLF3 impairs preplatelet fission and that a proportion of these circulating "hyper-stable" preplatelets are removed from the peripheral circulation (primarily in the spleen) before they have the chance to mature into platelets. This decreases the number of new platelets produced at by each MK (ineffective thrombopoiesis). We hypothesized that splenectomy would allow the preplatelets to circulate longer, allowing them to undergo fission and correct the platelet count. We measured circulating platelet and preplatelet counts by flow cytometry pre- and post-splenectomy by a published method(fig.2E). Spleen size and weight as well as histology were comparable between Crlf3 -/- and control animals (Supplementary Figure 4E). Control animals showed a slight increase in the platelet count as expected post-splenectomy (fig.2F). The platelet counts in splenectomised Crlf3 -/- animals also increased post-surgery but crucially reached the same level as those seen in the control animals (p = 0.4344) despite being 38% lower prior to splenectomy (p < 0.0001). Preplatelets were more abundant in the Crlf3 -/- animals pre-splenectomy (p = 0.0010; fig.2G). Post-splenectomy, circulating preplatelets increased marginally in control animals, but decreased in Crlf3 -/- animals to levels like those seen in the controls (p = 0.2524; fig.2G). We postulate that splenectomy allows Crlf3 -/- preplatelets to circulate for long enough to mature into platelets (switching from ineffective to effective thrombopoiesis), thereby improving the number of platelets produced per MK. In keeping with this, post-splenectomy, MK numbers in the BM of Crlf3 -/- animals reduced towards levels seen in control animals (fig.2H).

### Hairy cell leukemia, version 2.2018, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1159xtKa]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2017). Medium credibility.

Hairy cell leukemia — response assessment and follow‑up: CR is defined as normalization of blood counts (hemoglobin > 11 g/dL without transfusion, absolute neutrophil count > 1,500/mcL, platelets > 100,000/mcL), absence of HCL cells by morphologic examination of bone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood smear, regression of splenomegaly by physical examination, and absence of disease symptoms; available evidence suggests that achievement of CR is associated with longer duration of remission, and observation until there is an indication for additional treatment is recommended for patients who achieve a CR after initial treatment with purine analog.

### Quantitative peripheral blood perturbations of γ δ T cells in human disease and their clinical implications [^115zDoQz]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Human γδ T cells, which play innate and adaptive, protective as well as destructive, roles in the immune response, were discovered in 1986, but the clinical significance of alterations of the levels of these cells in the peripheral blood in human diseases has not been comprehensively reviewed. Here, we review patterns of easily measurable changes of this subset of T cells in peripheral blood from relevant publications in PubMed and their correlations with specific disease categories, specific diagnoses within disease categories, and prognostic outcomes. These collective data suggest that enumeration of γδ T cells and their subsets in the peripheral blood of patients could be a useful tool to evaluate diagnosis and prognosis in the clinical setting.

### Automatic wedge smears preparation may cause traumatic morphological changes in peripheral blood cells [^114DXZ4Q]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

In recent years, several automated analysers that prepare and stain blood smears have been introduced in clinical laboratories. Despite the use of instrumental settings based on physical characteristic of individual samples, traumatic injuries of neutrophil and lymphocytes can be observed. Some samples present a very high percentage of damaged cells, allowing the speculation that a cellular susceptibility may enhance mechanical traumatism. These artefacts can puzzle morphological evaluation in both traditional and digitised microscopy; in addition, unskilled operators can be misled.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^112edrh8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We present an automated protocol for the detection and characterization of thousands of blood cells in PBS linked with machine-learning methods that can use these cellular descriptions to distinguish between clinical conditions and identify novel associations between cytomorphological phenotypes and clinical diagnoses. Importantly, we show that our approach generalizes to other centers and scanners.

Haemorasis, our open-source method to extract and characterize large numbers of WBC and RBC from digitized PBS, demonstrates how this can be automated with no recourse to proprietary software. We make it publicly available as a Docker container, enabling its straightforward application. Using Haemorasis, we detect and characterize over half a million WBC and millions of RBC. With morphometric moments (the mean and variance of morphometric features for each PBS) we show the diagnostic importance of cytomorphological heterogeneity for various conditions. This observation bears similarity to previous reports that associated RDW with increased AML transformation risk. It is also worth considering that quantifying morphological variation, especially of subtle features, is likely to be challenging to achieve by visual assessment, as it requires the absolute quantification and evaluation of large numbers of cells.

### Normal and pathological erythropoiesis in adults: from gene regulation to targeted treatment concepts [^114stx6B]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

Red cell production, survival and turnover in health and disease, and mechanisms regulating these processes, have attracted the attention of physicians and scientists in the past five decades and many different mechanisms and molecules involved in the regulation of red cell production and survival have been discovered. In addition, a number of molecular and immunological markers and targets have been identified in red cells and their progenitors. Several of these novel antigens may serve as diagnostic markers or as therapeutic targets. Resulting new diagnostic strategies and novel treatment concepts should advance the field and lead to more precise diagnosis, better therapies and improved prognosis in reactive and clonal erythroid disorders.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113UczSx]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 — ATLL diagnostic testing — state that the diagnosis of ATLL requires histopathology and immunophenotyping, peripheral blood smear analysis for atypical cells, flow cytometry on peripheral blood, and HTLV‑1 serology, and in patients without histologically proven tumor lesions the presence of ≥ 5% T lymphocytes with an abnormal immunophenotype in the peripheral blood is required. The immunophenotyping panel for flow cytometry should at minimum include CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD25, CD30, TCRαβ, and TRBC1; the typical immunophenotype in most patients involves mature CD4‑positive T cells with expression of CD2, CD5, CD25, CD45RO, CD29, TCRαβ, and HLA‑DR, while most ATLL cells lack CD7 and CD26 and have a dim CD3 expression, with rare cases that are CD8+ or CD4/CD8 double positive or double negative; TRBC1 expression by flow cytometry has been reported as a highly sensitive method for assessing T‑cell clonality with good correlation with molecular methods.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^113bksJN]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus recommendation generation

Previously coded data were used to develop 4 domains of recommendations, ie, curricular considerations, method of PBS review, morphologic considerations, and specific disorders. Disorders were further subcategorized into disorders of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Response rates per round of revision were 87.5%, 87.5%, and 100%.

Strong and unanimous consensus was reached on multiple aspects of PBS education, including curricular considerations, method of review, and morphology (Table 2). All agreed that trainees should learn PBS review through a structured approach that includes the identification of monolayer, use of various magnifications, switching between magnifications, and systematic review of each cell line. Procurement of PBS slides should encompass both patients under the care of the trainee and slide "libraries" to ensure all trainees see similar morphology regardless of personal experience on ward and consult rotations.

Ideal curricula should include education on how PBS review can augment or eliminate the need for more advanced testing and should include discussions on the practical use of PBS within the context of resource limited vs resource rich settings. Trainees should be aware of the growing use of digital microscopy and understand the benefits and limitations of digital microscopy.

Trainees should be able to name and identify common cytoplasmic and nuclear features that aid in diagnosis. CR on individual disorders of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets can be seen in Table 2. Participants agreed that specific emphasis should be placed on disorders in which correct and timely diagnosis is paramount to avoiding significant patient morbidity, acute decompensation, or death. Acute leukemias and hemolytic anemias, specifically TMA, were felt to warrant explicit curricular emphasis. Conversely, fellows should also be competent in the recognition of commonly encountered diagnoses that are more indolent in nature, eg, iron deficiency anemia. However, consensus was not reached on how to balance education in these competing interests.

Focus group results

Transcribed statements from focus group 1 were coded thematically in an iterative fashion. Individual statements could be coded in several thematic categories if multiple dimensions were identified. Major emerging thematic categories included benefit provided by PBS review, cell lineage, medium used for PBS review, procedure of PBS review, source of slide, specific diagnosis, and specific morphology (Figure 2). Subtopics were developed within each theme.

Figure 2.
Participant statement coding. Statements were categorized and subcategorized following inductive coding. Seven emerging domains of theory are shown. Subdomains are noted where applicable. ∗Further subcategorization can be found in the supplemental Data. The number of further subcategories are noted in parentheses.

Most discussion centered on specific cell lineage (32.8% of the statements), specific diagnosis (39.7% of the statements), and specific morphology (26.0% of the statements). The procedure of PBS review was discussed the least (9.2% of the statements).

Participants reported the majority of their slides for PBS teaching as having originated from clinic or consult service patients currently being seen by the educator or trainee. Some voiced the importance of reviewing PBSs from collated slide libraries to ensure that trainees get a full breadth of exposure. Thorough systematic review was most commonly discussed as the appropriate method for trainee review, whereas some noted abbreviated methods were used in clinical practice by attending hematologists.

White blood cells and red blood cells accounted for the vast majority of cell lineage–based discussion (48.8% and 41.9%, respectively). The most commonly discussed morphologies were schistocytes, spherocytes, blasts, and macro-ovalocytes (supplemental Appendix). Acute leukemia (including acute promyelocytic leukemia), TMA, and hemolytic anemias were the most discussed diagnostic subcategories.

Several benefits of PBS review were stated. First, PBS review is often available at the time of consultation which can improve time to initial diagnosis. The rapid availability to review PBS is specifically important because it pertains to confirming or refuting "can't miss diagnoses" that convey a high likelihood of morbidity or mortality if misdiagnosed. Furthermore, the identification of morphologic characteristics informs Bayesian reasoning and aid in clinical decision making, and in turn, allows for early initiation of therapeutic interventions.

### Distribution and clinical significance of circulating CD8CD28regulatory T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [^115Sa52w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in the peripheral blood of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) may be closely related to the progression of PTB. In this study, the distribution characteristics and clinical importance of CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells in patients with tuberculosis were systematically analyzed, and the role and importance of CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells in influencing the immune response and progression of tuberculosis were discussed, which will provide immunological indices and reference values for the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Methods

Flow cytometry, sputum smears and computed tomography imaging were used to analyze the distribution characteristics of CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells in the peripheral blood of patients with PTB and the correlation between CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells and clinical and immune indices.

Results

The percentages of CD4 + CD25 high and CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells in the peripheral blood of patients with PTB were significantly higher than those in the healthy control (HC) group. Further analysis showed that the percentage of CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells in the Stage II group was significantly higher than that in the HC group. The percentages of CD4 + CD25 high and CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells increased significantly in patients in the Stage II group. The proportion of CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells was directly proportional to the degree of positivity in sputum smears, while CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells did not exhibit this trend.

The correlations between the percentage of CD4 + CD25 high and CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells and the percentage of lymphocyte subsets were examined. The percentage of CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells was negatively correlated with the percentage of CD4 + T cells and positively correlated with the CD8 + T cell percentage in the HC and PTB groups. The percentage of CD4 + CD25 high Treg cells was positively correlated with the percentage of CD4 + T cells only in the PTB group.

Conclusions

This study was the first to show that the proportion of CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells in the peripheral blood of patients with PTB was significantly increased, and the increase in CD8 + CD28 − Treg cells was related to the progression of PTB, which may affect the proportion of immune cell subsets by inhibiting the immune response, resulting in the progression of PTB.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^117UxPoQ]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^1111NnBM]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Haemorasis — computational detection and characterization of blood cells

Our blood cell detection and analysis pipeline — Haemorasis — assesses small, computationally tractable parts of the large PBS scans and consists of the following four steps (Supplementary Methods):
Quality control to detect informativepixel areas on each slide based on DenseNet121. This removes tiles where the concentration of cells was too small (very few/no cells) or too large (high frequency of overlapping cells) or images were blurred (Supplementary Fig. S1). This ensures that the analyzed area corresponds approximately to the monolayer, the recommended area of analysis for hematologists.
Red blood cell detection on tiles using a combination of Canny edge detectionand other simple computer vision operations and filtering of other objects (platelet clumps, groups of RBCs or individual WBCs) with an XGBoost model, using as features the morphometric characteristics described below in point 4. and more extensively in the Supplementary Methods. In essence, we generated a set of candidate RBCs which were then categorized according to their morphometry as illustrated by other methods –.
White blood cell detection and segmentation from tiles was based on U-Net, a popular and robust algorithm for cell segmentation. WBC nuclei were segmented by clustering WBC pixels using k-means clustering (k = 2), assuming that the darker region of the WBC corresponds to the nucleus as shown by others.
Morphometric characterization of RBC and WBC was performed using well-established morphometric features, available in popular bioimage analysis packages –. 53 features were calculated for each WBC (42 for cellular characterization and 11 for nuclear characterization) and 42 features for each RBC (Supplementary Methods).

Cytomorphological prediction of clinical conditions

We assess the predictive performance of Haemorasis with four binary prediction tasks:
Disease detection — identifying the presence of either deficiency anemia or MDS vs. normal blood;
Disease classification — distinguishing between deficiency anemia and MDS;
MDS genetic subtyping: distinguishing between SF3B1 -mutant and SF3B1 -wildtype (SF3B1 -wt) MDS;
Anemia classification — distinguishing between IDA and MA.

### Analysis of perforin expression in peripheral blood and lesions in severe and mild psoriasis [^112mifYR]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Perforin is a membrane-disrupting protein that allows the entry of granzymes into a target cell inducing degradation of target substances in the cytoplasm and nucleus thus leading to programmed cell death or apoptosis. Recent work demonstrated a possible involvement of perforin mediated cytotoxicity in immunopathogenesis of psoriasis.

Objectives

To investigate a difference in systemic (peripheral blood) and local (lesions) expression and distribution of perforin in psoriatic patients with severe and mild disease.

Methods

Flow cytometry was used for simultaneous detection of intracellular (perforin) and cell surface antigens in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The expression of perforin in skin lesions was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.

Results

Significant increase of perforin expression in T lymphocytes, especially cytotoxic CD8+ cells was found in severe psoriasis compared to mild disease (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). There was also an increase of CD56+P+ NK cells (p < 0.05) in severe compared to mild psoriasis. The psoriatic plaque of both, severe and mild disease were abundant with perforin showing no significant difference on local level.

Conclusion

Based on our results we suggest the association between perforin expression and disease severity.

### The miR-144 / hmgn2 regulatory axis orchestrates chromatin organization during erythropoiesis [^1174Am4n]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

miR-144 targets several chromatin factors, including Hmgn2

We hypothesized that the impaired nuclear condensation phenotype of miR-144 Δ/Δ erythrocytes may be driven at least in part by the gain of function of one or more of the miR-144 mRNA targets that are upregulated in the mutant fish. Our previous work demonstrated that miR-144 targets Dicer in erythrocytes, affecting the processing of miR-451 and all canonical miRNAs. The transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood in 2-dpf zebrafish embryos demonstrates that Dicer is among the mRNAs enriched upon loss of miR-144 (Fig. 2A). To test if Dicer stabilization and accompanied dysregulation of miRNA metabolism might contribute to the miR-144 Δ/Δ phenotype, we injected mRNA encoding Dicer in zebrafish embryos at the 1-cell stage (Fig. 2B) and confirmed its expression and functionality (Supplementary Fig. 2A). At 3-dpf, we isolated circulating peripheral blood cells and performed MGG staining on the blood smears. The N:C ratio of the Dicer-injected embryos was not significantly different from the non-injected siblings (Fig. 2B, C). These results suggest that Dicer is not directly involved in the nuclear condensation process, other than via its central role in miR-144 processing.

### Laboratory practice guidelines for detecting and reporting JAK2 and MPL mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^114LCavy]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2013). Medium credibility.

JAK2 and MPL specimen selection — Initial testing is most commonly performed on peripheral blood samples, and total white blood cells from the peripheral blood are the preferred cell population; Ficoll density centrifugation should be avoided because it depletes granulocytes. Granulocyte isolation not necessary because granulocytes comprise approximately 45% to 75% of total white blood cells in normal individuals, granulocyte isolation achieves, on average, only 15% higher JAK2 allele burden compared with whole white blood cells, and a 10-fold to 100-fold increase in assay sensitivity can be achieved by designing a sensitive PCR method.

### Interference with hemoglobin A (1C) determination by the hemoglobin variant shelby [^11195BrJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin variant carrier status was found in a 46-year-old African American man following detection of a falsely elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by ionexchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, VARIANT A1c, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Additional analysis of the hemoglobin variant using the Beta Thal Short program (Bio-Rad) revealed an unknown peak with a retention time of 4.84 minutes and a proportion of 26.3%. No mass shift in alpha-globin or beta-globin proteins was observed by mass spectrometry. DNA sequencing revealed a missense mutation in 1 beta-globin allele corresponding to the hemoglobin Shelby trait. The patient was asymptomatic with a normal hemoglobin value of 13.6 g/dL (136 g/L) but had increased target cells on a peripheral blood smear. An alternative method for HbA1c determination using boronate-affinity HPLC provided a value of 3.9% (0.04; reference range, 4.0%-6.9% [0.04–0.07]), more consistent with the patient's recent blood glucose values in the normal range.

Study participants

In total, 12 academic hematologists were invited to participate in the focus group. Eight participants (3 female and 5 male) were enrolled (Table 1). The mean duration of post fellowship practice was 15.1 years (range, 5–33). The clinical focus of the participants spanned both classical and malignant hematology. All participants routinely worked with fellows. Half of them had previously, or were currently, responsible for teaching PBS interpretation to trainees. Attendance of focus group 1 and 2 was 87.5%. No participant missed > 1 focus group session.

The MLL cohort captures previously described clinical features of MDS and anemia

The MLL cohort was composed of 203 male and 159 female individuals, with mean age 66.1 (362 individuals in total). Individuals with MDS were older than the remaining MLL cohort, with a bias towards males as previously reported — the chance of having MDS in our cohort increased by 12% every year, with males being more than twice as likely to have MDS (p = 8 × 10 −16 and p = 0.00017, respectively, for the binomial regression of MDS diagnosis based on age and sex; Fig. 1a, b; Table 1).

### Predictive significance of absolute lymphocyte count and morphology in adults with a new onset peripheral blood lymphocytosis [^117ViRXT]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Lymphocytosis is commonly encountered in the haematology laboratory. Evaluation of blood films is an important screening tool for differentiating between reactive and malignant processes. The optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphological evaluation of the smear has not been well defined in the literature. Likewise, the significance of lymphocyte morphology has not been well studied and there are no consensus guidelines or follow-up recommendations available. We attempt to evaluate the significance of lymphocyte morphology and to define the best possible cut-off value of absolute lymphocyte count for morphology review.

Methods

71 adult patients with newly detected lymphocytosis of 5.0×10(9)/L or more were categorised to either a reactive process or a lymphoproliferative disorder. We performed statistical analysis and morphology review to compare the difference in age, gender, lymphocyte count and morphological features between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine an optimal lymphocyte number to trigger morphology review.

Results

Lymphoproliferative disorders are associated with advanced age and higher lymphocyte count. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of lymphocyte morphology as a screening test were 0.9, 0.59, 0.60, 0.58 and 0.71, respectively. The optimal cut-off of lymphocyte number for morphology review was found to be close to 7×10(9)/L.

Conclusions

We found a moderate interobserver agreement for the morphological assessment. 'Reactive' morphology was very predictive of a reactive process, but 'malignant' morphology was a poor predictor of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

### Computational analysis of peripheral blood smears detects disease-associated cytomorphologies [^112bK8LL]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It is also important to point out some additional limitations of our method. Firstly, the blood cell detection techniques, ranging from WBC and RBC detection to nuclear segmentation in WBC and morphometric characterization, could be improved. For example, methods using transformers for hierarchical multi-resolution deep-learning architectures can replace the task of using predefined features, which can also bias results, as has been recently shown in histopathology. Our protocol was designed to mimic the typical steps of hematological assessment — detecting relevant regions of the slide/image, identification of individual cells and analyzing their morphology. Other steps were pragmatic: owing to their great numbers, annotating RBCs in order to train a dedicated detection algorithm would be time consuming; for this reason, we opted for a fast and simple, but perhaps less accurate detection protocol. With appropriately annotated data, supervised RBC detection could be further improved with deep-learning models. Lastly, the characterization of blood cells and nuclei using self-supervised or unsupervised deep-learning methods might also help avoid some biases introduced by more predefined sets of features.

Notwithstanding the limitations discussed above, our work provides proof-of-principle that computational cytomorphology can augment the ability of automated blood cell analyses to identify abnormalities suggestive of hematological disease, with minimal additional cost. This can help identify patients needing further and usually more invasive and expensive testing, such as bone marrow aspirates or genomic sequencing. Recent applications of computational cytomorphology on bone marrow smears have demonstrated how it can identify leukocytes, and assist diagnostic predictions – in specialized haemato-oncology. By demonstrating that this can now be extended to blood smears/slides, our work reveals the potential for the large-scale incorporation of automated cytomorphology into routine diagnostic workflows.
