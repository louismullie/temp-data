## Question

What is a tympanic membrane with a perforation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a tympanic membrane with a perforation is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic definition and anatomy. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why perforations matter. Next, I will classify causes and types. After that, I need to quantify functional consequences, especially hearing loss. Then, I should review natural history and healing. Next, I will examine complications and risks. Finally, I will consider diagnostic implications and management principles, making sure I anchor each point to appropriate references and correct myself if I overstate anything.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition. A tympanic membrane perforation is a hole or breach in the eardrum that creates a direct communication between the external auditory canal and the middle ear cavity, which is normally an air-filled, sealed space. This is a structural defect of the pars tensa and/or pars flaccida that violates the integrity of the membrane.

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions. The tympanic membrane functions as a pressure-sensitive diaphragm that transmits sound energy to the ossicular chain; a perforation disrupts this mechanism, reduces the pressure differential across the membrane, and permits contamination of the middle ear, which explains both conductive hearing loss and infection risk. Experimental and clinical data show that closure of a perforation restores middle-ear pressure differences and improves conductive function, though high-frequency recovery may be incomplete after large defects [^e74d8076].

> I need to check the etiologic categories next. Perforations arise from several mechanisms: infectious (acute otitis media with spontaneous rupture, chronic suppurative otitis media), traumatic (direct instrumentation, barotrauma, blast, welding injuries), iatrogenic (myringotomy, tympanostomy tubes, intratympanic injections), and chronic disease–related (cholesteatoma, persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction). Guidelines and large series consistently list these causes, with tympanostomy tubes and retained tubes being a major modern contributor in children [^c133d38c] [^132c8713] [^d502a70c] [^b1d5c4d1].

> Hold on, I should verify how we classify perforations clinically. Size is commonly described as a percentage of total membrane area, with "small" typically less than 25%, "moderate" 25–50%, and "large" greater than 50%, and location is described by quadrant (anterior, posterior, superior, inferior) and whether the umbo or annulus is involved. These descriptors correlate with healing likelihood and hearing impact, and objective measurement outperforms visual estimation for accuracy and reproducibility [^4fad68ea] [^2f39b382] [^fdda26ce].

> Next, I should review the functional consequences, especially hearing. Let me think about the magnitude of conductive loss. Larger perforations cause greater air–bone gaps, with the largest deficits at low frequencies and a characteristic "inverted V" pattern centered around 2 kHz; umbo involvement adds roughly 5–6 dB more loss, and small middle-ear/mastoid air volumes exacerbate the deficit. Multiple prospective cohorts and modeling studies converge on these findings, and closure of the perforation generally normalizes the air–bone gap except at very high frequencies in large defects [^af7d6125] [^4fad68ea] [^2c6478ef] [^e74d8076].

> I should confirm the natural history and healing dynamics. Many traumatic perforations heal spontaneously within weeks to months, and pediatric perforations have high closure rates with watchful waiting. A large pediatric cohort showed 90% closure by 2.5 years in children under 7 years and 75% in those 7–12 years, supporting a conservative approach when no cholesteatoma or persistent infection is present. Adults and chronic perforations heal less reliably, and persistent defects may require intervention [^ad0e9a4d] [^bf9ee897].

> But wait, what about complications if healing fails or disease persists. I need to ensure I capture the major risks: chronic suppurative otitis media with otorrhea and mucosal disease, cholesteatoma from squamous epithelium ingrowth, ossicular erosion or discontinuity, and sensorineural hearing loss from chronic infection or toxin exposure. These sequelae are well described in contemporary reviews and guidelines, and they underpin the rationale for timely closure in selected cases [^27ac58e8].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications so I don't miss practical points. A nonintact tympanic membrane modifies management of external ear disease: avoid ototoxic topical agents (e.g., aminoglycosides, low pH/acidifying drops) and prefer non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone drops when treating otitis externa or tube otorrhea. Tympanometry can help distinguish effusion from perforation or a patent tube by revealing a high equivalent ear canal volume, and pneumatic otoscopy or fogging can suggest a perforation when visualization is limited. These precautions reduce the risk of inner ear injury and guide safe topical therapy [^e999f581] [^7cd32554] [^725467ee] [^9af8857a].

> Let me consider management principles briefly, even though the question is definitional. Conservative care is appropriate for many traumatic or small perforations, with water precautions and observation. Persistent or large perforations, those with chronic otorrhea, or those associated with cholesteatoma warrant surgical closure, with myringoplasty or tympanoplasty achieving roughly 80–90% success depending on size, technique, and patient factors. Emerging adjuncts like basic fibroblast growth factor can accelerate closure in select cases, though hearing gains are inconsistent and evidence quality varies. I should double-check that I'm not overstating hearing benefits from bFGF; indeed, meta-analyses show improved closure and faster healing without consistent audiometric improvement, so counseling should be cautious [^c133d38c] [^4ba32acf] [^e683b6e8] [^88de732d].

> In summary, I need to ensure the definition is precise: a tympanic membrane perforation is a full-thickness defect of the eardrum that breaches the barrier between the external canal and middle ear, producing conductive hearing loss, infection risk, and potential for chronic middle ear disease. It is classified by cause, size, and location, has predictable acoustic effects proportional to size, often heals spontaneously especially in children, but can lead to significant complications if persistent, which is why diagnosis and management must account for its integrity and context [^92f4b0e3] [^af7d6125] [^ad0e9a4d] [^e999f581].

---

A tympanic membrane perforation is a **hole in the eardrum** that creates a direct connection between the external ear canal and the middle ear [^92f4b0e3]. It can result from infection, trauma, or medical procedures, and is most often associated with **conductive hearing loss** that worsens with larger defects [^af7d6125] [^4fad68ea]. Many small perforations heal spontaneously, but persistent or large defects may require surgical repair [^ad0e9a4d] [^c133d38c]. Management includes keeping the ear dry, avoiding trauma, and using non-ototoxic topical antibiotics if infection is present [^e999f581]; surgery is considered for perforations that fail to heal or cause significant hearing loss [^c133d38c].

---

## Anatomy and function of the tympanic membrane

The tympanic membrane is a thin, cone-shaped membrane that separates the external ear canal from the middle ear. It consists of three layers: an outer epithelial layer, a middle fibrous layer, and an inner mucosal layer. The membrane **vibrates in response to sound waves**, transmitting these vibrations to the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes) and then to the inner ear, enabling hearing [^e74d8076].

---

## Causes of tympanic membrane perforation

Tympanic membrane perforations can result from **various causes**, including:

- **Infections**: Acute otitis media (middle ear infection) is the most common cause, particularly in children [^notfound]. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) can also cause persistent perforations [^92f4b0e3].

- **Trauma**: Direct injury from objects inserted into the ear canal, head trauma, barotrauma (pressure changes), or acoustic trauma (loud noises) can cause perforations [^132c8713].

- **Iatrogenic causes**: Medical procedures such as tympanostomy tube placement, myringotomy, or intratympanic injections can inadvertently cause perforations [^c133d38c] [^b1d5c4d1].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with tympanic membrane perforation may present with the following **symptoms**:

- **Hearing loss**: Typically conductive, varying with the size and location of the perforation [^af7d6125] [^4fad68ea].

- **Ear pain**: Often associated with acute infections or trauma.

- **Otorrhea**: Ear discharge, particularly in chronic perforations or infections [^92f4b0e3].

- **Tinnitus**: Ringing or buzzing sensation in the ear.

- **Vertigo**: Occasionally reported, especially with larger perforations or trauma.

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of tympanic membrane perforation involves **clinical examination** and **objective testing**:

- **Otoscopy**: Direct visualization of the perforation, including size, location, and presence of discharge or infection [^2f39b382].

- **Tympanometry**: Assesses middle ear function and can help differentiate perforations from other middle ear conditions [^725467ee].

- **Audiometry**: Evaluates the degree of hearing loss, typically conductive in nature [^af7d6125].

---

## Natural history and healing

Many tympanic membrane perforations, particularly small traumatic ones, **heal spontaneously** within weeks to months [^bf9ee897]. The healing process involves epithelial migration, fibroblast proliferation, and remodeling of the fibrous layer. However, larger or chronic perforations may persist, requiring surgical intervention [^c133d38c].

---

## Complications

Persistent tympanic membrane perforations can lead to **several complications**, including:

- **Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)**: Persistent infection with chronic ear discharge and potential hearing loss [^92f4b0e3].

- **Cholesteatoma**: Abnormal growth of keratinizing epithelium into the middle ear, potentially causing bone erosion and serious complications [^27ac58e8].

- **Hearing loss**: Conductive hearing loss is common, with severity correlating to perforation size and location [^af7d6125] [^4fad68ea].

- **Tympanosclerosis**: Hardening of the tympanic membrane, potentially affecting mobility and hearing [^d3a4f64e].

---

## Management strategies

Management of tympanic membrane perforation depends on the **cause, size, and chronicity** of the perforation:

- **Conservative management**: Observation, keeping the ear dry, and avoiding trauma. Non-ototoxic topical antibiotics may be used if infection is present [^e999f581].

- **Surgical intervention**: Myringoplasty or tympanoplasty is considered for persistent perforations, large defects, or significant hearing loss. Success rates are generally high, particularly in smaller perforations [^4ba32acf] [^c133d38c].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been explored to enhance healing, although evidence for significant hearing improvement is limited [^e683b6e8] [^88de732d].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis for tympanic membrane perforation is **generally favorable**. Small perforations often heal spontaneously, while surgical repair is highly successful for persistent defects. However, chronic perforations associated with ongoing infection or Eustachian tube dysfunction may have a higher risk of recurrence and complications [^c133d38c] [^92f4b0e3].

---

A tympanic membrane perforation is a hole in the eardrum that can cause hearing loss and infection; many heal on their own, but persistent or large defects may need surgery. Management focuses on **infection control**, **water avoidance**, and **timely surgical repair** when indicated [^c133d38c].

### Achieving a successful closure of an anterior tympanic membrane perforation: evidence-based systematic review [^2fbf9b05]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives Surgical repair of a tympanic membrane perforation is a common otologic procedure. However, achieving a successful closure can be challenging, especially if the anterior margin of the tympanic membrane is involved. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on evidence published in closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations. Data Sources The following data sources were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1997 to August, 3 2017), MEDLINE (February 1948 to August 3, 2017), and Embase (1975 to August 3, 2017). Data Extraction Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed. For the purpose of this study, the inclusion criteria were as follows; (1) studies reporting surgical technique for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations, (2) primary cases only, (3) articles published in the English language, (4) minimum 6-month follow-up, and (5) recorded pre- and postoperative audiometry. The exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, revision surgery, and no audiometric outcomes. Results On initial search, a total of 181 articles were identified (PubMed, n = 136; Cochrane, n = 28; Embase, n = 17). Based on the criteria, 136 articles were excluded. Full text of 45 articles was reviewed, and a further 24 articles were excluded. A total of 21 articles fulfilled the criteria for study inclusion. Conclusions All published evidence is level 4. High-quality controlled studies are required to determine the most effective method for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforation.

### Prevalence of tympanic membrane perforations among adolescents, adults, and older adults in the United States [^19a792a9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) perforations can occur at any age, but limited population-level data are available. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and population estimates for TM perforations among individuals ≥ 12 years old in the United States. Overall, TM perforations have a prevalence of 2.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-2.6%), corresponding to 5.8 million Americans. Across the life course, older adults have the highest prevalence of TM perforations at 6.1% (95% CI, 4.7%-7.6%), corresponding to nearly 3 million Americans, as opposed to a prevalence of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3%-0.9%) in adolescents, which equates to 0.2 million Americans. Males and females have a similar prevalence at 2.3% (95% CI, 1.6%-3.0%) among males and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4%-2.6%) among females. These prevalence and population estimates provide the first US-based population estimates of the burden of TM perforations over the life course.

### Determinants of hearing loss in perforations of the tympanic membrane [^af7d6125]. Otology & Neurotology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Although tympanic membrane perforations are common, there have been few systematic studies of the structural features determining the magnitude of the resulting conductive hearing loss. Our recent experimental and modeling studies predicted that the conductive hearing loss will increase with increasing perforation size, be independent of perforation location (contrary to popular otologic belief), and increase with decreasing size of the middle-ear and mastoid air space (an idea new to otology).

Objective

To test our predictions regarding determinants of conductive hearing loss in tympanic membrane perforations against clinical data gathered from patients.

Study Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Inclusion Criteria

Patients with tympanic membrane perforations without other middle-ear disease.

Main Outcome Measures

Size and location of perforation; air-bone gap at 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz; and tympanometric estimate of volume of the middle-ear air spaces.

Results

Isolated tympanic membrane perforations in 62 ears from 56 patients met inclusion criteria. Air-bone gaps were largest at the lower frequencies and decreased as frequency increased. Air-bone gaps increased with perforation size at each frequency. Ears with small middle-ear volumes, ≤ 4.3 mL (n = 23), had significantly larger air-bone gaps than ears with large middle-ear volumes, > 4.3 mL (n = 39), except at 2,000 Hz. The mean air-bone gaps in ears with small volumes were 10 to 20 dB larger than in ears with large volumes. Perforations in anterior versus posterior quadrants showed no significant differences in air-bone gaps at any frequency, although anterior perforations had, on average, air-bone gaps that were smaller by 1 to 8 dB at lower frequencies.

Conclusion

The conductive hearing loss resulting from a tympanic membrane perforation is frequency-dependent, with the largest losses occurring at the lowest sound frequencies; increases as size of the perforation increases; varies inversely with volume of the middle-ear and mastoid air space (losses are larger in ears with small volumes); and does not vary appreciably with location of the perforation. Effects of location, if any, are small.

### Retained tympanostomy tubes: who, what, when, why, and how to treat? [^2118e781]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Tympanostomy tube placement is one of the most common surgical procedures performed across the globe. Controversies exist regarding what to do when a tube is considered to be retained in the tympanic membrane for too long.

Materials and Methods

Review of the PubMed medical literature starting in 1990, focusing on English language studies reporting on the definition, complications, and management of retained tympanostomy tubes.

Results

The medical literature reporting on outcomes regarding retained tympanostomy tubes is relatively sparse. Most studies recommend prophylactic removal of tubes after a defined period of time, usually around 2 to 3 years after placement. A preferred method of myringoplasty after tympanostomy tube retrieval has not been established, but most studies recommend grafting the perforation at the time of tube removal.

Conclusions

Although a consensus as to the optimal management of retained tympanostomy tubes is not yet established in the medical literature, a preponderance of studies recommend prophylactic removal at defined period of time (> 2–3 years) before the onset of complications such as otorrhea and granulation tissue formation. Due to a lack of best evidence, the surgeon's preference remains the guiding principle as to the best technique for myringoplasty at the time of removal.

### Natural history of pediatric tympanic membrane perforation [^ad0e9a4d]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the natural history of pediatric tympanic membrane perforation using an existing clinical database, with the aim of defining the time beyond which a perforation is unlikely to close naturally.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary center.

Patients and Interventions

A database of pediatric ear, nose, throat, and audiology consultations containing 20 years of data was analyzed. A total of 2865 episodes of perforation were followed, with all cases of surgical reconstruction excluded. Cases of perforation after ventilation tube extrusion were tagged. Statistical techniques including survival analysis were used.

Main Outcome Measures

Time from diagnosis of perforation to diagnosis of closure, in years.

Results

There was a predominance of perforations in boys (59.1% versus 40.9%). Time to closure increased by 7% for each 1-year increase in age at diagnosis. Time-to-closure curves for children older than 12 years diverged considerably from those for younger children after approximately 18 months. Centiles of time to closure were calculated for each 1-year age band. After 2.5 years of follow-up, rates of closure were 90% in children diagnosed younger than 7 years and 75% in children diagnosed between the age of 7 and 12 years. No significant difference was found in time to closure between boys and girls, left-sided and right-sided perforations, or in ventilation tube-related perforations and others. Comparison of membranes suffering a first perforation with those suffering a second perforation suggested a borderline significant time-to-closure disadvantage for first perforations.

Conclusion

When faced with the clinical question of what period of watchful waiting would be appropriate in monitoring a perforated tympanic membrane, before intervention may reasonably be recommended; there seems to be little advantage in waiting longer than 2.5 years.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^38ce79e0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### What effect does smoking have on the surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforations? A review [^6b211c78]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The link between cigarette smoking and outcome following surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforation is unclear. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the link between smoking and success rate following surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations.

Materials and Methods

Systematic review performed using the following data sources: 1) Cochrane central register of controlled trials (1997 to April 30, 2018), 2) Medline (February 1948 to April 30, 2018), and 3) Embase (1975 to April 30, 2018). Inclusion criteria for this study was: 1) studies reporting surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforations in smokers, 2)primary and revision cases, 3) English language literature, 4) minimum follow-up period of 6 months, and 5) pre and postoperative audiogram. The exclusion criteria were: 1) no identifiable data on smokers in reported outcomes, 2) less than 6 months follow-up, 3) no audiometric outcomes, and 4) non-English language articles.

Results

A total of 75 studies were identified on initial search and 8 were eligible for the study. All studies were of level 4 evidence. In these eight studies, overall surgical closure of tympanic membrane perforation was successful in 512/577 (88.7%) of nonsmokers and 151/197 (76.6%) in smokers. This difference was statistically significant.

Conclusions

Smokers may have a lower success rate compared against nonsmokers for surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations. Our review has limitations and more prospective high-quality controlled trials are required to further study this association.

### Otomycosis with tympanic membrane perforation: a review of the literature [^986cac2f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of the present study was to assess the rate of tympanic membrane perforation in patients with otomycosis and to discuss the literature regarding the difficulties in managing this condition.

Data Sources

Literature review from 1999 to 2019, Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline.

Study Selection

We searched for eligible articles concerning the clinical entity of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis. Case series and clinical trials were the types of articles included for this review.

Data Extraction

All the articles described in the study selection were used for this review.

Data Synthesis

Statistical techniques were not used.

Conclusion

Based on the available literature, it seems that tympanic membrane perforation secondary to otomycosis is not uncommon. The presence of this complication is associated with 2 problems: Antimycotic solutions are irritant to middle ear and may be ototoxic to the cochlea. Although most cases of fungus caused tympanic membrane (TM) perforation resolve with proper medical treatment, in a few patients a tympanoplasty may be required.

### Endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty for anterior TM perforation… [^967cc63d]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty should be considered for repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane. Importance Repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane has been challenging for otolaryngologists. Therefore, devising a simple and effective technique for performing the repair is crucial. Objective To assess the results of endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty for repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane. Tympanoplasty for closing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane is considered challenging. The reasons for poor surgical outcomes include a reduced vascular supply, limited anterior margin, poor visualization, and inadequate graft stabilization. 4–6 Overlay tympanoplasty has a high success rate in treating anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane, but it is surgically difficult.

2, 3 The modifications of underlay tympanoplasty for repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane include mediolateral graft, window-shade, anterior transcanal, loop overlay, and hammock techniques. 5–9 Although effective, these techniques require advanced surgical skills, postauricular incision, and general anesthesia. Few studies have described endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty for repair of anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane. 23 The present study aimed to evaluate the rate of graft success, hearing outcomes, and prognostic factors for endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty in repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane. Anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane could not be closed postoperatively in 4 patients; 2 of them had smaller residual perforations. The remaining 2 patients underwent later revision procedures that repaired the previous perforations.

One patient had postoperative hemorrhage because of a postauricular incision; however, the bleeding stopped after direct compression. Furthermore, 6 patients developed postoperative otorrhea, which resolved after they received otic and oral antibiotic treatments. No patients reported sensorineural hearing loss. Our study revealed that wider endoscopic visualization can neglect the factor of partial visualization of the perforation margin through otoscopy, which increases the rate of graft success in anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane. Therefore, the rate of graft success and hearing results are comparable with those of microscopic myringoplasty for repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane. However, our technique is simpler because postauricular incision, canalplasty, and general anesthesia are not required. Thus, endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty should be considered for repairing anterior perforations of the tympanic membrane.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^c133d38c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — long-term tympanic membrane changes and subsequent surgery risk are described as follows: tubes produce visible tympanic membrane changes and may cause a small or trivial decrease in long-term hearing levels that do not appear to be clinically significant or require intervention in most patients; persistent perforation is the sequela most likely to require intervention, with 80%-90% success rates for surgical closure with a single outpatient procedure; treatment with tubes was associated with a 9.5-times greater risk of subsequent tympanoplasty versus middle ear disease not treated with tubes and a > 200-times greater risk versus no ear disease.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e4e398c3]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We followed the population, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICO) format. Our study question was: for people with TM perforations, can the use of bFGF improve both the healing rate and time, and hearing outcomes? Our review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Fig. 1).

FIG. 1
Flow diagram of the search process and search outcomes.

Search Strategy and Study Selection

Two authors (J.H. and B.M.T.) independently searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from establishment to June 2019. Abstracts were identified by the following search terms: 1) tympanic membrane(s); membrane(s), tympanic; eardrum(s) or 2) tympanic membrane perforation; membrane perforation, tympanic; eardrum perforation; perforation, eardrum; tympanic membrane rupture; membrane rupture, tympanic; rupture, tympanic membrane, and 3) fibroblast growth factor 2; basic fibroblast growth factor; class II heparin-binding growth factor; heparin-binding growth factor class II; HBGF-2; prostatropin; FGF-2; fibroblast growth factor, basic; fibroblast growth factor-2; cartilage-derived growth factor; cartilage derived growth factor; prostate epithelial cell growth factor. The original articles were all from peer-reviewed scientific journals published in English. The database search yielded 169 studies, of which 91 studies met the requirements after duplicates were removed.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^70daea51]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — initial use of long-term tubes: The clinician should not place long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube. Recommendation against based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B with Level of confidence in evidence High, Exceptions None, and Policy level Recommendation. Benefits include avoiding unnecessary adverse events more common with long-term tubes (higher incidence of otorrhea, granulation tissue, tympanic membrane perforation), reducing long-term follow-up, and reducing risk of a retained tube beyond the necessary period of ventilation. Risks and costs for initial management are none, but there is some potential for repeat tubes that might have been avoided with a long-term tube and risk of missing or delayed diagnosis of OME after short-term tube extrusion. Differences of opinion note that 4 of 16 panel members (25%) felt the statement could unintentionally increase use of long-term tubes because of intentional vagueness in determining a need for ventilation beyond the duration of a short-term tube.

### Functional correlations of tympanic membrane perforation size [^4fad68ea]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The correlation between tympanic membrane perforations and hearing loss was studied.

Study Design

Prospective data from 220 patients, who underwent primary surgery for simple chronic otitis media with a perforated eardrum, were analyzed.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

One hundred fifty-one patients with 155 eardrum perforations, which were checked for correct diagnosis, normal middle-ear status, and integrity of the ossicular chain, were included.

Interventions

All patients underwent primary myringoplasty.

Main Outcome Measures

Preoperative conductive hearing loss due to eardrum perforations.

Results

Hearing loss shows a linear relationship with increasing eardrum perforation size. Umbo involvement shows a worsening of the hearing by 5 to 6 dB (p < 0.0001). The least impact of a perforation is seen at the resonance frequency of 2 kHz. Above and below 2 kHz, an 'inverted V shape' of the air-bone gap is a consistent finding. If the air-bone gap exceeds the 'inverted V-shape' pattern, additional pathology behind the eardrum must be assumed and addressed.

Conclusion

We propose using standardized photographs or drawings to document preoperative perforation sizes. A linear relationship between the size of a perforation and the conductive hearing loss does exist. Umbo involvement at the perforation margin may worsen the hearing by 5 to 6 dB, whereas the position of the perforation itself does not play a role. The least impact of a perforation is seen at the resonance frequency of 2 kHz. An "inverted V-shape" pattern, above and below 2 kHz, of the air-bone gap is a consistent finding. If the air-bone gap exceeds this pattern, additional pathology behind the eardrum perforation must be assumed and addressed.

### Traumatic tympanic membrane perforations diagnosed in emergency departments [^132c8713]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) are frequent events leading to evaluation in the primary care and otolaryngology offices or the emergency department (ED). Despite specific warning labels on packaging of cotton-tipped applicators regarding the risk of injury to the ear canal with personal use, these products are commonly used to remove ear cerumen.

Objective

To analyze the mechanism of injury for traumatic TMPs among patients presenting to the ED.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional analysis of cases from 100 emergency departments in the United States. The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was searched on April 3, 2015, for ear-related injuries with analysis information regarding patient age, patient sex, time and date of injury, specific injury diagnoses, and specific injury mechanisms that occurred across 5 years, from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Diagnoses of traumatic TMP documented in the ED visit record as well as patient demographics, diagnoses, and other aspects of the injury, including mechanism of injury.

Results

There were 949 case entries in the database for traumatic TMP, which extrapolates to 4852 ED visits nationally. Of 949 patients evaluated, 568 (59.8%) were men and 381 (40.2%) were women resulting in a male to female ratio of 1.49:1. Most injuries occurred in patients 18 years or younger (602 of 949 [63.4%]) with children younger than 6 years most at risk (331 of 949 [34.9%]). Ear canal instrumentation including foreign bodies was noted in 581 of 949 cases (61.2%), with cotton-tipped applicators noted in 261 (44.9%) of these cases. While foreign body instrumentation represented the leading cause of traumatic TMP in patients aged 0 to 5 years (284 of 331 cases [85.8%]), 6 to 12 years (108 of 158 [68.4%]), 19 to 36 years (85 of 223 [38.1%]), 37 to 54 years (48 of 91 [52.7%]), and 55 years or older (22 of 33 [66.7%]), water trauma was the leading cause of TMP in patients aged 13 to 18 years (43 of 113 cases [38.1%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Traumatic TMP represents a common reason for evaluation in the ED. Despite common warnings regarding risk of injury to the tympanic membrane with use of a cotton-tipped applicator, it is still a major cause of traumatic TMPs. Other injury mechanisms also play an important role in the teenage and young adult populations.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^ea8949f5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — tympanometry after pneumatic otoscopy is directed as follows: Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; this is a Strong recommendation based on extrapolation of systematic reviews of diagnostic studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is stated as Grade B with extrapolation from cross-sectional studies using a consistent reference standard for tympanometry as a primary diagnostic method, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for primary diagnosis and medium for use as an adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy. Benefits include improved diagnostic accuracy, confirmation of suspected OME, objective information regarding middle ear status, differentiation of OME versus tympanic membrane perforation by ear canal volume, and prognostic information, whereas risks, harms, and costs include cost, lack of access, equipment calibration and maintenance, and misinterpretation of findings; the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit.

### A review on the use of hyaluronic acid in tympanic membrane wound healing [^533895e3]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tympanic membrane perforation represents a significant morbidity, especially if it occurs during a child's speech and language development. Recently, there has been an increased interest in hyaluronic-acid-related research and products as a potential therapeutic option for tympanic membrane perforation repair.

Areas Covered

This review describes the physical and chemical properties of hyaluronic acid and examines the role of hyaluronic acid in wound healing, in particular on the tympanic membrane. It also reviews the safety and efficacy of hyaluronic acid and its derivatives in animal studies as well as in clinical trials. Finally, it considers the potential future clinical applications in tympanic membrane perforation repair.

Expert Opinion

Hyaluronic acid has been found to accelerate tympanic membrane perforation closure, shorten the period of healing, produce a better quality neo-membrane and improve hearing. More importantly, hyaluronic acid is biodegradable, safe and biocompatible in the ear. Recently, there has been a trend towards the use of modified hyaluronic acid. However, there is a lack of higher-level evidence to support the use of hyaluronic acid in tympanic membrane perforations in the clinical setting. More large-scale randomised control trials are warranted before these bio-devices will be used routinely.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^e999f581]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) with suspected or confirmed tympanic membrane perforation — topical agent selection and ototoxicity cautions are specified as follows: If the tympanic membrane is known or suspected to be nonintact, topical drops that contain alcohol, have a low pH (most acidifying/antiseptic agents), or both should be avoided because of pain and potential ototoxicity, and substances with ototoxic potential (eg, aminoglycosides, alcohol) should not be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated and the middle ear space is open, because the risk of ototoxic injury outweighs the benefits compared with non-ototoxic antimicrobials with equal efficacy; the only topical antimicrobials approved by the FDA (December 2005) for middle ear use are quinolone drops; warnings for neomycin-containing products note that neomycin can induce permanent sensorineural hearing loss, therapy should be limited to 10 consecutive days, and CORTISPORIN Otic Suspension should not be used in any patient with a perforated tympanic membrane; identification of persistent patency is aided by the facts that children with tubes inserted more than 1 year ago should also have the tympanic membrane carefully assessed, since in some cases the tube may remain functional for 3 years or longer, and individuals who taste substances placed into their ear or who can expel air out of their ear canal by pinched nose blowing can be assumed to have a perforation.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e0620539]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) perforation is commonly encountered in the clinical setting. It can be iatrogenic, or caused by trauma or infections. In the United States, it is estimated that 1 to 3% of the population will have a TM perforation some time in their life. In specific groups (e.g. Indigenous Australians), the prevalence reported has been as high as 28 to 43%. Some perforations may lead to chronic otorrhea and hearing loss, and limit water sports, which may significantly reduce the quality of life. Moreover, chronic TM perforations, if left untreated, serve as a conduit for further infections, acquired cholesteatoma, facial nerve palsy, labyrinthitis, and subperiosteal abscess. Although traumatic TM perforations tend to heal spontaneously, large or chronic perforations may fail to heal and require surgical interventions. In addition, the long-term spontaneous healing rate can sometimes be unsatisfactory. Kristensen reported that healing rate for spontaneous perforations to be 78.7%, which appears to vary depending on the cause of perforation. To repair TM perforations, patients may suffer from complications from conventional surgery. Hence, it is crucial to explore options that may improve the efficacy of repair.

With the advancement in the field of tissue engineering, various bioscaffolds and bioactive molecules have been applied with encouraging results. Among them, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is one of the most commonly used bioactive molecules. Until recently, a majority of the studies were in animal models. However, in the recent years, we have witnessed a surge in the use of bFGF in human trials (,–). Although a majority of trials reported promising benefits, the perforation closure rates varied across the different studies, and there does not appear to be a consensus for hearing benefits. Recently, a literature review supported the role of bFGF in the repair of TM perforation, but to the best of our knowledge, no quantitative analysis has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of bFGF.

Thus, the aim of this comprehensive meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of bFGF for the repair of TM perforations both in healing and hearing by evaluating the current best evidence.

### Chronic suppurative otitis… [^cc110cee]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best treatment for otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation. Evidence-Based Answer. Acute otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation in children should be treated with an oral antibiotic. Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is better than oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for treating acute otitis media in children with tympanostomy tubes. Evidence Summary There are three different types of otitis media associated with a perforation of the tympanic membrane: acute otitis media complicated by perforation of the tympanic membrane, presenting as otorrhea; acute otitis media in a patient with tympanostomy tubes; and chronic suppurative otitis media, defined as tympanic membrane perforation with chronic inflammation of the middle ear and persistent otorrhea for two weeks to three months.

1.

ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA WITH PERFORATION A meta-analysis of six RCTs of children six months to 12 years of age with acute otitis media examined the effectiveness of amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid versus placebo or delayed treatment in reducing pain, fever, or both at three to seven days. ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA WITH TYMPANOSTOMY TUBES An industry-sponsored, single-blind RCT of 80 children six months to 12 years of age with tympanostomy tubes and acute otitis media compared ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid oral suspension. The children treated with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone had a median time to cessation of otorrhea of four days compared with seven days for those treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.

Recommendations from Others A 2004 joint practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians includes otorrhea as a verification of middle ear effusion in its diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media. The recommendation to treat most children who require antibiotics with amoxicillin does not differentiate between patients with and those without tympanic membrane perforation.

### Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane: a review of 80 cases [^bf9ee897]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TPTM) is often encountered in primary care or in the emergency department (ED). Several therapeutic interventions have been described, but conservative follow-up until spontaneous complete recovery is the most common choice.

Objective

Our goal was to analyze the trauma mechanism, perforation characteristics, and outcome of patients with TPTM.

Methods

The study included patients examined in the ED of a tertiary, university-affiliated medical center because of TPTM between 2012 and 2016. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, trauma mechanism, clinical characteristics, and outcome. A phone survey was performed to obtain the missing information of all the patients who did not continue their follow-up in our outpatient clinic.

Results

We reviewed the histories of 80 patients with a mean age of 26.7 ± 14.6 years (20 children; 25%). TPTM was caused by blunt trauma in 45 patients (56%) and penetrating trauma in 35 patients (44%). Thirty-five patients (44%) completed their follow-up in the hospital outpatient clinic, with a mean duration of 6.2 weeks. Twenty-five patients (38%) completed their follow-up in a community-based otolaryngology clinic, 6 patients (9%) chose not to complete their follow-up, and 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 60 patients who completed follow-up, 56 patients recovered spontaneously, 3 patients underwent successful tympanoplasty, and 1 patient was referred to surgery but was lost to follow-up. All children healed spontaneously.

Conclusion

TPTM was more common in young males with main mechanisms of blunt trauma (an assault) or cleaning the ear canal. All children demonstrated complete spontaneous recovery.

Statement 2 — modifying factors in diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE): Clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy). Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk. The action statement profile characterizes the aggregate evidence quality as Grade C, observational studies, the level of confidence in evidence as High, the benefits-harms assessment as a Preponderance of benefits over harm, and the policy level as Recommendation. Key clinical history components that can modify management include diabetes, HIV infection or other immunocompromised states, history of radiotherapy, and presence of tympanostomy tubes or a perforated tympanic membrane (nonintact tympanic membrane).

### Otoscope fogging: examination finding for perforated tympanic membrane [^9af8857a]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The author reports a recently recognised physical examination finding, otoscope fogging, for perforated tympanic membrane. Otoscope fogging is defined as condensation forming in the view field of the otoscope while inspecting the ear. In the setting of occult perforation secondary to the inability to visualise the entire tympanic membrane, otoscope fogging may provide the clinician with valuable information since medical management may differ if perforation is present.

### Relationship between tympanic membrane perforations and retained ventilation tubes… [^8a56cbd8]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

These range from acute complications, such as otorrhea and early tube extrusion, to late sequelae, including tympanic membrane atrophy, tympanosclerosis, cholesteatoma, and persistent perforation. 2The management of perforations was described in the literature even before the advent of ventilation tubes. In 1947, Dunlap and Schuknecht3used cautery of the perforation edges, followed by the daily instillation of urea to improve healing. The rate of tympanic membrane perforation in spontaneously extruded tubes ranges from less than 1% to 4%. 2, 5, 6When tubes are removed surgically, the resultant perforation rate increases significantly. 7, 8 Because of this increase, concomitant patching has been advocated at the time of tube removal. The decision to remove a retained tube in these patients has fallen to the judgment of the individual clinician.

The goal of this study was 2-fold: to define the effects of prolonged tube retention on subsequent tympanic membrane healing and to determine the efficacy of patching in reducing the perforation rate when ventilation tubes are removed. The tube retention time differed between the 2 groups, with an average of 2. 5 years in the healed group and
3. 9 years in the perforated group. The overall perforation rate was 28%: 30% in the patch group and 26% in the no-patch group. For children with a history of less than 3 sets of tubes, the perforation rate was 24% vs 42% in those with 3 or more sets. Those patients with no history of adenoidectomy had a perforation rate of 17%, while those with a previous adenoidectomy had a perforation rate of 47%. There were no differences in healing with regard to age, sex, or the presence of concomitant medical problems. Only 2 patients with healed tympanic membranes required ventilation tube replacement.

Our initial results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in perforation rate in children whose tubes remained in place beyond 24 months. Also significant was the influence of adenoidectomy on healing. Patients with a history of adenoidectomy had a much higher perforation rate than those with no such history. One possible explanation is that patients who require adenoidectomy have inherently worse eustachian tube function or middle ear disease, leading to a poor outcome after tube removal.

### Epidemiology of persistent tympanic membrane perforations subsequent to tympanostomy tubes assessed with real world data [^31d3202e]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the incidence of persistent tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) after tympanostomy tube (TT) surgery using a large population-based cohort.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Medicaid claims data from 1999 to 2006.

Patients

We studied healthy children who had Medicaid eligibility within 6 months of birth that received TTs and had 2 to 7 years of follow-up.

Main Outcome Measures

We operationalized persistent TMP by a charge for tympanoplasty and/or one or more diagnoses of TMP.

Results

We identified 47,724 children who received TTs and had ≥ 2 years eligibility. The incidence of persistent TMP varied, based on definition and follow-up. The 2 and 7-year TMP rates were: 0.38% and 3.81% for two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart or tympanoplasty; 0.26% and 2.94% for two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart; 0.13% and 1.73% for tympanoplasty, alone; 0.04% and 1.21% for tympanoplasty preceded by one TMP diagnosis; and 0.01% and 0.52% for tympanoplasty and two TMP diagnoses 6 months apart. Reinserting TTs was associated with an increased likelihood of persistent TMP (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.98, 95% CI 1.49–2.63). Each year increase in age was associated with 49% increase in the risk of persistent TMP.

Conclusion

Billing claims data may be used to assess the rate of persistent TMP after TT placement in large populations, yielding results consistent with findings from cohort studies and meta-analyses. Our findings may serve as the basis for future TMP research using real world datasets.

### How does closure of tympanic membrane perforations affect hearing and middle ear mechanics? An evaluation in a patient cohort and temporal bone models [^e74d8076]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine how tympanic membrane (TM) perforations and their closure, using a paper-patch technique, affect middle-ear mechanics and, thus, conductive hearing for different sizes of the TM perforation.

Study Design

Temporal bone (TB) study and prospective clinical trial.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Nine patients with chronic otitis media for more than 3 months.

Intervention

The TM perforations were closed with a paper patch in all 9 patients. In 5 of 9 patients, myringoplasty was performed. Matching TM perforations were created in a TB model (n = 8) and closed using the paper patch.

Main Outcome Measures

Air-bone gap was measured in all 9 patients of the patient cohort with TM perforations before and after closure and in 5 patients after myringoplasty. Stapes velocity and sound pressure difference between the ear canal and middle-ear cavity were measured in TBs with intact TM, with TM perforations, and with the perforations closed by the paper patch. All measurements in the patient cohort and TBs were performed for different sizes of TM perforations to determine if the effects varied as a function of size.

Results

Degree of the air-bone gap differed as a function of size of the TM perforations and its recovery after closure, and myringoplasty was independent of the size of the TM perforation in the frequency range of 0.25 to 4 kHz. In the TB measurements, although pressure difference across the TM was almost fully recovered by closing the perforation with a paper patch, recovery of the stapes motion was limited at frequencies above 4.5 kHz for larger sizes of TM perforations.

Conclusion

Hearing loss caused by TM perforations depends on the size of the perforation. Hearing returns almost completely across the frequency range after closure except above 4 kHz for larger perforations. This is because the structural damage caused by large TM perforations cannot be completely restored by application of a paper patch.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^6efe0f1e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tube otorrhea and complications — frequencies and management — are reported as follows: Acute TTO occurs in up to 50% of children who are closely monitored in RCTs, with cohort studies finding 16% postoperative otorrhea (first 30 days), 26% delayed otorrhea, 7% recurrent otorrhea, and 4% chronic otorrhea. Caregivers should be counseled that TTO responds to topical antibiotic ear drops, does not usually require oral antibiotics, and benefits from water precautions until the discharge is no longer present. Up to 3% of tubes may fail to extrude and require active removal; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs with about 2% of short-term tubes and up to 20% of long-term tubes; and localized cholesteatoma may be seen in 0.5% of cases.

### Comparing myringoplasty to type I tympanoplasty in tympanic membrane repair: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4ba32acf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the anatomic success rates of type I tympanoplasty (tympanoplasty) versus myringoplasty. By our definition, tympanoplasty involves entering the middle ear via elevation of a tympanomeatal flap, while myringoplasty involves surgery to the drumhead without middle ear exposure.

Data Sources

PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane.

Review Methods

To be included, studies must have documented surgical technique, tympanic membrane (TM) perforation size (as % of TM), and success rate using tissue or alloplastic grafts. Exclusion criteria included series with more than 10% of patients with cholesteatoma or middle ear pathology. A meta-analysis of weighted summary proportions under the random effects model was performed, and proportion differences (PD) were calculated. A secondary analysis of hearing outcomes was performed.

Results

Eighty-five studies met inclusion, with a tympanoplasty cohort of n = 7966 and n = 1759 for myringoplasty. For perforations, less than 50% of the TM, the success rate for tympanoplasty and myringoplasty was 90.2% and 91.4%, respectively (PD: 1.2%, p = .19). In perforations greater than 50%, tympanoplasty and myringoplasty success rates were 82.8% and 85.3%, respectively (PD: 2.5%, p = .29). For both procedures, perforations less than 50% of the TM had higher success rates than perforations greater than 50% of the TM (p < .01). Both techniques endorsed significant improvements to air-bone gap (ABG) metrics.

Conclusion

Our analysis suggests that the anatomic success rate is similar for tympanoplasty and myringoplasty, regardless of perforation size, and that smaller perforations experience higher success rates in both techniques. ABG outcomes were also similar between procedure techniques.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^943b203b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Follow-up setting and triggers for referral — Periodic follow-up for all children with tubes is essential to detect and manage complications, which may vary by the type of tube and its composition. Once adequate postoperative tympanostomy tube function and hearing improvement are established within 3 months by the surgeon or designee, some follow-up care may occur in primary care offices; if this approach is chosen, the specialist should ideally be informed of the visit, with referral to otolaryngology implemented upon any complication such as early extrusion, tube obstruction, tube medialization, otorrhea, retained tube, or tympanic membrane perforation.

### Fungal otitis externa as a cause of tympanic membrane perforation: a case series [^1be267ac]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a series of 11 patients — 8 men and 3 women, aged 18 to 70 years (mean: 46.0) — who had fungal otitis externa that had been complicated by a tympanic membrane perforation. These patients had been referred to us for evaluation of chronic, mostly treatment-refractory otitis externa, which had manifested as otorrhea, otalgia, and/or pruritus. Seven of the 11 patients had no history of ear problems prior to their current condition. Five patients had been referred to us by a primary care physician and 4 by an otolaryngologist; the other 2 patients were self-referred. All patients were treated with a thorough debridement of the ear and one of two antifungal medication regimens. Eight of the 11 patients experienced a complete resolution of signs and symptoms, including closure of the tympanic membrane perforation. The other 3 patients underwent either a tympanoplasty (n = 2) or a fat-graft myringotomy (n = 1) because the perforation did not close within a reasonable amount of time. This series demonstrates that the nonspecific signs and symptoms of fungal otitis externa can make diagnosis difficult for both primary care physicians and general otolaryngologists. This study also demonstrates that most cases of tympanic membrane perforation secondary to fungal otitis externa will resolve with cleaning of the ear and proper medical treatment. Therefore, most patients with this condition will not require surgery.

### Chronic suppurative otitis media [^92f4b0e3]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a leading global cause of potentially preventable hearing loss in children and adults, associated with socioeconomic deprivation. There is an absence of consensus on the definition of CSOM, which complicates efforts for prevention, treatment, and monitoring. CSOM occurs when perforation of the tympanic membrane is associated with severe or persistent inflammation in the middle ear, leading to hearing loss and recurrent or persistent ear discharge (otorrhoea). Cholesteatoma, caused by the inward growth of the squamous epithelium of the tympanic membrane into the middle ear, can also occur. The optimal treatment of discharge in CSOM is topical antibiotics. In resource-limited settings where topical antibiotics might not be available, topical antiseptics are an alternative. For persistent disease, surgery to repair the tympanic membrane or remove cholesteatoma might offer long-term resolution of otorrhoea and potential improvement to hearing. Recent developments in self-fitted air-conduction and bone-conduction hearing aids offer promise as new options for rehabilitation.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^788788cf]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 12 (StataCorp LP, Texas City, TX) and Review Manager version 5.3. Closure rates are expressed as odds radio (OR), while healing times and hearing improvement are reported as the standardized mean difference (SMD). Moreover, the I² statistic was applied to assess heterogeneity, with an I² value of 25, 50, and 75% indicating a low, moderate, and high heterogeneity respectively. All data were dropped into the pool with suitable statistical models. The subgroup analysis was also continued considering that the perforation size has been reported to be associated with healing time. We divided the studies into three subgroups based on the patients' perforation size, as: large perforation (> 50% of the TM); small perforation (< 50% of the TM); and unknown size (size of the TM perforation unspecified in the studies) for the outcomes of the healing time. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure reliability of the results by excluding one outlying study. Funnel plots were used to examine publication bias. In addition, Begg's tests were used to quantitatively assess publication bias. To further examine the possible effect of publication bias, the trim-and-fill method also was used in our analyses. All p values were two sided, with p < 0.05 being considered as statistically significant.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3141b1be]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Tympanic membrane perforation with squamous epithelial ingrowth [^fc0c5eb0]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The squamous epithelium of the tympanic membrane and external auditory canal exhibits an inherent migration pattern to facilitate the exfoliation of keratinizing squamous cells as part of a natural cleansing mechanism.

### A proof-of-concept computer vision approach for measurement of tympanic membrane perforations [^fdda26ce]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Size, an important characteristic of a tympanic membrane perforation (TMP), is commonly assessed with gross estimation via visual inspection, a practice which is prone to inaccuracy. Herein, we demonstrate feasibility of a proof-of-concept computer vision model for estimating TMP size in a small set of perforations.

Methods

An open-source deep learning architecture was used to train a model to segment and calculate the area of a perforation and the visualized tympanic membrane (TM) in a set of endoscopic images of mostly anterior and relatively small TMPs. The model then computed relative TMP size by calculating the ratio of perforation area to TM area. Model performance on the test dataset was compared to ground-truth manual annotations. In a validation survey, otolaryngologists were tasked with estimating the size of TMPs from the test dataset. The primary outcome was the average absolute error of model size predictions and clinician estimates compared to sizes determined by ground-truth manual annotations.

Results

The model's average absolute error for size predictions was a 0.8% overestimation for all test perforations. Conversely, among the 38 survey respondents, the average clinician error was a 11.0% overestimation (95% CI, 5.2–16.7%, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

In a small sample of TMPs, we demonstrated a computer vision approach for estimating TMP size is feasible. Further validation studies must be done with significantly larger and more heterogenous datasets.

### Effects of tympanic membrane perforation, middle ear cavity volume, and mastoid aeration on hearing impairment [^2c6478ef]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate the effects of the location and size of tympanic membrane (TM) perforation and middle ear cavity volume on conductive hearing loss in patients with TM perforation.

Methods

Data were collected via a retrospective medical chart review.

Results

We enrolled 128 patients with a mean age of 45.6 ± 10.1 years. The mean perforation size was 21.2 ± 8.6% of the TM area, and the mean air-bone gap (ABG) was 20.2 ± 8.6 dB HL on pure tone audiometry. Patients were divided into two groups based on mean ABG. Patients with a large ABG had a significantly larger TM perforation area and smaller mastoid volume. The TM perforation was most commonly located in the central section. However, regression analyses showed that the proportion of the perforated TM area was the only independent predictor of a large ABG (odds ratio, 1.053; 95% confidence interval, 1.022–1.085; p = 0.001). When we analyzed the frequencies in which hearing loss occurred due to TM perforation, we confirmed that hearing loss occurred mainly in the low-frequency range.

Conclusion

In patients with TM perforation, conductive hearing loss occurs mainly at low frequencies and in proportion to the size of the TM perforation.

### Surgery for tympanic membrane retraction pockets [^acec90ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Tympanic membrane retractions are commonly managed by ENT surgeons. There is currently no consensus as to the indications, timing and options for management of this condition.

Objectives

To study the effectiveness of different surgical options in the management of tympanic membrane retractions.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2010 Issue 1); PubMed (1950 to 2010); EMBASE (1974 to 2010); CINAHL (1982 to 2010); BIOSIS Previews; ISI Web of Science; CAB Abstracts; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; ISCTRN; UKCRN; ICTRP and Google. The date of the search was 17 March 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the surgical management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets in adults or children. Staging of the retraction using a known system must have been performed. Studies of cholesteatoma or perforations were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently collected and analysed data to minimise the effects of selection and reporting bias.

Main Results

Two RCTs were included, involving 71 participants. The first study showed no statistically significant benefit of cartilage graft tympanoplasty over a watch and wait policy for either disease progression or hearing outcome. The second showed no additional benefit from the insertion of ventilation tubes over cartilage tympanoplasty alone with regards to hearing outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence currently exists to either support or refute the role of surgery in the management of tympanic membrane retractions. Higher quality studies are much needed to ascertain this.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^88de732d]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This meta-analysis has identified that the application of bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate as well as shorten healing time for the TM regeneration. There is no evidence, as assessed only from studies of acute perforations, to show that bFGF improves hearing. Given its ease, availability and safety, bFGF can be used effectively for the TM repair. Additional high-quality multi-center randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further support its efficacy in different ethnic groups especially with chronic TM perforations.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e683b6e8]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To investigate the effectiveness of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) versus placebo or no intervention in the treatment of tympanic membrane (TM) perforations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies.

Data Sources:

PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were screened from their inceptions to June 2019.

Study Selection:

Inclusion criteria: 1) English language; 2) observational (retrospective or prospective) or treatment (RCT) studies; 3) reported the outcomes on the application of bFGF in adult or pediatric population. Exclusion criteria: 1) studies without a control group; 2) animal studies, in vitro studies, review studies, and case reports.

Data Extraction:

Number of patients, cause of TM perforation, perforation size, treatment, mean age, follow-up time, sex, closure rate, healing time, mean air-bone gap improvement.

Data Synthesis:

A total of 14 studies were included, including seven RCTs and seven non-RCTs with a total of 1,072 participants. The odds ratio for closure rate of bFGF treatment was 7.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.65 to 11.53; p < 0.01; I² = 44%) and the standardized mean difference (SMD) for healing time was –5.89 (95% CI: –7.85 to –3.93, p < 0.01, I² = 98%), suggesting bFGF application has a significant effect on closure of TM perforations. However, no significant change in hearing (SMD: 0.08, 95% CI: –0.11 to 0.27, p = 0.39, I² = 0%) was seen as a result of bFGF treatment.

Conclusions:

Our meta-analysis has revealed that the application of bFGF can significantly enhance the closure rate as well as shorten the healing time for TM perforations. In terms of hearing, there is as yet no evidence that bFGF has a significant effect. Given its ease, availability, and safety, bFGF can be used effectively for TM repair.

### The development and evaluation of a smartphone-aided diagnosis application to measure tympanic membrane perforations [^8bbe52c3]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectivesChronic otitis media is a long-term infection of the middle ear. It is characterized by persistent discharge from the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane. It is one of the most common causes of preventable hearing loss, especially in developing countries. Precise estimation of the size of tympanic membrane perforation is essential for successful clinical management. In this study, we developed a smartphone-based application to calculate the ratio of the area of tympanic membrane perforation to the area of the tympanic membrane. Twelve standardized patients and 60 medical students were involved to assess the area of tympanic membrane perforation, in particular, the percentage of perforation size. MethodsIn total, 60 student doctors (including year 5 and year 6 medical students, intern and post-graduate year training of doctors) were recruited during their rotation at the Otolaryngology department of Taipei Medical University Shuang-Ho Hospital. Twelve standardized patients with chronic otitis media were recruited through a single otology practice. Oto-endoscopic examination was performed for all patients by using a commercially-available digital oto-endoscope, and clinical images of the tympanic membrane perforation were obtained. To demonstrate the variability of perforation size estimation by different student doctors, we calculated the percentage of perforation using the smartphone-based application for 12 tympanic membranes objectively and compared the results with those visually estimated by the 60 student doctors subjectively. ResultsThe variance in the visual estimation by the 60 student doctors was large. By contrast, variances in smartphone-based application calculations were smaller, indicating consistency in the results obtained from different users. The smartphone-based application accurately estimated the presence of perforation for tympanic membranes with high consistency. The differences in visual estimations can be considerably great and the variances can be large among different individuals. ConclusionsThe smartphone-based application is a dependable tool for precisely evaluating the size of tympanic membrane perforation.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3758e4d8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Impact of mastoidectomy on simple tympanic membrane perforation repair [^c8437330]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Mastoidectomy has long been identified as an effective method of treatment for chronic ear infection. The effect of mastoidectomy on patients without evidence of active infectious disease remains highly debated and unproven. The objective in the study was to examine the impact of mastoidectomy on the repair of uncomplicated tympanic membrane perforations.

Study Design

Retrospective study of patients at tertiary referral center.

Methods

Four hundred eighty-four patients who underwent surgical repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations were identified and reviewed in a retrospective manner. Simple tympanic membrane perforations were defined as tympanic membrane perforations of any size and location without any of the following confounding variables: 1). active infection (active otorrhea, abnormal middle ear mucosa, or granulations tissue); 2). ossicular abnormalities (ossicular fixation, ossicular discontinuity, ossicular malformation, or ossicular absence); 3). cholesteatoma; or 4). prior attempt at tympanic membrane repair (prior tympanoplasty or mastoidectomy). Surgical outcome and clinical course were assessed to compare results of tympanic membrane perforation repair with and without canal wall up mastoidectomy.

Results

Tympanic membrane repair was equally effective in both groups at 91%. Hearing results were comparable. Development of persistent ipsilateral otological disease requiring a subsequent ipsilateral procedure was approximately twice as common in the tympanoplasty group. In the tympanoplasty group, 14.1% of patients underwent subsequent ipsilateral otological procedures, and 6.1% of patients in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy intact canal wall group underwent subsequent ipsilateral procedures (P < .05). The most common subsequent ipsilateral procedures were tympanoplasty, tympanostomy tube placement, tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall up, and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall down, in that order. After including untreated tympanic membrane perforations as subsequent procedures, the adjusted rate of subsequent procedures was 15.5% in the tympanoplasty group and 12.2% in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy group (P > .05).

Conclusion

Mastoidectomy was not necessary for successful repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations. However, mastoidectomy impacted the clinical course in patients by reducing the number of patients requiring future procedures and by decreasing disease progression. This suggests that even in the absence of active evidence of infection, mastoidectomy improved the underlying disease process. Combining mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty during repair of simple perforations in patients with no active evidence of infection remains an appropriate option and may be valuable in reducing the need for future surgery.

### Chronic otorrhoea, otalgia and hearing loss not responding to antibiotics and tympanoplasty surgery [^c044cfbd]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Chronic otorrhoea from a tympanic membrane perforation is common. We present the case of a patient who had already received seemingly adequate treatment for his condition in the past. Yet, he presented to our outpatient clinic with worsening otalgia and otorrhoea, progressive hearing loss and a new tympanic membrane perforation. After a thorough otological evaluation, the patient's medical history and the histological specimen from a previous operation were reviewed. The findings met the diagnostic criteria of eosinophilic otitis media. After treatment with topic triamcinolone through the perforated tympanic membrane, the patient's otalgia subsided, hearing levels were improved and the size of the tympanic membrane perforation decreased.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^abe99d1d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — tympanometry preparation and calibration. Prior to performing tympanometry, the ear canal should be examined with otoscopy for cerumen blockage, foreign bodies, drainage, tympanic membrane perforation, or a collapsed canal to correlate findings with tympanometry results. Proper calibration of the tympanometer is essential for accurate results.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^9fb76136]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Chronic bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME) with hearing difficulty — Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer AND documented hearing difficulties. Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials and observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B. Level of confidence in the evidence: High. Benefits: Reduced prevalence of MEE, improved hearing, improved child and caregiver QOL, optimization of auditory access for speech and language acquisition, elimination of a potential barrier to focusing and attention in a learning environment. Risks, harms, costs: Risk of anesthesia, sequelae of the indwelling tympanostomy tubes (eg, otorrhea, granulation tissue, obstruction), complications after tube extrusion (myringosclerosis, retraction pocket, persistent perforation), failure or premature tympanostomy tube extrusion, tympanostomy tube medialization, procedural anxiety and discomfort, and direct procedural costs. Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Policy level: Recommendation. Intentional vagueness: The term hearing difficulty is used instead of hearing loss to emphasize that a functional assessment of how a child uses hearing and engages in the environment is important, regardless of what specific threshold is used to define hearing loss based on audiologic criteria.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^b185ee13]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — short-term versus long-term devices differ in duration, indications, and trade-offs. Short-term tubes ventilate for "8 to 18 months, on average; some stay in place 3 years or longer", are the "Routine choice for first ear tube surgery for a child", have "Reduced incidence (vs long-term tubes) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis; ease of insertion", but carry "Potential for early extrusion and need for repeat tube surgery". Long-term tubes provide ventilation for "15 months or longer, usually 2 to 3 years; some stay in place 5 years or longer", are a "Selective choice for first ear tube surgery for a child when a need for prolonged ventilation is anticipated; option for repeat tube surgery", offer "Longer period of middle ear ventilation, potential to avoid repeat insertion of short-term tubes and exposure to general anesthesia; ability to insert silastic T-tube in stenotic canal", but have "Increased incidence (vs short-term tube) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis, medialization (if short shaft with no outer flange); more difficult to insert". Relative uses include, for short-term tubes, "Repeat ear tube surgery in children without significant risk factors or anatomic changes in the eardrum that would warrant a long-term tube", and for long-term tubes, "Cleft palate, stenotic ear canal, abnormal tympanic membrane (atrophy, atelectasis, retraction pocket), premature extrusion of multiple prior short-term tubes".

### Panel 8: complications and sequelae [^40448eb2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Although serious complications of otitis media (OM) such as brain abscess are rare, sequelae of OM such as tympanic membrane perforation and atelectatic tympanic membrane are quite common. Inner ear sequelae can cause hearing loss and speech and language problems. The objectives of this article are to provide a state-of-the-art review on recent articles on complications and sequelae of OM in different anatomic locations, from the tympanic membrane to intracranial sites, as well as hearing loss and speech and language development.

Data Sources

Primarily PubMed supplemented by Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database.

Review Methods

All types of articles related to OM complications and sequelae published in English between January 2007 and June 2011 were identified. A total of 127 relevant quality articles are summarized and included in this report.

Results

Key findings are summarized based on the following major anatomic locations and categories: tympanic membrane; cholesteatoma; ossicular problems; mucosal sequelae; inner ear sequelae; speech and language development; extracranial areas, including mastoiditis and facial nerve paralysis; intracranial complications; and future research goals. New information and insights were gained to prevent complications and sequelae.

Conclusion and Implications For Practice

Over the past 4 years, progress has been made in advancing the knowledge on the complications and sequelae of OM, which can be used to prevent and treat them effectively. Areas of potential future research have been identified and outlined.

RESULTS

Characteristics of the Studies

Of the 91 studies identified, a total of 14 studies with 1,072 patients were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of seven RCTs and seven non-RCTs (,–). The included studies were published between 2003 and 2018, with a range of follow-up time from 3 to 12 months. Perforations in three studies were chronic due to various causes, while perforations in the other studies were caused by trauma. All studies reported the closure rates (,–); only eight studies reported the healing time. Six studies provided the outcomes of hearing. The characteristics and statistics of the selected documents were summarized in Table 1. The detailed information of the bFGF application in each study was also summarized in Supplemental Table 1, including composition, manufacturer, concentration, doses, frequency, and duration.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d8e5af29]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

After searching, the 91 articles were independently evaluated by two authors (J.H. and B.M.T.) with the following inclusion criteria: 1) observational (retrospective or prospective) or treatment (randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) studies; 2) studies that reported the outcomes on the application of bFGF in adult or pediatric populations. Studies without a control group were excluded. Animal studies, in vitro studies, review studies, and case reports were excluded as well. A third author (Y.S.) was available when any disagreement presented between these two authors. A total of 14 studies were selected for further analysis from the 91 studies through screening the abstract and full texts. Subsequently, the quality of the included studies was judged according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias through Review Manager 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) (Fig. 2).

FIG. 2
Risk of bias summary for enrolled studies. Green, yellow, and red circles indicate a low, unclear, and high risk of bias, respectively.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was the complete closure rate in the bFGF treatment group versus the complete closure rate in the control group. The secondary outcomes were the differences in healing time and improvement in hearing. The following data was taken or derived from the full report of the 14 studies for both the treatment and control groups: 1) number of subjects, 2) percentage closure, 3) mean and standard deviation (SD) of closure time in days, 4) mean and SD of four frequency (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) average of air-conduction threshold in decibels (dB) obtained via standard pure-tone audiometric testing. Also recorded were 1) first author, 2) year of publication, 3) the study design (RCT or non-RCT), and 4) size of perforation targeted by the study.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^39ac2aa0]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Our trial supports the notion that asymptomatic bulging of the tympanic membrane is an important predictor of AOM and perforation; this has not been emphasised in the AAP and AAFP guideline. Furthermore, the implications of withholding antibiotic therapy in children with bulging eardrums have not previously been evaluated in high quality studies. Guidelines for management of AOM in Indigenous children define AOM as middle ear effusion with either bulging of the tympanic membrane, recent discharge, ear pain, or redness. There is no option to withhold antibiotics in an Aboriginal child with AOM; for children in whom AOM is associated with perforation, longer courses of antibiotics are recommended. Our RCT supports that recommendation.

A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from studies in low-risk populations identified subgroups most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. In children younger than 2 years of age with bilateral acute otitis media, 55% of controls and 30% on antibiotics still had pain, fever, or both at 3–7 days, with a rate difference between these groups of -25% (95% CI -36% to -14%), resulting in a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of four children. In children with otorrhoea the rate difference and NNT, respectively, were -36% (-53% to -19%) and three, whereas in children without otorrhoea the equivalent values were -14% (-23% to -5%) and eight. From our results in Aboriginal children (Table 2), the NNT would be about ten for normalisation of ears, about six for prevention of perforation, and about four for either beneficial outcome. If compliance could be guaranteed in Aboriginal children, each NNT would likely be reduced.

### Diagnostic inaccuracy and subject exclusions render placebo and observational studies of acute otitis media inconclusive [^fc451902]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic accuracy and appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria representative of children at greatest risk is of paramount importance in trials to evaluate placebo or observation as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management.

Methods

Twelve observational studies spanning the time frame 1958–2005 and 13 natural history studies spanning the time frame 1968–2006 were evaluated for the diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria applied within the study design.

Results

Although a bulging or full tympanic membrane (TM) with effusion is the best indication of a diagnosis of bacterial AOM based on tympanocentesis findings, few observational and natural history studies required a bulging TM. Examination of subject inclusion criteria showed that many subjects did not have AOM but rather had no middle ear disease at all or they had otitis media with effusion. Exclusion criteria of subjects were also remarkable. Frequently children < 2 years old were excluded; mean age among the studies reflected an older age group, unlike the true epidemiology of AOM. Otitis prone children, those with severe disease, with a bulging TM, with fever, with a definite need for antibiotics, with recent antibiotic treatment, with recent AOM, or with perforation of the TM were often excluded.

Conclusions

Guidelines and some authorities have overlooked or discounted the importance of the issues of inaccurate diagnosis on study entry, broad inclusion criteria, and the creation of bias in exclusion criteria among placebo/natural history trials in AOM. The current data favoring observation of children with AOM should be reconsidered until better studies are conducted.

### The impact of platelet-derived growth factor on closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^51debdab]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients with tympanic membrane (TM) perforations often have infections, and repetitive topical treatment may be required. These infections can be prevented by permanent closure of the TM perforation. Different surgical treatment options have been described, but noninvasive techniques may be preferred as they carry less risk than surgery. One noninvasive approach is to induce wound healing by application of growth factors. The effect and clinical use of applying topical platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) for decrease of size and closure of chronic TM perforations is evaluated.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Twenty patients with chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma for more than 3 months.

Intervention

Topical treatment with PDGF or placebo applied weekly to the TM for 6 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Success rate, defined as a reduction of perforation size of 50% or more to determine relative changes of the perforation size; effect of initial size and location of TM perforation on success rate; and air and bone conduction thresholds to determine air-bone gap measured before treatment.

Results

Randomization made matching pretreatment perforation size of the 2 study groups impossible, and the initial rate perforation/TM was significantly smaller in the PDGF group. No difference between the 2 groups was found for perforation/TM less than 10%. However, success rate did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (power = 0.8), and the effect of PDGF was found to be small (-2%; standard deviation, ± 49%). Initial size and position of the TM perforation were not significant factors determining success. Mean air-bone gap for the frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz was 22.5 dB.

Conclusion

The topical application of PDGF as an office treatment for chronic otitis media is not a favorable alternative to surgery.

### Incidence of tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid treatment through myringotomy tubes [^91a16f75]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Intratympanic (IT) steroids are often used to treat inner ear disorders such as sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss, autoimmune inner ear disease, and Ménière disease. Administration of corticosteroids via IT injection, via application with a pledget to the round window, or via catheter has been used for this purpose. The frequency of adverse events related to the IT injection of steroids is low, with pain, short-lasting vertigo, otitis media, and tympanic perforations being the most common complications. However, the safety of IT steroid therapy has not yet been established in a randomized clinical trial. In this article, we discuss a group of 11 patients with sensorineural hearing loss who underwent myringotomy and tube placement for home-based dexamethasone instillation and subsequently developed the complication of tympanic membrane perforation. It appears that there is a significantly increased incidence of tympanic membrane perforations in this population.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^725467ee]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Abnormal type B tympanogram — interpretation of equivalent ear canal volume in children is as follows: a normal equivalent ear canal volume usually indicates middle ear effusion (MEE); a low volume indicates probe obstruction by cerumen or contact with the ear canal; and a high volume indicates a patent tympanostomy tube or a tympanic membrane perforation.

### Fresh tympanic membrane perforations heal without significant loss of strength [^53cb14ab]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The mechanical and structural properties of the tympanic membrane change after a perforation has healed.

Background

In previous studies, efforts have been made to enhance the healing process of tympanic membrane perforations. The strength of the healed perforation has been tested with moiré interferometry in gerbils, but in no other species.

Methods

A laser myringotomy was made on 10 Sprague-Dawley rats and 10 CBA mice, and assessments were made after 2 or 4 weeks with moiré interferometry and light and electron microscopy.

Results

The mean peak displacement at pressure loads of +350 daPa and of -350 daPa did not differ significantly in the healed perforations as compared with the untouched tympanic membranes. Morphologic assays showed fivefold increased thickness at the site of the perforation due to invaded fibroblasts and extracellular matrix.

Conclusion

Moiré interferometry was successfully performed in the rat ears, whereas in mouse ears the method was not easily applicable due to technical difficulties. The stress-strain curve of the rat tympanic membrane displays an S-shape. The strength of the spontaneously healed tympanic membrane after myringotomy was not significantly impaired. The site of the perforation became significantly thickened at 2 and 4 weeks post-myringotomy. This information is of clinical importance, because recently closed perforations will be challenged by pressure gradient in everyday life.

### The risk of cholesteatoma in individuals with first-degree relatives surgically treated for the disease [^27ac58e8]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Cholesteatoma in the middle ear is an uncommon disease accompanied by risks for severe complications if not treated. The incidence of cholesteatoma is 6 to 9 per 100 000 inhabitants in developed countries and tends to be higher in children. A decline in incidence has been described over the last decades in several countries. There is a male dominance in having had cholesteatoma surgery.

A cholesteatoma is typically defined as an acquired retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane that loses its ability to self-clean and thus starts to accumulate keratin debris. With time, the cholesteatoma grows and affects surrounding bone and other nerve and soft tissues, which can lead to hearing loss and disturbances of taste, balance, and facial nerve function. Infection of the cholesteatoma is common and seems to increase the rate of bone resorption. Cholesteatoma, if not treated, can lead to sinus thrombosis, meningitis, and intracranial abscess.

Several other types of cholesteatoma exists, including (1) acquired nonretraction pocket cholesteatoma emerging from a perforated tympanic membrane, (2) congenital cholesteatoma under an intact membrane, and (3) postsurgical cholesteatoma divided in recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. The treatment of the disease is surgical, but occasionally individuals will not undergo surgery, mostly due to medical reasons.

In the literature, cholesteatoma is in general not presented as a hereditary disease, but in clinical practice, histories of familial cases are accumulating. The results of a search in the literature are sparse, and in a 2018 review article by Jennings et al, only 35 articles were found on the subject, ranging from case reports of siblings to genetic testing. However, in 2009, Prinsleyreported on family clustering of cholesteatoma in 12 families in the United Kingdom, the largest cohort yet reported in the literature. In 2019, a preliminary communication from the same research groupshowed the results of a genetic study of one of these families with the identification of 2 genes of interest.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^463cb052]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — ventilation duration, device types, and when to consider long-term tubes: Short-term tubes usually afford 8 to 18 months of middle ear ventilation, with Shepard usually extruding by 8 months; commonly used long-term tubes typically remain in place for 2 years or longer, and subannular ventilation tubes achieve long-term ventilation with median 35 months. The main benefit of T-tubes is prolonged ventilation but they are accompanied by increased risk of perforation, myringosclerosis, granulation tissue, cholesteatoma, and chronic otorrhea. About 25% of children need a second set of short-term tympanostomy tubes and about 8% require a third set, with additional risk factors for repeat surgery including having a parent who is a smoker, daycare attendance, breastfeeding for under 3 months, pacifier use, tympanic membrane atelectasis, male sex, asthma, gastrointestinal disease, and prematurity; however, there are no prospective studies to identify specific risk factors that identify children who would benefit from initial long-term tube placement. Consideration for placement of long-term tympanostomy tubes may be reserved for a subset with conditions such as cleft palate, Trisomy 21, or stenotic ear canals that make short-term tube placement difficult or impossible; other relative indications include an atrophic or atelectatic tympanic membrane or a history of premature extrusion of at least 2 sets of prior short-term tubes, and less often family preference to avoid multiple exposures to general anesthesia.

### Diagnosis and management of the lateralized tympanic membrane [^d21e7954]. The Laryngoscope (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

Lateralization of the tympanic membrane (TM) is associated with significant morbidity. In a series of 14 patients, we make observations to illuminate this condition for the diagnosing and treating physician.

Study Design

Chart review of 14 consecutively treated patients.

Methods

We analyzed the presenting signs and symptoms, etiology, audiometric data, and operative findings of patients with a lateralized tympanic membrane (TM).

Results

The etiology was postsurgical in 13 patients (there were four aural atresia repairs and nine tympanoplasties), with 2 patients having had multiple previous surgeries. Presentation averaged more than 5 years after the latest surgery. Presenting symptoms included hearing loss in 10, tinnitus in 3, vertigo in 3, and otorrhea in 2 patients; 3 patients were nonsymptomatic at the time of presentation. The average air-bone gaps were 39 dB before treatment and 29 dB after treatment. Operative findings included cholesteatoma in six patients. Eight patients healed with the TM in the normal position; one had TM retraction, one had a TM perforation, and three had a recurrent lateralization.

Conclusion

The lateralized TM is primarily, but not necessarily, a complication of otological surgery. It may be associated with considerable morbidity, including hearing loss and cholesteatoma. Patients may present several years after their surgery, occasionally as an incidental finding. Surgical repair is often necessary for significant underlying disease, but re-establishment of a normal TM can be challenging.

### Outcomes after tympanic membrane perforation during primary stapes surgery for otosclerosis [^58d97575]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

Stapes surgery is occasionally complicated by an intraoperative tympanic membrane perforation (ITMP), traditionally indicating abortion of the procedure due to concerns for postoperative infection and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This work examines outcomes and complications in completed primary stapes surgeries with and without ITMP.

Study Design

Retrospective review.

Methods

All patients diagnosed with otosclerosis between February 2008 and September 2017 at a tertiary otology referral center were reviewed retrospectively. Primary outcome measures were post-operative air-bone gap (ABG), air conduction and bone conduction pure tone averages, and post-operative complications.

Results

Review revealed 652 primary stapes operations meeting inclusion criteria, of which ITMP occurred in 10. There were no significant differences in pre-operative hearing metrics or demographic characteristics between ears with and without ITMP. There were also no significant differences in post-operative ABG (6.4 vs. 8.0dB HL, P = 0.43) or change in ABG after surgery (-21.6 vs. -18.2dB, P = 0.34) between these two groups. Patients with ITMP were more likely to complain of post-operative dysgeusia (30.0% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.015) but were no more likely to develop reparative granuloma, otitis media, or SNHL (P > .05).

Conclusions

The first review of ITMP and hearing outcomes after stapes surgery is presented. Our findings suggest that it is likely safe and appropriate to proceed with primary stapes surgery and concurrent tympanoplasty in the presence of a small ITMP with minimal risk of infection, SNHL, or worsened hearing outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^de6bb4ff]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Guideline action term strength and implied obligation — strong recommendation, recommendation, and option — define clinician expectations. For a strong recommendation, the benefits clearly exceed the harms with high-quality evidence (grade A or B), and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation indicates benefits exceed harms but with lower-quality evidence (grade B or C), and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option indicates suspect evidence (grade D) or well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) showing little clear advantage between approaches, and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. Option is similar to the weak recommendation in the GRADE classification.

### Repair of complete tympanic membrane perforations… [^d0a00ac3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

COMPLETE or "pantympanic" perforations denote total loss of the tympanic membrane with the exception of a rim of pars tensa left as a remnant which is actually the annulus of the pars tensa. This perforation usually excludes the pars flaccida of the drum. Initial grafting procedures to perforations of the tympanic membrane were first reported about ten years ago. 1, 2 A significant improvement in results occurred with evolution to the use of external canal skin grafts in the repair of these perforations. 3–5 Additional materials, namely vein or fascia, soon followed the use of canal skin in the evolution of this surgical procedure. 6, 7. The cases reported in this paper are restricted to those persons having complete loss of the tympanic membrane before grafting. The grafting procedure shown uses two tissues, namely vein and canal skin in combination. The use of this combination was first introduced and reported by TABOR JR. Repair of Complete Tympanic Membrane Perforations.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^28f673d7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — precautions for removal and irrigation highlight safety considerations and technique selection. The suspicion of a nonintact tympanic membrane should be assessed by history and/or physical examination prior to selection of a disimpaction technique, and prior tympanic membrane perforation, prior ear surgery, intratympanic injections, tympanostomy tubes, or barotrauma should prompt use of techniques other than irrigation. Current otitis externa should also be identified; if the ear canal is currently infected, irrigation should be avoided. Pain should alert clinicians to possible infection or other pathology, and if present the ear should be assessed before selecting a method of cleaning. In the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane, irrigation could produce caloric effects resulting in vertigo, some agents can be toxic to the middle or inner ear, and mechanical removal is the preferred technique when eardrum perforation is suspected. Safe and effective irrigation is not always possible in patients with narrow or stenotic ear canals, and specialized equipment and procedures may be required to safely remove cerumen in these patients. A perforated tympanic membrane or patent tympanostomy tube likewise limits options available for cerumen removal.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^2feaf703]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Tympanostomy tube complications and sequelae — anesthesia-related mortality for children undergoing diverse procedures ranges from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 45,000 anesthetics delivered; the most common tube-related sequela is otorrhea, seen in approximately 16% of children within 4 weeks of surgery and 26% of children at any time the tube remains in place (mean, 12–14 months); complications include an obstructed tube lumen in 7% of intubated ears, premature extrusion in 4%, and tube displacement into the middle ear in 0.5%; the posttympanostomy sequela most likely to require intervention is persistent perforation, occurring in about 2% of children; and myringoplasty or tympanoplasty has an 80% to 90% success rate for surgical closure of persistent perforation with a single procedure.

### Tympanic membrane changes in central tympanic membrane perforations [^d3a4f64e]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to evaluate the histopathological changes in central tympanic membrane perforations caused by chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-nine temporal bones from 25 patients (13 male patients and 12 female patients) with central tympanic membrane perforations-18 chronic otitis media with perforation and 11 chronic otitis media with perforation caused by ventilation tubes-and 30 aged-matched normal temporal bones were included in this study. A scale was used to evaluate the extension of the migration of stratified squamous epithelium in the inner surface of the tympanic membrane. The thickness of tympanic membranes was measured halfway between the annular ligament and the perforation and compared with that of the normal bones. The presence of tympanosclerosis and papillary projections of squamous epithelium was also noted.

Results

The extension of the migration of stratified squamous epithelium in the inner surface of the tympanic membrane was observed in 11 of the 29 perforations (38%). The thickness of tympanic membranes was significantly different between the perforation groups and the control group. Of the 29 tympanic membranes, 13 (44%) had tympanosclerosis and 8 (28%) revealed papillary projections of squamous epithelium.

Conclusions

Our study shows that a central tympanic perforation should not merely be considered as a simple defect. Most of the tympanic membranes showed one or more signs of sequelae or persistent abnormalities such as tympanosclerosis, papillary projections, thickening, and ingrowth without significant differences between the 2 central perforation groups.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^5a957047]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are commonly used to treat people with CSOM. This is the first update to the review published in 2021, and is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics compared to placebo, no treatment, or another systemic antibiotic in people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two clinical trials registers to 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) to placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving people with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia)/discomfort/local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity measured in several ways. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found three new studies (390 participants). Overall, we included 21 studies (2525 participants). We report four core comparisons below, and describe an additional four in the Results section of the review. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain from a single study if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 1 study, 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks, or health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. The study did not report ear pain and suspected ototoxicity. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Seven studies assessed this comparison, with five presenting usable data. There may be little or no difference between oral ciprofloxacin and placebo/no treatment (with all participants receiving ciprofloxacin ear drops) in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 300 participants; low-certainty evidence), with similar results at two to four weeks. One study reported outcomes beyond four weeks, but the results were not usable. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications, and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antibiotics and topical steroids in both study arms) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus topical steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at two to four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 1 study, 30 participants). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if co-trimoxazole improved resolution of ear discharge after four weeks compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 1 study, 98 participants; very low-certainty evidence). From the narrative reporting of one study, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing, or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). 4. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antiseptics in both study arms) One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms, and found no difference in the resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no-treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). The study reported no other outcomes. Limitations include heterogeneity in the duration and definition of CSOM used by studies included in the review. Although we planned subgroup analyses for different participant characteristics, treatment duration, and spectrum of antibiotic activity, we did not perform these analyses due to lack of available data.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence available to determine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM is limited. We are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics, when used alone (with or without aural toileting (ear cleaning)), are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an intervention such as topical antibiotics, there may be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics; it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic is more effective than another. Harmful effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the included studies.

### Compared to placebo, long-term antibiotics resolve otitis media with effusion (OME) and prevent acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) in a high-risk population: a randomized controlled trial [^b27b90d2]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

We believe that our study of long-term antibiotic use is very relevant for Aboriginal and other populations at high risk of tympanic membrane perforation. Unfortunately conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has not significantly reduced ear disease in Australian Aboriginal children. A recent pediatric outreach program in Far North Queensland confirms that CSOM is the most prevalent health problem in Aboriginal children. The poor school achievement of Aboriginal children, already disadvantaged by poverty, has been partially attributed to the chronic hearing loss.

Our study shows that Aboriginal infants with OME receiving continuous amoxicillin had fewer perforations, more normal ears, less pneumococcal carriage and fewer resistant pneumococci than children who received regular paediatric care and antibiotic treatment for acute illnesses but without continuous amoxicillin. The option to use long-term antibiotics would be less relevant for western populations where the outcome of untreated OM is less severe, and the balance of benefit and risk is less influenced by the risk of a severe clinical outcome, and more influenced by the potential for increased antibiotic resistance in the child and the community.

### Assessments of the size of tympanic membrane perforations: a comparison of clinical estimations with video-otoscopic calculations [^2f39b382]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

We conducted a study to determine how accurate various ENT specialists were in estimating the size of 100 tympanic membrane (TM) perforations with standard otoscopy. The specialists included, in descending order of rank, 2 Consultant Surgeons, 2 Senior Registrars, and 2 Registrars, all of whom had confirmed good vision. We compared their estimates, which were made independently and expressed as a percentage of the total area of the TM, with exact measurements calculated with computer-based video-otoscopy. We found that the video-otoscopic calculations were far superior to the estimates of the specialists, even the most experienced Consultants (p < 0.01). We recommend that video-otoscopy be used whenever possible.

### Prognostic factors of successful tympanoplasty in pediatric patients: a cohort study [^65112855]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tympanoplasty in children is a current and controversial theme. Previously reported success rates for tympanoplasty in children have ranged between 56–94%, with this wide range being attributed to different selection criteria and definitions of success. The latter parameter traditionally has been measured only by the post-operative integrity of the graft. Yet, there exist other valuable characteristics to consider, as it is known that children in general, and those who have undergone repair of the tympanic membrane, in particular, present a greater risk for retractions, serous otitis media, and re-perforation with episodes of acute otitis media. In addition, with a pediatric patient, the surgery itself may be considered as being more difficult technically, due to the narrowness of the external ear canal and the generally smaller size of the ear, thus contributing to a poor result, but of a functional type. Therefore, over time, otorhinolaryngologists dedicated to pediatric pathology have considered it necessary to have a more complete definition of "success" — one that should include 1) integrity of the graft or membrane; 2) post-operative gain (minimum of 10 dB) in the auditory threshold, or conservation of hearing; and 3) complete healing, with the space of the aerated middle ear manifested by the graft located in the correct anatomical position, with neither atelectasis nor otitis media with effusion (OME).

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^b704d3cc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) initial corticosteroids — Clinicians may offer corticosteroids as initial therapy to patients with SSNHL within 2 weeks of symptom onset, categorized as an Option based on systematic reviews of RCTs and new RCTs and a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and the level of confidence in the evidence is Medium, with the benefit of hearing improvement. Risks for systemic steroids include suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and Cushing's-like syndrome (minimal with 10- to 14-day treatment), aseptic necrosis of the hip, and hyperglycemia, whereas IT corticosteroids have minimal systemic effect but can cause local reactions of pain, tympanic membrane perforation, and transient dizziness, and entail high cost and multiple office visits. Exceptions for systemic steroids include medical conditions affected by corticosteroids, such as insulin-dependent or poorly controlled diabetes, tuberculosis, and peptic ulcer disease. There is a large role for shared decision making with patients, and although several group members were reluctant to endorse the 2-week time frame, the time frame of 2 weeks was retained to encourage early care. The majority of trials use a 1- to 2-week window from symptom onset as the initial therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^b1d5c4d1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Intratympanic steroid therapy — adverse effects and administration recommendations are reported: IT corticosteroids can have infrequent adverse effects including pain, transient dizziness, infection, persistent tympanic membrane perforation, and possible vasovagal or syncopal episode during injection, and the frequency of administration ranges from self‑administration by the patient several times per day to physician administration from once daily to once weekly or less; all studies agreed that IT steroid eardrops should be instilled in the affected ear for 15 to 30 minutes per injection. Despite an uncertain balance of benefit versus harm and insufficient evidence to conclude the treatment is ineffective, the GUG concludes that even a small possibility of hearing improvement makes this a reasonable treatment to offer to patients.

### Microscopic over-under versus medial tympanoplasty for larger tympanic membrane perforations [^0a4f3a14]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify the differences in hearing, anatomical success rate, functional success rate, and complications between over-under tympanoplasty and medial tympanoplasty procedures.

Methods

The clinical data of patients with tympanic membrane perforation repaired by medial tympanoplasty between January 2011 and December 2016 and by over-under tympanoplasty between January 2017 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. We evaluated the differences between medial tympanoplasty and over-under tympanoplasty.

Results

The overall success rate of over-under tympanoplasty was higher than that of medial tympanoplasty (90.76% vs 81.31%). In large perforations, the success rate of over-under tympanoplasty was higher than that of medial tympanoplasty (89.80% vs 71.43%). There was no statistically significant difference in the success rate between the two treatment groups for moderate perforations. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups (P = 0.2637).

Conclusions

Over-under tympanoplasty is more suitable for large perforations of the tympanic membrane and has a higher success rate as compared to medial tympanoplasty.

### Metallic foreign body adjacent to the round window: a rare cause for chronic tympanic membrane perforation with hearing loss [^d502a70c]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Welding injuries to the tympanic membrane (TM) or middle ear are rare but can cause significant damage. These injuries occur when a hot spark or molten slag drops directly into the external auditory canal and through the action of gravity (because the ear is upright during such an injury), then risks burning through the TM. This can lead to a multitude of adverse consequences including chronic TM perforation, secondary purulent otorrhoea, facial palsy, taste disturbance, vertigo and hearing loss. We present the case of a welding injury to the right TM, resulting in a chronic perforation and hearing loss. The patient required surgical intervention for removal of the metallic foreign body and repair of the TM. The patient obtained a good surgical result with no sensorineural hearing loss. This is a preventable occupational injury, which can be avoided by use of ear protection and increased awareness of this potential risk.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^3204a63c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

1.7. Other adverse events

Four studies fully reported some adverse events of interest to this review (AVERTS‐2; Lambert 2012; Lambert 2016; NCT02265393). One study stated "We did not have any complications", but it is not clear which adverse effects were specifically assessed and documented during the trial (Garduno‐Anaya 2005). One study did not report any information on adverse effects (El Shafei 2020). Two studies reported on the occurrence of some adverse effects, but did not state which group participants who experienced these adverse effects were allocated to, therefore we are unable to make a comparison of intratympanic corticosteroids and placebo (Borghei 2016; Ul Shamas 2017). Two studies did not report any information on adverse effects (AVERTS‐1; NCT03664674).

As most adverse effects were rare, and some studies reported zero events in at least one group, we have used the Peto odds ratio to analyse these data. We also note that these findings may not be easily generalisable to a non‐trial context. Many of these adverse effects are specifically related to intratympanic injection. In the context of these trials (where placebo injections are used as the comparator) it is therefore appropriate to provide a comparison of the groups. However, in clinical practice, the decision for people with Ménière's disease is whether to have an intratympanic injection or not. Therefore the absolute effects in the intervention group may be of more relevance when selecting a treatment.

1.7.1. Persistent tympanic membrane perforation

The Peto odds ratio for persistent tympanic membrane perforation in those receiving intratympanic corticosteroids was 5.71 (95% CI 1.56 to 20.96; 3 studies; 320 participants; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence; Analysis 1.11). This suggests that intratympanic corticosteroids may substantially increase the chance of a persistent tympanic membrane perforation when compared to placebo. The absolute effects in the included studies were: no perforations out of 117 participants in the control group (0%), compared to 12 perforations out of 203 participants in the intratympanic corticosteroids group (5.9%).

One further study described one instance of tympanic membrane perforation, but it is unclear which group this participant was allocated to, and all study participants in this trial had a ventilation tube inserted (Borghei 2016).

### Rate of tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection [^967154c9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation after intratympanic steroid injection. To determine which comorbid conditions and risk factors are associated with prolonged time to perforation closure following intratympanic steroid injection.

Materials and Methods

Clinical data were gathered for patients who had undergone intratympanic steroid injection to treat sudden sensorineural hearing loss or Ménière's disease. Primary outcomes analysis included rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation, defined as perforation at least 90days following last injection, and time to perforation healing. Age, sex, number of injections, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, previous head and neck irradiation, and concurrent oral steroids, were analyzed as potential predictors of persistent perforation.

Results

One hundred ninety two patients were included in this study. Three patients (1.6%) had persistent tympanic membrane perforations. All three patients received multiple injections. One patient underwent tympanoplasty for repair of persistent perforation. The median time to perforation healing was 18days. There was no statistically significant variable associated with time to perforation healing. However, patients with prior history of head and neck radiation averaged 36.5days for perforation healing compared to 17.5days with no prior history of radiation and this approached statistical significance (p = 0.078).

Conclusions

The rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation following intratympanic steroid injection is low. Patients with a history of radiation to the head and neck may be at increased risk for prolonged time for closure of perforation.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^cdba6edc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — definition and diagnostic criteria: SSNHL is a subset of sudden hearing loss (SHL) that is sensorineural in nature, occurs within a 72-hour window, and meets audiometric criteria; the most frequently used audiometric criterion is a decrease in hearing of ≥ 30 decibels affecting at least 3 consecutive frequencies, and this guideline uses ≥ 30-dB SNHL at 3 consecutive frequencies. Idiopathic SSNHL (ISSNHL) is defined as SSNHL with no identifiable cause despite adequate investigation and is the situation in 90% of patients with SSNHL; in this document, the use of SSNHL is equivalent to ISSNHL after the appropriate workup in Key Action Statement 1 and KAS 2. SHL is defined as a rapid-onset subjective sensation of hearing impairment in one or both ears, and physical examination and tuning fork testing help distinguish conductive hearing loss (CHL) from sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) by identifying obstructing cerumen, foreign body, tympanic membrane perforation, or middle-ear fluid so the SSNHL pathway can be triggered; SSNHL is often but not always accompanied by tinnitus and/or vertigo, and tinnitus may persist and be disturbing to the patient.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^6e3a4d58]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Positive pressure therapy (Meniett device) in Ménière's disease — Evidence syntheses found no benefit for vertigo control and the use of positive pressure therapy, such as that with a Meniett device, is not recommended. Sved et al reviewed 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with follow-up from 2 weeks to 4 months and found no significant difference in vertigo control, and Van Sonsbeek et al reviewed 5 RCTs and determined there was no compelling evidence of effectiveness. The optimal frequency is 3 applications of pressure daily for at least 6 weeks; if there is no improvement after 6 weeks, then it is unlikely that the device is efficacious. Hearing levels were worse in users in 2 studies, and tympanostomy tubes are required with risks including persistent tympanic membrane perforation (approximately 2%–4%) and chronic otorrhea (approximately 1%). There may be rare exceptions in subpopulations at high risk for general anesthesia or with contraindications to other destructive procedures where this therapeutic modality may be utilized as a last resort to treat Ménière's disease, and providers need to clearly advise patients that current data suggest it may not be helpful in controlling symptoms.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^7a739a81]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

A variety of different interventions have been proposed to treat people with Ménière's disease. These include dietary or lifestyle changes, oral treatments, treatments administered by injection into the ear (intratympanic) and surgical treatments. This review focuses on the use of intratympanic corticosteroids to treat the symptoms of Ménière's disease.

Corticosteroids can be administered into the middle ear through the tympanic membrane. They are often administered via injection, but can also be delivered as drops through a ventilation tube (with or without a wick). Treatment regimens vary from a one‐off injection to a short course (two to three injections), and may need to be repeated if symptoms recur. Different types of corticosteroids may be used, including methylprednisolone, dexamethasone or hydrocortisone.

At present, there is no agreement on which is the ideal treatment for people with Ménière's disease – consequently there is no 'gold standard' treatment with which to compare these medications.

How the intervention might work

As the underlying cause of Ménière's disease is poorly understood, so too are the ways in which the interventions may work.

The specific action of steroids in the inner ear is unclear, but may include an influence on water homeostasis, ion channels and blood flow to the inner ear (reviewed in Farhood 2016). The rationale for intratympanic delivery is that it enables steroids to reach the target organ at a high dose (Parnes 1999), whilst avoiding complications from systemic administration. The drug is thought to be absorbed into the inner ear, where glucocorticoid receptors have been shown to be present (Rarey 1996).

Potential side effects of the intervention include pain due to the procedure, a persistent perforation of the tympanic membrane, or the development of tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss following the injection.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^54e92e45]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Effect of bFGF on Hearing Improvement in Acute TM Perforations

Six studies (n = 457 subjects) reporting the hearing improvement were included in a fixed-effect model. All of them consisted of acute TM perforations. To evaluate hearing improvement, the thresholds of pure-tone average were compared before and at the final follow-up following bFGF treatment. There was no statistically significant improvement in hearing (SMD = 0.08; 95% CI: –0.11 to 0.27, p = 0.39) in the bFGF treatment group compared with the control group. No significant interstudy heterogeneity was found (I² = 0%) (Fig. 5). The conclusion did not change following sensitivity analysis.

### Chronic suppurative otitis media… [^f275cd5b]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media causes recurrent or persistent discharge through a perforation in the tympanic membrane, and can lead to thickening of the middle ear mucosa and mucosal polyps. It usually occurs as a complication of persistent acute otitis media with perforation in childhood. Cholesteatoma is an abnormal accumulation of squamous epithelium usually found in the middle ear cavity and mastoid process of the temporal bone. Granulation tissue and ear discharge are often associated with secondary infection of the desquamating epithelium. Cholesteatoma can be congenital or acquired. If untreated, it may progressively enlarge and erode the surrounding structures. Definition Chronic suppurative otitis media is persistent inflammation of the middle ear or mastoid cavity. Synonyms include chronic otitis media, chronic mastoiditis, and chronic tympanomastoiditis.

Chronic suppurative otitis media is characterized by recurrent or persistent ear discharge over two to six weeks through a perforation of the tympanic membrane. Chronic suppurative otitis media usually begins as a complication of persistent AOM with perforation in childhood. Typical findings may also include thickened granular middle ear mucosa and mucosal polyps. Occasionally, chronic suppurative otitis media will be associated with a cholesteatoma within the middle ear. Chronic suppurative otitis media is differentiated from chronic otitis media with effusion, in which there is an intact tympanic membrane with fluid in the middle ear but no active infection. Chronic suppurative otitis media does not include chronic perforations of the eardrum that are dry, or that only occasionally produce discharge, and have no signs of active infection.

In developed countries and advantaged populations, previous insertion of tympanostomy tubes is now probably the single most important etiologic factor. Of those children who have tympanostomy tubes in place, a history of recurrent AOM, older siblings, and attendance at a child care center increase the risk of developing chronic suppurative otitis media. Most cholesteatomas are thought to occur as a complication of a retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane. They are associated with recurrent or persistent middle ear disease, family history, and craniofacial abnormalities. If untreated, a cholesteatoma may progressively enlarge and erode the surrounding structures.

### T-tubes through cartilage tympanoplasty: is It worth the perforation risk? [^836058a3]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review a single surgeon's experience with T-tube placement through cartilage tympanoplasty versus native tympanic membrane for long-term ventilation of the chronic ear and residual perforation rates following tube removal.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Two tertiary referral centers.

Patients

One hundred sixteen patients (4–71 yr of age) who underwent either total island cartilage tympanoplasty or posterior palisade cartilage tympanoplasty with T-tube placement primarily or secondarily from 1998 to 2016.

Main Outcome Measures

Long-term outcome of each T-tube was recorded with respect to retention and patency, and tympanic membrane status following either tube removal or extrusion. Audiometric data, age, sex, diagnosis, and procedure(s) performed were considered.

Results

There were 116 patients (122 total ears and 139 total T-tubes) included: 57 ears underwent total island cartilage tympanoplasty with tube placed through cartilage and 65 ears underwent posterior island graft with tube placed through native tympanic membrane. Sixty-eight T-tubes were placed in the total island cartilage group with three (4.4%) residual perforations following removal. Seventy-one T-tubes were placed in the posterior palisade graft group with six residual perforations (8.5%) following removal or extrusion. The mean retention rate for the T-tubes was 3.93 years for the total island tympanoplasty group and 3.58 years for the posterior palisade tympanoplasty group. The mean follow-up for total island tympanoplasty and posterior palisade tympanoplasty was 5.36 and 5.66 years, respectively.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that T-tube placement through cartilage tympanoplasty is worthwhile providing long-term ventilation to the middle ear and portends no higher risk for residual perforation than T-tube placement through native tympanic membrane.

### Cartilage tympanoplasty [^e4fe9d52]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

This chapter describes two techniques for cartilage reconstruction of the tympanic membrane: the perichondrium/cartilage island flap, which uses tragal cartilage, and the palisade technique, which uses cartilage from the tragus or cymba. The perichondrium/cartilage island flap is preferred for management of the atelectatic ear and the high-risk perforation. The palisade technique is preferred in cases of cholesteatoma and when ossicular reconstruction is needed in the malleus-present situation. Descriptions of the modifications that should be taken in response to specific surgical indications are also provided and include the high-risk perforation, the ear requiring ossiculoplasty, the atelectatic ear, cholesteatoma, and pervasive Eustachian tube dysfunction.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^0ed74a75]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pathomechanism

According to Ikeda et al, there are two conditions required for the formation of a herniation of the tympanic membrane. The first is a pre-existing defect in the pars tensa of the tympanic membrane, which, for example, occurs in otitis media with perforation or iatrogenic due to paracentesis. After remission, the second requirement is a recurrent positive pressure inside the middle ear, that can force the 'scarred' and thinned portion of the tympanic membrane laterally into the external ear canal.

Positive pressure (the pulsion) inside the middle ear can lead to a transient bulging of the tympanic membrane, which is commonly encountered among patients with acute otitis media, trumpet players or after Valsalva manoeuvre. Patients who suffer from chronic otitis media with effusion often report about aural fullness. They tend to repeatedly perform Valsalva manoeuvres to create positive middle ear pressure by opening the Eustachian tube, which allows a better drainage of the fluid.

Besides this method is also commonly recommended by physicians to reduce symptoms of otitis media with effusion as a low-cost and effective therapy.

Sadé described 'hyperectasis' of the tympanic membrane as a condition where either a small or large part of the tympanic membrane bulges above the physiological level.

The authors of this study believe that hyperectasis is equivalent to a bulging of the tympanic membrane involving all three layers. In the presence of a pre-existing defect of the fibrous layer, excessive autoinflation can cause a herniation of the tympanic membrane.

In this scenario, a two-layer hernia can develop through the thinned portions of the tympanic membrane.

These hernias show a higher compliance and in extreme cases, a 'ballooning effect' can lead to a complete occupation of the external auditory canal.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^5b43205d]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to diagnose AOM in children who present with moderate-to-severe bulging of the tympanic membrane, or new onset of otorrhea not due to acute otitis externa.

### Regenerative treatment for tympanic membrane perforation [^48c1298d]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish a tissue engineering therapy for the treatment of large tympanic membrane perforation (TMP) without the need for conventional surgical therapy.

Study Design

Randomized control trial.

Setting

General hospital.

Patients and Methods

A total of 63 chronic TMPs were randomly selected from outpatients.

Intervention

Of the total 63 chronic TMPs, 53 were randomly assigned to the basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) group and the remaining 10 were randomly assigned to the control group. Materials used for the TM repair were gelatin sponge and fibrin glue with/without b-FGF. After creating a mechanical disruption of the edge of the TMP, a gelatin sponge was immersed in b-FGF or saline (for the control group) and placed over the perforation. Fibrin glue was dripped over the sponge as a sealant.

Main Outcome Measures

The effectiveness of this therapy was evaluated by closure rates, hearing level, and sequelae 3 weeks after treatment. The treatment was repeated up to 4 times for cases in which complete closure of the TMP was not achieved after 1 round of treatment.

Results

Complete closure of the TMP was achieved in more than 98.1% (52/53) of the patients in the b-FGF group and 10% (1/10) of the patients in the control group. The average hearing level of all patients with successful TM repair was improved. Serious sequelae were not observed in any patient.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that a combination of gelatin sponge, b-FGF, and fibrin glue enables the regeneration of the TM without conventional operative procedures. This innovative regenerative therapy is an easy, safe, cost-effective, and minimally invasive outpatient treatment.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^89272e76]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### The effectiveness of bFGF in the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f977fe88]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, the underlying mechanism of bFGF in promoting the TM regeneration has not been fully understood. Previous studies have postulated the possible effects of bFGF on cell proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and fibroblasts and production of proteases in vitro. Studies have shown that spontaneously healed TMs tend to be thin and dimeric due to incomplete formation of the fibrous layer, resulting in higher risks of reperforation. It is thought that bFGF promotes neovascularization and improves the arrangement of collagen fibers in the fibrous layer of a TM, thereby reducing the risk of reperforation.

Despite an improvement in healing outcomes, this study did not show a statistically significant improvement in hearing compared with spontaneous healing. The SMD for the hearing gains was only 0.08, which is a change that is not clinically significant. The outcome of hearing function for TM repair depends on various factors, including graft type, surgical approach, Eustachian tube function, site and size of perforations. Our study did not show an improvement in hearing following bFGF treatment, suggesting that bFGF may not have improved sound conduction despite the probable improvement in TM structure. However, our results of hearing are limited to those with traumatic TM perforations. It should be noted that, compared with other causes of perforations, traumatic perforations tend to heal more spontaneously and rapidly. Moreover, it has been reported that there is no significant impact on hearing upon complete closure of the acute TM perforations compared with pre-perforation hearing. Hence, these studies mainly showed faster hearing recovery following the bFGF treatment rather than improvement in hearing.

### Pediatric myringoplasty: definition of "success" and factors affecting outcome [^7cc52076]. Otology & Neurotology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent studies have reported a high success rate of pediatric myringoplasty, but their definition of success and length of follow-up vary widely. Authors debate whether the success of a pediatric myringoplasty should be defined purely by an intact tympanic membrane or should analysis of middle ear health and audiometric data also be included. For the purposes of this study, success was defined as an intact tympanic membrane at 12 months postsurgery without evidence of effusion and preservation of hearing.

Objectives

To determine the true success rate of myringoplasty and identify any independent factors that significantly influence outcome.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of 132 myringoplasties performed at Birmingham Children's Hospital. Cases were grouped into those children aged younger than 8 years and those aged 8 years and older.

Results

An intact tympanic membrane was present in 80.0% of cases at the first postoperative visit. However, at 12 months, the previously defined success rate, cases decreased to 67.3%. Younger age (p < 0.0047) and anterior perforations (p < 0.0038) were the only factors found to be associated with a poorer outcome.

Conclusion

The true rate of success of a pediatric myringoplasty would seem to be lower than rates commonly quoted to parents, and this finding is in keeping with other otologists using a similar definition of success. Younger age at the time of surgery and anterior perforations have a less successful outcome. These findings are important when counseling/consenting carers of younger children about to undergo a myringoplasty.

### Outcomes in children with perforated tympanic membranes after tympanostomy tube placement: results using a pilot treatment algorithm [^9d460bf9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to examine the success of a pilot treatment algorithm for tympanic membrane perforations in children after tympanostomy tube placement.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review of children with diagnosed tympanic membrane perforations after tympanostomy tube placement from 1998 to 2003 at a tertiary care children's hospital was performed. The patients had been treated according to an algorithm used by 2 pediatric otolaryngologists for management of tympanic membrane perforations: observation vs myringoplasty. Success rates were examined.

Results

Ninety-five children were identified, 27% of whom had nonhealing perforations after tube extrusion; 73% of the perforations were caused by a retained tube. The median duration of tube retention was 48 months, ranging from 13 to 120 months. After the treatment protocol, 76% of the patients underwent gelatin film or paper patch myringoplasty, 23% had adipose myringoplasty, and 1% were observed. Overall, 91% had healed perforations after the first intervention. Among those requiring a second intervention, the sizes of initial perforations were between 15% and 40%, with postrepair perforation sizes between 5% and 40%. In addition, 75% of those requiring a second intervention underwent tympanoplasty repair and 25% had fat patch myringoplasty. None required a third intervention.

Conclusions

Our treatment algorithm for children with tympanic membrane perforations after tympanostomy tube placement appears to be successful and is an excellent model for other clinicians.

### A study of correlation between tympanic membrane perforation size with hearing loss in patients with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media [^bbae2d01]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study is directed towards establishing a correlation between the objective measurement of tympanic membrane (TM) perforation size with hearing loss in patients with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media (COM), and to compare the otoscopic findings of the TM perforation vis-a-vis the results obtained by image analysis of the endoscopic image of the perforation.

Materials and Methods

An observational, prospective and hospital based study was performed on 107 ears (78 patients) with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media. Objective measurement of the TM perforation size was done by capturing the images of the perforation on ImageJ analysis software. A correlation was established between the hearing loss and the perforation with respect to its size and location. The accuracy of the otoscopic finding of the perforation was established with respect to the endoscopic image of the perforation.

Results

The extent of the hearing loss was seen to increase with increasing size of the TM perforation (r = 0.435, p < 0.0001). Posterior perforations had a 12% greater hearing loss than anterior perforations but this was significant only at the frequency of 500Hz (p = 0.02). There was a positive correlation between the otoscopic estimation of the size of the perforation with the endoscopically obtained image.

Conclusion

Hearing loss in chronic otitis media is directly proportional to the size of the TM perforation and posteriorly based perforations have worse audiometric thresholds at lower frequencies (500Hz).

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^2ad8bc86]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 — abbreviations and definitions of common terms — defines tympanostomy tube insertion, otitis media categories, and related ear findings with explicit thresholds. Tympanostomy tube insertion is surgical placement through a myringotomy for temporary middle ear ventilation, and tubes generally last several months to several years, with synonyms including ventilation tubes, pressure equalization (PE) tubes, grommets (UK), and bilateral myringotomy and tubes (BMT). Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) is OME persisting for 3 months or longer from onset or diagnosis. Persistent acute otitis media (AOM) includes relapse of AOM within 1 month after completing antibiotics, and when 2 episodes of otitis media occur within 1 month it may be difficult to distinguish recurrence from persistence. AOM is the rapid onset of middle-ear inflammation diagnosed by a distinctly bulging tympanic membrane with a middle ear effusion; OME is fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of AOM, and middle ear effusion (MEE) refers to fluid in the middle ear often from OME and during or after AOM. Tympanostomy tube otorrhea is discharge from the middle ear through the tube, a retraction pocket is a collapsed area of the tympanic membrane with sharp demarcation, and a tympanogram is an objective measure of tympanic membrane vibration and pressure, with a flat tracing if the middle ear is filled with fluid and a peak shifted based on pressure (left if negative, right if positive).
