## Question

guidelines for staph aureus bacteremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guidelines for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, preserving natural self-verification and any initial mistakes with corrections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate recognition and empiric therapy. Then, I should verify source control priorities. Next, I will review diagnostic evaluation for endocarditis and metastatic foci. After that, I need to confirm pathogen-directed definitive therapy and dosing. Then, I will examine duration of therapy and the complicated versus uncomplicated paradigm. I should also consider special populations, adjunctive therapies, and follow-up strategies. Finally, I will integrate quality improvement and acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps to keep the plan realistic and evidence-based.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment and empiric therapy steps. S. aureus bacteremia carries high morbidity and mortality, so I need to ensure rapid recognition and early effective therapy; empiric coverage should be tailored to local MRSA prevalence and sepsis risk, with vancomycin or daptomycin for MRSA risk and an antistaphylococcal β-lactam for MSSA risk, while avoiding unnecessary MRSA coverage in low-risk settings per sepsis guidance, and I should double-check that therapy is initiated within the first hour when sepsis is suspected to optimize outcomes [^116U5Z6z] [^113f1bRa] [^115nMZR7].

> Wait, let me verify source control because delays here drive failure. I need to check for and promptly remove infected intravascular devices, especially central venous catheters implicated in S. aureus bacteremia, as failure to remove is strongly associated with persistent bacteremia, relapse, and complications. For tunneled dialysis catheters, over-the-wire exchange may be considered in select contexts, but I should confirm that many guidelines still favor removal for S. aureus given relapse risk, and I must not forget to drain abscesses or debride necrotic tissue when present [^115moQ7J] [^111cbnRs] [^1167w7DV].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup for endocarditis and metastatic infection. Hold on, I should verify the echocardiography strategy: IDSA recommends echocardiography for all adults with SAB, with TEE preferred when TTE is negative but suspicion remains or when prosthetic material is present. However, emerging data suggest that in carefully selected low-risk patients, a normal TTE combined with low-risk features may obviate TEE, so I need to ensure I apply risk stratification thoughtfully rather than reflexively ordering TEE for everyone [^114dLHwr] [^1142JcY6] [^114j5fRd].

> I will now examine the role of follow-up blood cultures and imaging for metastatic foci. I should confirm that repeat blood cultures are obtained every 48–72 hours until clearance, as persistent bacteremia beyond 48–72 hours is a key predictor of complicated disease and should trigger extension of therapy and intensified evaluation; for suspected metastatic infection, 18F-FDG PET/CT can change management in a meaningful subset, but I need to weigh availability and pretest probability, and in children, I should remember that echocardiography is reserved for those with congenital heart disease, persistent bacteremia, or clinical suspicion of endocarditis rather than routine for all [^114QicJa] [^113TWxmn] [^114kCttQ].

> Let me think about definitive antimicrobial therapy once susceptibilities return. For MSSA, I should preferentially use an antistaphylococcal β-lactam such as nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin, and I need to ensure I avoid glycopeptide monotherapy for MSSA when possible given inferior outcomes. For MRSA, vancomycin or daptomycin are appropriate, and I should double-check vancomycin dosing and monitoring to target an AUC/MIC of 400–600 mg·h/L using Bayesian or steady-state methods rather than relying on troughs to minimize nephrotoxicity and maximize efficacy [^115nMZR7] [^114tyGbM] [^112QWv3D] [^112UvoTZ].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing nuances and alternatives. Daptomycin should be dosed at 6 mg/kg IV daily for bacteremia, with consideration of higher doses up to 8–10 mg/kg for persistent bacteremia or elevated MICs, and I need to monitor for treatment-emergent nonsusceptibility. Ceftaroline is a reasonable alternative in refractory cases or when first-line agents are unsuitable, though I should confirm local susceptibility patterns and the limited randomized evidence base for SAB [^114abrBA] [^1156vTRT].

> I need to ensure I classify disease correctly to guide duration. Uncomplicated SAB is generally defined by absence of endocarditis or metastatic infection, negative follow-up cultures by 48–72 hours, and rapid clinical response; complicated SAB includes endocarditis, persistent bacteremia beyond 48–72 hours, prosthetic material, or metastatic foci, and I should double-check that using risk factors alone to label "complicated" can misclassify patients and lead to unnecessary prolonged therapy, so I must integrate clinical evolution and objective findings rather than risk-factor checklists alone [^116wHVJg] [^117MdQB6] [^111AgSEL].

> Let me reconsider duration recommendations and the evidence behind them. For uncomplicated SAB, 2 weeks of IV therapy after documented clearance is standard, but wait, I should verify that the evidence base is surprisingly limited; recent systematic reviews have not demonstrated clear mortality differences between shorter and longer courses, suggesting that carefully selected patients may do well with shorter durations, whereas complicated SAB generally warrants 4–6 weeks, with endocarditis typically requiring 6 weeks and bone/joint infections individualized to 4–6 weeks depending on surgical management and clinical response [^115NBYVf] [^114nPDQk] [^111C3TfD].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has unique device-related issues. In pediatrics, I should confirm that echocardiography is not routine for all and is reserved for those with congenital heart disease, persistent bacteremia, or clinical suspicion; for osteoarticular infections, IV therapy is standard with transition to oral after clinical improvement in select cases, and for PICC-associated thrombus with SAB, practice varies widely, so I need to individualize duration and consider anticoagulation per local protocols while ensuring source control and follow-up cultures [^114kCttQ] [^111BLdS5] [^115R9Mez].

> Next, I should review adjunctive therapies and when they are indicated. Rifampin is recommended for prosthetic valve or prosthetic joint infections, typically in combination with a backbone agent, but I should confirm that the evidence base is limited and that some guidelines still endorse its use in these settings. The role of adjunctive clindamycin for toxin suppression remains controversial and is being tested in the SNAP adaptive platform trial, so I should avoid routine use outside of trials or specific toxin-mediated syndromes [^111C3TfD] [^113V2R7U] [^111hkjyp].

> I will now examine follow-up and response monitoring. I should double-check that blood cultures are repeated every 48–72 hours until clearance, that clinical response is reassessed at 72 hours, and that any persistent bacteremia beyond 3–4 days should prompt re-evaluation of source control, susceptibilities, and therapy; infectious diseases consultation improves adherence to these processes and is associated with better outcomes, so I need to ensure early ID involvement and structured communication with the treating team [^115FgAxw] [^111ZNYzW].

> Let me verify quality improvement levers that meaningfully change outcomes. Implementation of bundled interventions that enforce source control, appropriate β-lactam therapy for MSSA, timely echocardiography, follow-up cultures, and guideline-concordant durations improves adherence and reduces mortality, and real-time stewardship tools and order sets can sustain these gains, though I should acknowledge that even high adherence to quality indicators may not fully mitigate mortality when patient-level risk is high, underscoring the need for comprehensive care [^114yAKKb] [^117E8XyX] [^112Kb69A].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal standards. There remains substantial global practice variation in antibiotic choice, use of rifampin, oral step-down practices, imaging strategies, and definitions of persistent bacteremia, reflecting limited high-quality randomized data. Ongoing adaptive platform trials like SNAP aim to address these gaps, so I should remain open to evolving evidence and document my rationale when deviating from local protocols [^114VkSSW] [^115ZhmxN] [^113V2R7U].

> Finally, I should confirm that my documentation captures the essentials: source identification and control actions, echocardiography results and rationale, clearance of bacteremia, classification of complicated versus uncomplicated disease, and the final antibiotic plan with duration and monitoring, as clear discharge communication supports continuity and early detection of relapses or complications [^115moQ7J].

---

Current guidelines for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) emphasize **early source control** [^114yAKKb] and **ID consultation** [^115fnow2] as core elements of care. For MSSA, use a **β-lactam** (nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin) [^11291DFi]; for MRSA, use vancomycin or daptomycin [^116g3NZp]. All adults require **echocardiography** [^114dLHwr] (TTE, with TEE if TTE is negative but suspicion remains) to exclude endocarditis [^113s2xZF]. Treat uncomplicated SAB for 14 days after the first negative culture; complicated SAB requires 4–6 weeks, with longer courses for endocarditis or prosthetic material [^114QicJa]. Obtain follow-up blood cultures every 48–72 hours until clearance [^115fnow2], and tailor therapy to clinical response and complications [^115fnow2].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain at least two sets from different venipuncture sites before initiating antibiotics, if feasible [^notfound].

- **Clinical assessment**: Identify the source of infection (e.g. catheter, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, skin/soft tissue) [^113Aray5].

- **Risk stratification**: Assess for complications, including endocarditis, metastatic infections, prosthetic material, and persistent bacteremia [^117MdQB6].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns** and patient-specific factors [^115hGc1Z] [^116U5Z6z]. For MSSA, initiate a **β-lactam** (nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin) [^115nMZR7]; for MRSA or when MRSA risk is high, use vancomycin or daptomycin [^116U5Z6z] [^116g3NZp].

---

## Definitive antibiotic therapy

Definitive therapy should be tailored to **susceptibilities** [^116yn9zF]:

| **Pathogen** | **First-line therapy** | **Alternative therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| MSSA | - Nafcillin <br/> - Oxacillin <br/> - Cefazolin | - Vancomycin <br/> - Daptomycin <br/> - Linezolid |
| MRSA | - Vancomycin <br/> - Daptomycin | - Linezolid <br/> - Ceftaroline <br/> - Telavancin |

---

Vancomycin dosing should target an **AUC/MIC of 400–600** [^112QWv3D]; monitor trough levels or use Bayesian methods to guide dosing and minimize nephrotoxicity [^115fnow2].

---

## Duration of therapy

- **Uncomplicated SAB**: 14 days after the first negative blood culture, provided there is no evidence of endocarditis or metastatic infection [^114QicJa].

- **Complicated SAB**: 4–6 weeks, particularly in cases of endocarditis, prosthetic material, or metastatic infections [^114Nmb4q].

- **Endocarditis**: Minimum of 6 weeks of therapy, often longer depending on clinical response and surgical interventions [^111C3TfD].

---

## Source control

Source control is essential and should be pursued promptly [^114yAKKb]. Remove infected intravascular catheters or devices; drain abscesses or empyemas; and consider surgical intervention for deep-seated infections or prosthetic material [^113Aray5].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **Echocardiography**: Perform TTE for all patients with SAB; if TTE is negative but clinical suspicion for endocarditis remains, perform TEE [^117KWHjN].

- **PET/CT**: Consider in persistent bacteremia or when metastatic infection is suspected [^113TWxmn].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **repeat blood cultures** every 48–72 hours until clearance [^114yAKKb], with clinical monitoring for response, complications, and relapse. Infectious diseases consultation is recommended for all patients with SAB to optimize management and outcomes [^115FgAxw].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Use cefazolin or nafcillin for MSSA; vancomycin or daptomycin for MRSA. Echocardiography is recommended for children with congenital heart disease, persistent bacteremia, or clinical suspicion of endocarditis [^114kCttQ].

- **Patients with prosthetic material**: Prolonged therapy (4–6 weeks) and consideration of adjunctive rifampin are recommended [^111C3TfD].

- **Persistent bacteremia**: Re-evaluate source control, consider alternative antibiotics (e.g. daptomycin, ceftaroline), and assess for complications [^116g3NZp].

---

## Quality indicators and outcomes

Key quality indicators include **early source control**, appropriate antibiotic selection and duration, echocardiography, and ID consultation [^1172oSYj]. Adherence to these indicators is associated with improved outcomes, including reduced mortality and recurrence [^114yAKKb].

---

## Controversies and gaps in current guidelines

- **Optimal duration of therapy**: Evidence for 14-day therapy in uncomplicated SAB is limited; ongoing studies may refine recommendations [^115NBYVf].

- **Role of adjunctive therapies**: The use of adjunctive agents (e.g. rifampin, clindamycin) remains controversial and is being studied in ongoing trials [^113V2R7U].

- **Oral step-down therapy**: Limited evidence supports early switch to oral therapy in select patients; further research is needed [^111eaKkV].

---

Current SAB guidelines emphasize **early source control**, appropriate antibiotic selection, and structured monitoring, with therapy individualized to clinical response and complications.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^112px728]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

The current study illustrates the potential of using social media to understand global treatment practices and decision making. Although previous studies on physicians' management of SAB have been conducted, none were as extensive and on a global scale as this current study. Our study has several limitations. There were relatively low participation rates from South America and Africa. The respondents were not questioned about their local guideline and adherence to it, and for many countries no national guidelines were available. This made it impossible for us to consider the role of national guidelines in the present study. Given the fact that 71 countries were included in the survey, comparing differences between each of these countries was methodologically infeasible. Therefore, we limited the analyses to continents. We were unable to evaluate spatial clustering of infections. The survey was only available in English, which might have dissuaded non-English speaking physicians. Because the survey was distributed through listservs and social media, the exact number of recipients or proportion of physicians per country is unknown. Therefore, the true response rate is uncertain and could only be estimated by the ratio of the reported surveys and the number of times the URL link was opened. Finally, because it was impossible to control who filled out the survey, respondents theoretically could have been non-physicians or could have completed the survey multiple times. However, because there was no incentive in responding, and we did not discover any nonsensical answers, this seems unlikely. Overall, the advantage of receiving feedback from over 2000 specialists from all over the world outweighs the potential disadvantages of the use of social media platforms.

### Low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients Do not require routine diagnostic imaging: a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study [^114QicJa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study at 7 hospitals in the Netherlands. We obtained approval from the research ethics boards of all hospital sites.

All adults with low-risk SAB (see definition below) between January 2013 and December 2022 were eligible for inclusion. Supplementary Table A provides exact time periods per hospital.

Exclusion criteria were aged < 18 years, death or deemed suitable for palliative care ≤ 72 hours after the index blood culture, contaminated or polymicrobial blood cultures, or immediate transfer to another hospital. If follow-up blood cultures were missing, we considered them to be negative. Blood cultures were considered contaminated when S. aureus grew in only 1 blood culture bottle, the cultures were documented as contaminated by the treating physician or clinical microbiologist, no antibiotic treatment was initiated, and no relapse of S. aureus bacteremia occurred. Follow-up was 90 days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment to determine infection-related mortality, all-cause mortality, and relapse. Infection-related mortality was assessed as previously described.

Low-Risk SAB

Low-risk SAB was defined as 1 or more blood cultures positive for S. aureus in the absence of all of the following risk factors: community acquisition, implanted prosthetic material (vascular and intracardiac prostheses [except for coronary artery stents], prosthetic joints, and osteosynthesis material), failure to remove central venous catheter (CVC), positive blood cultures more than 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics with in vitro susceptibility to the isolated S. aureus (appropriate treatment), fever (≥ 38°C) more than 72 hours after initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment, treatment delay (signs of infection for more than 48 hours before initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment), and clinical signs of metastatic infection (Supplementary Table B).

SAB Management

The Dutch national guideline provides recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of SAB patients. Clinical microbiologists are required to report all S. aureus blood culture results to the treating physician promptly, ideally within 4 hours. Follow-up blood cultures are recommended every 48 hours until negative. Bedside consultation by an infectious diseases (ID) physician should be standard care for all patients with SAB. The guideline recommends a TTE in all patients. Patients with uncomplicated SAB should be treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for 2 weeks after initial negative blood cultures. We considered 14 ± 4 days of antibiotics appropriate, given the variation in prescription practices between hospitals. In patients with metastatic infection, antibiotic treatment for 4–6 weeks, depending on focus of infection, is required.

### Does adjunctive clindamycin have a role in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia? A protocol for the adjunctive treatment domain of the Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) randomized controlled trial [^111hkjyp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The SNAP trial provides the opportunity to inform best practice and clinical care worldwide in the use of adjunctive clindamycin (or lincomycin) for all SAB. The available sample size is substantially larger than in any clinical trial for SAB to date, with recruitment progressing on target, and the study design provides early opportunities to discover either benefit or harm, through iterative scheduled analyses after every 500 participants reach the primary outcome.

In contrast to the presumed benefits of adjunctive treatment with clindamycin, other in vitro models have suggested possible drug interactions that diminish the efficacy of the backbone β-lactam antibiotics for SAB treatment. In vitro data addressing drug interactions for the treatment of SAB suggest that clindamycin in combination with a cell wall–active antibacterial agent may result in diminished clearance efficacy of antibiotics against S. aureus, but there are no supporting in vivo or clinical trial data for this. The SNAP trial provides the opportunity to answer this question definitively, with the additional benefit of including all susceptibility phenotypes of SAB in the same clinical trial, thus answering the question concerning PSSA, MSSA, and MRSA to inform clinicians caring for patients globally.

The choice of dose and duration of clindamycin for the adjunctive domain was clinically derived, using experience to balance possible adverse effects with optimal dosing, the shortest duration thought by clinicians to have an effect, and the available in vitro evidence and guidelines. Alternatives considered include the higher dose recommended in the UK and French guidelines (900 mg); shorter duration of 3 days, per the hollow-fiber models; and longer duration of 7 days, per the CASSETTE trial. Future studies within the SNAP adjunctive domain may be able to test these alternative approaches.

The SNAP trial started recruitment in February 2022 and has recruited 2319 platform participants as of 26 March 2024 (Figure 1). Of the 2319 platform participants, 1994 (86%) have been enrolled in the adjunctive clindamycin domain, making it the best recruiting domain within the SNAP trial. Despite strong recruitment and clinician equipoise, a minority of sites have elected not to participate in this domain due to concerns with increased risk of C. difficile toxin production, though some of these sites have gone on to activate this adjunctive domain.

### Factors associated with recurrence and mortality in central line-associated bloodstream infections: a retrospective cohort study [^115ruEPe]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found that increased age, increased SOFA score, and shorter antimicrobial treatment duration were all associated with earlier mortality or recurrence in patients with HA-CLABSIs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine factors associated with time to recurrence or mortality in patients with central line infections.

Current antimicrobial treatment duration guidelines for CLABSIs range from 5 to 7 days for uncomplicated coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infections in which the causative line is removed, to 6 weeks for complicated Staphylococcus aureus infections, with wide variation depending on patient and central line characteristics and causative organisms, although in most cases the guidelines recommend between 7 and 14 days of antimicrobial treatment. We found an apparent plateauing of the benefit of prolonged antimicrobial treatment after about 15 days. We did not have enough patients to compare outcomes among individual classes of causative organisms, so this study should not, by itself, change current treatment guidelines. Instead, the significant association between shorter antimicrobial treatment duration and the primary outcome, which was robust and consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses, should be explored further in other, larger cohorts.

Guidelines recommend 2 to 6 weeks of antibiotics for most patients with Staphylococcus aureus CLABSIs, a longer course than that recommended for CLABSIs caused by other organisms. A sensitivity analysis excluding Staphylococcus aureus CLABSIs did not change the association of antimicrobial treatment duration with the primary outcome, suggesting that Staphylococcus aureus was not the primary driver of this association. Moreover, the presence of high-risk organisms, which included Staphylococcus aureus, was not associated with the primary outcome.

While not specific to central line infections, Chotiprasitsakul et al. recently published a propensity score matched study of Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia with similar methodology to ours, finding no association between a longer (11–16 days) versus a shorter (6–10 days) duration of antibiotics and 30-day mortality. Several differences between the studies may account for the disparate results. Chotiprasitsakul et al. limited their study to patients with Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia who received between 6 and 16 days of antibiotics, whereas ours included only patients with HA-CLABSIs, but with a broader range of causative organisms and with any antimicrobial treatment duration. Some organisms in our study, such as Staphylococcus aureus, may require more prolonged antimicrobial treatment. Although our study did not demonstrate this, it was underpowered to analyze organisms individually. Finally, our study analyzed antimicrobial duration as a continuous variable instead of categorizing it into long or short duration, increasing our power to detect an association with outcomes.

### Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, Australia [^115UEPE2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Substantial illness and increased medical costs are also associated with staphylococcal bacteremia. S. aureus bacteremia is often related to serious infections, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. It frequently results in prolonged hospital admission and increased costs. In hospital H, the average length of stay for patients with S. aureus bacteremia was 26.5 days. In South Australia, the estimated additional cost of each episode of hospital-acquired S. aureus infection was $22,000 in 1998. Nationally, these South Australian costs translate to additional hospital costs of ≈$150 million dollars ($22,000 x 6,900 episodes).

Treatment of S. aureus infections is complicated by the high prevalence of antimicrobial drug resistance. Although this has long been the case with multiresistant strains of MRSA in hospitals, the spread of hospital strains into the community, as well as the emergence of unique strains of MRSA unrelated to health care, have made this an issue of general importance. At least 3 community strains of MRSA are currently circulating in Australia. Two of these 3 community strains carry the gene for Panton-Valentine leukocidin, which is associated with subcutaneous abscess formation and necrotizing pneumonia. A number of reports have already highlighted the clinical impact of infection due to these strains (,–). Surveillance data show that their prevalence is increasing in our capital cities, but the situation in rural Australia is not well documented. This increase will inevitably affect guidelines for empirical antimicrobial drug prescribing for staphylococcal infections and for patients in the community with suspected SAB. Further surveillance of staphylococcal infections, including bacteremia, is warranted to guide recommendations for empirical therapy and infection control interventions.

### Make modern microbiology matter more in the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of infective endocarditis [^115NhkzD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The ESC 2023 diagnostic criteria for IE do not make use of the improvements in species determination of bacteria, in particular, streptococci, that have occurred since the first publication of the Duke criteria in 1994. For example, it has become evident that patients with bacteremia with streptococci of the mutans, bovis, or sanguinis groups often have IE, whereas patients with bacteremia caused by anginosus group streptococci rarely have IE. In addition, several pathogens are not mentioned in the ESC 2023 diagnostic criteria despite having a propensity similar to that of Staphylococcus aureus or "oral streptococci" to cause IE. Such bacterial genera and species include Abiotrophia, Aerococcus, Corynebacterium striatum, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and these should all be regarded as typical pathogens. Some of these pathogens are recognized as typical IE pathogens in the Duke–ISCVID criteria.

An entire section (5.3.1) of the ESC guidelines describes standard blood culture practices, which is of limited interest to the clinician and of no use for laboratory personnel. In particular, the guidelines recommend drawing blood cultures at a 30-minute interval, referring to Lamy et al. This reference states that "a 30–60 min interval between samples has been arbitrarily recommended" and that "Li et al (1994) found no difference in blood culture yield whether samples were collected within a 24-h period, either simultaneously or serially", which does not support the recommendation of continued use of the arbitrary sampling interval. It is very impractical to wait between blood cultures, and such a recommendation necessitates firm evidence, which is lacking. What is not mentioned but would have been useful for the reader of the guidelines is that a short time to blood culture positivity in S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia is associated with increased risk of IE; positive blood cultures drawn at 48–72 hours after the initiation of antibiotic treatment is associated with increased likelihood of IE; and Cutibacterium acnes, a not uncommon cause of prosthesis valve IE, grows slowly; therefore, incubation is longer than the standard 120 hours, increasing the likelihood of finding this pathogen.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^111RFxV6]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

From January to February 2017, we distributed a 7-question, electronic, vignette-based survey (Supplementary Data,) of clinical scenarios related to the management of SAB in children to PID providers in the Emerging Infections Network of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA EIN).

The survey questions explored diagnostic and treatment practices of providers for patients with osteomyelitis-associated SAB, nonpersistent SAB (< 48 h), persistent MRSA bacteremia, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)-associated thrombosis with SAB, and parenteral treatment of choice for MSSA bacteremia.

Demographic information regarding practice region, experience, and employment was collected by EIN membership profile. Similar to previous EIN surveys, the response rate was calculated from PID EIN members who had ever responded to a survey. Descriptive statistics were calculated as percentages for each response category.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of endocarditis [^113s2xZF]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to TTE, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining echocardiography in patients with S. aureus, E. faecalis, and some Streptococcus species bacteremia.

### Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: an update on new therapeutic approaches [^116g3NZp]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin and daptomycin are options for the initial treatment of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia.

### Impact of an evidence-based bundle intervention in the quality-of-care management and outcome of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^114yAKKb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several aspects of clinical management have been shown to have significant impact on prognosis. The objective of the study was to identify evidence-based quality-of-care indicators (QCIs) for the management of SAB, and to evaluate the impact of a QCI-based bundle on the management and prognosis of SAB.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature to identify QCIs in the management of SAB was performed. Then, the impact of a bundle including selected QCIs was evaluated in a quasi-experimental study in 12 tertiary Spanish hospitals. The main and secondary outcome variables were adherence to QCIs and mortality. Specific structured individualized written recommendations on 6 selected evidence-based QCIs for the management of SAB were provided.

Results

A total of 287 and 221 patients were included in the preintervention and intervention periods, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, the intervention was independently associated with improved adherence to follow-up blood cultures (odds ratio [OR], 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78–4.49), early source control (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 2.12–9.79), early intravenous cloxacillin for methicillin-susceptible isolates (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.15–2.78), and appropriate duration of therapy (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.24–3.64). The intervention was independently associated with a decrease in 14-day and 30-day mortality (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, .26-.85 and OR, 0.56; 95% CI, .34-.93, respectively).

Conclusions

A bundle orientated to improving adherence to evidence-based QCIs improved the management of patients with SAB and was associated with reduced mortality.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^11291DFi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN TREATMENT OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BACTEREMIA OR INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS

ASSURE Study

A phase 2, multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telavancin for the treatment of adult patients with uncomplicated SAB. Patients were randomized to receive either telavancin (10 mg/kg IV q24h) or standard therapy (vancomycin 1 g IV q12h or antistaphylococcal penicillin [nafcillin 2 g IV q6h, oxacillin 2 g IV q6h, or cloxacillin 2 g IV q6h]) for 14 days (blinded dose adjustment of vancomycin was permitted per site-specific guidelines). The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure at day 84, defined as resolution of clinical symptoms/signs associated with bacteremia, no evidence of metastatic complications, all cultures negative for S. aureus after qualifying blood cultures, and no nonstudy systemic antistaphylococcal medication to which the baseline pathogen was susceptible.

Of 60 patients randomized to telavancin or standard therapy, 58 received 1 or more doses of study medication (n = 29 in each group). The key analysis populations included the all-treated target population (ATT; patients who received 1 or more doses of study medication and fulfilled inclusion/exclusion and continuation criteria [telavancin, n = 15; standard therapy, n = 16]) and the clinically evaluable population (patients in the ATT population who received 12–16 days of study medication and whose study participation did not deviate from the protocol by more than prespecified limits [telavancin, 8; standard therapy, 9]). Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 ATT treatment groups. All baseline isolates of S. aureus (MRSA and MSSA) available for testing were vancomycin susceptible (≤ 1 µg/mL). Sixteen patients in the telavancin group and 12 patients in the standard therapy group discontinued study medication early. The most common reason for failing to meet continuation criteria was identification of complicated bacteremia (positive follow-up blood cultures).

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^112QWv3D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent clinical data on vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest a reevaluation of current dosing and monitoring recommendations. The previous 2009 vancomycin consensus guidelines recommend trough monitoring as a surrogate marker for the target area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). However, recent data suggest that trough monitoring is associated with higher nephrotoxicity. This document is an executive summary of the new vancomycin consensus guidelines for vancomycin dosing and monitoring. It was developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists vancomycin consensus guidelines committee. These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400–600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

### What risk of endocarditis is low enough to justify the omission of transoesophageal echocardiography in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia? A narrative review [^115HbDFW]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recent criteria which can identify patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) who are at very low risk of endocarditis raise the question of whether transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is appropriate for these patients.

Aims

To estimate the probability of occult endocarditis complicating SAB below which a TOE-guided treatment strategy no longer offers the best 180-day survival, and to examine the key uncertainties affecting this result.

Sources

Estimates of the parameters required to calculate the Pauker-Kassirer testing threshold were identified from studies published prior to 1 June 2017 using a composite search strategy that involved a systematic search for relevant controlled trials and guidelines, followed by a non-systematic iterative search of the observational literature.

Content

Estimates of the necessary parameters were generally consistent across the literature with the exception of the procedural mortality of TOE. In our base-case scenario (TOE mortality 0.1%), the testing threshold for TOE in apparently uncomplicated SAB was a 1.1% probability of occult endocarditis. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the procedural mortality of TOE was a key uncertainty affecting estimates of the testing threshold.

Implications

None of the available clinical tools can place patients with SAB below this probability of endocarditis with 95% confidence. Future work in this area should concentrate on improving the precision of these tools and on exploring the value of alternative echocardiography strategies. In addition, a better understanding of the harms of TOE is required to ensure that recommendations regarding the role of this investigation in the management of patients with SAB are appropriate.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^111oFPib]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 2229 individual survey responses were obtained. The URL link was opened 5679 times (response rate 39%). Nine percent (198/2229) of records were removed from the analyses because of completion of ≤ 1 questions (88/2229, 4%) or not entering the country of practice (110/2229, 5%). No non-targeted responses were identified. The remaining survey records of 2031 respondents from 71 different countries on 6 continents (North America [701, 35%], Europe [573, 28%], Asia [409, 20%], Oceania [182, 9%], South America [124, 6%], and Africa [42, 2%]) were included in the analysis (Figure 1). Respondents stated they were physicians in adult infectious diseases (74%), clinical microbiology (10%), internal medicine (6%), and pediatric infectious diseases (5%). Thirteen percent of respondents were still in training, and 44% had been registered as a consultant for more than 10 years.

Global distribution of survey respondents. Respondents per country: 71 unique countries participated, and participation ranged from 1 to 654 respondents per country.

Antimicrobial Management of SAB

Antibiotic treatment for SAB differed significantly between continents (Figure 2). For MSSA bacteremia, cefazolin was the first-choice antibiotic treatment in North America (78% of respondents), whereas anti-staphylococcal penicillins were preferred in all other continents (51%–82%; P < .01) (Figure 2 A). For MRSA bacteremia, vancomycin was the preferred first-choice antibiotic agent in all continents, but with a broad range of 53%–97% of respondents. Daptomycin was identified as the first-choice antibiotic agent for MRSA bacteremia in 23% of European respondents but in < 10% of respondents of all other continents (Figure 2 B; P < .01 for all comparisons above.)

### Use of transthoracic echocardiography in the management of low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: results from a retrospective multicenter cohort study [^1142JcY6]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model to identify patients with low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), in whom infective endocarditis (IE) can be ruled out based on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

Background

S. aureus is a major cause of bacteremia and often leads to IE. Current guidelines recommend performing transesophageal echocardiography on all patients or treating all patients empirically with prolonged intravenous antibiotics; however, this approach is resource intensive, many physicians do not adhere to guidelines, and recent studies suggest that low-risk patients may not require transesophageal echocardiography.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 833 consecutive hospitalized patients with SAB from 7 academic and community hospitals in Toronto, Canada, over a 3-year period (2007 to 2010). Patients who received a TTE within 28 days of bacteremia (n = 536) were randomly divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine high-risk criteria for IE in the derivation cohort, and criteria were then applied to the validation cohort to determine diagnostic properties.

Results

Four high-risk criteria predicted IE: indeterminate or positive TTE (p < 0.001), community-acquired bacteremia (p = 0.034), intravenous drug use (p < 0.001), and high-risk cardiac condition (p < 0.004). In the validation cohort, the presence of any 1 of the high-risk criteria had 97% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87% to 100%) and 99% negative predictive value (95% CI: 96% to 100%) for IE. The negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95% CI: 0.007 to 0.35).

Conclusions

A normal TTE ruled out IE in patients without community-acquired SAB, high-risk cardiac conditions, and intravenous drug use. This study provides evidence that clinical risk stratification combined with a normal TTE may be adequate to rule out IE in most patients with SAB.

### Contemporary management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia-controversies in clinical practice [^111SQUPW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) carries a high risk for excess morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, significant practice variation continues to permeate clinical management of this syndrome. Since the publication of the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, the field of SAB has evolved with the emergence of newer diagnostic strategies and therapeutic options. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of SAB, with special focus on areas where the highest level of evidence is lacking to inform best practices.

### Does adjunctive clindamycin have a role in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia? A protocol for the adjunctive treatment domain of the Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) randomized controlled trial [^113V2R7U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The use of adjunctive antibiotics directed against exotoxin production in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is widespread, and it is recommended in many guidelines, but this is based on limited evidence. Existing guidelines are based on the theoretical premise of toxin suppression, as many strains of S. aureus produce toxins such as leukocidins (eg, Panton-Valentine leukocidin, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, exfoliative toxins, and various enterotoxins). Many clinicians therefore believe that limiting exotoxin production release by S. aureus could reduce its virulence and improve clinical outcomes. Clindamycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotic, is commonly used for this purpose. We report the domain-specific protocol, embedded in a large adaptive, platform trial, seeking to definitively answer this question.

Methods and Analysis

The Staphylococcus aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) trial is a pragmatic, randomized, multicenter adaptive platform trial that aims to compare different SAB therapies, simultaneously, for 90-day mortality rates. The adjunctive treatment domain aims to test the effectiveness of adjunctive antibiotics, initially comparing clindamycin to no adjunctive antibiotic, but future adaptations may include other agents. Individuals will be randomized to receive either 5 days of adjunctive clindamycin (or lincomycin) or no adjunctive antibiotic therapy alongside standard-of-care antibiotics. Most participants with SAB (within 72 hours of index blood culture and with no contraindications) will be eligible to participate in this domain. Prespecified analyses are defined in the statistical appendix to the core protocol, and domain-specific secondary analyses will be adjusted for resistance to clindamycin, disease phenotype (complicated or uncomplicated SAB) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin–positive isolate.

### Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: new therapeutic approaches [^1156vTRT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

This article reviews recent clinical evidence for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Vancomycin remains the initial antibiotic of choice for the treatment of patients with MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis due to isolates with vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration ≤ 2 μg/mL, whereas daptomycin is an effective alternative, and ceftaroline seems promising. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis.

### Staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters: is over-the-wire exchange an appropriate management option? [^1167w7DV]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Over-the-wire exchange of tunneled dialysis catheters is the standard of care per K/DOQI guidelines for treating catheter-related bacteremia. However, Gram-positive bacteremia, specifically with staphylococcus species, may compromise over-the-wire exchange due to certain biological properties. This study addressed the effectiveness of over-the-wire exchange of staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters compared with non-staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters.

Methods

Patients who received over-the-wire exchange of their tunneled dialysis catheter due to documented or suspected bacteremia were identified from a QA database. Study patients (n = 61) had positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or coagulase-negative staphylococcus not otherwise specified. Control patients (n = 35) received over-the-wire exchange of their tunneled dialysis catheter due to infection with any organism besides staphylococcus. Overall catheter survival and catheter survival among staphylococcal species were assessed.

Results

There was no difference in tunneled dialysis catheter survival between study and control groups (P = 0.46). Median survival time was 96 days for study catheters and 51 days for controls; survival curves were closely superimposed. There also was no difference among the three staphylococcal groups in terms of catheter survival (P = 0.31). The median time until catheter removal was 143 days for SE, 67 days for CNS, and 88 days for SA-infected catheters.

Conclusions

There is no significant difference in tunneled dialysis catheter survival between over-the-wire exchange of staphylococcus-infected tunneled dialysis catheters and those infected with other organisms.

### Therapeutic options for adult patients with persistent methicillin-susceptibleBacteremia: a narrative review [^116JxcCZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies used in the management of persistent methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia.

Data Sources

A literature search using the PubMed database (inception to December 2022) was conducted using the search terms " Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", "methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", "persistent methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", and "refractory methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia ". In addition, therapeutic agents which could be used as treatment for MSSA including "nafcillin", "oxacillin", "cefazolin", "ceftaroline", "gentamicin", "rifampin", and "daptomycin" were also combined with the aforementioned search terms to capture data using these agents.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Clinical data were limited to those published in the English language. Articles and abstracts were considered for inclusion in addition to ongoing trials identified through ClinicalTrials.gov.

Data Synthesis

A total of 78 articles were reviewed including 17 in vitro or animal model studies and 39 studies including patient data. The remaining 22 articles included guidelines, review articles, and editorials. Recent data evaluating use of dual β-lactam regimens for persistent MSSA bacteremia were limited to 8 case reports or case series.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

At present, there is little guidance on how to best manage patients with persistent MSSA bacteremia. This narrative review collates the available data to assist clinicians in selecting the best possible antimicrobial regimen when facing this clinical conundrum.

Conclusions

Modification of antimicrobial therapy, in conjunction with source control and infectious diseases consultation, may all be necessary to sterilize blood cultures in patients with persistent MSSA bacteremia.

### Low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients Do not require routine diagnostic imaging: a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study [^113F8RB6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Stratification to categorize patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) as low or high risk for metastatic infection may direct diagnostic evaluation and enable personalized management. We investigated the frequency of metastatic infections in low-risk SAB patients, their clinical relevance, and whether omission of routine imaging is associated with worse outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study at 7 Dutch hospitals among adult patients with low-risk SAB, defined as hospital-acquired infection without treatment delay, absence of prosthetic material, short duration of bacteremia, and rapid defervescence. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose treatment plan changed due to detected metastatic infections, as evaluated by both actual therapy administered and by linking a adjudicated diagnosis to guideline-recommended treatment. Secondary outcomes were 90-day relapse-free survival and factors associated with the performance of diagnostic imaging.

Results

Of 377 patients included, 298 (79%) underwent diagnostic imaging. In 15 of these 298 patients (5.0%), imaging findings during patient admission had been interpreted as metastatic infections that should extend treatment. Using the final adjudicated diagnosis, 4 patients (1.3%) had clinically relevant metastatic infection. In a multilevel multivariable logistic regression analysis, 90-day relapse-free survival was similar between patients without imaging and those who underwent imaging (81.0% versus 83.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.749; 95% confidence interval,.373–1.504).

Conclusions

Our study advocates risk stratification for the management of SAB patients. Prerequisites are follow-up blood cultures, bedside infectious diseases consultation, and a critical review of disease evolution. Using this approach, routine imaging could be omitted in low-risk patients.

### Impact of routine bedside infectious disease consultation on clinical management and outcome of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in adults [^111ZNYzW]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

Study setting and participants

An observational cohort study of adults with SAB was conducted at the Cambridge University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust (CUHNHFT), a tertiary-care referral centre. All first episodes of SAB in patients older than 18 years admitted between July 2006 and December 2012 were eligible for inclusion in the study. The exclusion criteria included death before blood cultures becoming positive, transfer to another hospital before the blood cultures became positive, polymicrobial cultures or positive cultures that were deemed to be contaminated.

Study procedures

On the day the blood culture became positive, the clinical microbiologist provided telephone advice to the primary clinical team. Before November 2009, patients were not routinely reviewed by the infectious diseases service; an IDC only occurred if requested by the primary clinical team, and this usually consisted of a single bedside review. For patients admitted between July 2006 and November 2009 (the pre-IDC group), data were collected retrospectively from the medical records and a national register of deaths. In November 2009, a routine bedside IDC service was introduced for all patients with SAB. In addition to the telephone advice provided by the microbiology team, patients received an initial bedside clinical review, followed by weekly clinical review by the IDC team until the time of hospital discharge. Written recommendations for investigation and management were recorded in the medical records. Data in this group were collected prospectively.

Study definitions and outcome measures

Previously defined criteria were used to determine if the source of the bacteraemia was due to soft tissue infection, intravascular (iv) catheter infection, native and prosthetic valve infective endocarditisor bone and joint infections (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). For all other foci of infection, clinical and/or radiologic and/or microbiologic evidence was used to determine the source of infection. Community-acquired, hospital-acquired and healthcare-associated infections were defined according to previously published criteria. Uncomplicated SAB was defined as negative blood culture results 2 to 4 days after the initial positive blood culture finding and/or defervescence at 72 hours, and no evidence of endocarditis, metastatic disease or deep focus of infection. Complicated SAB cases did not meet the criteria for uncomplicated infection, had an unknown focus or died within 72 hours. Recurrence was defined as blood cultures positive for S. aureus 14 days after the initial positive result. Metastatic infection was defined as a secondary site of infection distant from the primary site of infection.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Guideline compliance and clinical outcomes among patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with infectious diseases consultation in addition to antimicrobial stewardship-directed review [^115FgAxw]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Previous studies have shown infectious diseases consultation (IDC) for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) improves management and outcomes. The influence of IDC on outcomes for SAB in addition to an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) review for adult inpatients with SAB has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of IDC on SAB management with concomitant ASP review and resulting outcomes.

Methods

Adult inpatients with SAB admitted December 2012-October 2014 were included. The primary end point compared adherence to Infectious Disease Society of America guideline recommendations between patients receiving an IDC versus those not receiving an IDC. We also evaluated adherence to the individual components of the primary end point and clinical outcomes, including time to microbiologic clearance, recurrence of bacteremia, mortality, and length of stay.

Results

This study included 154 patients (115 IDC and 39 non-IDC). Guideline adherence was significantly greater in the IDC group 78% versus 46% in the non-IDC group (P < .001). Significantly more patients in the IDC group had echocardiography (91% vs 67%; P < .001) and follow-up blood cultures (92% vs 64%; P > .001). Mortality was also greater in the non-IDC group (23%) versus 5% for the IDC group (P = .001).

Conclusions

Patients with SAB receiving an IDC were more likely to receive guideline-congruent management and had significantly reduced mortality. No improvements in antibiotic choice or dosing were observed, likely a result of ASP review.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^1179u6Dk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study has certain limitations. The response rate, although acceptable for this type of survey, may lead to sampling bias, and it may not be generalizable to all PID providers. However, there was an equal distribution of responders throughout most regions of the United States, which may limit this bias. In addition, responses to vignette-based questions may be subject to response bias, and we recognize that vignettes may only approximate what is actually done in clinical practice. Finally, the anonymity of the survey is designed to allow responders to answer questions as accurately as possible; however, survey answers may not accurately reflect true practice patterns. Nevertheless, this study highlights the substantial variation in the management of children with SAB, can inform guidelines, and should guide our next steps in evaluating best practice patterns for this challenging pathogen.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^112XuLJH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Survey Development and Distribution

We conducted this study on geographic practice variation in SAB by modifying a recently developed survey that was deployed in five European countries. The modified survey was tested among an independent expert panel and adjusted where appropriate. The survey focused on unsettled aspects of the disease in clinical practice: first-choice antimicrobial agents, intravenous to oral switch of antimicrobial therapy, treatment duration, the use of 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan, and the definition of persistent SAB (Supplementary Appendix 1). When relevant, questions were provided separately for both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA bacteremia. The survey was anonymous and voluntary. Country of practice was asked to determine geographic region and subsequently respondents were grouped by continent. The survey was developed in English. Target respondents included infectious diseases, clinical microbiology and internal medicine physicians (both adults and pediatrics) treating SAB patients throughout the world. The survey was distributed through a public URL link on listservs, e-mails, Twitter, and WeChat. Respondents were asked to share the survey link with their professional network. The link was accessible between 2 November and 22 November 2022.

Ethical Approval

Given the anonymous and voluntary aspects of the survey, a declaration of exemption was issued by the institutional review board of Duke University.

Definitions

Uncomplicated bacteremia was defined as SAB that was not community-acquired, with < 48 hours of positive blood cultures under appropriate antibiotic treatment, and no signs of metastatic infections. Oral switch therapy was defined as prescribing at least part of the treatment course orally. Both definitions were provided with the relevant questions. The estimated percentage of SAB patients in whom oral switch therapy was used was defined as never or uncommonly (< 20% of SAB patients), sometimes (20%–60% of SAB patients) or frequently (> 60% of SAB patients). All questions concerning antibiotic treatment assumed that the isolate was susceptible to the drug.

### Heterogeneity in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia clinical trials complicates interpretation of findings [^1162KUp9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We systematically evaluated randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). There was intertrial heterogeneity in cohort characteristics, including bacteremia source, complicated SAB, and comorbidities. Reporting of cohort characteristics was itself variable, including bacteremia source and illness severity. Selection bias was introduced by exclusion criteria relating to comorbidities, illness severity, infection types, and source control. Mortality was lower in RCT control arms compared with observational cohorts. Differences in outcome definitions impedes meta-analysis. These issues complicate the interpretation and application of SAB RCT results. The value of these trials should be maximized by a standardized approach to recruitment, definitions, and reporting.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^112bDCcd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite being the leading cause of mortality from bloodstream infections worldwide, little is known about regional variation in treatment practices for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). The aim of this study was to identify global variation in management, diagnostics, and definitions of SAB.

Methods

During a 20-day period in 2022, physicians throughout the world were surveyed on SAB treatment practices. The survey was distributed through listservs, e-mails, and social media.

Results

In total, 2031 physicians from 71 different countries on 6 continents (North America [701, 35%], Europe [573, 28%], Asia [409, 20%], Oceania [182, 9%], South America [124, 6%], and Africa [42, 2%]) completed the survey. Management-based responses differed significantly by continent for preferred treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, use of adjunctive rifampin for prosthetic material infection, and use of oral antibiotics (P < .01 for all comparisons). The 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were most commonly used in Europe (94%) and least frequently used in Africa (13%) and North America (51%; P < .01). Although most respondents defined persistent SAB as 3–4 days of positive blood cultures, responses ranged from 2 days in 31% of European respondents to 7 days in 38% of Asian respondents (P < .01).

Conclusions

Large practice variations for SAB exist throughout the world, reflecting the paucity of high-quality data and the absence of an international standard of care for the management of SAB.

### Mortality in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia remains high despite adherence to quality indicators: secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study [^1172oSYj]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the association between compliance with previously published quality indicators (QIs) for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) and 30-day mortality.

Methods

We conducted a post hoc analysis of all adult patients with SAB who were hospitalized at a Spanish university hospital between 2013 and 2018. We evaluated the compliance with 7 QIs of SAB management (i.e. Infectious Diseases consultation, follow-up blood cultures, early source control, echocardiography, early cloxacillin or cefazolin, vancomycin monitoring, and appropriate treatment duration). The QIs compliance rate was considered good if ≥ 75% of the QIs recommended in each patient were performed. We studied the impact of different risk factors (including QIs compliance) on 30-day all-cause mortality adjusting by multivariable modeling and propensity-matched analysis.

Results

We included 441 patients with SAB. The QIs compliance rate was ≥ 75% in 361 patients (81.9%). A total of 95 patients (21.5%) died within 30 days after the index blood culture. In the multivariable model, the variables associated with 30-day mortality were: age (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0–1.1), Charlson comorbidity index (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4), persistent bacteraemia > 72 h (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 3.2–11.5), infective endocarditis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2–6.7), and SAB of unknown source (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5–7.1). We did not find an association between a global QIs compliance rate of ≥ 75% or any individual QI with 30-day mortality.

Conclusions

SAB 30-day mortality remains high despite good adherence to previously published QIs for the management of SAB. Future research should focus on additional factors to further improve SAB-related mortality.

Treatment Duration

The most commonly identified durations of therapy between geographic regions for SAB-associated syndromes were similar. Thus, the majority of respondents from each continent indicated the same duration of treatment for native valve endocarditis (6 weeks), septic arthritis (4 weeks), and spondylodiscitis (6 weeks). Despite these similarities in practice amongst the majority of practitioners across geographic regions, substantial "within-region" variation existed for these syndromes. For each infectious complication of SAB, individual respondents within each continent indicated longer and shorter durations of therapy (Figure 4).

Figure 4.
Treatment duration for S. aureus bacteremia. Percentage (count) of total respondents of the question per continent. P < .01 for comparison between continents for all categories (χ2 test).

The finding of blood cultures positive for S. aureus after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy was identified as the most important reason to extend therapy duration in SAB patients beyond 2 weeks in all continents (range: 66% in South America to 90% in North America). Immunocompromised status was identified as an indication to extend antibiotic treatment beyond 2 weeks for most North American physicians (72%) but less than half (43%) of European physicians. By contrast, community acquisition of SAB was considered a reason to extend antibiotic treatment in only 20%–41% of physicians (Table 1; P < .01 for all above mentioned comparisons between continents).

18F-FDG PET/CT Scan use

The availability, insurance coverage, and use of 18F-FDG PET/CT scans differed significantly between geographic regions (Table 1). All were highest in Europe and lowest in Africa. The direct availability of 18F-FDG PET/CT scans for SAB patients ranged from 9% in Africa and 29% in South America, to 78% in Europe. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were used for SAB patients by 94% of European, 83% of Oceanian, 61% of South American, 57% of Asian, and 51% of North American physicians (P < .01 for both above mentioned comparisons between continents). Survey respondents indicating that they ordered 18F-FDG PET/CT scans in patients with SAB were asked to specify for which indications they did so. Globally, the most important and most agreed upon indication for 18F-FDG PET/CT scan in SAB was persistent bacteremia: 62%–70% of physicians in every continent ordered 18F-FDG PET/CT scans for this indication (Supplementary Table 2; p = 0.66).

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^115nMZR7]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health concern, and, of the Gram-positive bacteria, drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a serious threat. S. aureus causes a wide range of infections commonly involving the skin, soft tissue, bone, joints, and infections associated with indwelling catheters or prosthetic devices. In addition, S. aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in industrialized nations. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia incidence has decreased over the past decade, MRSA remains associated with poorer clinical outcomes compared with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) often causes metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis (IE), septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Moreover, SAB can lead to complications such as sepsis and septic shock. Taken together, these issues make SAB particularly challenging to treat.

Choice and timing of antibacterial therapy greatly affect treatment outcomes in SAB. For SAB caused by MSSA, β-lactam therapy is considered the gold standard. For MRSA, the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend treatment with vancomycin or daptomycin. However, each antimicrobial agent has limitations. Several issues restrict the utility of vancomycin, including slow bactericidal activity, low tissue penetration, and increasing reports of resistance and failure. While daptomycin is effective against MRSA bacteremia, treatment-emergent nonsusceptibility is concerning, and evidence suggests prior vancomycin treatment may encourage daptomycin resistance in S. aureus. Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with SAB and the limitations of currently approved treatments, there is a need to identify alternative agents for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Time to effective treatment is largely dependent on pathogen identification. Delays in diagnosing and treating SAB lead to poorer clinical outcomes. Standard microbial identification techniques take between 48 and 72 h, while recently developed rapid diagnostic tests provide data within 3 h of collection. By enabling optimized antimicrobial therapy, rapid diagnostic tests may lower mortality, hospitalization, and costs. This review discusses the global incidence and prevalence, diagnostic methods, and current management strategies for SAB. We also briefly discuss another key part of MRSA infection management — prevention; however, an in depth discussion is beyond the scope of this review.

### Contemporary management of cardiac Implantable electronic device infection: the American college of cardiology COGNITO survey [^111odsM1]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

CIED infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in contemporary EP practice. Early identification and optimal management of CIED infection is pivotal in improving short- and long-term patient outcomes. Low levels of familiarity with clinical guidelines for CIED infection management and delayed referral to lead extraction has significant impact on clinical outcomes. This was evident in evaluating the patient case scenarios in the current survey. In a scenario of a pocket infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, only 65% of non-EPs and 33% of PCPs recommended complete system extraction. Even in the setting of complete device erosion, only 51% of non-EPs and 32% of PCPs recommended system extraction. Consideration for extraction was significantly higher for EPs in these scenarios. Current Heart Rhythm Society guidelines provide a Class I indication for complete system extraction in these scenarios. However, a great divide exists between recommendations and current clinical practice patterns. The surveyed clinical cases highlight a critical low level of awareness with clinical practice guidelines for management of CIED infections among non-EP cardiologists and PCPs, who are often the first point of contact for patients with device-related issues. In addition, several non-EP cardiologists in community practice implant, follow, and manage CIEDs without an involvement of an EP. The results of the current survey call for increased societal efforts to improve awareness regarding CIED infection management among non-EP cardiologists and PCPs, which in effect will lead to improved patient outcomes.

### Management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^113Aray5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis are serious infections that demand prompt clinical attention to ensure good outcomes. Of foremost importance is identifying and managing the source of infection and any associated complications. Evaluation for the presence of cardiac involvement is essential because inadequately managed S. aureus endocarditis is life threatening. Thus, physicians must aggressively negotiate treatment paths, considering whether the S. aureus bacteremia is complicated, whether foreign sources of infection should be removed or replaced, and whether surgical intervention is necessary. Selection of an antibiotic treatment is also an essential factor for optimal management. The increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections has created a tremendous demand for effective and safe antimicrobial agents other than the historic anti-MRSA agent vancomycin.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^111BLdS5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Two hundred twenty-three of 334 (67%) clinicians with a PID practice responded from the United States and Canada, most (37%) having 5–14 years of clinical experience, and the majority practicing at a university hospital (62%). Fourteen (6%) providers do not manage children with SAB and were excluded from the analysis.

Osteomyelitis-Associated Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia

For children with osteomyelitis-associated SAB showing clinical improvement shortly after initiation of antibiotics, almost all (97%) providers routinely repeat blood cultures until negative, whereas a minority routinely image the heart (29%), abdomen (3%), retina (6%), or vasculature (eg, Doppler ultrasound, 12%) (Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows the various treatment approaches taken by pediatric providers, with half (50%) treating intravenously only for those with persistent bacteremia (> 48–72 hours), whereas 28% treat almost all patients with 10–14 days of intravenous (IV) antibiotics and 22% treat with oral antibiotics once they have clinically improved (ie, no minimum duration of parenteral therapy). For those with MSSA bacteremia, nafcillin and cefazolin are used similarly (Figure 1C).

(A) Diagnostic workup for a child with osteomyelitis-associated SAB that is improving shortly after antibiotic initiation. Almost all providers repeat blood cultures until negative; however, the minority will routinely look for other foci of infection. (B) For the treatment of osteomyelitis-associated SAB, 50% of providers will switch to an oral regimen for nonpersistent bacteremia. Twenty-eight percent and 22% will treat with all intravenous antibiotics or treat with oral antibiotics after clinical improvement, respectively. (C) For the treatment methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with osteomyelitis, 55% of clinicians use nafcillin, 42% use cefazolin, and 3% use an alternative agent.

Nonpersistent Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia

For febrile, well appearing children with only 1 S aureus blood culture, no clear source of infection, and subsequent negative cultures before antibiotics, 54% of providers treat with oral antibiotics after empiric vancomycin; 25% complete therapy with IV antibiotics, and 17% discontinue antibiotics, assuming that S aureus is a contaminant. A small proportion (4%) of providers chose an alternative management strategy, including evaluating for a source of infection (3%).

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^116yn9zF]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Empirical treatment decisions in MRSA bacteremia require consideration of the prevalence and resistance profile of local strains, risk factors for a complicated clinical course, presence of comorbidities, concurrent interventions, and response to prior antibiotics. Current US and European treatment recommendations are summarized in Table 3. For most cases of MRSA bacteremia, vancomycin or daptomycin is the recommended treatment. The choice of antibiotic may also depend on if the bacteremia is secondary to another infection. For example, daptomycin, although indicated for treatment of SAB, is contraindicated for SAB originating from pneumonia since pulmonary surfactants inactivate it. Vancomycin poorly penetrates lung tissue; thus, linezolid or clindamycin are recommended if the strain is susceptible. Reports of MRSA isolates resistant or nonsusceptible to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, daptomycin, and ceftaroline, as well as multidrug-resistant MRSA clones, are a concerning trend. These data highlight the importance of early identification of MRSA and susceptibility to identify the optimal antibiotic.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^115ZhmxN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Perspective

The current study suggests that there is no global standard of practice for SAB. Striking differences were noted, both between and within continents, in what antibiotics were prescribed, and by what route. The lack of a global standard in the management of SAB stands in stark contrast to treatment of other syndromes of comparable lethality. For coronary artery disease, management has been largely standardized by guidelines based on data from randomized controlled trials. Coincident with establishing these best treatment practices, the annual US mortality rate from coronary artery disease declined by 17.7% from 2005 to 2015. By contrast, the 1-month mortality for patients with SAB only decreased by 2.8% over the same time period. The results of this study underscore one key fact: a global standard of care for SAB will be difficult to develop pending more definitive clinical trials data. Indeed, fewer than 3500 patients have been enrolled in published SAB randomized trials over the past 20 years (Supplementary Table 3). Factors other than robust clinical data, such as cultural differences, costs and availability of resources also influence management choices. However, without consensus on best practice, normative and cultural factors gain influence on for example antibiotic prescription behavior. Multinational clinical trials such as the Staphylococcus aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) are thus essential to standardize clinical definitions, identify treatment strategies, and improve patient outcomes of this common and frequently lethal infection.

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^114Nmb4q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The clinical spectrum of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) varies widely and ranges from uncomplicated peripheral venous catheter infection to widespread disseminated infection. SAB is commonly divided in complicated and uncomplicated SAB to guide clinical management. Guidelines recommend to treat uncomplicated SAB for 2 weeks and complicated SAB for 4 to 6 weeks with antibiotics. A frequently used definition of complicated SAB is the one introduced in 2003 by Fowler and coworkers, in which complicated SAB is defined as SAB complicated by infection-related mortality, metastatic or locally complicated infection, embolic stroke, or recurrent SAB. However, this definition includes outcomes that are unknown at the moment a physician needs to decide whether to treat for 2 weeks or longer. To help identify patients with complicated SAB, the same investigators determined risk factors for complicated SAB: community acquisition of bacteremia, persistent fever, persistently positive blood cultures, and skin findings suggesting acute systemic infection. Although the presence of risk factors for complicated SAB does not equate the actual existence of complicated SAB, presence of these (and other) risk factors is now often used to define complicated SAB, even in the absence of proven metastatic or locally complicated infection. For instance, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia define complicated SAB as presence of locally complicated or metastatic infection, or the presence of 1 of several risk factors (presence of prosthetic material, persistent fever, persistently positive blood cultures, and skin findings suggestive of systemic infection).

However, associations between risk factors and occurrence of complicated SAB are poorly validated, and the investigators reporting these risk factors did not recommend including them as part of the definition. The use of risk factors, therefore, implies the possibility of misclassification, either leading to over- and underdiagnosis of complicated SAB, potentially leading to over- and undertreatment with antibiotics.

In a prospective cohort study of patients with SAB, we retrospectively adjudicated all episodes as either complicated or uncomplicated SAB using a reference definition based on clinical course and outcome as proposed by Fowler et al. and quantified associations and predictive values of risk factors for this outcome. Second, we determined the accuracy of categorizing complicated SAB using the IDSA criteria, compared with the reference definition, and estimated the potential consequences for antibiotic use.

### Leveraging electronic medical records to evaluate a computerized decision support system for Staphylococcus bacteremia [^1147Ckya]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

HELP computerized computerized decision support system

The HELP CDSS assigns patients to one of two arms: one for CoNS bacteremia (including Staphylococcus intermedius) or one for S. aureus bacteremia (including Staphylococcus lugdunensis). In the CoNS arm, the CDSS checks the number of independent blood cultures. If only one positive blood culture is available without evidence of catheter infection by the same pathogen (clinical judgment by the physician in charge), the CDSS recommends a follow-up blood culture to rule out contamination before starting antibiotics. If two separate blood cultures yield positive results for the same CoNS species with matching antibiotic susceptibility profiles, the CDSS suggests investigating a possible source of infection and considering antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures were considered separate if they were collected from different sites and at different times (2 h to 5 days). A negative follow-up blood culture suggested contamination, prompting a reevaluation of antibiotic therapy if it was already initiated.

The HELP CDSS for S. aureus bacteremia is based on treatment recommendations published by Hagel et al. It was developed by a panel of IDS and medical microbiologists in collaboration with medical informaticians from all study sites. A simplified schematic representation is shown in Fig. 5.

Fig. 5
Schematic representation of the HELP CDSS.

Rough overview of the decision algorithm that was the basis for the HELP CDSS.

For SAB, the CDSS distinguishes between uncomplicated and complicated cases based on criteria such as positive follow-up blood cultures, permanent foreign bodies, prolonged fever, or vasopressor use. Treatment of complex SAB exceeds the capabilities of the CDSS, so immediate IDS consultation is advised. This also applies to polymicrobial bacteremia when more than one pathogen is detected in addition to staphylococci. For uncomplicated SAB treatment, guidance is offered, including source control, diagnostic imaging, and appropriate antibiotics.

### Performance of processes of care and outcomes in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^114CQsqR]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalized adults.

Objective

We aimed to identify current practice patterns in the management of SAB, and to evaluate their association with clinical outcomes.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A 1558-bed tertiary care teaching hospital.

Patients

Adult patients hospitalized between January 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, who had at least 1 positive blood culture with S aureus.

Intervention

None

Measurements

Electronic medical records were reviewed and the processes of care in the management of SAB were identified. The main outcome was clinical failure, defined as a composite endpoint of in-hospital mortality and persistent bacteremia.

Results

Two hundred fifty episodes of SAB occurred in 241 patients, and 78 (32.4%) had clinical failure. Processes of care that impacted the risk of clinical failure included: timing of follow-up blood cultures (delays of > 4 days had a relative risk [RR] of 6.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1–20.5; P = 0.001), consultation with infectious diseases specialist within 6 days from diagnosis of SAB (RR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–0.9; P = 0.03), and use of β-lactams in patients with methicillin-susceptible S aureus bacteremia (RR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.04–0.5; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

The processes of care identified in our study could serve as quality and patient safety indicators for the management of SAB.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^115ULE6m]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is still a major global healthcare problem. Of concern is S. aureus bacteremia, which exhibits high rates of morbidity and mortality and can cause metastatic or complicated infections such as infective endocarditis or sepsis. MRSA is responsible for most global S. aureus bacteremia cases, and compared with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, MRSA infection is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. S. aureus virulence is affected by the unique combination of toxin and immune-modulatory gene products, which may differ by geographic location and healthcare- or community-associated acquisition. Management of S. aureus bacteremia involves timely identification of the infecting strain and source of infection, proper choice of antibiotic treatment, and robust prevention strategies. Resistance and nonsusceptibility to first-line antimicrobials combined with a lack of equally effective alternatives complicates MRSA bacteremia treatment. This review describes trends in epidemiology and factors that influence the incidence of MRSA bacteremia. Current and developing diagnostic tools, treatments, and prevention strategies are also discussed.

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^117MdQB6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

Recommended duration of antibiotic treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is frequently based on distinguishing uncomplicated and complicated SAB, and several risk factors at the onset of infection have been proposed to define complicated SAB. Predictive values of risk factors for complicated SAB have not been validated, and consequences of their use on antibiotic prescriptions are unknown.

Methods

In a prospective cohort, patients with SAB were categorized as complicated or uncomplicated through adjudication (reference definition). Associations and predictive values of 9 risk factors were determined, compared with the reference definition, as was accuracy of Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria that include 4 risk factors, and the projected consequences of applying IDSA criteria on antibiotic use.

Results

Among 490 patients, 296 (60%) had complicated SAB. In multivariable analysis, persistent bacteremia (odds ratio [OR], 6.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9–12.0), community acquisition of SAB (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.9–4.7) and presence of prosthetic material (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5–3.6) were associated with complicated SAB. Presence of any of the 4 risk factors in the IDSA definition of complicated SAB had a positive predictive value of 70.9% (95% CI, 65.5–75.9) and a negative predictive value of 57.5% (95% CI, 49.1–64.8). Compared with the reference, IDSA criteria yielded 24 (5%) false-negative and 90 (18%) false-positive classifications of complicated SAB. Median duration of antibiotic treatment of these 90 patients was 16 days (interquartile range, 14–19), all with favorable clinical outcome.

Conclusions

Risk factors have low to moderate predictive value to identify complicated SAB and their use may lead to unnecessary prolonged antibiotic use.

### Perspectives on daptomycin resistance, with emphasis on resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [^114abrBA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are becoming more frequent and less easily treated by means of currently recommended agents. Vancomycin has been associated with decreased susceptibility in staphylococci and with treatment failures. Daptomycin is rapidly bactericidal; a dosage of 4 mg/kg daily is approved for treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections, and a dosage of 6 mg/kg daily is approved for treatment of patients with S. aureus bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis. Findings of in vitro studies suggest a correlation between the minimum inhibitory concentrations of daptomycin and vancomycin. Clinical failure was associated with increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations in case reports and in a randomized study of persons with S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. Patients who did not respond to therapy had deep-seated infections that required but could not be or were not managed with adjunctive surgical therapy. No definitive resistance mechanism has been identified, although genetic mutations have been described. Clinically, prior vancomycin therapy has not been associated with failure of daptomycin therapy. Although clinical practitioners must monitor for daptomycin resistance, the available data support the use of daptomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis.

### Improving the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, including MRSA [^115moQ7J]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

S. aureus bacteraemia is associated with a mortality of 20–30%, and suboptimal management can significantly impact on the associated morbidity. Failure to remove an infected intravascular focus increases the risk of treatment failure, recurrence of S. aureus bacteraemia and metastatic complications. Based on this data, our first measurement evaluated the adequacy and timely removal or debridement of the source of bacteraemia.

Endocarditis is a well documented complication in around 12% of cases, although rates vary between different population groups and rates from 5% up to 60% have been reported. This highlights the need for echocardiography in all cases of S. aureus bacteraemia, even in the absence of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) both recommend echocardiography in all cases of S. aureus bacteraemia in their guidelines. Based on these guidelines, our second measurement assessed whether echocardiography was performed in all adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia.

Obtaining a repeat blood culture is recommended after initiation of appropriate treatment. This enables the early identification of complications and persistence of bacteraemia. Hence our third measurement assessed whether clearance blood cultures were obtained.

Treatment of less than two weeks is associated with a higher risk of complications. The presence of an irremovable or undrainable primary focus, endocarditis, a metastatic focus of infection or persistence of bacteraemia are all indications for prolonged antimicrobial therapy of four to six weeks. It is uncertain whether de-escalation to oral therapy impacts on the relapse rate.

Based on this evidence, the fourth measurement evaluated the adequacy of antimicrobial duration and choice. A minimum of two weeks of intravenous antibiotics for uncomplicated bacteraemia, and four to six weeks of antibiotics for complicated bacteraemia was considered adequate.

Documentation of S. aureus bacteraemia in the discharge summary enables earlier identification of complications following a patient's discharge, such as recurrence of bacteraemia, metastatic foci of infection or endocarditis. The fifth measurement assessed whether S. aureus was documented in the discharge summary.

A previous study revealed that patients under the care of medical teams who did not follow the treatment recommendations by infectious diseases consultants were more likely to experience a relapse of the bacteraemia. Many of the project's Plan-Do-Study-Act learning cycles were therefore centred around improving clinical liaison between the clinicians and the microbiology team.

### Impact of management and bacterial genomics on outcomes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children [^116V9kKY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Children with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) generally presented with nonsevere signs and symptoms in sharp contrast to reports of adults with SAB. Despite incomplete adherence to current management guidelines, children with SAB did not experience mortality or relapse. Molecular characteristics of strains responsible for SAB in children were not significantly different than those described in adults. Improved outcomes in pediatric SAB compared with adults may most likely be attributed to less severe comorbidities in children.

### Comparing success rates in central venous catheter salvage for catheter-related bloodstream infections in adult patients on home parenteral nutrition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173VR4w]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

The impact that recurrent CVC removal can have on future venous access implies that catheter salvage should be attempted wherever possible in HPN-dependent patients with CRBSI. Whereas guidelines recommend CVC removal in most cases of CRBSI, catheter salvage aims to retain the CVC with the use of appropriate catheter lock therapy and systemic antibiotics, usually for ≥ 10–14 d. Catheter salvage is attractive because it obviates the inconveniences and risks of CVC replacement, especially in those patients who have limited remaining venous access or who cannot tolerate prolonged periods without HPN. Catheter removal, on the other hand, reduces the risk of infection recurrence, persistent bacteremia, and metastatic infection. However, the appropriateness of catheter salvage in specific situations remains contentious. Current European HPN guidelines recommend attempting CVC salvage solely in patients with uncomplicated infections arising from Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), and Gram-negative bacilli. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines advocate catheter removal or replacement as a first-line approach to CRBSI. All guidelines agree on removing the CVC in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, for CRBSIs caused by yeasts, or in cases of complicated infections such as endocarditis, septic thrombosis, and other metastatic infections. However, the recommended treatment for certain high-virulence bacteria (e.g. S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) remains controversial. For instance, whereas the IDSA recommends CVC removal in case of S. aureus and Gram-negative infections, some IF expert centers report high rates of successful catheter salvage with these bacteria.

In addition to the indications for CVC salvage, several other uncertainties exist around CRBSI management. One of these is the added value of an antimicrobial lock solution next to conventional systemic antibiotic treatment and another is the option of guidewire exchange instead of catheter removal; antimicrobial lock solution consists of high concentrations of an antimicrobial agent (often combined with an anticoagulant) instilled into the catheter lumen. Guidewire exchange is a technique that has previously been reported in studies mainly concerning hemodialysis patients. This technique involves the insertion of a guidewire through the infected CVC into the vein, followed by removal of the infected catheter and placement of a new catheter over the guidewire. However, the optimal strategy to salvage a catheter remains unclear owing to the lack of well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^115Cka8X]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in children; however, optimal management of these patients remains unclear. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) bacteremia recommend vancomycin therapy for up to 6 weeks, depending on the source and clinical response. Guidelines for the treatment of methicillin- susceptible S aureus (MSSA) bacteremia recommend nafcillin as first-line therapy, with cefazolin as an alternative.

Despite these recommendations, the application of broad guidelines to specific scenarios encountered in the management of S aureus bacteremia (SAB) in children remains difficult. Recent literature has challenged long-held notions regarding optimal management of SAB associated with osteoarticular infections; however, there remains a paucity of evidence to guide management in several other common scenarios including the following: nonpersistent SAB without a source, prolonged MRSA bacteremia, and central-line associated SAB. Given the complexity in the management of children with SAB, we sought to describe practice patterns and clinical decision making among pediatric infectious diseases (PID) providers.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to general principles, setting of care, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering outpatient parenteral or oral antibiotic treatment in patients with left-sided IE caused by Streptococcus species, E. faecalis, S. aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci, provided they were receiving appropriate IV antibiotic treatment for at least 10 days (or at least 7 days after cardiac surgery), are clinically stable, and do not show signs of abscess formation or valve abnormalities requiring surgery on TEE.

### Intravenous to oral switch in complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia without endovascular infection: a retrospective single-center cohort study [^111eaKkV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), guidelines recommend prolonged intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy for at least 4–6 weeks. Few studies suggest the safety of sequential IV to oral switch in these patients. Also, bone and joint infections, which are common metastatic infections in SAB, can be safely managed with predominant oral treatment. In these patients, early IV-oral switch is associated with shorter hospital stay and fewer complications. Our institute has the policy that patients with SAB with nonendovascular metastatic infectious foci can be treated with oral antibiotics after 14 days of IV treatment. This study determined the outcome and adverse events of this strategy in comparison to prolonged IV treatment.

### Long versus short course anti-microbial therapy of uncomplicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: a systematic review [^115NBYVf]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend at least 2 weeks duration of antibiotic therapy (DOT) for patients with uncomplicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) but the evidence for this recommendation is unclear.

Objectives

To perform a systematic literature review assessing current evidence for recommended DOT for patients with SAB.

Methods

The following are the methods used for this study.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Database and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to March 30, 2024. References of eligible studies were screened and experts in the field contacted for additional articles.

Study Eligibility Criteria

All clinical studies, regardless of design, publication status and language.

Participants

Adult patients with uncomplicated SAB.

Interventions

Long (> 14 days; > 18 days; 11–16 days) vs. short (≤ 14 days; 10–18 days; 6–10 days, respectively) DOT with the DOT being defined as the first until the last day of antibiotic therapy.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I-tool.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Only studies presenting results of adjusted analyses for mortality were included. Data synthesis could not be performed.

Results

Eleven nonrandomized studies were identified that fulfilled the pre-defined inclusion criteria, of which three studies reported adjusted effect ratios. Only these were included in the final analysis. We did not find any RCT. Two studies with 1230 patients reported the primary endpoint 90-day all-cause mortality. Neither found a statistically significant superiority for longer (> 14 days; 11–16 days) or shorter DOT (≤ 14 days; 6–10 days, respectively) for patients with uncomplicated SAB. Two studies investigated the secondary endpoint 30-day all-cause mortality (> 18 days; 11–16 days vs. 10–18 days; 6–10 days, respectively) and did not find a statistically significant difference. All included studies had a moderate risk of bias.

Conclusions

Sound evidence that supports any duration of antibiotic treatment for patients with uncomplicated SAB is lacking.

### Avoiding the perfect storm: the biologic and clinical case for reevaluating the 7-day expectation for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia before switching therapy [^111vHmmW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia (MRSAB) is associated with poor outcomes and serious complications. The MRSA guidelines define treatment failure and persistent bacteremia as lasting ≥ 7 days; however, this definition requires reevaluation. Aggressively reducing the bacterial inoculum promptly is critical because factors already in place before clinical presentation are driving resistance to the few antibiotics that are available to treat MRSAB. Alternative approaches to treat MRSAB should be considered within 3–4 days of persistent MRSAB. With rapid molecular diagnostics emerging in clinical microbiology laboratories and biomarkers as a potential for early patient risk stratification, a future shorter threshold may become possible.

Practice guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin treatment for Staphylococcus aureus infection in adult patients were reviewed by an expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists. A literature review of existing evidence regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring of serum concentrations, in addition to patient outcomes combined with expert opinion regarding the drug's pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety record, resulted in new recommendations for targeting and adjustment of vancomycin therapy.

### Transplantation in the face of severe donor sepsis: pushing the boundaries? [^115an2Vd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Most current transplantation guidelines suggest that bacteremia or bacterial sepsis precludes organ donation. However, various investigators report good outcomes when donor bacteremia was discovered incidentally posttransplant or when bacteremia was cleared before organ retrieval. The authors present the case of a donor who underwent surgical repair of a congenital heart defect complicated by refractory septic shock with positive blood cultures for cloxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus until time of death. Hemorrhagic and necrotic foci were noted on the renal capsules at time of organ retrieval. The donor liver appeared grossly unremarkable. One year after transplantation, the 3 recipients continue to do well with no known sequelae of having received organs from a Staphylococcus aureus -septic donor. The authors conclude that with appropriate perioperative antibiotics targeted at an organism with known sensitivities and consideration of a modified immunosuppressive protocol, even organs from individuals with known severe sepsis at the time of retrieval may be appropriate for donation.

### Quality improvement of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia management and predictors of relapse-free survival [^117E8XyX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

Methods

A quasi-experimental pre- and postintervention study design was used to compare process and clinical endpoints before and after a quality-improvement initiative. All inpatients > 18 years of age with a positive blood culture for S. aureus during the specified pre- and postintervention period with clinical information available in the electronic medical record were included. An institutional protocol for the care of patients with S. aureus bacteremia was developed, formalized, and distributed to providers using a pocket card, an electronic order set, and targeted lectures over a 9-month period.

Results

There were 167 episodes of S. aureus bacteremia (160 patients) identified in the preintervention period, and 127 episodes (123 patients) in the postintervention period. Guideline adherence improved in the postintervention period for usage of transesophageal echocardiogram (43.9% vs 20.2%, P < .01) and adequate duration of intravenous therapy (71% vs 60%, P = .05). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, the variables associated with increased relapse-free survival were postintervention period (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48; confidence interval [CI] 0.24–0.95; P .035) and appropriate source control (HR 0.53; CI, 0.24–0.92; P .027). Regardless of intervention, presence of cancer was associated with an increased risk of relapse or mortality at 90 days (HR 2.88; P < .0001; CI, 1.35–5.01).

Conclusion

A bundled educational intervention to promote adherence to published guidelines for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia resulted in a significant improvement in provider adherence to guidelines as well as increased 90-day relapse-free survival.

### Infectious diseases: what you may have missed in 2023 [^114QB41V]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2023, published research on COVID-19 remains prominent. The aim of this article is to highlight important developments in infectious disease evidence unrelated to COVID-19 that were published in 2023. The literature was screened for sound new evidence relevant to internal medicine specialists and subspecialists whose focus of practice is not infectious diseases. The highlighted publications relate to various organisms and patient populations. One article provides insight into the updated guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis. Several articles address the management of sepsis and bacteremia: comparison of cefepime versus piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftobiprole for the treatment of complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics in patients with gram-negative bacteremia. Another article examines differences in all-cause mortality in patients with Clostridioides difficile infection who receive different treatments. Additional articles provide evidence about the treatment of patients with HIV infection: the utility of preexposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection, the efficacy of pitavastatin in reducing cardiovascular disease, and the efficacy of dexamethasone for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis in persons with HIV.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nPDQk]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis identified only one RCT examining shorter versus longer duration of antibiotic therapy exclusively for patients with bacteremia and a further 23 trials among patients with the infectious syndromes that are most commonly associated with bacteremia in the ICU. No significant difference in cure or survival was detected for bacteremic patients receiving shorter- versus longer-duration therapy. These data indicate that shorter-duration therapy may be effective for BSIs but also highlight the need for a larger, high-quality trial dedicated to this question.

The only trial randomly assigning exclusively patients with bacteremia, rather than an identified infectious syndrome, was conducted in a severely ill neonatal population. The main finding of this trial was that overall outcomes were not significantly different for neonates receiving shorter- versus longer-duration antibiotics. A high rate of failure was seen among the small number of patients receiving short-duration treatment for S. aureus bacteremia, and this is consistent with the findings of some prior retrospective studies and current treatment guidelines for this pathogen; yet other studies support short-course therapy for catheter-associated S. aureus bacteremia. This review highlights the potential importance of considering S. aureus bacteremia separately from other pathogens in the context of adequately powered trials in the future.

### Infrastructure and current practice of blood culture diagnostics in patients with sepsis: teachings and recommendations from the European sepsis care survey [^116VXSbG]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up blood cultures are indicated in specific conditions

Gram-negative bacteremia has a reported mortality of 13–20%. In cases of Gram-negative bacteremia successful control of the source of the infection can be verified by follow-up blood cultures. This practice is associated with decreased mortality, according to a meta-analysis of 5 studies with 4378 patients. Another study showed that obtaining follow-up blood cultures for bacteremia was not associated with mortality. Taking into consideration these controversies we suggest that follow-up cultures are collected in the case of new sepsis onset, lack of clinical response of relapse, patients with candidemia, patients with bloodstream infection (BSI) by Staphylococcus aureus, patients with multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteraemia, and patients with central line BSI.

The time until positivity of blood culture has clinical implications

The time to bacterial culture positivity is the time from the start of incubation to the preliminary positive result of a blood culture. For some decades, differential time to positivity between samples from a central line and peripheral samples was used to differentiate central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) from bacteremia from a different source. As a next step, several studies analyzed the possible association between short time to positivity and mortality, especially in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. A meta-analysis of 24 studies showed that short time to positivity is a predictor of mortality and septic shock.

Blood cultures can be used for de-escalation where appropriate

De-escalation has several benefits that arise from reduction of antimicrobial consumption, shortening of hospital stay and reduction of cost. These facts will gradually contribute to slowing the rate of increase of resistant pathogen rates. De-escalation is one of the pillars of Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) programs, contributing to appropriate antimicrobial use. Several trials present contradictory results of the effect of de-escalation on mortality. A Greek observational study reported that de-escalation for BSIs by fully susceptible Gram-negatives had no effect on mortality. There is no available meta-analysis so far on this topic, and larger and well-designed studies are needed to reveal the possible association of de-escalation and mortality in patients with sepsis. As results of future studies are anticipated, the known benefits of de-escalation are indirect in terms of reduction of the incidence of MDR pathogens.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^117KWHjN]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Detection of metastatic infectious foci

Echocardiography

Using a risk stratification for diagnostic investigations is only helpful if there are diagnostic modalities that can reliably detect metastatic infections. For either diagnosing or excluding endocarditis in SAB, standard clinical practice is to perform echocardiography in patients with SAB, as a significant portion of patients with SAB have endocarditis in absence of clinical signs. Scoring systems have been developed to determine the necessity of (transesophageal) echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be performed with low threshold in patients with negative TTE but persistent suspicion of endocarditis and in patients with prosthetic heart valves and/or cardiac implantable electronic devices. On the other hand, the combined absence of certain risk factors and prognostically unfavorable features of bacteremia can probably obviate the need of TEE. Future research should focus on how clinical prediction scores can be improved to reduce the number of patients classified as high risk for endocarditis – and thus requiring TEE – while maintaining acceptable negative predictive value. It must be said, however, that such trials will be difficult to conduct as the event rates are low in the very low risk patient group and will therefore require large numbers to demonstrate any difference between the strategies.

Another question is whether there are subgroups of patients with SAB in whom echocardiography can be safely omitted altogether. For example, patients with a very low a priori risk of endocarditis, or patients with transient bacteremia already receiving extended courses of parenteral antibiotics for other sites of infection might not always require TTE. Scenario-based research has shown that clinicians already actively engage in risk stratification when applying echocardiography strategies. It is important to note, however, that TTE is widely available, safe, inexpensive, and standard of care for patients with SAB. Thus, any decision to withhold echocardiography from SAB patients will need to be shown not to cause harm in high quality, adequately powered, and broadly generalizable trials.

Need for a new classification

Clinicians need a classification for SAB that directs the diagnostic work-up and individualizes antibiotic treatment (Fig. 1). This framework can also be used to identify knowledge gaps for future research (Table 1). This proposed classification system begins after the initial positive blood culture with a requisite evaluation for every patient with SAB, including physical examination, repeat blood cultures, and echocardiography. Risk stratification based upon these results could then define patients at high or low risk of metastatic infection. Patients identified as high risk for complications could then undergo a more extensive diagnostic work-up to find or exclude these complications, in contrast to the patient without risk factors present at baseline or with negative results from the initial work-up ('low-risk SAB'). Ideally, the result of the more in-depth diagnostic work-up would delineate the extent and nature of the patient's S. aureus infection. This 'final clinical diagnosis', and not a designation of complicated SAB solely on the basis of the presence of factors that are associated with metastatic infections, would correspond with a certain treatment strategy for the average patients with this clinical picture, including route of administration, duration, and load reduction. The last step is to establish the final treatment plan for the individual patient by further streamlining or changing duration of the treatment based on clinical factors. Of course, for this classification to work in clinical decision making, it must be able to accurately identify the absence of metastatic infections in patients with SAB, even when traditional evaluations fail to identify one.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^117QsUvt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Despite being the leading cause of mortality from bloodstream infections worldwide, little is known about regional variation in treatment practices for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB). The aim of this study was to identify global variation in management, diagnostics, and definitions of SAB.

Methods

During a 20-day period in 2022, physicians throughout the world were surveyed on SAB treatment practices. The survey was distributed through listservs, e-mails, and social media.

Results

In total, 2031 physicians from 71 different countries on 6 continents (North America [701, 35%], Europe [573, 28%], Asia [409, 20%], Oceania [182, 9%], South America [124, 6%], and Africa [42, 2%]) completed the survey. Management-based responses differed significantly by continent for preferred treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, use of adjunctive rifampin for prosthetic material infection, and use of oral antibiotics (P < .01 for all comparisons). The 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were most commonly used in Europe (94%) and least frequently used in Africa (13%) and North America (51%; P < .01). Although most respondents defined persistent SAB as 3–4 days of positive blood cultures, responses ranged from 2 days in 31% of European respondents to 7 days in 38% of Asian respondents (P < .01).

Conclusions

Large practice variations for SAB exist throughout the world, reflecting the paucity of high-quality data and the absence of an international standard of care for the management of SAB.

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^116qo8iG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

We identified 9 risk factors commonly used to predict complicated SAB (Supplementary Table 1). These include: (1) community acquisition of bacteremia; (2) persistent fever after 72 hours; (3) skin manifestations suggestive of systemic infection; (4) positive follow-up blood cultures after 48 hours; (5) presence of permanently implanted prosthetic material; (6) hemodialysis dependence; (7) an unknown focus of infection at presentation; (8) history of endocarditis, active intravenous drug use, or a heart condition predisposing for endocarditis; and (9) delay in start of effective antimicrobial therapy of 48 hours or more after collection of first positive blood culture. For purposes of analysis, we combined history of endocarditis, active intravenous drug use, and a heart condition predisposing for endocarditis as 1 risk factor because these are all risk factors strongly associated with development of endocarditis.

The IDSA classifies SAB as complicated if any of the following characteristics are present: endocarditis or metastatic infection, presence of permanently implanted prosthetic material, skin findings suggestive of systemic infection, positive follow-up blood cultures after 48 hours, and persistent fever after 72 hours. For clarity, throughout the manuscript, patients who meet the IDSA definition for complicated SAB will be referred to as meeting the IDSA definition.

Site of acquisition (nosocomial, community-acquired, or healthcare associated) was classified as defined by Friedman et al. Comorbidity was classified using the Charlson comorbidity index. Sepsis and septic shock were defined using the Sepsis-3 guidelines. Persistent bacteremia was defined as a positive blood culture 48 hours after start of effective antimicrobial therapy. Infective endocarditis (IE) was diagnosed by applying the modified Duke criteria. Definite focus of infection was the diagnosis made by the treating physician at hospital discharge. Patients could have multiple infectious foci (eg, endocarditis and spondylodiscitis).

Infection-related mortality was defined as death from direct sequelae of the infection (sepsis, embolic stroke, death during infection control surgery) or persistent signs of infection at the time of death, as described earlier.

### A scenario-based survey of expert echocardiography recommendations for patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at varying risk for endocarditis [^114j5fRd]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Respondents were advised to consider the following conditions as applying to each scenario: TTE and TEE were equally accessible; no specific contraindication to TEE was present; there were no clinical features of an intracardiac complication of endocarditis (eg, heart failure or atrioventricular conduction disturbance); and no new complications of SAB arose unless stated.

For each scenario, respondents were asked to select their preferred echocardiography strategy from 6 options, as if they had been asked to provide a recommendation on day 3 to 5 after the onset of bacteremia. The 6 echocardiography strategies were TEE as the only study; both TTE and TEE; TTE first, followed by TEE only if the TTE result is negative for endocarditis; TTE first, followed by TEE only if the TTE result is positive for endocarditis; TTE as the only study; and no echocardiography. The first 3 strategies all have a negative likelihood ratio for native valve endocarditis of less than 0.10 (eTable 1, eTable 2, and eMethods in the Supplement) and are subsequently referred to as highly exclusionary echocardiography strategies. No information regarding the diagnostic performance of any echocardiography strategy was provided to respondents.

Respondents were also asked to provide nonidentifying demographic details including country of clinical practice, medical specialty, years of postfellowship experience, and annual SAB caseload. We also sought each respondent's assessments of the risk and consequence of relapse after inadvertent treatment of clinically occult S aureus native valve infective endocarditis with short-course antibiotic therapy.

The survey was initially piloted among a small group of local and international contacts who provided feedback on the number and framing of survey questions and the appropriateness of the presented echocardiography strategy descriptions. Once finalized, the survey was distributed via the email lists of various national specialty societies and via direct email contacts between September 2018 and March 2019. The survey was made available to respondents in 3 languages (English, French, and Spanish). Overall response rates or predictors were not calculable, but list-specific response rates were estimated for lists with known distribution numbers.

Biomarkers to individualize treatment duration

A possible way to personalize treatment even more could be with the use of biomarkers, as is already done with procalcitonin in intensive care unit and in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. If shown to be effective in clinical studies, one potential example of personalizing antibiotic therapy based upon novel diagnostic platforms includes the use of microbial cell-free S. aureus DNA from plasma to define the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with SAB by identifying when S. aureus DNA drops below limits of detection.

### Management of gram-positive coccal bacteremia and hemodialysis [^111cbnRs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Gram-positive cocci are the most common cause of bloodstream infections in hemodialysis patients, with Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci causing most infections. Management of these infections often is complicated by limited vascular access options, as well as an increasing prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria in hemodialysis centers, including the emergence of strains of methicillin-resistant S aureus with vancomycin heteroresistance and increasing rates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, both of which have limited antibiotic treatment options. This article describes the management of these infections based on the organism and its susceptibility profile, including catheter management, antibiotic lock therapies, and systemic antibiotic choices. Although coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteremia often may be managed with preservation of the catheter, antibiotic lock therapy, and intravenous antibiotics, this is rarely the case with S aureus bacteremia because of frequent relapse and the risk of complications, including endocarditis. Enterococcal bacteremia requires more individualization of care, but catheters are less likely to be salvaged, especially when vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus is the causative organism. Finally, strong infection control policies in the hemodialysis unit, conversion from catheter to arteriovenous access when possible, and appropriate use of antibiotics are essential factors in the prevention of these bloodstream infections.

### Risk factors for recurrence after Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. A retrospective matched case-control study [^114tyGbM]. The Journal of Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to identify risk factors for recurrence of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) by auditing compliance with guidelines on its treatment in our hospital.

Methods

We retrospectively identified patients over the preceding 8 years whose SAB had recurred, matching each to a control patient with non-recurrent SAB.

Results

40/1870 patients with SAB had suffered recurrent disease (2.1%), 33 of whom were available for study. Where 2, 4 and 6 weeks of intravenous therapy were recommended, 78%, 29% and 25% of patients received it, and there was no association with recurrence. Glycopeptide use in patients with methicillin sensitive SAB (MSSA) was significantly associated with recurrence (p = 0.015). Where the source of the bacteraemia was a peripheral venous catheter the odds of recurrence were less than where an SAB originated at another site (p = 0.047). All patients with SAB in whom a central venous catheter was not removed suffered recurrence.

Conclusions

We found the recurrence rate after SAB was low despite poor compliance with guidelines on treatment duration. Glycopeptide therapy for MSSA bacteraemia was more likely to result in recurrent SAB than beta-lactam therapy. Recurrence was significantly less likely in patients where the source of the SAB was a peripheral line than in those with another source.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^111Ns9vf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study shows that even the most basic aspects of treating patients with SAB differ profoundly between geographic regions. This variation was most marked in fundamental aspects of decision-making for SAB treatment, including antibiotic choice for MSSA bacteremia, addition of rifampin for prosthetic device infections, and route of administration. An anti-staphylococcal penicillin was treatment of choice for MSSA bacteremia in Europe and Oceania but a distant second to cefazolin in North America. The evidence for superiority of either of the 2 is limited to cohort studies with conflicting results and with underrepresentation of complicated disease, emphasizing the need for randomized trials.

The role of adjunctive rifampin in patients with prosthetic material infections also differed by continent. This controversy persists despite the availability of published society guidelines that recommend the use of rifampin in S. aureus infections involving prosthetic valves and arthroplasties. However, the recommendation to use rifampin for prosthetic valve infective endocarditis has a very limited evidence base. Thus, well-designed randomized trials are needed to define any potential role of adjunctive rifampin in prosthesis-associated SAB. Importantly, the wide range of practices regarding the use of rifampin in this survey demonstrates the presence of the global equipoise necessary to ethically conduct such a trial.

The practice of prescribing part of the treatment course for SAB with oral antibiotics was well accepted in all continents except North America, where only a minority of physicians would consider its routine use. This infrequent use of oral therapy in the United States may be due in part to a high prevalence of MRSA, the presence of a well-organized outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy system, or concerns related to medical malpractice. This lack of global consensus on the role of oral switch therapy is also reflected by the lack of consensus on which setting in which it should be considered. In fact, only the criteria of " source control" and " absence of central nervous system infection " were considered essential for oral switch by a clear majority. By contrast, all other listed criteria were regarded as essential by approximately half of the respondents — which implies that these were considered non-essential by the other half. Because oral switch therapy has potential to decrease the number of adverse drug events, catheter-associated problems and costs, and the fact that the survey respondents are in equipoise on the question, the need for a well-designed randomized trial seems clear. Current studies such as SABATO and SNAP might provide answers in the future.

### How would you treat tricuspid valve infective endocarditis in a patient who uses injection drugs? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113x5iU7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a common and morbid condition involving prolonged hospital stays, significant disability, and a high mortality rate. The current crises of injection drug use and opioid use disorder have contributed to high rates of infective endocarditis in the United States. Endocarditis in patients who inject drugs involves additional management complexity for multiple reasons. Several infective endocarditis management guidelines exist, including from the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology. In light of the unique challenges of caring for this particular population, in 2022 the American Heart Association published a scientific statement specifically focusing on infective endocarditis in people who inject drugs. In these rounds, 2 experts in their respective fields, an infectious diseases specialist and a cardiac surgeon, discuss medical management, interventional approaches, and the value of multidisciplinary care for tricuspid valve endocarditis in a person who uses injection drugs, both in general and in relation to Mr. Y, a 30-year-old man with a history of substance use disorder, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and right-sided endocarditis.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^114kCttQ]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study provides insights on the variation in the management of children with S aureus bacteremia. Notably, we found very little agreement in (1) the optimal route of antibiotics for children with osteomyelitis-associated SAB and nonpersistent SAB, (2) choice of antibiotic for MSSA bacteremia, (3) antibiotic approach in children with persistent MRSA bacteremia on vancomycin, and (4) optimal duration of antibiotics for PICC-associated thrombus and SAB.

These results highlight the complexity in caring for children with SAB and current gaps in consensus guidelines for the optimal management of these patients. Clinicians often encounter scenarios with little data to support treatment decisions, or they are forced to extrapolate data from adult studies. In children with SAB, however, the mortality, pathophysiology, and antibiotic pharmacokinetics are quite different than adults. The IDSA guidelines for MRSA bacteremia recommend echocardiography for all adult patients, whereas in children this is only recommended for those with congenital heart disease, persistent bacteremia (> 48–72 hours), or clinical findings suggestive of endocarditis. Our results reflect this recommendation because less than one third of providers routinely obtain an echocardiogram in a clinically improving child with SAB (Figure 1A). Notably, for a vignette describing bacteremia in a child with significant atopic dermatitis, 17% of respondents chose to discontinue antibiotics, assuming that S aureus was a contaminant — a recommendation at odds with the Committee on Infectious Diseases recommendation that " S. aureus almost never is a contaminant when isolated from a blood culture". Although it is certainly biologically plausible that a positive blood culture for S aureus could be a result of skin contamination, particularly in atopic dermatitis with or without cutaneous S aureus infection, there is historic precedent to treat these children with a short course of parenteral antibiotics. Whether this is suitable in practice is thus far unstudied and merits further discussion in subsequent guideline revisions.

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^111apNHF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Risk factors have low to moderate predictive value to identify complicated SAB. Using risk factors to define complicated SAB, as recommended by IDSA guidelines, may increase the proportion of patients with complicated SAB by 20%. Because classification is used to guide the duration of antibiotic treatment, this will inadvertently lead to unnecessary prolonged antibiotic use. These findings illustrate that in patients with SAB, better criteria, in addition to reliable additional diagnostic procedures, are needed to optimize clinical management.

Is There a Particular Subgroup of Those With SAB Who Particularly Benefit From 18 F-FDG-PET/CT? Complicated or Uncomplicated, High- or Low-Risk?

18 F-FDG-PET/CT is becoming established in having a role in changing management in SAB. The likelihood of a management change, such as a change in antibiotic duration, following 18 F-FDG-PET/CT appears to be of the order of 16%-19%. This compares with the degree of adjustment of dose or change in the duration of therapy of 16%-19% seen in malignancy. A study in 1998 sought to differentiate those patients with SAB at high and low risk of an adverse outcome and stratify their treatment accordingly. They referred to 'simple", "uncomplicated", "endocarditis", and "extracardiac'. SAB and proposed different durations of intravenous antibiotic treatment for the different conditions (7 days, 14 days, 4–8 weeks, and 4–8 weeks, respectively). A "simple" SAB had rapid clinical resolution (within 72 hours of initiating therapy and removal of focus), a negative transoesophageal echo (TOE) for both vegetations and predisposing valve abnormalities, negative repeat blood cultures (showing clearance of bacteria from the blood) at day 2–4 after starting appropriate treatment, and a removable focus of infection with no remaining indwelling prosthetic devices. "Uncomplicated" SAB described those with predisposing valvular abnormalities but no vegetation on TOE, a positive blood culture despite treatment, a superficial nonremovable focus of infection or ongoing signs of infection after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotics. Given the high mortality of this condition, treatment courses have since been extended in the "uncomplicated" group, which now would be considered "complicated" due to the presence of bloodstream bacteria following 2 days of appropriate treatment. In MRSA SAB, the Infectious Diseases Society of America no longer uses the term simple, and define uncomplicated through the absence of positive follow-up blood cultures. In fact, their description of uncomplicated MRSA SAB appears similar to that of simple SAB but with the addition of the term "no metastatic infection. " 18 F-FDG-PET/CT is an obvious tool for clinicians to utilize in the exclusion of metastatic infection in determining the duration of treatment in such cases.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112cLfcS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

Persistent Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia

For the treatment of children with persistent MRSA bacteremia despite adequate vancomycin levels, 37% continue vancomycin and add a second agent, most commonly rifampin. A minority (12%) continue vancomycin monotherapy, whereas 43% change to other agents, most commonly daptomycin; 8% of providers chose an alternative management strategy.

Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter-Associated Thrombus With Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia

There was no consensus on the duration of IV therapy for children with PICC-associated thrombus and bacteremia; 34% treated for 2 weeks, 37% treated for 4 weeks, 18% treated for 6 weeks, and 11% chose an alternative treatment strategy. The majority (71%) recommend anticoagulation.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^114VkSSW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of mortality by bloodstream infections worldwide, and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of mortality attributable to antimicrobial resistance. Despite its global distribution and an incidence of approximately 30 per 100 000 person-years, the optimal approach to S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is poorly understood. Despite the fact that SAB has been a major theme in the medical literature for decades, basic treatment elements such as the optimal antibiotic regimen, the role of adjunct and oral antibiotics, the optimal treatment duration, and the definition of persistent SAB remain fundamentally unknown. Even less is known about global differences in treatment practices for SAB.

The aim of this study was to identify global variation in management, diagnostics, and definitions of SAB. To do this, we used a variety of social media platforms to reach a large number of clinicians throughout the world for a survey on SAB treatment practices.

### Validation of the proposed definition for complicated coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia [^115d9Yew]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are a frequent cause of bacteremia, particularly in hospitalized patients with catheters and indwelling devices. However, because they are common skin commensals, CoNS are often isolated from blood cultures, with most cases representing contamination rather than true infection.

Because of CoNS' low virulence and association with catheter-related infections, the bacteremia's 30-day mortality is lower than that of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. However, studies investigating predictors of mortality in CoNS bacteremia are scarce. Factors previously associated with increased mortality include advanced age, severity of infection, comorbidities, inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, and lack of source control interventions.

Most CoNS infections are catheter-related, and guidelines recommend catheter removal as an essential source control measure. In cases where the catheter is removed and there is no evidence of metastatic infection, septic thrombophlebitis, or infective endocarditis, a short course of antimicrobial treatment (3–5 days) is sufficient. Some studies even suggest that catheter removal alone, without additional antimicrobial therapy, may be a safe approach, underscoring the importance of this intervention. For patients with retained long-term catheters, a prolonged course of antimicrobial treatment (10–14 days) combined with antibiotic lock therapy is recommended to achieve effective source control through high-concentration local antibiotic administration.

Unlike S. aureus bacteremia, there is no widely accepted definition of complicated disease for bacteremia caused by other species, including CoNS. Recently, Varisco et al proposed a definition of complicated CoNS bacteremia, modeled on the Infectious Diseases Society of America's criteria for complicated S. aureus bacteremia. The proposed definition includes 6 criteria: persistent fever or persistent bacteremia lasting ≥ 72 hours after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy, presence of implanted devices, metastatic complications, infective endocarditis, and, in catheter-related infections, failure to remove the catheter within 48 hours of bacteremia onset. Varisco et al found that approximately half of the patients met the criteria for complicated CoNS bacteremia and that these patients had higher mortality compared to those with uncomplicated bacteremia (22% vs 12%, P = .004).

This study aims to identify predictors of mortality in patients with CoNS bacteremia and evaluate the proposed definition of CoNS complicated bacteremia.

### Low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia patients Do not require routine diagnostic imaging: a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study [^115Xb2dH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

A nonrandomized study on the added value of [18 F]FDG-PET/CT in patients with SAB suggested a survival benefit in low-risk patients. Sixty-one percent of low-risk patients had infectious foci on [18 F]FDG-PET/CT. However, the precise localization of these foci in this patient group and the part that affected treatment were not described. Furthermore, patients with prosthetic material and treatment delay were not considered to be at high risk, and patients with existing clinical signs of metastatic infection were also included.

Most clinical decision rules for imaging in SAB focus on IE and aim to determine the necessity of TEE. While current guidelines recommend performing TTE in all SAB patients, emerging evidence suggests that TTE may not be necessary for well-defined low-risk SAB patients. A cost-effectiveness analysis has also shown that in patients with a low probability of IE (< 2%), treating bacteremia without echocardiography can be cost-effective. Moreover, scenario-based research also indicated that clinicians feel confident in using risk stratification when deciding on echocardiography strategies. Consistent with these findings, our study revealed that echocardiography was not performed in all patients. TTE was performed in 58.9% and TEE was performed in 18.0% of the patients; 1 showed valvular vegetations (tricuspid valve; Table 4, Supplementary Table E). Importantly, we observed similar 90-day relapse-free survival in patients who did not undergo echocardiography compared with those who did. This suggests that risk stratification can be a valuable tool in deciding whether to perform TTE. Additionally, incorporating variables such as time to blood culture positivity, which clinicians can readily access at the time of SAB diagnosis, can enhance the precision of risk stratification models and improve accuracy when identifying patients who may not require invasive imaging.

### Screening and treatment for Staphylococcus aureus in patients undergoing hemodialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1164cfwV]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis follows the steps proposed by the Cochrane Collaboration and is in accordance with PRISMA guidelines statement for systematic review reporting. The inclusion criterion was S. aureus colonization in patients with CKD undergoing HD as the primary outcome. The exclusion criteria were nonrandomized studies, letters, editorials, and case reports; studies involving patients < 18 years of age; evaluation of S. aureus infection treatment outcomes without evaluation of the effect of nasal colonization; and no specification of the therapy administered to the treatment group. The interventions compared in this meta-analysis were surveillance for screening of nasal carriers of S. aureus, prophylactic treatment/decolonization to control cross-transmission, and S. aureus infection (bacteremia and skin infection at the catheter insertion site) between treated and untreated patients undergoing HD.

The following characteristics of each study were extracted: study design; total numbers of patients receiving various treatments (various treatments group), mupirocin (mupirocin group), and placebo or control (control group) with corresponding rates of eradication; colonization by S. aureus; duration of surveillance; number of patients with skin infection at the catheter insertion site; and episodes of bacteremia.

Study identification strategy

Relevant studies published from January 1989 to January 2014 were identified through a search of the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register), Embase, LILACS, SciELO, CINAHL, and Medline/PubMed. The principal descriptors used in the search were " Staphylococcus aureus ", "MRSA", "MSSA", "treatment", "decolonization", "nasal carrier", "colonization", chronic kidney disease", "dialysis", and "haemodialysis" or "hemodialysis".

Study selection

The studies were read by two independent reviewers (C.G. and M.T.) to ascertain whether they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The reviewers were not blinded. Each reviewer evaluated the titles and abstracts of all identified studies and obtained complete photocopies of all relevant articles. In cases of doubt or disagreement, a third reviewer (D. A.B.) was solicited to issue an opinion regarding whether the study should or should not be included.

### Effect of automated telephone infectious disease consultations to nonacademic hospitals on 30-day mortality among patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: the SUPPORT cluster randomized clinical trial [^115fnow2]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Telephone Consultation

The ID intervention consisted of an unsolicited telephone consultation by an ID specialist from JUH with the treating physician. The ID specialist recommended state-of-the-art, personalized management of SAB based on 6 QIs that had been successfully implemented at JUH: (1) drawing of follow-up BC, (2) early source control or focus on sanitation, (3) transesophageal echocardiography in patients with clinical indications, (4) intravenous narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics for methicillin-susceptible S aureus, (5) adjustment of the vancomycin dose according to the trough levels in patients with methicillin-resistant S aureus infections, and (6) treatment duration according to the complexity of infection (ie, 2 weeks for uncomplicated infections and at least 4 weeks for complicated infections). The IDC was initiated shortly after obtaining informed consent from the study center, typically on the same day. In case the treating physician could not be reached, the contact was reestablished the following day or, in the case of Fridays, either over the weekend if the treating physician was available or on the next workday. Consultation included detailed information about past and current medical history and the current concerns of the patient, the results of the physical examination, the presence of implanted foreign bodies, the course of serologic markers of inflammation and organ function, any clinical tests and interventions that were planned or had already been performed, and current antibiotic therapy.

After the IDC, a summary of the individual recommendations following a standardized structure was additionally provided by fax. This summary typically included the recommendation of the antibiotic of choice, such as cephazolin or flucloxacillin for methicillin-susceptible SAB and intravenous daptomycin or vancomycin with trough-level assessment for methicillin-resistant SAB, 14 days of intravenous therapy for uncomplicated SAB or longer for complicated SAB, the drawing of follow-up BC samples ideally 48 to 72 hours after initiation of adequate therapy or source control, addition of a second antibiotic (eg, rifampicin or fosfomycin) in the case of suspected or proven foreign-body infection or abscesses, and exclusion of echocardiography in high-risk patients. Additional support was possible on request.

The European Respiratory Journal (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to duration of treatment, ALAT/ERS/ESCMID/ESICM 2017 guidelines recommend to consider administering longer courses of antibiotics in patients with inappropriate initial empiric therapy individualized to the patient's clinical response, specific bacteriological findings (such as pandrug-resistant bacteria, MRSA, or bacteremia), and the serial measurement of biomarkers when indicated.
