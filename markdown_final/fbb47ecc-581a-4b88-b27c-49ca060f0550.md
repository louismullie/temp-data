## Question

Alendronate for acute epididymitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alendronate has any role in the management of acute epididymitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about alendronate's pharmacology and its FDA-labeled indications. Then, I should define acute epididymitis and its standard-of-care therapy. Next, I will check for any plausible mechanistic overlap or guideline support tying alendronate to epididymitis. After that, I should weigh risks versus benefits. Finally, I will synthesize a clear clinical recommendation and highlight key follow-up and safety considerations [^1138g7iX] [^112nyLca].

> Let me first confirm alendronate's mechanism and indications to ensure I'm not missing a niche rationale. Alendronate is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that binds hydroxyapatite and inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; it requires ongoing administration to suppress new resorptive surfaces, and while incorporated in bone, it is pharmacologically inactive, with labeled uses in osteoporosis, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, osteoporosis in men, and Paget's disease, but no infectious disease indications or urologic applications are listed on FDA labeling or SPL entries [^1138g7iX] [^112tJA7o] [^116MQKqN] [^112grdfc].

> Now, I need to define the target condition and the standard of care; acute epididymitis is typically an infectious/inflammatory process due to sexually transmitted pathogens like Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in sexually active younger men, or enteric gram-negative organisms in older men or those with urinary tract instrumentation, and management is with targeted antibiotics plus supportive care, with urgent scrotal ultrasound when torsion is a concern because torsion is a surgical emergency and time-sensitive to salvage [^112nyLca] [^114DZQT2] [^112DQcwx] [^111aACwo] [^117L1kG2] [^1173XH2k].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about novel pathways; I should check for any mechanistic overlap that might tempt off-label use. The RANKL/RANK/OPG axis is indeed expressed in male reproductive tissues including epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicles, and denosumab has been studied in contexts related to RANKL signaling, but that is distinct from bisphosphonates; alendronate does not inhibit RANKL, it targets osteoclast function downstream at bone surfaces, so this does not provide a therapeutic rationale for epididymal infection or inflammation, which is not an osteoclast-mediated process [^112j3t2g] [^114Yt37K] [^116JMJMv] [^1138g7iX].

> I should confirm guideline endorsement or lack thereof; I need to check CDC and EAU guidance carefully. Reviewing CDC STI guidelines and contemporary EAU urological infection guidance, there is no mention or endorsement of alendronate or any bisphosphonate for epididymitis, and recommended therapy centers on targeted antimicrobials and adjunctive measures, confirming an absence of support for bisphosphonates in this setting [^112nyLca] [^114DZQT2] [^1159jTK5] [^1169FdTM] [^116viPZu].

> Next, I should review the specific, evidence-based antibiotic regimens and be precise; wait, let me verify dosing because I recall a potentially confusing doxycycline DR entry. For likely chlamydial/gonococcal disease, CDC recommends ceftriaxone 500 mg IM single dose (1,000 mg if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days, with modification to include levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 10 days when enteric coverage is indicated, especially in insertive anal intercourse, and levofloxacin monotherapy 500 mg daily for 10 days if gonorrhea has been excluded and enteric organisms are likely; I initially noted a doxycycline hyclate DR 120 mg twice daily reference, but wait, I should double-check and adhere to the CDC-standard doxycycline 100 mg twice daily regimen rather than the DR-specific 120 mg, to avoid dosing errors in this context [^112nyLca] [^1159jTK5] [^114DZQT2] [^117NZooN] [^116qNK83].

> I will now examine harms if alendronate were inappropriately used here; I need to ensure I weigh risk without plausible benefit. Alendronate can cause significant upper GI adverse effects including esophagitis, erosions, ulcers, and perforation necessitating strict administration instructions, it carries risks of hypocalcemia, severe musculoskeletal pain, atypical femoral fractures, and osteonecrosis of the jaw, and it is contraindicated in certain esophageal disorders and generally avoided in severe renal impairment, all of which represent nontrivial hazards with no offsetting benefit in epididymitis [^1119xMb9] [^113cdCQh] [^111K4XYY] [^111BAUdg].

> Let me think about the full management picture to ensure nothing is missed; I should confirm diagnostic and adjunctive steps. When torsion cannot be excluded clinically, urgent scrotal ultrasound is indicated, and supportive measures such as bed rest, scrotal elevation, and NSAIDs are recommended adjuncts; patients with suspected STI-related epididymitis should be counseled regarding partner notification and presumptive treatment of partners, while severe pain, systemic illness, poor adherence, or concern for complications should prompt specialist referral or hospital admission, and lack of clinical improvement within 72 hours should trigger reassessment of diagnosis and therapy [^111aACwo] [^112DQcwx] [^111PsXPB] [^111PB6CJ] [^1171BRpJ].

> Synthesizing this, I should double-check that no evidence supports alendronate in this condition and that recommended care is clear. There is a complete mechanism and evidence mismatch for alendronate in acute epididymitis, no guideline endorsement, and meaningful medication risks, whereas effective, guideline-backed antibiotic regimens with supportive care exist; therefore, alendronate has no role in managing acute epididymitis, and care should follow CDC and EAU recommendations with pathogen-directed antibiotics, appropriate imaging when torsion is a concern, and timely follow-up if symptoms do not improve [^112nyLca] [^1169FdTM] [^1138g7iX] [^1119xMb9].

---

For acute epididymitis, alendronate is not indicated [^112grdfc] and is therefore **not recommended** because it is a bisphosphonate that targets bone resorption [^1138g7iX] and has no antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity relevant to this condition [^112tJA7o]. Acute epididymitis is managed with pathogen-directed antibiotics and supportive care [^112DQcwx]; alendronate offers no clinical benefit and is **not recommended by any guideline** [^112nyLca] [^1169FdTM]. Use of alendronate in this context risks unnecessary adverse effects without therapeutic gain [^1119xMb9].

---

## Pharmacological properties of alendronate

Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that **inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption** [^1138g7iX], increasing bone mineral density and reducing fracture risk in osteoporosis and related bone disorders [^112sm93Z] [^112grdfc]. It has **no antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity** relevant to acute epididymitis [^112tJA7o].

---

## Pathophysiology of acute epididymitis

Acute epididymitis is typically caused by **bacterial ascent from the urethra or bladder** [^1173XH2k], most often due to sexually transmitted pathogens (e.g. Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae) in younger men [^112nyLca], or to enteric organisms (e.g. Escherichia coli) in older men or those with urinary tract abnormalities [^114DZQT2]. The condition is characterized by acute inflammation, pain, swelling, and potential complications such as abscess formation, infertility, and chronic pain if left untreated [^1173XH2k].

---

## Current standard treatment guidelines

Current guidelines from the CDC and EAU recommend **antibiotic therapy tailored to the likely causative organisms** [^112nyLca] [^1169FdTM]. For **sexually transmitted pathogens**, use ceftriaxone 500 mg IM (1,000 mg if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 10 days [^112nyLca]. For **enteric organisms** [^1118oLGR], use levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily for 10 days or ofloxacin 300 mg PO BID for 10 days [^114DZQT2]. Supportive measures — such as **bed rest, scrotal elevation, and NSAIDs** — are also recommended [^112DQcwx].

---

## Evidence regarding alendronate in acute epididymitis

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for alendronate in acute epididymitis [^112nyLca] [^1169FdTM]. Its mechanism of action does not address the underlying infectious or inflammatory processes, and it lacks antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory properties relevant to epididymitis [^116MQKqN].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Using alendronate for acute epididymitis carries unnecessary risks, including:

- **Gastrointestinal irritation**: Esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and gastrointestinal discomfort [^1119xMb9].

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Severe bone, joint, or muscle pain [^1119xMb9].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Particularly in patients with predisposing conditions [^1119xMb9].

- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Rare but serious complication [^1119xMb9].

These risks **outweigh any hypothetical benefit**, given the lack of evidence for efficacy in this setting.

---

## Clinical recommendations

Given the absence of evidence and guideline support, alendronate **should not be used** for acute epididymitis [^112nyLca] [^1169FdTM]. Clinicians should adhere to established antibiotic regimens and supportive care tailored to the likely causative organisms and patient-specific factors [^111x9tWF].

---

Alendronate is **not indicated** [^112grdfc] for acute epididymitis due to its lack of antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory activity [^112tJA7o]. The condition should be managed with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care, and alendronate use in this context is not supported by clinical evidence or guidelines [^112nyLca] [^1169FdTM].

### Fosamax [^1138g7iX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H]alendronate in bone showed about a 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in the bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover, i.e. the number of sites at which bone is remodeled. In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114DZQT2]. MMWR. Recommendations and reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute epididymitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend initiating levofloxacin 500 mg PO once daily for 10 days in patients with acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms (such as patients after prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary tract instrumentation procedures). This is applicable if gonorrhea has been excluded by Gram, methylene blue, or gentian violet stain. Treatment should be guided by bacterial cultures and antimicrobial susceptibilities.

### Epididymitis: An overview [^1173XH2k]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute epididymitis:

- **Definition**: Acute epididymitis is the acute inflammation of the epididymis characterized by pain and scrotal swelling present for less than six weeks.

- **Pathophysiology**: Acute epididymitis is caused by several factors: bacterial ascent, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs); viral genesis, like adenovirus and enterovirus; fungi, including C. albicans and Histoplasma capsulatum; parasites, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Schistosoma species, and filariasis. Other causes include drug-induced factors (e.g. amiodarone), rheumatic conditions (Behçet's disease, vasculitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura), obstruction (e.g. post-vasectomy), genital trauma, and sterile reflux.

- **Disease course**: Inflammation of the epididymis results in acute epididymis, which causes clinical manifestations of gradual unilateral scrotal pain and epididymal swelling, accompanied by symptoms of fever, hematuria, dysuria, and urinary frequency. Disease progression may lead to complications such as abscess formation or Fournier gangrene, infertility, and chronic pain.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute epididymitis is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Severely suppressed bone turnover: a potential complication of alendronate therapy [^116DRbTG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Alendronate, an inhibitor of bone resorption, is widely used in osteoporosis treatment. However, concerns have been raised about potential oversuppression of bone turnover during long-term use. We report on nine patients who sustained spontaneous nonspinal fractures while on alendronate therapy, six of whom displayed either delayed or absent fracture healing for 3 months to 2 years during therapy. Histomorphometric analysis of the cancellous bone showed markedly suppressed bone formation, with reduced or absent osteoblastic surface in most patients. Osteoclastic surface was low or low-normal in eight patients, and eroded surface was decreased in four. Matrix synthesis was markedly diminished, with the absence of double-tetracycline label and absent or reduced single-tetracycline label in all patients. The same trend was seen in the intracortical and endocortical surfaces. Our findings raise the possibility that severe suppression of bone turnover may develop during long-term alendronate therapy, resulting in increased susceptibility to, and delayed healing of, nonspinal fractures. Although coadministration of estrogen or glucocorticoids appears to be a predisposing factor, this apparent complication can also occur with monotherapy. Our observations emphasize the need for increased awareness and monitoring for the potential development of excessive suppression of bone turnover during long-term alendronate therapy.

### Epididymitis: an overview [^114piZPz]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Epididymitis, an inflammation of the epididymis, is commonly observed in the outpatient setting. The etiology and treatment depend on patient age and the likely causative organisms. Epididymitis typically presents as a gradual onset of posterior scrotal pain, which may be accompanied by urinary symptoms such as dysuria and urinary frequency. Physical examination findings include a swollen and tender epididymis with the testis in an anatomically normal position.

Although the exact etiology is largely unknown, urine reflux into the ejaculatory ducts is considered the most common cause of epididymitis in children younger than 14 years. In sexually active males aged 14 to 35, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most common pathogens. The recommended treatment in this age group is a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone, followed by 10 days of oral doxycycline.

- **Patients who practice insertive anal intercourse**: An enteric organism in addition to the common pathogens is likely, and the recommended regimen includes ceftriaxone with 10 days of oral levofloxacin or ofloxacin.
- **Men older than 35 years**: Epididymitis is usually caused by enteric bacteria transported by urine reflux into the ejaculatory ducts secondary to bladder outlet obstruction; levofloxacin or ofloxacin alone is sufficient to treat these infections.

Recognition and prompt therapy are vital to reduce patient morbidity because untreated acute epididymitis can lead to infertility and chronic scrotal pain.

### The effects of parathyroid hormone, alendronate, or both in men with osteoporosis [^111Z1Dox]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Because parathyroid hormone increases both bone formation and bone resorption, it is possible that combining parathyroid hormone with an antiresorptive agent will enhance its effect on bone mineral density.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 83 men, aged 46 to 85 years with low bone density, to receive alendronate (10 mg daily; 28 men), parathyroid hormone (40 microg subcutaneously daily; 27 men), or both (28 men). Alendronate therapy was administered for 30 months, with parathyroid hormone therapy beginning at month 6. The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine, proximal femur, radial shaft, and total body were measured every six months using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was measured at baseline and month 30 through quantitative computed tomography. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were assessed every six months. The primary endpoint was the rate of change in bone mineral density at the posteroanterior spine.

- **Results**: The bone mineral density at the lumbar spine increased significantly more in men treated with parathyroid hormone alone than in those in the other groups (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The bone mineral density at the femoral neck increased significantly more in the parathyroid hormone group than in the alendronate group (P < 0.001) or the combination-therapy group (P = 0.01). The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine increased significantly more in the combination-therapy group than in the alendronate group (P < 0.001). At 12 months, changes in serum alkaline phosphatase levels were noted.

### The patient with chronic epididymitis: Characterization of an enigmatic syndrome [^117FykPe]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

We provide a baseline description of men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, explore relevant associations that may be important etiological factors, and suggest a classification system and specific symptom assessment tool.

- **Materials and methods**: Men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, described as symptoms of discomfort or pain lasting at least 3 months in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis localized to one or both epididymides on clinical examination, completed an extensive specific clinical inventory questionnaire. Evaluation included demographics, preceding and concurrent clinical history, duration since diagnosis, associated and previous clinical associations, frequency and severity of prostatitis, voiding and sexual symptoms, specific and general quality of life, and history of investigation and/or treatment for the condition. Volunteers with no past or current history of chronic epididymitis completed similar clinical inventory questionnaires.

- **Results**: A total of 50 consecutive men aged 21 to 83 years (average age 46) diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, with an average symptom duration of 4.9 years (ranging from 0.25 to 29 years), were enrolled in the study. The average pain score plus or minus the standard deviation was 4.7 ± 2.1 (range 0 to 10). Of these men, 16% were reasonably satisfied with their quality of life. Although 66% of the patients thought about the symptoms some or a lot, only 30% found that symptoms kept them from doing the kinds of things they would usually do. The most common previous therapies recollected by the patients were antibiotics (74%).

### The utility of scrotal ultrasonography in the emergent setting: beyond epididymitis versus torsion [^113baDKy]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Scrotal pain is a common acute presentation for medical care. Testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis are two diagnoses for which early detection is critical, and their sonographic imaging features have been thoroughly described in the radiologic literature. Other important conditions of which radiologists must be aware, however, have received less attention. This article will highlight key traumatic and non-traumatic causes of acute scrotal pain other than testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis that may present in the emergency department setting.

### Bisphosphonates in renal osteodystrophy [^116WFbc5]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The present review considers the role that bisphosphonates may have in patients with renal failure. Although bisphosphonates are widely used to reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis, few studies have documented their effect in patients with renal osteodystrophy. The pathogenesis of bone loss after renal transplantation and the role of the recently identified osteoprotegerin/receptor activating nuclear factor-kappa B system is described. Inhibition of bone resorption may prove beneficial when high bone turnover is present, but there are potential drawbacks to the widespread use of bisphosphonates. These issues are discussed, with emphasis placed on reports published within the past 18 months.

### Effect of oral alendronate on bone mineral density and the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. The Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study Group [^112sm93Z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1995). High credibility.

The Alendronate Phase III Osteoporosis Treatment Study, published by Liberman UA and colleagues in 1995, explored the effects of alendronate therapy in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included a population of 994 female patients. The inclusion criteria specified postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, while exclusion criteria included treatments with corticosteroids, vitamin D deficiency, Paget's disease or hyperparathyroidism, active peptic ulcer disease, and abnormal renal or hepatic function.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Alendronate group**: 526 patients received 5 or 10 mg daily for three years, or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year.
	- **Placebo group**: 355 patients received a matching placebo.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in new vertebral fractures was observed in the alendronate group compared to the placebo group (3.2% vs. 6.2%; relative risk [RR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 0.95).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant reduction in the progression of vertebral deformities in the alendronate group (33% vs. 41%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.51).

### SPL drug information for alendronate sodium [^111K4XYY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Contraindications regarding the use of alendronate sodium PO (also known as Binosto, Fosamax):

- **Delayed esophageal emptying**: Do not use alendronate in patients with conditions delaying esophageal emptying, such as stricture or achalasia, or in patients unable to sit upright for at least 30 minutes.

- **Hypocalcemia**: Correct hypocalcemia before initiating alendronate. Correct other mineral metabolism disturbances, including vitamin D deficiency, if present. Monitor serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia throughout treatment.

### Alendronate does not interfere with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scanning [^11119bLS]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Several studies have found that administration of etidronate results in competitive interference with 99mTc-labeled bone scanning reagents. In contrast, this problem was not encountered with other bisphosphonates.

- **Methods**: We prospectively studied 9 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scanning was performed before they received alendronate, and scanning was repeated a mean of 16.6 days afterward, when the patients had been receiving 40 mg alendronate daily for a mean of 6 days. In addition, 7 patients who underwent delayed scanning when they had been receiving alendronate for a mean of 111 days were also restudied. Quantitative whole-body bone scanning was performed, and radioactivity deposited in the bone metastasis was determined using region-of-interest analysis.

- **Results**: A less than 6% increase in whole-body retention of 99mTc-MDP was seen on the initial post-alendronate scan compared with the baseline scan. No significant differences in activity were seen in the bone lesion evaluated on the baseline and initial post-alendronate studies. The delayed post-alendronate scan generally showed similar or higher tracer accumulation compared with the baseline scan.

- **Conclusion**: Alendronate did not competitively inhibit uptake of 99mTc-MDP in the skeleton or tumor metastasis. Use of alendronate before bone scanning is unlikely to result in decreased detection of lesions or falsely decreased 99mTc-MDP activity at metastatic bone tumor sites.

### Alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis in men [^114bRLwy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). High credibility.

The study "Alendronate for the treatment of osteoporosis in men" was published by Orwoll E. and colleagues in 2000 in the journal The New England Journal of Medicine. This study focuses on osteoporosis in men.

- **Study question**: What is the role of alendronate in male patients with osteoporosis?
- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blind, RCT.
- **Population**: 241 male patients.
	- **Inclusion criteria**: Male patients with osteoporosis.
	- **Exclusion criteria**: Medical conditions associated with bone loss, other bone diseases, vitamin D deficiency, renal disease, severe cardiac disease, or history of treatment for osteoporosis.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 146 received alendronate (10 mg daily for up to 2 years).
	- n = 95 received placebo (matching placebo daily for up to 2 years).

- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine at 2 years (7.1% vs. 1.8%; ARD 5.3, 95% CI 4.3 to 6.3).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in vertebral fractures (0.8% vs. 7.1%; RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.2).
	- Significant increase in bone mineral density at the total body at 2 years (2% vs. 0.4%; AD 1.6%, 95% CI 1 to 2.1).

- **Conclusion**: In male patients with osteoporosis, alendronate was superior to placebo in increasing bone mineral density and reducing vertebral fractures.

### Epididymitis: An overview [^111CkCfm]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

Acute epididymitis is a disease that can be associated with various conditions and symptoms, including pelvic surgery, urethral discharge, and decreased resistive index (RI) of the epididymal arteries. Additional associations include a positive urine bacterial culture, hematospermia, tachypnea, the presence of urine white blood cells (WBCs), urinary frequency, and acute bacterial prostatitis. An increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, spermatic cord tenderness, and decreased RI of the intratesticular arteries are also noted.

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) may be involved, along with testicular tenderness, urethritis, anoreceptive intercourse, chills, suprapubic pain, and hypotension. Other symptoms can include a testicular lump, hydrocele, elevated WBC count, testicular induration, and features specific to men who have sex with men (MSM), such as positive urine Neisseria gonorrhoeae PCR. The presence of Prehn's sign, inguinal lymphadenopathy, scrotal erythema, and positive urine leukocyte esterase tests may be observed.

The disease may manifest due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), with scrotal pain and testicular swelling commonly reported. Epididymal tenderness, testicular enlargement, tachycardia, and increased epididymal peak systolic velocity (PSV) could be present. Painful ejaculation and an enlarged prostate are also possible, as is a positive urine Chlamydia trachomatis DNA test. Additional symptoms include scrotal swelling, an inserted urinary catheter, fever, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

Prostatic tenderness, dysuria, urinary tract infections (UTI), and a positive cremasteric reflex are potential indicators, along with testicular pain.

### Management of acute epididymitis: Are European guidelines being followed [^1141srCf]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute epididymitis is increasing in men aged 35 years or under due to sexually-transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis. This study examines whether urological surgeons are adhering to European guidelines for managing acute epididymitis in these patients.

A postal questionnaire survey was conducted among specialists in urology in two regions of the UK. Of 79 completed replies, 41 (52%) specialists reported taking a detailed sexual history, but only 34 (43%) referred patients to a genitourinary medicine clinic. Quinolones, principally ciprofloxacin, are the most commonly prescribed first-line antibiotic by 56 (71%) of respondents.

The management of acute epididymitis in young men must be improved. Ciprofloxacin is not the optimal antimicrobial for treating urogenital chlamydial infection.

### Alendronate reduces periprosthetic bone loss after uncemented primary total hip arthroplasty: a prospective randomized study [^113BzUwN]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2001). High credibility.

Periprosthetic bone loss, especially in the proximal part of the femur, is common after cemented and uncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA). Bone loss can be progressive and, in the extreme, may threaten the survival of the prosthesis. To study whether alendronate therapy can reduce bone loss adjacent to prostheses, 13 uncemented primary THA patients were randomized to the study. They received 10 mg alendronate plus 500 mg calcium (n = 8) or 500 mg calcium only (n = 5) daily for 6 months of follow-up after THA. Periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) was measured with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

Decreases in periprosthetic BMD in the alendronate-treated group were lower compared with the changes in the calcium-only group in the same regions of interest at the same follow-up time. In the proximal femur, the mean BMD decrease was 17.1% in the calcium-only group, whereas in the alendronate-treated group, the decrease was only 0.9% (p = 0.019). The mean periprosthetic BMD change was also significantly different in the total periprosthetic area between the study groups at the end of the follow-up (calcium-only group -9.9% vs. alendronate-treated group -2.6%; p = 0.019).

Alendronate therapy led to a significant reduction in periprosthetic bone loss after primary uncemented THA compared with the changes found in patients without therapy. This kind of bone response may improve the support of the prosthesis and may result in better survival of the prosthesis. However, in this study, the follow-up time was too short and the study population was too small to make any long-term conclusions.

### Case report on secondary testicular necrosis due to fulminant epididymitis: Ultrasonographic evaluation and diagnosis [^111DXEzz]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Epididymitis is a common condition with possible severe complications. If epididymitis is suspected, we suggest starting medical treatment promptly. In our experience, scrotal ultrasound should be performed for the diagnosis of epididymitis and orchitis and should be repeated if there is a suspicion of doubtful blood supply to the testicle. This case provides the first clinical evidence to support associated funiculitis in this disease. Also, this case stresses the usefulness of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of testicular necrosis secondary to epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis.

### Comparison of effects of the bisphosphonate alendronate versus the RANKL inhibitor denosumab on murine fracture healing [^111Wq67L]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2009). Low credibility.

The role of osteoclast-mediated resorption during fracture healing was assessed. The impact of two osteoclast inhibitors with different mechanisms of action, alendronate (ALN) and denosumab (DMAB), were examined during fracture healing. Male human RANKL knock-in mice that express a chimeric (human/murine) form of RANKL received unilateral transverse femur fractures. Mice were treated biweekly with ALN 0.1 mg/kg, DMAB 10 mg/kg, or PBS (control) 0.1 mL until death at 21 and 42 days after fracture.

- **Treatment efficacy**: Assessed by serum levels of TRACP 5b, showed almost a complete elimination of TRACP 5b levels in the DMAB-treated animals but only approximately 25% reduction of serum levels in the ALN-treated mice.

- **Mechanical testing**: Showed that fractured femurs from both ALN and DMAB groups had significantly increased mechanical properties at day 42 compared with controls.

- **muCT analysis**: Showed that callus tissues from DMAB-treated mice had significantly greater percent bone volume and BMD than did both control and ALN-treated tissues at both 21 and 42 days, whereas ALN-treated bones only had greater percent bone volume and BMC than control at 42 days.

- **Qualitative histological analysis**: The 21- and 42-day ALN and DMAB groups had greater amounts of unresorbed cartilage or mineralized cartilage matrix compared with the controls, whereas unresorbed cartilage could still be seen in the DMAB groups at 42 days after fracture. Although ALN and DMAB delayed the removal of cartilage and the remodeling of the fracture callus, this did not diminish the mechanical integrity of the specimens by the conclusion of the study.

### Antibiotic regimens and intestinal colonization with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli [^111wtewj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The intestinal tract provides an important reservoir for antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli, including Enterobacteriaceae species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Selective pressure exerted by antibiotics plays a crucial role in the emergence and dissemination of these pathogens. Many classes of antibiotics may promote intestinal colonization by health care-associated gram-negative bacilli because the organisms are often multidrug resistant. Antibiotics may inhibit colonization by gram-negative pathogens that remain susceptible, but the benefits of this effect are often limited due to the emergence of resistance.

- **Antibiotic formulary alterations**: These changes, along with standard infection control measures, have been effective in controlling outbreaks of colonization and infection with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

- **Need for additional research**: Additional research is needed to clarify the role of strategies such as selective decontamination of the digestive tract, and decontamination of environmental surfaces and patients' skin and wounds.

### Alendronate inhibits bone resorption at the bone-screw interface [^1121W4BQ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

In the study, we investigated whether the systemic administration of alendronate, a third-generation bisphosphonate, suppressed the loosening of screws at the bone-screw interface. We systemically administered alendronate to rats fitted with external fixators. External fixators with two half pins were applied to the right femurs of rats, and alendronate was administered once a week during a 5-week postoperative period. Radiographic, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings subsequently were analyzed. Treatment with alendronate reduced the width of the fibrous loosening membrane and the number of osteoclasts at the bone-screw interface. These findings indicate that systemic treatment with alendronate exerts an inhibitory effect on local bone resorption at the bone-screw interface.

### Efficacy of alendronate in the treatment of low bone density in the pediatric and young adult population [^116FPq8S]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Pediatric osteoporosis is uncommon but can result in painful and debilitating insufficiency fractures. Treatment options for osteoporosis in children are limited. Although bisphosphonate therapy for children has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, its use in this population has been increasing. Randomized controlled studies have not been conducted due to the small subject pool and the ethical difficulty of randomizing a child with an insufficiency fracture to a placebo arm of a study. This retrospective case-control study involving children with primarily neuromuscular disease was conducted to review changes in bone mineral density as measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning.

- **Methods**: Medical records and DXA scans were screened to identify children with low bone density who had been treated with alendronate as well as similar control subjects with low bone density for their age who had not received alendronate. Medication acquisition was confirmed by refill records, and cumulative exposure was calculated. Interval DXA scans were reviewed to correlate changes in bone mineral density (in grams per square centimeter) as well as the percent change and percent change over time for both alendronate-treated and control subjects.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight alendronate-treated subjects and thirty control subjects met the inclusion criteria. No significant improvement in bone mineral density was observed in the alendronate-treated subjects compared with the control subjects. Some patients in both groups showed marked improvement, with…

### Binosto [^112tJA7o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment but inhibits osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [3H]alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [3H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in the bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e. the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption.

### Effect of alendronate treatment on bone mineral density in male patients with osteoporosis [^111zRhob]. Endocrine Practice (2004). High credibility.

To assess the efficacy of alendronate therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and hip in men with osteoporosis, medical records of male patients with osteoporosis, who had undergone follow-up in the Endocrinology Clinic at the National Naval Medical Center, were reviewed. Nine patients treated with alendronate for at least one year were identified. Patients were excluded from analysis if they had evidence of osteomalacia or if baseline and follow-up BMD results on the same dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) densitometer, at least 10 months apart, were not available. DEXA BMD results at the lumbar spine and hip, before and after at least 10 months of alendronate treatment, were analyzed for significant differences. Patients were also receiving calcium supplementation (1,000 to 1,500 mg/day), and all but one patient received vitamin D (400 to 800 U/day).

Lumbar spine BMD increased by 6.4 ± 1.8% per year with alendronate treatment (P = 0.008). A mean absolute gain of 0.052 ± 0.010 g/cm² was noted for the entire study group (N = 9), following a mean duration of treatment of 14 ± 1 months (P = 0.005). The mean lumbar spine BMD Z score improved by 0.40 ± 0.09 (P = 0.002) with alendronate therapy. The femoral neck BMD also increased by 4.5 ± 1.4% per year with alendronate treatment (P = 0.013). The mean absolute gain in femoral neck BMD was 0.028 ± 0.009 g/cm² for the study group (N = 9) after 14 ± 1 months of therapy (P = 0.013). The mean femoral neck BMD Z score improved by 0.30 ± 0.08.

### Role of bisphosphonates in prostate cancer [^1127JNyN]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate the role of bisphosphonates in the long-term supportive care of patients with prostate cancer, an emerging medical challenge, studies were conducted. Although therapeutic options have extended the survival of patients with prostate cancer, these patients often develop skeletal morbidity from disease and treatment-related effects that undermine skeletal integrity.

- **Methods**: Studies were identified through MEDLINE searches, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from scientific meetings.

- **Results**: Low bone mass is prevalent in patients in the early stages of prostate cancer, although the reasons for this correlation are unknown. Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by either pharmaceutical (including hormonal) or surgical castration causes significant decreases in bone mineral density. Pamidronate has been shown to prevent bone loss, whereas zoledronic acid has been shown to increase bone mass in men undergoing ADT. Finally, zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing objectively measurable skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer.

- **Conclusion**: Bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid in particular, have potent activities against osteoclasts, which affect bone integrity. Zoledronic acid has now become an additional option that can provide benefits to patients with prostate cancer throughout the course of their disease.

### Rankl regulates male reproductive function [^114Yt37K]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

RANKL signaling in male reproductive tract and human spermatozoa was observed in various tissues. Interestingly, RANKL was abundantly expressed in the luminal cytoplasm of all human epididymal compartments, the prostate gland, and seminal vesicle. The expression varied across different organs, but there was abundant expression in the luminal cytoplasm of epithelial cells in the corpus, cauda epididymis, and prostate. RANK was also expressed in the caput and cauda epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle, with the strongest expression in the cauda epididymis. In contrast, OPG was expressed predominantly in the basal cells surrounding the luminal epithelial cells and in very few epithelial cells on the luminal site of the epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle. RANKL was also expressed in the acrosomal region of most human spermatozoa, suggesting a possible role in mature spermatozoa. Additionally, Denosumab induced no change in intracellular calcium concentration in human spermatozoa and had no relevant effects on the subsequent progesterone response, which is an important stimulating signal during fertilization. Moreover, Denosumab had no effect compared with vehicle treatment on the acrosome reaction.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor-associated severe epididymo-orchitis [^116BEu2f]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A man in his late 50s, with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and morbid obesity, presented to the hospital with complicated epididymo-orchitis. The onset of symptoms (scrotal pain, erythema, and swelling) occurred after the use of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, for two months. His baseline antidiabetic medications were insulin, glipizide, and metformin. Initially, he had failed treatment of epididymo-orchitis with oral levofloxacin for three weeks, followed by two weeks of doxycycline therapy.

At the presentation to the hospital, an ultrasound of the scrotum revealed scrotal and right testicular abscess. The patient underwent right inguinal orchiectomy. Postoperatively, pus culture was positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Candida glabrata, and hence, he was treated with oral antibiotics, including high-dose antifungal medications. Adequate wound care and regular follow-up demonstrated resolution of infection. This case highlights the risk of severe urogenital infection associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the setting of uncontrolled T2DM.

### Are antibiotics necessary for pediatric epididymitis [^116sJFvD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

To determine the percentage of cases of epididymitis in pediatric patients that is of bacterial cause and to identify factors that predict a positive urine culture, we conducted a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis in one pediatric emergency department over 11 years. Charts were reviewed for historical, physical, laboratory, and radiologic data. A positive urine culture was used to identify patients with a bacterial cause of epididymitis.

A total of 160 patient records were initially identified as having a diagnosis of epididymitis; of these, 20 met exclusion criteria or did not have records available for review, leaving 140 cases of epididymitis for analysis. Patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 17 years, with a median age of 11 years. Of these patients, 91% received empiric antibiotic therapy. Additionally, 97 (69%) had a urine culture sent, of whom 4 (4.1%; 95% confidence interval, 1.1%-10.2%) were positive. Of the 4 positive urine cultures, 3 had organisms not sensitive to typical empiric therapy for urinary tract infections. The boys with positive urine cultures were not significantly different from the other patients regarding age, maximum temperature, or number of white blood cells on urinalysis.

Given the low incidence of urinary tract infections in boys with epididymitis, in prepubertal patients, antibiotic therapy can be reserved for young infants and those with pyuria or positive urine cultures. Because it is difficult to predict which patients will have a positive urine culture, consideration should be given to reducing the routine use of antibiotics in this population.

### Epididymitis after prostate brachytherapy [^114xcAV4]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to analyze the incidence, time-course, and potential predisposing factors for clinically diagnosed postimplant epididymitis.

- **Methods**: Of the 517 patients randomized and treated under two protocols, aiming for a total of 1200 participants, 5 developed clinically diagnosed epididymitis following iodine-125 or palladium-103 prostate brachytherapy. Standard implant techniques were used with a modified peripheral loading pattern. Perioperative antibiotics, either cefazolin or ciprofloxacin, were administered to 258 patients based on physician preference. Treatment-related morbidity was monitored through mailed questionnaires employing standard American Urological Association (AUA) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria at intervals of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Non-respondents to the questionnaires were followed up by telephone interviews. Although epididymitis was not specifically queried, its occurrence was documented during routine follow-up examinations.

- **Results**: Postimplant epididymitis was observed in 5 (1%) of the 517 brachytherapy patients. None of these 5 patients had a prior history of orchitis, epididymitis, vasectomy, or preimplant catheterization. Symptoms of epididymitis emerged at 4, 7, 10, 150, and 300 days post-implantation. The patients affected had prostate volumes, preimplant AUA scores, and ages consistent with other implant recipients. There was no apparent association between postimplant epididymitis and the degree of implant-related prostate swelling or the nu…

### Evaluating the necessity of antibiotics in the treatment of acute epididymitis in pediatric patients: A literature review of retrospective studies and data analysis [^112nh3kZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

This literature review and data analysis aim to evaluate the percentage of pediatric patients with acute epididymitis who were found to have a bacterial etiology and the percentage of patients in these studies that were treated with antibiotic therapy versus conservative therapy.

- **Methods**: A search of EBSCO through January 13, 2016, using the keywords "epididymitis" or "epididymo-orchitis" and "child", "children", or "pediatric", identified 542 potential studies. Twenty-seven retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria, containing patients aged 21 years or younger with acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis. Data on the number and age of patients, urine cultures and urinalysis results, number of patients treated with antibiotics, and incidence were extracted.

- **Results**: A total of 1,496 patients with acute epididymitis were identified. Urinalysis was obtained for 1,124 patients, and 190 (16.9%) were positive. A urine culture was obtained for 670 patients, and 100 (14.9%) were positive. Fourteen studies addressed antibiotic administration wherein 652 patients were with acute epididymitis and 554 (85%) received antibiotics. Of 502 patients with urinalysis results, urine culture results, and antibiotic treatment rates, 54 (10.8%) were positive for a bacterial source. Antibiotics were administered to 410 (81.7%) of these 502 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Practitioners should consider only prescribing antibiotics to patients with acute epididymitis if there is an abnormal urinalysis or urine culture.

### The use of bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis [^115osCxP]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

The bisphosphonates alendronate and risedronate, given orally once weekly, are the cornerstone of treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis, as well as male and secondary osteoporosis. They significantly reduce the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures; these effects appear early, within 6–12 months, and seem to be sustained. Several questions remain unanswered. In addition, data on a new bisphosphonate became available in 2004.

The optimal duration of treatment has not been clearly established. Long-term data with alendronate are now available, indicating a persistence of alendronate effects on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers several years after stopping treatment given for 5 years. Whether these effects translate into sustained reduction of fractures needs further analysis. Due to their efficacy, bisphosphonate use has been explored in other forms of osteoporosis, such as after androgen deprivation therapy for prostatic cancer. The challenge of long-term compliance with osteoporosis treatment has led to the use of intermittent bisphosphonate. The effects of intermittent oral and intravenous ibandronate on bone mineral density, bone turnover, and fractures have been recently reported.

The mechanism by which bisphosphonates improve bone strength is not yet fully understood but probably involves complex effects on different components of bone strength, such as microarchitecture.

European Urology (2013). High credibility.

Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) induces loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and increases the risk of fractures in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). We sought to determine whether a weekly dose of alendronate, an oral bisphosphonate, could reduce this unwanted side effect.

- **Objective**: To assess whether once-weekly oral alendronate therapy would maintain or improve BMD in men initiating ADT for localised PCa.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study was conducted. We included hormonally naïve PCa patients initiating ADT with leuprolide acetate 30 mg intramuscularly every 4 months.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomised to receive either oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly or placebo for 1 year. Both groups received daily calcium 1 g and vitamin D 400 international units.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Changes in BMD (at the lumbar spine [LS] and total hip [TH]) and bone markers were measured.

- **Results and limitations**: One hundred ninety-one subjects were enrolled, and 186 were randomised between alendronate (n = 84) and placebo (n = 102). The alendronate group demonstrated a mean spine BMD increase of 1.7% compared with -1.9% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). Alendronate also increased the BMD at the hip (percent change: 0.7%) compared to placebo (-1.6%). Median urinary N-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen (Ntx) values decreased by 3.5% in the alendronate group and increased by 16.5% in the placebo arm, even after adjusting for centre (p = 0.510) and baseline urinary Ntx (p < 0.0001).

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute onset of scrotal pain-without trauma, without antecedent mass [^117L1kG2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as testicular swelling with acute pain and can reflect multiple etiologies, including epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the spermatic cord, or torsion of the testicular appendages. Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum and its etiology with imaging is necessary because a delayed diagnosis of torsion for as little as 6 hours can cause irreparable testicular damage.

Ultrasound duplex Doppler of the scrotum is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for the acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass in an adult or child. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Rankl regulates male reproductive function [^116JMJMv]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

RANKL, RANK, and OPG are expressed in the testis of mice, and inhibition of RANKL increases testicular weight and sperm count.

RANKL, RANK, and OPG were detected in the mouse testis and epididymis at 16–18 weeks of age (Fig. 1a–d; Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). RANKL was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm/membrane of mature Sertoli cells co-expressing SOX9 in the nuclei. RANKL expression was also detected in the cytoplasm of most spermatocytes and some spermatids but not in spermatogonia. RANK was expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of the VASA-positive germ cells, particularly in spermatogonia and spermatids, and in some spermatocytes. OPG was expressed in the cytoplasm of most spermatogonia, the junction between peritubular cells and spermatogonia, spermatids, and some peritubular cells. In the epididymis, RANKL was markedly expressed in the caput, while being undetectable or with low expression in the corpus and cauda epididymis. RANK and OPG were also expressed in the epididymis, with expression varying in different segments.

To manipulate gonadal cell–cell signaling of RANKL, the RANKL inhibitor OPG (1 mg/kg) was injected twice a week for two or five weeks into C57BL/6 mice. OPG treatment for two weeks significantly increased testicular weight and germ cell epithelial height of seminiferous tubules at stage VII–VIII when compared with vehicle-treated mice. Two weeks of OPG treatment also increased sperm count.

### How would you manage this patient with osteoporosis? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^113Dhr5S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone strength that increases the risk for fracture. Approximately 10 million men and women in the United States have osteoporosis, and more than 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually.

In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists issued the "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis", and in 2017, the American College of Physicians issued the guideline "Treatment of Low Bone Density or Osteoporosis to Prevent Fracture in Men and Women". Both guidelines agree that patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated with an antiresorptive agent, such as alendronate, that has been shown to reduce hip and vertebral fractures. However, there is no consensus on how long patients with osteoporosis should be treated and whether bone density should be monitored during and after the treatment period.

In this Beyond the Guidelines discussion, two experts address the management of osteoporosis in general and for a specific patient. They discuss the role of bone density monitoring during and following a 5-year course of alendronate and provide treatment recommendations for a patient whose bone density decreases during or after this period.

### Bone health in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: The role of bisphosphonates [^112GcehB]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Androgen-deprivation therapy, a mainstay in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer, is associated with significant bone loss and related complications such as fractures. Bisphosphonates, which are osteoclast inhibitors, are effective in preventing skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic prostate cancer and also in preventing bone loss in patients with locally advanced disease. Understanding the management of bone health, including identifying patients at risk, selecting the most appropriate therapy, and monitoring and managing side effects, is critical. This review provides the most recent bone health risk factor and bisphosphonate data available for prostate cancer patients.

### Ibandronate sodium [^112yZ62i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ibandronate sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis with fatalities, angioedema, asthma exacerbation, bronchospasm, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis bullous [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Hypocalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Renal toxicity**: Acute renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Osteonecrosis of the jaw and other oro-facial sites, including the external auditory canal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

- **Atypical femoral shaft fracture**: Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

- **Eye inflammation**: Iritis and uveitis. In some cases with other bisphosphonates, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued.

### Kit for the preparation of technetium Tc 99m medronate [^114XkU1Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Medronate Injection and are NOT to be administered directly to the patient. Technetium Tc 99m Medronate Injection, as well as other radioactive drugs, must be handled with care, and appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and clinical personnel consistent with proper patient management.

To minimize radiation dose to the bladder, patients should be encouraged to drink fluids and to void immediately before the examination and as often thereafter as possible for the next 4 to 6 hours. Technetium Tc 99m Medronate Injection should be formulated within six hours prior to clinical use. Optimal imaging results are obtained 1 to 4 hours after administration. The finding of an abnormal concentration of radioactivity implies the existence of underlying pathology. However, further study is required to distinguish benign from malignant lesions. The image quality may be adversely affected by obesity, old age, or impaired renal function.

The components of the kit are sterile and non-pyrogenic. It is essential to follow directions carefully and adhere to strict aseptic procedures during preparation. Technetium Tc 99m labeling reactions depend on maintaining the stannous ion in the reduced state; hence, Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m Injection containing oxidants should not be used.

### Binosto [^114EXt8Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

To assess the effects of alendronate sodium on the incidence of vertebral fractures (detected by digitized radiography; approximately one third of these were clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared placebo to the pooled dosage groups of alendronate sodium (5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48% relative risk reduction). A reduction in the total number of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who received alendronate had a loss in stature that was statistically significantly less than was observed in those who received placebo (-3.0 mm vs. -4.6 mm).

The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) consisted of two studies in postmenopausal women: the Three-Year Study of patients who had at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture and the Four-Year Study of patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture. In both studies of FIT, 96% of randomized patients completed the studies (i.e. had a closeout visit at the scheduled end of the study); approximately 80% of patients were still taking study medication upon completion.

### Randomized trial of effect of alendronate continuation versus discontinuation in women with low BMD: Results from the Fracture Intervention Trial long-term extension [^116LuYtv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2004). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of continuation versus discontinuation of alendronate on BMD and markers of bone turnover, we conducted an extension trial in which 1,099 older women who received alendronate in the FIT were re-randomized to alendronate or placebo. Compared with women who stopped alendronate, those continuing alendronate for 3 years maintained a higher BMD and greater reduction of bone turnover, showing the benefit of continued treatment. However, among women who discontinued alendronate and took placebo in the extension, BMD remained higher, and reduction in bone turnover was greater than values at FIT baseline, showing the persistence of alendronate's effects on bone.

- **Introduction**: Prior trials, including the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), have found that therapy with alendronate increases BMD and decreases fracture risk for up to 4 years in postmenopausal women with low BMD. However, it is uncertain whether further therapy with alendronate results in the preservation or further gains in BMD and if the skeletal effects of alendronate continue after treatment is stopped.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a follow-up placebo-controlled extension trial to FIT (FIT Long-Term Extension [FLEX]) in which 1,099 women aged 60–86 years who were assigned to alendronate in FIT, with an average duration of use of 5 years, were re-randomized for an additional 5 years to alendronate or placebo. The results of a preplanned interim analysis at 3 years are reported herein. Participants were re-randomized to alendronate 10 mg/day (30%), alendronate 5 mg/day (30%), or placebo (40%).

### A randomized double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of teriparatide [recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–34)] with alendronate in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^113V7G65]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). High credibility.

Teriparatide (rDNA origin) injection [recombinant human PTH (1–34)] stimulates bone formation, increases bone mineral density (BMD), and restores bone architecture and integrity. In contrast, bisphosphonates reduce bone resorption and increase BMD. We compared the effects of teriparatide and alendronate sodium on BMD, nonvertebral fracture incidence, and bone turnover in 146 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomized to either once-daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide 40 micrograms plus oral placebo (n = 73) or oral alendronate 10 mg plus placebo injection (n = 73). The median duration of treatment was 14 months.

- **Lumbar spine BMD**: At 3 months, teriparatide significantly increased lumbar spine BMD more than alendronate (P < 0.001). Lumbar spine BMD increased by 12.2% in the teriparatide group and 5.6% in the alendronate group (P < 0.001 for teriparatide vs. alendronate).

- **Femoral neck BMD and total body bone mineral**: Teriparatide increased femoral neck BMD and total body bone mineral significantly more than alendronate, but BMD at the one-third distal radius decreased compared with alendronate (P ≤ 0.05).

- **Nonvertebral fracture incidence**: Significantly lower in the teriparatide group than in the alendronate group (P < 0.05).

Both treatments were well tolerated despite transient mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia with teriparatide treatment. In conclusion, teriparatide, a bone formation agent, increased BMD at most sites and decreased nonvertebral fractures more than alendronate.

### Therapeutic equivalence of alendronate 35 milligrams once weekly and 5 milligrams daily in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^114vmkcz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alendronate 35 mg once weekly compared with alendronate 5 mg daily in the prevention of osteoporosis.

- **Methods**: We compared the efficacy and safety of treatment with alendronate 35 mg once weekly (n = 362) and alendronate 5 mg daily (n = 361) in a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women (6 months or greater), aged 40–70 years, with lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density T-scores between -2.5 and 1. The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparability of lumbar spine bone mineral density increases, defined by strict prespecified criteria.

- **Results**: Mean increases in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months were equivalent (difference between the alendronate 35-mg once-weekly group and the alendronate 5-mg daily group [90% confidence interval] at month 12 was -0.3% [-0.6, 0.1], well within the prespecified bounds of ± 1.0%). Bone mineral density increases at other skeletal sites and effects on bone turnover were also virtually identical for the two dosing regimens. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated, and the larger weekly unit dose was not associated with an increased frequency of upper gastrointestinal events.

The conclusion is that alendronate 35 mg once weekly is therapeutically equivalent to alendronate 5 mg daily and provides patients with greater dosing convenience, in addition to the proven efficacy of alendronate and good tolerability.

### SPL drug information for alendronate sodium [^113cdCQh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of alendronate sodium PO (also known as Binosto, Fosamax):

- **Increased serum sodium**: Use caution in patients requiring sodium restriction, including those with a history of heart failure (HF), hypertension, or other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as alendronate effervescent tablets contain 650 mg of sodium.

- **Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Exercise caution in patients with poor oral hygiene, periodontal and/or other dental diseases, ill-fitting dentures, undergoing invasive dental procedures, having comorbid disorders (such as cancer, anemia, coagulopathy, infection), or receiving chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or angiogenesis inhibitors. Perform a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry before initiating alendronate.

- **Musculoskeletal pain, atypical femoral fracture**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as alendronate has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Evaluate patients with new thigh or groin pain to rule out an incomplete femoral fracture. Consider discontinuing treatment.

- **Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, esophagitis, esophageal perforation**: Use caution in patients with active upper gastrointestinal diseases, including Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, gastritis, duodenitis, or peptic ulcers. Advise patients to take alendronate with an adequate amount of water and not to lie down for at least 30 minutes.

### Rankl regulates male reproductive function [^112j3t2g]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The marked expression of RANKL in the epithelia lining the epididymis, prostate gland, and seminal vesicle indicates that inhibition of extra-gonadal RANKL may influence reproductive function. RANK was also expressed in all organs lining the reproductive tract, while OPG was found in a few of the luminal epithelial cells of all organs lining the male reproductive tract. RANKL signaling may have a role in the epithelia but could also signal to the spermatozoa, as expression of RANK and RANKL in spermatids and the acrosomal region of human spermatozoa supports a role during sperm maturation and potentially during ejaculation. However, Denosumab induced no change in intracellular calcium concentration, the progesterone response, or the acrosome reaction in human spermatozoa. This indicates that the possible role of RANKL in human spermatozoa may be different and could, in theory, be involved in binding to the epithelia of the female reproductive tract or the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. The 100-fold higher sRANKL concentration in seminal fluid compared with serum supports a biological role. It is plausible that RANKL is secreted, cleaved, or released from the epithelial cells in the reproductive tract under the control of local regulators, as there was no link between serum and seminal concentrations of sRANKL. A biological role of seminal RANKL was indicated by the negative associations between seminal sRANKL concentrations and semen quality variables, including the total number of progressive motile sperm and the total number of morphologically normal sperm.

### The role of bisphosphonates in the management of metastatic prostate cancer [^112jVaW1]. Current Oncology Reports (2003). High credibility.

Most men with advanced prostate cancer have primarily skeletal metastases, which are responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer. Although bone lesions are osteoblastic in radiographic appearance, recent evidence has demonstrated that anti-osteoclast therapy with bisphosphonates reduces skeletal-related complications in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. This observation may be explained by the demonstration that osteoclast activity is greatly upregulated even in osteoblastic metastases. Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy, the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer, leads to increased bone resorption and reduces bone mineral density. These effects can be ameliorated, and potentially completely prevented, by coadministration of bisphosphonates. These findings may point to a role for bisphosphonates in men with prostate cancer even prior to the development of skeletal metastases. Determination of whether such early therapy ultimately results in delayed time to skeletal progression or in improved survival will require large randomized studies.
