## Question

Rivaroxaban to prevent varicocele

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether rivaroxaban can prevent varicocele or has any role in prophylaxis against varicocele formation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of varicocele. Then, I should verify rivaroxaban's mechanism of action and labeled indications. Next, I will compare the disease mechanism with the drug's effects to check for a mechanistic match or mismatch. After that, I should review guideline-based management of varicocele to see what therapies are recommended. Finally, I need to consider potential harms of off-label anticoagulation and address edge scenarios like thrombosed varicocele or post-embolization thrombus.

> Let me first confirm the underlying biology of varicocele before jumping to any treatment assumptions. Varicocele is a dilatation of the pampiniform plexus caused primarily by venous valvular incompetence leading to retrograde reflux of warm abdominal blood into the scrotum, which over time can impair testicular function and fertility; importantly, this is a structural venous insufficiency problem rather than a thrombotic disorder.

> Now, I should verify what rivaroxaban actually does. Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that reduces thrombin generation and clot formation; it is indicated for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and certain cardiovascular risk reductions, but there is no indication related to venous valve function or prevention of venous dilatation; mechanistically, it does not repair valves or reverse reflux physiology [^117BXDu1] [^117BXDu1] [^112nLTzh].

> Hold on, let's not conflate conditions. The key question is whether an anticoagulant that prevents thrombosis can prevent a reflux-based venous dilatation. I need to ensure I am not mixing varicocele (valvular failure with reflux) with venous thrombosis (clot occlusion). Rivaroxaban prevents thrombosis, but it has no effect on venous valvular competence, vein wall remodeling, or hydrostatic reflux; therefore, the mechanism is mismatched to varicocele pathophysiology [^113YCMz3] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review evidence-based treatments for varicocele to confirm what is actually recommended. Guidelines and standards emphasize mechanical correction of refluxing veins: observation for asymptomatic cases, percutaneous embolization to occlude incompetent gonadal veins, or surgical varicocelectomy for appropriately selected patients with infertility and abnormal semen parameters; none recommend anticoagulation to prevent development or progression of varicocele [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX] [^113YCMz3].

> Wait, I should double-check potential downsides if someone empirically tried anticoagulation here. Anticoagulation carries bleeding risk without delivering pathophysiologic benefit in varicocele; rivaroxaban has well-characterized bleeding profiles in VTE programs and labeling, and unnecessary anticoagulation could complicate periprocedural management if embolization or surgery is ultimately needed [^116E68m5] [^111cVvde] [^117BXDu1].

> But wait, what if the concern is a thrombosed varicocele or a thrombotic complication after treatment — would that justify rivaroxaban to "prevent" problems? Hmm, wait a minute, that would be a different clinical scenario. Anticoagulation can be used to treat thrombotic complications, such as a renal vein thrombus after varicocele embolization, or rarely a thrombosed varicocele presenting with acute pain; however, these are treatments for thrombotic events or complications, not prophylaxis against the formation of a varicocele itself, and they do not imply benefit for preventing varicocele development or progression [^117Ch4ri] [^112SNt2M].

> Initially, I wondered if microthrombi could contribute to venous hypertension and that anticoagulation might indirectly reduce venous pressure; hold on, I should verify that thought because it risks conflating mechanisms. On reconsideration, the dominant pathology in varicocele is valvular insufficiency with reflux, not thrombotic obstruction, so targeting coagulation does not address the cause; guideline recommendations reinforce mechanical correction rather than pharmacologic anticoagulation for this condition [^113YCMz3] [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX].

> I should now state the clinical bottom line clearly and make sure it aligns with evidence and safety. There is no role for rivaroxaban in preventing varicocele: the mechanism is mismatched, there is no supporting indication or guideline endorsement, and exposing patients to anticoagulation adds bleeding risk without benefit; appropriate management remains observation when mild, and mechanical occlusion or surgical ligation when indicated for symptoms or infertility [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX] [^111ssemb].

---

Rivaroxaban is **not indicated or effective** for preventing varicocele because varicoceles result from venous valve incompetence and reflux, not thrombosis [^113YCMz3]. There is **no clinical evidence** or guideline support [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX] for anticoagulation to prevent varicocele formation or progression, and using rivaroxaban would expose patients to unnecessary bleeding risk without benefit [^116E68m5]. Management should focus on observation, surgical ligation, or embolization when indicated [^112RKZ2M].

---

## Pathophysiology of varicocele

Varicoceles are caused by **venous valve incompetence** in the pampiniform plexus, leading to reflux, venous dilation, and increased scrotal temperature that can impair testicular function and fertility [^113YCMz3] [^112M4CyJ]. The key mechanism is **valvular incompetence**, not thrombosis; therefore, anticoagulation does not address the underlying problem [^112RKZ2M].

---

## Mechanism of action of rivaroxaban

Rivaroxaban is a **direct factor Xa inhibitor** that reduces thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation, and is approved for VTE treatment/prevention, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and other thrombotic indications [^117BXDu1]. It does not affect venous valve function or reflux and therefore cannot prevent varicocele formation or progression [^111ssemb].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding rivaroxaban and varicocele

There is **no clinical evidence** that rivaroxaban prevents varicocele formation or progression; no studies or trials have evaluated anticoagulation for this purpose, and no guidelines recommend it [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the AUA, ASRM, and EAU do not recommend anticoagulation for varicocele prevention or treatment [^113LAdTq]. Management is based on observation, surgical ligation, or embolization [^112RKZ2M] when indicated, with **no role for anticoagulation** [^116GTVzX].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of rivaroxaban

Rivaroxaban carries a **significant bleeding risk**, including major and intracranial hemorrhage [^116E68m5], and is contraindicated in patients with active bleeding, severe renal impairment, or hepatic disease. Using it without a clear indication therefore exposes patients to unnecessary harm [^117CffWw].

---

## Alternative and established treatments for varicocele

Established treatments include:

- **Observation**: For asymptomatic or mild cases [^113LAdTq].
- **Surgical ligation**: Microsurgical subinguinal or inguinal approaches [^116GTVzX].
- **Percutaneous embolization**: Minimally invasive occlusion of refluxing veins [^112RKZ2M].

These options are supported by evidence and guidelines, and there is **no role for anticoagulation** [^113LAdTq] [^116GTVzX].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Rivaroxaban is **not indicated or effective** for preventing varicocele because the condition is due to venous valve incompetence, not thrombosis [^113YCMz3]. There is **no evidence or guideline support** for anticoagulation in varicocele, and its use would expose patients to unnecessary bleeding risk [^116GTVzX] [^116E68m5]. Management should rely on observation, surgical ligation, or embolization when appropriate.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: Evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^113YCMz3]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). High credibility.

A varicocele is a venous dilatation due to valvular incompetence within the pampiniform plexus. Varicoceles are seen in 10–20% of the population and are usually left-sided. They are the most commonly identifiable abnormality found in men evaluated for infertility, though there are myriad other causes. Testicular varicoceles are identified in 40% of men with primary infertility and 80% of men with secondary infertility. Additionally, 2–10% of men with varicoceles complain of scrotal pain or discomfort.

Although the pathophysiology of varicoceles is incompletely understood, it likely involves incompetent valves in the spermatic veins. This incompetence leads to the reflux of warm abdominal blood into the scrotum, causing a subsequent rise in scrotal temperature. Evidence suggests that over time, varicoceles have a progressive, deleterious effect on testicular size, function, and fertility.

Varicocele diagnosis is clinical. Based on clinical findings, there are three arbitrary grades of varicoceles: large varicoceles are visible, medium varicoceles are palpable, and small varicoceles are only palpable during a Valsalva manoeuvre. Subclinical varicoceles can be visualized on ultrasound. However, there is no consensus on the optimal criteria for ultrasound diagnosis. Various classifications are available; thus, preference depends on the individual clinician.

- **Treatment options**: Treatment options for testicular varicoceles include conservative management, percutaneous embolization, or surgical varicolectomy. Percutaneous embolization as a treatment for varicocele has been in use since the late 1970s.

### Xarelto [^113d9wML]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the treatment of DVT and/or PE and the reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and/or PE, the EINSTEIN trials excluded patients with CrCl values < 30 mL/min at screening. However, administration of Xarelto is expected to result in serum concentrations of rivaroxaban similar to those observed in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to < 50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with a CrCl of 15 to < 30 mL/min should be observed closely, and any signs or symptoms of blood loss should be promptly evaluated. The use of Xarelto should be avoided in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min.

- **Prophylaxis of DVT following hip or knee replacement surgery**: The combined analysis of the RECORD 1–3 clinical efficacy studies did not show an increase in bleeding risk for patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min, and reported a possible increase in total venous thromboemboli in this population. In the RECORD 1–3 trials, patients with CrCl values < 30 mL/min at screening were excluded, yet administration of Xarelto 10 mg once daily is expected to result in serum concentrations of rivaroxaban similar to those in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to < 50 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with a CrCl of 15 to < 30 mL/min should be observed closely, and any signs or symptoms of blood loss should be promptly evaluated. The use of Xarelto should be avoided in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min.

- **Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications not at high risk of bleeding**: Patients with CrCl values < 30 mL/min at screening were excluded from the MAGELLAN study.

### Clinical and safety outcomes associated with treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116E68m5]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

Many anticoagulant strategies are available for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, yet little guidance exists regarding which drug is most effective and safe.

- **Objective**: To summarize and compare the efficacy and safety outcomes associated with eight anticoagulation options (unfractionated heparin [UFH], low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], or fondaparinux in combination with vitamin K antagonists); LMWH with dabigatran or edoxaban; rivaroxaban; apixaban; and LMWH alone) for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

- **Data sources**: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the evidence-based medicine reviews from inception through February 28, 2014.

- **Study selection**: Eligible studies were randomized trials reporting rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. Of the 1,197 studies identified, 45 trials including 44,989 patients were included in the analyses.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including the number of patients, duration of follow-up, and outcomes. The data were pooled using network meta-analysis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary clinical and safety outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding, respectively.

- **Results**: Compared with the LMWH-vitamin K antagonist combination, a treatment strategy using the UFH-vitamin K antagonist combination was associated with an increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.15–1.79).

### Editor's choice - European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2021 clinical practice guidelines on the management of venous thrombosis [^111bivZB]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, specifically concerning the choice of anticoagulation and extended therapy, the ESVS 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of reduced doses of DOACs, such as apixaban 2.5 mg BID or rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily, in patients with unprovoked proximal DVT who require extended anticoagulation beyond six months but are not deemed to be at a very high risk of recurrence.

### Ex vivo reversal of effects of rivaroxaban evaluated using thromboelastometry and thrombin generation assay [^113XdwJZ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016).

- **Editor's key points**: There is limited information on the best treatment of bleeding in patients taking newer direct oral anticoagulants. The effects of various procoagulant factors on laboratory coagulation parameters were assessed on blood treated ex vivo with rivaroxaban or blood from rivaroxaban-treated patients. Reversal of rivaroxaban anticoagulant effects ex vivo was possible, but varied between reversal agents and the coagulation assay, indicating that clinical trials are needed to validate reversibility in vivo.

Rivaroxaban (Xarelto ®; Bayer, Germany) is used as thrombosis prophylaxis and therapy instead of anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or vitamin K antagonists, because it is considered to have a wider therapeutic range and a more predictable dose–response relationship. According to the manufacturer, rivaroxaban does not require routine drug monitoring.

In the European Union, Canada, and the United States, rivaroxaban is approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients undergoing hip- or knee-replacement surgery, prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, treatment and prevention of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and prevention of atherothrombotic events after acute coronary syndrome. Dose reduction (15 mg once daily) is recommended or can be considered in patients with advanced renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–49 mL min−1).

Part II: Endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^114b4LyT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

For patients with an asymptomatic superficial truncal vein aneurysm located more than 3 cm distal to the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed. Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the risk of VTE.

Patients with symptomatic, thrombosed, or large (> 3 cm) aneurysms in the superficial veins are best treated with surgical excision.

Focal dilation of the saphenous veins (GSV, SSV, AAGSV, or PAGSV) that measures ≥ 20 mm for GSV, 15 mm for SSV, or has a diameter that is three times the upper limit of the average saphenous diameter is considered an aneurysm. Most patients are asymptomatic or have a palpable lump at the groin or in the popliteal fossa. Many patients present only with symptoms of varicosity or CVI. Patients occasionally complain of a tender lump, which can be firm if the aneurysm is thrombosed. Evaluation with duplex scanning is usually satisfactory, but congenital superficial truncal vein aneurysms may occur in patients with venous malformations (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome). Saphenous aneurysms may occasionally mimic femoral hernia, synovial, or Baker's cyst, or venous leiomyosarcoma. In these patients, further evaluation with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is warranted.

When the saphenous aneurysm is near the femoral or popliteal vein, open surgical excision is indicated, with ligation or oversewing of a dilated proximal saphenous stump. In patients with symptomatic saphenous reflux, endovenous ablation, tumescent anesthesia-aided phlebectomy, or limited stripping of the distal vein may be considered.

### Clinical experience with the new oral anticoagulants for treatment of venous thromboembolism [^111GpDVZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Four non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants — apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have been evaluated in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. All except edoxaban have also been studied for extended secondary prophylaxis after venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban, and recently dabigatran, has been approved for this indication. It is therefore timely to review the characteristics, efficacy, and safety of these drugs with an emphasis on patients with venous thromboembolism.

This review focuses on the clinical results from the phase III trials, separately for each of the drugs as compared with vitamin K antagonists. We also address the results from meta-analyses that were published recently. Finally, the results in some special groups of interest — renal impairment, elderly patients, and patients with cancer — are reviewed, although they comprised only small minorities of the study populations.

All four drugs demonstrated noninferiority against vitamin K antagonists in the acute treatment and clear superiority against placebo in the extended treatment (not performed with edoxaban). The risk of bleeding was generally lower with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, and the reduction of the risk of intracranial hemorrhage seems to mirror the experience from atrial fibrillation trials.

In conclusion, over the past 30 years, treatment has evolved from a week of hospitalization and intravenous heparin therapy, through low-molecular-weight heparin injections subcutaneously and early discharge from the hospital, to the possibility of…

### Rivaroxaban for prevention of thrombotic events, hospitalization, and death in outpatients with COVID-19: A randomized clinical trial [^113g3YmW]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

We observed a discordance in the point estimate favoring the placebo in the intention-to-treat analysis and rivaroxaban in the safety analysis. This difference was driven largely by an excess of hospitalizations in the rivaroxaban group compared with placebo (21 versus 17) in the intention-to-treat analysis, whereas hospitalization was less frequent in the two groups in the safety analysis population (11 versus 15, respectively). We postulate that this observation was likely a play of chance in the context of a lower-than-expected event rate and a disproportionate number of patients assigned to rivaroxaban not receiving or taking study medication before experiencing clinical deterioration requiring hospitalization compared with patients assigned to placebo (10 versus 2). This imbalance highlights the challenges and limitations of conducting a randomized controlled trial remotely during the pandemic with an associated impact on medication supply chains and delivery services.

Similar to other trials, PREVENT-HD observed a low frequency of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, and non-CNS systemic arterial embolism. Although events were marginally less frequent in the rivaroxaban group, the nominal number of events and the post hoc exploratory nature of this descriptive analysis preclude interpretation of a treatment benefit of rivaroxaban. The number of events is insufficient to recommend thromboprophylaxis to nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19.

### EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health [^117K3UgQ]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

The EAU 2025 guidelines recommend that varicocelectomy may be considered as a surgical intervention for varicocele. This procedure is specifically indicated for consideration in men with raised DNA fragmentation who experience otherwise unexplained infertility or have suffered from failed assisted reproductive techniques. Such techniques include instances of pregnancy loss, failure of embryogenesis, and implantation failure.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^115RFtXx]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Low credibility.

A varicocele is a venous dilatation due to valvular incompetence within the pampiniform plexus, affecting 10–20% of the population and found in 40% of men with primary infertility (Hum Reprod Update 7(1):59–64, 2001, Cochrane Database System Rev (3), 2004, Curr Urol 6(1):33–6, 2012, World J Men's Health 37(1):4, 2019). Varicocele-associated pain occurs in 2–10% of cases (Hum Reprod Update 7(1):59–64, 2001, SpringerPlus 4:1–5, 2015). Treatment options include conservative management, percutaneous embolization, or surgery (Urology 72(1):77–80, 2008). In the literature, percutaneous embolization has a technical failure rate ranging from 0 to 13.9% and recurrence rates of around 13% (Cochrane Database System Rev 4(4):CD000479, 2021).

This study evaluates the success and recurrence of percutaneous varicocele embolizations over fifteen years and compares the embolic materials used.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of all adult patients who underwent varicocele embolization from April 2008 to February 2023 in two tertiary centers. Data collected included patient age, procedure date, access site, side of occurrence, previous interventions, treatment method, need for re-intervention, and recurrence rates. Technical success was defined as successful access to the gonadal vein and embolization of the same with coil/sclerosant. Clinical success was assessed through follow-up telephone consultations and ultrasound.

- **Results**: The technical and clinical success rate was 96% and 93.75%, respectively. Of 225 patients, 3.12% had prior failed surgeries.

### The mechanism of action of rivaroxaban — an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor — compared with other anticoagulants [^112nLTzh]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Although results of some phase III clinical trials of new oral anticoagulants are now known, it is important to understand the mechanisms of their actions. These new agents exert their anticoagulant effect via direct inhibition of a single factor within the coagulation cascade, such as factor Xa or thrombin. Rivaroxaban — the first oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor — is a small-molecule oxazolidinone derivative that binds directly and reversibly to factor Xa via the S1 and S4 pockets.

Rivaroxaban competitively inhibits factor Xa and is more than 10,000-fold more selective for factor Xa than other related serine proteases; it does not require cofactors, such as antithrombin, to exert its anticoagulant effect. Unlike indirect factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban inhibits both free and clot-bound factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity, thereby prolonging clotting times. Dabigatran etexilate is a direct thrombin inhibitor that inhibits both free and fibrin-bound thrombin.

Although the mechanism of action differs between the direct factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors, phase III studies of these new agents confirmed that both factor Xa and thrombin are viable anticoagulation targets.

### Oral rivaroxaban for symptomatic venous thromboembolism [^117CffWw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide a simple, fixed-dose regimen for treating acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and for continued treatment, without the need for laboratory monitoring.

- **Methods**: We conducted an open-label, randomized, event-driven, noninferiority study that compared oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) for 3, 6, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic DVT. In parallel, we carried out a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continued-treatment study.

- **Results**: The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%], vs. 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.04; P < 0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group.

### Xarelto [^114VbSrf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The absorption of rivaroxaban is dose-dependent. For doses of 2.5 mg and 10 mg, the absolute bioavailability is estimated to be 80% to 100% and is unaffected by food. Xarelto 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets can be administered with or without food. However, when Xarelto 20 mg is administered in a fasted state, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 66%. Coadministration of Xarelto with food increases the bioavailability of the 20 mg dose, with the mean AUC and Cmax increasing by 39% and 76%, respectively, with food. Therefore, Xarelto 15 mg and 20 mg tablets should be taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of rivaroxaban appear 2 to 4 hours after tablet intake. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban are not influenced by drugs that alter gastric pH. Coadministration of Xarelto (30 mg single dose) with the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine (150 mg twice daily), the antacid aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (10 mL), or Xarelto (20 mg single dose) with the PPI omeprazole (40 mg once daily) did not demonstrate any effect on the bioavailability and exposure of rivaroxaban.

The absorption of rivaroxaban is dependent on the site of drug release in the gastrointestinal tract. There is a reported 29% and 56% decrease in AUC and Cmax compared to tablet form when rivaroxaban granulate is released in the proximal small intestine. Exposure is further reduced when the drug is released in the distal small intestine or ascending colon. Therefore, administration of rivaroxaban distal to the stomach should be avoided, as it can result in reduced absorption and related drug exposure.

In a study with 44 healthy subjects, both measur…

### Benefit-risk assessment of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness [^115Gh3Jj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Figure 1 and Table 2 display the risk differences, number needed to treat (NNT), and number needed to harm (NNH) of the five pairs of benefit–risk outcomes. The benefits outnumbered the harms in each evaluated pair. In Pair 1, there were 32.5 (95% CI, −68.1 to 3.0) fewer symptomatic VTE and VTE-related deaths compared with 8.2 (95% CI, −12.2 to 28.5) additional major bleeding events per 10,000 patients treated with rivaroxaban.

Pair 2 shows 20.3 (95% CI, −13.0 to 53.6) nonfatal PE and VTE-related deaths prevented compared with 0 (95% CI, −9.8 to 9.8) critical site and fatal bleeds. The greatest differences were observed in the composite of fatal and irreversible-harm thrombotic events prevented compared with the composite of critical site and fatal bleeding (Pairs 3 and 5).

In Pair 3, there were 38.6 (95% CI, −85.3 to 8.1) fewer fatal and irreversible nonfatal thrombotic events, with no excess fatal or critical site bleeding. Pair 5 shows a benefit of 63.0 (95% CI, −113.5 to −12.5) fewer fatal and irreversible nonfatal thrombotic events with no excess critical site and fatal bleeding. Pair 4 shows little difference in thromboembolic fatal events versus fatal bleeding.

### Potential treatment option of rivaroxaban for breastfeeding women: A case series [^1163mVLT]. Thrombosis Research (2024). High credibility.

Use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in breastfeeding women is currently challenging due to limited safety data for breastfeeding infants, and there have been no previous studies on the drug concentration in breastfeeding infants. We treated two patients (one case involved twin pregnancy) with venous thromboembolisms in breastfeeding women administered rivaroxaban at our institution. Blood samples from the mothers and breastmilk samples were collected at time 0 and 2 hours after the rivaroxaban administration. Breastfeeding was conducted 2 hours after the rivaroxaban administration, and blood samples from the infants were collected 2 hours after breastfeeding (4 hours after maternal rivaroxaban administration).

- **Milk-to-plasma ratios**: The milk-to-plasma (M:P) ratios were 0.27 in Case 1 and 0.32 in Case 2.

- **Relative infant dose**: The estimated relative infant dose (RID) was 0.82% in Case 1 (Children 1 and 2) and 1.27% in Case 2. The rivaroxaban concentration in the infant plasma was below the lower limit of quantification in all infants. In addition, even in the high-exposure case simulation based on 5 days of breastfeeding in Case 2, the infant plasma concentration level was below the lower limit of quantification.

At 3 months of follow-up, breastfeeding was continued, and all infants grew and developed without any health problems, including bleeding events. The case series showed that there were no pharmacokinetic or clinical concerns for breastfeeding women or breastfed infants, and it provides support for rivaroxaban as a safe treatment option for these patients.

### Antithrombotic management of venous thromboembolism: JACC focus seminar [^116TC3iW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) represents a significant public health burden, with anticoagulation management being the primary treatment for most patients. Since 2010, the introduction of four direct oral anticoagulants has notably influenced the selection of anticoagulants for patients with VTE. The treatment of VTE involves three phases:

- **Initial treatment**: This phase lasts from the first 5 to 21 days.
- **Primary treatment**: This phase extends over the first 3 to 6 months.
- **Secondary prevention**: This occurs after the initial 3 to 6 months.

Oral-only anticoagulation strategies are now available, incorporating therapies such as apixaban or rivaroxaban starting in the initial treatment phase. Furthermore, low-dose anticoagulation with either apixaban or rivaroxaban can be utilized during the secondary prevention phase for eligible patients. The use of direct oral anticoagulants is also endorsed for many patients with cancer-associated VTE. Appropriate selection and monitoring of anticoagulants remain critical components of delivering high-quality care to patients with VTE.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: A multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^112y1KYQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

For more than a decade, guidelines have recommended a limited 3 months of anticoagulation for the treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). How closely real‐world practice follows these guideline recommendations is not well described.

- **Methods and results**: In our multicenter, retrospective cohort study, we evaluated trends in anticoagulation duration for patients enrolled in the MAQI 2 (Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative) registry who were receiving anticoagulation for a provoked VTE. The MAQI 2 registry comprises six centers in Michigan that manage patients' long‐term anticoagulation. We identified 474 patients on warfarin and 302 patients on direct oral anticoagulants who were receiving anticoagulation for a primary indication of provoked VTE between 2008 and 2020. Using a predefined threshold of 120 days (3 months plus a buffer period), predictors of extended anticoagulant use were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Most patients received more than 120 days of anticoagulation, regardless of which medication was used. The median (25th–75th percentile) length of treatment for patients taking warfarin was 142 (91–234) days, and for direct oral anticoagulants, it was 180 (101–360) days. ReVTE (odds ratio [OR], 2.75 [95% CI, 1.67–4.53]), history of myocardial infarction (OR, 3.92 [95% CI, 1.32–11.7]), and direct oral anticoagulant rather than warfarin use (OR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.59–3.08]) were independently associated with prolonged anticoagulation.

- **Conclusions**: In our cohort of patients with provoked VTE, most patients received anticoagulation therapy for longer than the guideline-recommended duration.

### Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^115RSNem]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Rivaroxaban has been found to be noninferior to warfarin for preventing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage. To assess the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared to adjusted-dose warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF, we built a Markov model using a United States payer/Medicare perspective and a lifetime time horizon.

The base-case analysis assumed a cohort of patients with AF, aged 65 years, with a congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke (2 points) score of 3, and no contraindications to anticoagulation. Data sources included the Rivaroxaban Once-daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) and other studies of anticoagulation.

Outcome measurements included costs in 2011 United States dollars, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Patients with AF treated with rivaroxaban lived an average of 10.03 QALYs at a lifetime treatment cost of $94,456. Those receiving warfarin lived an average of 9.81 QALYs and incurred costs of $88,544. The ICER for rivaroxaban was $27,498 per QALY. These results were most sensitive to changes in the hazard decrease of intracranial hemorrhage and stroke with rivaroxaban, cost of rivaroxaban, and time horizon.

Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated rivaroxaban was cost-effective in 80% and 91% of 10,000 iterations at willingness-to-pay thresholds.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113FL5uJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

In general, FDA-approved indications for each of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are comparable. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban are approved for lowering the risk of stroke and embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) as well as for the treatment and prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Unique indications include betrixaban for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with an acute medical illness, and rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease.

However, there remains uncertainty in understanding the safe and effective use of DOACs in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, specifically atrial fibrillation (AF) with recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), AF with concomitant artificial heart valves, stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and cancer-associated thromboembolism. This section aims to clarify the use of DOACs within these patient subgroups.

### Xarelto [^111cVvde]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Overdosage**: Overdose of Xarelto may lead to hemorrhage. Discontinue Xarelto and initiate appropriate therapy if bleeding complications associated with overdosage occur. Rivaroxaban systemic exposure is not further increased at single doses greater than 50 mg due to limited absorption. The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of Xarelto overdose may be considered. Due to the high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Partial reversal of laboratory anticoagulation parameters may be achieved with the use of plasma products. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available.

### Introduction: Varicoceles: a contemporary perspective [^112M4CyJ]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

In this Views and Reviews section, four groups of authors address the timely and highly relevant issue of varicoceles across the male life spectrum. Varicoceles are very prevalent among men presenting for an infertility workup. While a reduction in bulk semen parameters (including sperm concentration, motility, and morphology) has long been recognized as a deficit caused by varicoceles, in recent years, a number of investigators have shown that varicoceles can have broader, multi-faceted effects on male reproductive health. Sperm DNA integrity and other aspects of sperm function appear to be impacted by the presence of varicoceles, and varicocele correction can result in significant improvement in not only semen parameters but also fertilization and pregnancy rates.

### Safety and effectiveness of oral rivaroxaban versus standard anticoagulation for the treatment of symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (XALIA): An international, prospective, non-interventional study [^117MmLEP]. The Lancet Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of the anticoagulant rivaroxaban for the treatment and secondary prevention of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism has been shown in phase 3 trials; however, data about rivaroxaban use in routine clinical practice are needed.

- **Methods**: XA inhibition with rivaroxaban for long-term and initial anticoagulation in venous thromboembolism (XALIA) was a multicenter, international, prospective, non-interventional study of patients with deep-vein thrombosis, conducted in hospitals and community care centers in 21 countries. The study investigated the safety and effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with standard anticoagulation therapy (initial treatment with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or fondaparinux, usually overlapping with and followed by a vitamin K antagonist) for at least 3 months. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with an objectively confirmed diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis and an indication to receive anticoagulation treatment for at least 3 months. Following approval of rivaroxaban for the pulmonary embolism indication, patients with deep-vein thrombosis and concomitant pulmonary embolism were also eligible; however, those with isolated pulmonary embolism were not included. Type, dose, and duration of therapy for each patient were at the physician's discretion. The primary effectiveness and safety outcomes were major bleeding, recurrent venous thromboembolism, and all-cause mortality. Propensity score-adjusted analyses were done to account for potential imbalances between groups.

### Benefit-risk assessment of rivaroxaban for extended thromboprophylaxis after hospitalization for medical illness [^111QUeoA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

To compare benefits and risks in the identical population and time period, both efficacy and safety outcomes were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population and included all events from randomization to day 45 inclusive. This contrasts with prior reports that used the safety population for safety outcomes. All possible efficacy and bleeding events were adjudicated by a clinical events committee blinded to treatment assignment. All ultrasounds were adjudicated by a core laboratory experienced in reading compression ultrasonography to rule in or rule out deep vein thrombosis. Analyses were performed for the total population and for the prespecified subgroups. All results were computed with incident proportions.

- **Statistical analysis**: The benefit and risk were assessed as rate differences with 95% CI per 10,000 patients, defined as the difference in proportions between the two treatments scaled to a hypothetical population of 10,000 patients to reflect benefits and risks on a population level. These rate differences can be interpreted as the number of patients in this population who would experience a particular event when treated with rivaroxaban minus that in the same population treated with a placebo. Results were shown in both forest plots and tabular forms. The 95% CI was calculated to demonstrate uncertainty only, and no hypothesis tests were conducted nor any adjustments for multiplicity applied.

The number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated as the reciprocal of the rate differences between rivaroxaban and placebo.

### CIRSE standards of practice on varicocele embolisation [^112RKZ2M]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Percutaneous embolisation is an effective, minimally invasive means of treating a variety of benign and malignant lesions and has been successfully used to treat varicoceles since the late 1970s, with refined and expanded techniques and tools currently offering excellent outcomes for varicocele embolisation.

- **Purpose**: This document presumes that the indication for treatment is clear and approved by the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and will define the standards required for the performance of each modality, as well as their advantages and limitations. CIRSE Standards of Practice documents are not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care, but recommend a reasonable approach to, and best practices for, the performance of percutaneous varicocele embolisation.

- **Methods**: The writing group was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognised expertise in embolisation of male varicoceles. The writing group reviewed the existing literature on varicocele embolisation, performing a pragmatic evidence search using PubMed to search for publications in English and relating to human subjects published from 2006 to 2021. The final recommendations were formulated through consensus.

- **Conclusion**: Embolisation has an established role in the successful management of male varicoceles. This Standards of Practice document provides up-to-date recommendations for the safe performance of varicocele embolisation.

### Migration of sclerosant material to the left renal vein following coil embolisation of a varicocele [^117Ch4ri]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Percutaneous testicular varicocele embolisation for symptomatic and subfertile males is often preferred over surgical ligation of the gonadal vein due to its minimally invasive approach and reduced complication rate. Glues, coils, vascular plugs, balloons, and sclerosants are used in various combinations to achieve sufficient venous occlusion. Here, we report on the first known case of sclerosant material migration beyond the placement of an embolisation coil for the treatment of a varicocele, resulting in a left renal vein thrombus.

A man in his 20s presented to the emergency department two days following uncomplicated left varicocele embolisation with acute left-sided abdominal pain. He was found to have sclerosant material causing an ipsilateral non-occlusive left renal vein thrombus with extension towards his inferior vena cava on CT. He was treated with three months of anticoagulation, and follow-up imaging at three months showed resolution of this thrombus without renal impairment.

### Secondary prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism after initial oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^111Lw6Cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, little evidence is available on the length and type of anticoagulation used for extended treatment for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with unprovoked VTE who have completed initial oral anticoagulation therapy.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of available oral therapeutic options (aspirin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) for extended thromboprophylaxis in adults with a first unprovoked VTE, to prevent VTE recurrence after completion of an acceptable initial oral anticoagulant treatment period, as defined in individual studies.

- **Search methods**: For this review, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (March 2017) as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2). We also searched trials registries (March 2017) and reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials in which patients with a first, symptomatic, objectively confirmed, unprovoked VTE, who had been initially treated with anticoagulants, were randomised to extended prophylaxis (vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), antiplatelet agents, or DOACs) versus no prophylaxis or placebo. We also included trials that compared one type of extended prophylaxis versus another type of extended prophylaxis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

- **Main results**: Six studies with a combined total of 3436 patients were included in the analysis.

### Thrombosed varicocele: A rare cause for acute scrotal pain - a case report [^112SNt2M]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

**Learning points**: Spontaneous thrombosis of varicocele is a rare cause of acute scrotal pain. Pain out of proportion to clinical features is characteristic of this condition. A spontaneous thrombus in varicoceles not responding to adequate (7–10) medical therapy requires varicocelectomy, which produces immediate pain relief. Histopathology can be useful in this disorder as it helps differentiate a spontaneous complete thrombus in the acute thrombosed varicocele from an in vitro remodeled clot in a longer-standing varicocele.

### Effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban 15 or 20 mg versus vitamin K antagonists in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^114Dk7D4]. Stroke (2019). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke fivefold. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have long been the reference treatment for stroke prevention, though with a risk of serious bleeding. The direct-acting oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban was approved for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in 2012. In the ROCKET-AF pivotal trial (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation), patients were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg (R20) daily or 15 mg for those with low creatinine clearance (about 20% of the participants). Patients randomized to rivaroxaban experienced fewer stroke and systemic embolisms (SSEs) than those randomized to warfarin, without a significant difference in clinically relevant bleeding (CRB) or major bleeding (MB). There was no separate description of rivaroxaban 15 mg (R15) or R20 patient groups or results.

The translation of clinical trial results to actual practice is uncertain because physicians, patients, drug prescriptions, and usage may not align with study conditions. Few observational studies have compared standard and reduced doses of rivaroxaban versus VKAs, particularly observing lower doses in Asian patients. When rivaroxaban was first marketed in France in 2012, regulatory authorities requested a comparative effectiveness and safety study of R20 or R15 in NVAF, compared with VKAs. To this end, we performed the study reported herein.

### How I treat with anticoagulants in 2012: new and old anticoagulants, and when and how to switch [^113dj6Mv]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Two novel oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have recently been approved. They differ in many ways from warfarin, including rapid onset of action, shorter half-life, fewer drug-drug interactions, lack of need for monitoring, and no need for titration or dose adjustments. These novel agents represent a landmark shift in anticoagulant care; however, many aspects of their use will be unfamiliar to practicing clinicians, despite the imminent widespread use of these agents in the community. The management of these anticoagulants when transitioning from or back to warfarin, around surgery or in case of major hemorrhage, requires knowledge of their pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action. Unfortunately, there is a limited evidence base to inform decisions around management of these agents. We present our practice in these settings supported, where available, with literature evidence.

### Monitoring the anticoagulant effect following a massive rivaroxaban overdose [^116dMib3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor approved for the prevention of stroke, the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, and secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome in many countries. As the use of this agent increases, so does the potential for overdose, both intentional and unintentional. Clinical data on overdoses of rivaroxaban in humans are limited. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who took an overdose of 1400 mg of rivaroxaban and describe how the resolution of the anticoagulant effect was monitored using readily available coagulation assays.

### A fifteen-year retrospective analysis of varicocele embolization: Evaluating success, recurrence rates and embolic agents [^115QQQmX]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Low credibility.

In cases of varicocele embolization failure, several underlying mechanisms may be implicated, including incomplete venous occlusion, collateral vessel recruitment, or missed alternative venous drainage pathways. A repeat embolization procedure should be considered in technically feasible cases, particularly where persistent reflux is demonstrated. CT venography can aid in identifying residual or alternative venous channels not visualized during the initial intervention.

Technical challenges typically arise in cases of varicoceles with venous collaterals that bypass competent valves in the cranial segment of the internal spermatic vein, or in the presence of right-sided varicoceles. Late failure is thought to be due to the opening of persistent small venous collaterals into the internal spermatic vein. A structured approach, incorporating imaging and tailored re-intervention, may enhance long-term clinical outcomes in these cases.

Our findings demonstrate no significant association between the type of embolic agent used and technical success, clinical success, recurrence rates, need for re-intervention, or fertility outcomes. These results suggest that adding a sclerosing agent to coil embolization does not confer a measurable clinical advantage. Although no recurrences were observed in the small group treated with the Hourglass™ occlusion device, the limited sample size precludes definitive conclusions. These observations support using coil embolization alone as a sufficient and effective treatment modality. This is interesting economically as the addition of sclerosant was not found to provide added benefit.

### Thrombosed varicocele - a rare cause for acute scrotal pain: a case report [^114mduGv]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombosed varicoceles have been described as a rare cause of acute scrotal pain. Postoperative thrombus in pampiniform plexuses has been managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics, parenteral and oral analgesics, and scrotal elevation with bed rest. Spontaneously occurring thrombi have also been reported to have been managed medically in a previous case, though the exact details of medical treatment are unclear. To date, all the cases mentioned in the literature have been managed medically without any note of surgical treatment being needed in such instances. It is noteworthy to reference the first report in the literature by Roach et al, who recommended conservative management. In their study of two patients, both underwent surgical ligation and excision of the thrombosed vein, making their recommendations contrary to their findings.

Similarly, El Hennawy et al. advised conservative management, yet in their case, the patient underwent surgery. There are two other case reports which have documented that pain usually subsides within a week of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and scrotal rest. Doerfler et al. also recommend medical management, while their patient was subjected to surgery. Kleinclauss et al. were the only ones who managed their patient successfully with medical management alone.

The other documentation of medical management lies with postoperative varicocelectomy patients. In summary, the collected reports suggest that medical therapy may be successful if only a single superficial spermatic vein is involved.

### Surgery or embolisation for varicocele in subfertile men [^113xk4wW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

A varicocele is an almost exclusively left-sided varicosity of the pampiniform plexus of the spermatic cord, forming a tangle of distended blood vessels in the scrotum. Although the concept that varicocele causes male subfertility and therefore varicocelectomy cures male subfertility has been around for almost fifty years now, the mechanisms by which varicocele would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained, and neither have the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy would resolve subfertility. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether a causal relation exists at all between the distension of the pampiniform plexus and impairment of fertility.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effect of varicocele treatment on pregnancy rate in subfertile couples.

- **Search strategy**: Relevant trials were identified in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's specialised register of controlled trials. A MEDLINE search, using the group's search strategy, was performed for the period 1966–2000. Additionally, hand searching was performed of 22 specialist journals in the field from their first issue till 2000. Cross references and references from review articles were checked.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed, if they reported pregnancy rates as an outcome measure, and if they reported data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the internal spermatic vein) and untreated groups.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Six studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. One (Nieschlag 19

### Xarelto [^116tnMaY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. There are limited clinical data in patients with CrCl between 15 and less than 30 mL/min; therefore, these patients should be observed closely, and any signs or symptoms of blood loss should be promptly evaluated. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl less than 15 mL/min (including those on dialysis); thus, the use of Xarelto should be avoided in these patients.

Discontinue Xarelto in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery**: In patients with CrCl less than 30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased as compared to patients with normal renal function. Clinical data are limited for patients with CrCl between 15 and less than 30 mL/min; therefore, close observation and prompt evaluation of any signs or symptoms of blood loss in such patients is recommended. As there are no clinical data for patients with CrCl less than 15 mL/min (including those on dialysis), Xarelto should not be used in these patients.

- **Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients at risk for thromboembolic complications not at high risk of bleeding**: In patients with CrCl less than 30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function.

### The perils of inhibiting deficient factors [^1143KkPm]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation in patients with factor X deficiency is an evidence-poor area. A patient with factor X deficiency was anticoagulated with warfarin, followed by rivaroxaban. Warfarin may be a safer anticoagulant option than rivaroxaban in hereditary factor X deficiency. A baseline coagulation screen should be performed prior to the commencement of anticoagulation.

We report a case of a previously undiagnosed factor X deficiency in an 83-year-old man, who had no previous bleeding history despite multiple hemostatic challenges. He was anticoagulated with warfarin for atrial fibrillation without bleeding complications; however, a major hemorrhage occurred soon following a switch to rivaroxaban.

### Rivaroxaban treatment for six weeks versus three months in patients with symptomatic isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: Randomised controlled trial [^114u6izr]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

- **Objective**: To compare two different treatment durations of rivaroxaban in patients with symptomatic isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

- **Design**: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

- **Setting**: 28 outpatient clinics specializing in venous thromboembolism.

- **Participants**: 402 adults (≥ 18 years) with symptomatic isolated distal DVT.

- **Interventions**: After receiving a standard dose of rivaroxaban for six weeks, participants were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg or placebo once daily for an additional six weeks. Follow-up continued for 24 months from study inclusion.

- **Main outcomes measures**: The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent venous thromboembolism during follow-up after randomisation, defined as the composite of progression of isolated distal DVT, recurrent isolated distal DVT, proximal DVT, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, or fatal pulmonary embolism. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding after randomisation until two days from the last dose of rivaroxaban or placebo. An independent committee adjudicated the outcomes.

- **Results**: 200 adults were randomised to receive additional rivaroxaban treatment and 202 to receive placebo. Isolated distal DVT was unprovoked in 81 (40%) and 86 (43%) patients, respectively. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 23 (11%) patients in the rivaroxaban arm and 39 (19%) in the placebo arm (relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.95; P = 0.03, number needed to treat 13, 95% confidence interval 7 to 126). Recurrent isolated distal DVT occurred in 16 (8%) patients in the rivaroxaban arm.

### Favorable therapeutic index of the direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, compared with the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran in rabbits [^111tFL9i]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Apixaban is an oral, direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in late-stage clinical development. This study assessed the effects of the direct FXa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, versus the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, on venous thrombosis (VT), bleeding time (BT), and clotting times in rabbits.

- **Methods**: We induced the formation of non-occlusive thrombus in VT models by placing threads in the vena cava. Bleeding was induced by the incision of cuticles in anesthetized rabbits. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran were infused intravenously to achieve a stable plasma level. Clotting times, including the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), modified PT (mPT), and thrombin time (TT), were measured.

- **Results**: Apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran exhibited dose-related efficacy in preventing VT, with EC(50) values of 65, 33, and 194 nm, respectively. At doses resulting in an 80% reduction of control thrombus, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran prolonged BT by 1.13 ± 0.02-fold, 1.9 ± 0.1-fold, and 4.4 ± 0.4-fold, respectively (✱ p < 0.05). Additionally, apixaban was > 50-fold more potent in prolonging TT than aPTT and PT. Of the clotting assays studied, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran responded the best to mPT.

- **Conclusion**: Comparable antithrombotic efficacy was observed between apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran in the prevention and treatment of VT in rabbits.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the additional benefit of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for endovenous varicose vein interventions [^117YEgp9]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Major and minor bleeding were defined as per the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis guidelines. Of the 12 trial arms that reported on bleeding after pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, there was one instance of major bleeding, associated with the coadministration of LMWH and ibuprofen. Other trials that considered minor bleeding rates noted a range from 0% to 10%.

There was no significant difference in bleeding events between three days of Fondaparinux versus Rivaroxaban, nor between Rivaroxaban 10 mg OD for five days versus ten days. Of the 11 trial arms that included VTE-related mortality as an outcome, there was one VTE-related death that occurred in the mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone group following a PE from an iliofemoral DVT.

- **Risk of bias**: Studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tool for nonrandomized studies of interventions and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials. Randomized trials were generally at high or unclear risk of bias, primarily due to the lack of registered protocols, high rates of attrition, and potential for performance biases due to lack of blinding. For nonrandomized studies, there was a critical risk of selection bias through confounding by indication, as well as significant attrition bias and high potential for reporting bias.

- **Quality assessment**: In the randomized trial arms, the quality of evidence for the rates of DVT and PE was judged as moderate in light of the risk of bias.

### Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus warfarin anticoagulation for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism: a U.S. perspective [^116xTtJF]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Rivaroxaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that is noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). Whether rivaroxaban is cost-effective in the prevention of recurrent VTE, however, is not known.

- **Material and methods**: To assess the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in the prevention of recurrent VTE, we built a Markov state-transition model over a 10-year time horizon. The base case analysis consisted of a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old patients with an initial VTE who received secondary prophylaxis with either rivaroxaban or warfarin for 3 to 12 months. Cost estimates were derived from the Healthcare and Utilization Project and other sources. Probabilities were based on literature values. Outcomes included costs in 2011 United States dollars, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over 10 years from a societal perspective.

- **Results**: Compared with warfarin, the rivaroxaban strategy cost less ($3,195 vs. $6,188) and was more effective (9.29 QALYs vs. 9.14 QALYs). Our results were highly robust in sensitivity analyses. Warfarin was no longer dominated by rivaroxaban when the risk of major bleeding with rivaroxaban exceeds 3.8% (base case estimate: 0.96%).

- **Conclusion**: In summary, prophylactic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban appears to be a cost-effective, and perhaps cost-saving, alternative to warfarin for the prevention of recurrent VTE.

### Xarelto [^111ssemb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Xarelto is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require a cofactor, such as anti-thrombin III, for activity. Rivaroxaban inhibits free FXa and prothrombinase activity. Although rivaroxaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, it indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, rivaroxaban decreases thrombin generation.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Rivaroxaban produces dose-dependent inhibition of FXa activity. Clotting tests, such as prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and HepTest®, are also prolonged dose-dependently. In children treated with rivaroxaban, the correlation between anti-factor Xa to plasma concentrations is linear with a slope close to 1. Monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using anti-FXa activity or a clotting test is not recommended.

- **Specific populations**:

	- **Renal impairment**: The relationship between systemic exposure and pharmacodynamic activity of rivaroxaban was altered in adult subjects with renal impairment relative to healthy control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

	- **Hepatic impairment**: Anti-factor Xa activity was similar in adult subjects with normal hepatic function and in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A class). There is no clear understanding of the impact of hepatic impairment beyond this degree on the coagulation cascade and its relationship to efficacy and safety.

### Editor's choice - efficacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis of phase III trials [^116TNLL4]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The aim was to perform a review of the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants (NOAs) in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

- **Methods**: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. On March 26, 2014, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane trial register were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the NOAs dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in VTE treatment and secondary prevention. Two investigators assessed the methodological quality of the RCTs. The main study outcomes (efficacy, safety, and net clinical benefit) were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

- **Results**: Ten RCTs, mostly with low risk of bias, involving nearly 38,000 patients, were identified. In six trials of treatment, NOAs were equally effective as VKAs in preventing reSymptomatic VTE (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75–1.05), but major bleeding occurred less often (1.08% vs. 1.73% for VKAs, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.77), leading net clinical benefit to favor NOAs (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70–0.90). Fatal bleeding occurred less often with NOAs (0.09% vs. 0.18% for VKAs), a difference that approached statistical significance (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.26–1.01). In three secondary prevention trials, NOAs reduced VTE recurrence rates to 1.32% (vs. 7.24% with placebo, RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.12–0.24) and fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) (including unexplained deaths) to 0.1% (vs. 0.29% for placebo, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.10–1.38), at the expense of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (4.3% vs. 1.8% for placebo, RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.65–3…).

### Reconsidering the role of routine anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism prevention in plastic surgery [^114C2qtd]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Fondaparinux is a particularly questionable choice because it requires injection, unlike rivaroxaban and apixaban, and does not have an antidote. The lack of a reversal agent is an important difference from other anticoagulants such as heparin, enoxaparin, warfarin, and (recently) rivaroxaban and apixaban that do have antidotes (protamine sulfate, vitamin K, as well as andexanet alfa, respectively). Similar to other anticoagulants, this medication is not approved by the FDA for VTE prophylaxis in plastic surgery patients. Fondaparinux is approved for VTE prophylaxis only in orthopedic and general surgery patients judged to be at high risk of VTE. The use of anticoagulants in plastic surgery to prevent VTEs is therefore off-label. Unlike other factor Xa inhibitors such as enoxaparin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, fondaparinux is not indicated for the treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism unless accompanied by warfarin. Plastic surgeons need to be aware of the specific indications and regulatory status of these anticoagulants and the potential for liability in patients who develop bleeding. Plaintiff attorneys are actively soliciting patients who have experienced bleeding complications. A Google search is sobering.

### Surgery or embolisation for varicocele in subfertile men [^116x9ckb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

A varicocele is a meshwork of distended blood vessels in the scrotum, usually left-sided, due to dilatation of the spermatic vein. Although the concept that varicocele causes, and varicocelectomy cures, male subfertility has been around for almost fifty years, the mechanisms by which varicocele would affect fertility have not yet been satisfactorily explained, and neither have the mechanisms by which varicocelectomy would restore fertility. Furthermore, it has been questioned whether a causal relation exists at all between the distension of the pampiniform plexus and impairment of fertility.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effect of varicocele treatment on pregnancy rate in subfertile couples.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group trials register (searched 12 Sept 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2004), EMBASE (January 1985 to May 2004), and reference lists of articles. Additionally, we hand-searched 22 specialist journals in the field from their first issue until 2004, checked cross references, references from review articles, and contacted researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs were included if they were relevant to the clinical question posed, reported pregnancy rates as an outcome measure, and provided data in treated (surgical ligation or radiological embolization of the internal spermatic vein) and untreated groups.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria.
