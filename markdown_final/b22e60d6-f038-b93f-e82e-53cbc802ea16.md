## Question

A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and mild nausea. She has no significant past medical history. On examination, she is febrile (38.5°C), with localized tenderness and mild guarding in the left lower quadrant, but no signs of generalized peritonitis. Laboratory studies reveal leukocytosis. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows sigmoid diverticulitis with a single, well-circumscribed pericolic abscess measuring 3.5 cm in diameter. She is hemodynamically stable and has no other acute medical issues.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the most appropriate initial management for this patient's diverticular abscess, and what follow-up should be considered after successful nonoperative treatment?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate initial management for a 3.5 cm diverticular abscess in a stable, immunocompetent patient, and what follow-up should be considered after successful nonoperative treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and how to classify the severity. Then, I should verify the size-based thresholds that trigger percutaneous drainage versus antibiotics alone. Next, I will review guideline concordance and the strength of evidence. After that, I need to outline the nonoperative plan, including antibiotics, monitoring, and when to escalate. Finally, I should confirm the follow-up strategy, including colonoscopy timing and the role of elective surgery, and reconcile any conflicting guidance with the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification. This is acute complicated diverticulitis with a pericolic abscess, Hinchey Ib by modified classification, in a hemodynamically stable, immunocompetent patient without generalized peritonitis, which places her in a category where nonoperative management is appropriate if carefully selected and monitored [^d8d004bd] [^041794d3].

> Now, I need to check the size threshold for percutaneous drainage. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on a practical cutoff around 3–5 cm, with most recommending image-guided drainage for abscesses larger than 3 cm and allowing antibiotics alone for smaller collections. Specifically, ASCRS recommends percutaneous drainage for abscesses greater than 3 cm, whereas WSES suggests an initial trial of antibiotics alone for small abscesses less than 4–5 cm, and ESCP advises considering drainage for abscesses greater than 3 cm, reserving surgery for failure of nonoperative therapy [^4f7677ec] [^76309ec7] [^7064a95f] [^ba41abdd].

> Wait, let me verify the exact size here. The abscess is 3.5 cm, which sits at the lower end of the "gray zone" where both antibiotics alone and antibiotics plus drainage are reasonable. Given stability, no peritonitis, and a modest size, antibiotics alone are acceptable, but I should acknowledge that some guidelines would still favor drainage at this size, albeit with weak recommendations and low-quality evidence, so shared decision-making and close follow-up are essential [^4f7677ec] [^7064a95f] [^ba41abdd].

> I will now examine the evidence for antibiotics alone in small abscesses. Observational data show high success with antibiotics alone for abscesses under about 4 cm, with pooled failure around 20% and very low mortality, and contemporary series suggest comparable short- and long-term outcomes between antibiotics alone and antibiotics plus drainage for Hinchey Ib–II abscesses, supporting a trial of antibiotics alone in selected patients [^1e42fae6] [^72221b78].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the nonoperative plan details. Broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative rods and anaerobes are indicated, with typical regimens including a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole, and duration is commonly 7–10 days, often transitioning to oral therapy once clinically improving. Close monitoring for clinical deterioration, persistent fever, or escalating pain is mandatory, with a low threshold to repeat CT at 4–6 days if the patient is not improving as expected [^1618d37c] [^53ef0487] [^df0d56a0].

> Next, I should review follow-up after successful nonoperative treatment. Let me first confirm colonoscopy timing. Because abscess-forming disease carries a nontrivial risk of underlying malignancy mimicking diverticulitis, guidelines recommend early colonic evaluation 4–6 weeks after resolution to exclude cancer, and WSES specifically advises early colonic evaluation within 4–6 weeks after nonoperative management of a diverticular abscess [^7975162e] [^fe8081ce] [^1618d37c].

> I need to ensure I address recurrence risk and the role of elective surgery. Patients managed nonoperatively after an abscess have higher recurrence and complicated recurrence rates than those with uncomplicated disease, with 5-year recurrence around 25% and higher risk with larger index abscesses. ASCRS gives a strong recommendation to consider elective sigmoid resection after successful nonoperative treatment of a diverticular abscess, though this should be individualized to patient risk, comorbidities, and preferences, and some series show that expectant management can be safe in selected patients, albeit with nontrivial recurrence [^bda72152] [^e71c4844] [^351b07f0].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers to avoid surgery and accepts recurrence risk? I should double-check that observation is not unreasonable. Expectant management after successful nonoperative treatment of an abscess can be safe in carefully selected patients, with low rates of emergency surgery and mortality, though recurrence is common and often manageable nonoperatively; this supports a shared decision-making approach rather than a blanket mandate for elective resection in all patients [^351b07f0] [^9573ebbc].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is to initiate nonoperative management with broad-spectrum antibiotics alone, hospitalize for close observation given fever and leukocytosis, and reassess clinically at 48–72 hours with a low threshold to repeat CT if there is no improvement. If she deteriorates or the abscess enlarges, proceed to image-guided percutaneous drainage. After successful nonoperative resolution, arrange colonoscopy in 4–6 weeks and counsel on recurrence risk and the option of elective sigmoid resection, tailoring the decision to her risk profile and preferences [^7064a95f] [^4f7677ec] [^7975162e] [^bda72152].

The most appropriate initial management for a 3.5 cm diverticular abscess in a stable, immunocompetent patient is **antibiotics alone** [^7064a95f] with close clinical monitoring, as abscesses under 4–5 cm [^1e42fae6] typically resolve without drainage [^cb3c7810]. Reserve percutaneous drainage for abscesses ≥ 4–5 cm [^1e42fae6], clinical deterioration, or failure of antibiotics after 48–72 hours [^131f63c1]. After successful nonoperative treatment, **colonoscopy in 4–6 weeks** [^7975162e] is recommended to exclude malignancy and assess disease extent [^fe8081ce]. Elective sigmoid resection should be considered for recurrent or complicated disease, but routine elective surgery after a single resolved abscess is not mandatory [^bda72152] [^0499878d].

## Initial management of diverticular abscess

### Size-based management approach

Current guidelines consistently recommend a **size-based approach** to managing diverticular abscesses:

- **Small abscesses (< 4–5 cm)**: Antibiotics alone are recommended for stable, immunocompetent patients [^7064a95f] [^1e42fae6].
- **Large abscesses (≥ 4–5 cm)**: Percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics is recommended due to higher failure rates with antibiotics alone [^1e42fae6] [^4f7677ec].

Given the patient's 3.5 cm abscess, **antibiotics alone** are appropriate [^7064a95f].

---

### Clinical evidence supporting antibiotics alone for small abscesses

Several studies and guidelines support **antibiotics alone** for small abscesses:

- **WSES 2020 guidelines**: Recommend an initial trial of nonoperative management with antibiotics alone for small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscesses [^7064a95f] [^1e42fae6].
- **ASCRS 2020 guidelines**: Antibiotics alone are effective for abscesses < 3 cm, with failure rates up to 34% for larger abscesses [^4f7677ec].
- **EAES/SAGES 2018 consensus**: Antibiotic therapy alone has a high success rate for abscesses < 4 cm [^cb3c7810].

---

### Recommended antibiotic regimen

Empiric therapy should cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes. Common regimens include:

- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate**: 875/125 mg orally twice daily.
- **Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily** plus metronidazole 500 mg orally three times daily.
- **Moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily** (monotherapy).

Intravenous therapy is indicated for severe illness or inability to tolerate oral intake [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Close clinical monitoring is essential to detect treatment failure. Repeat CT is indicated if the patient **fails to improve clinically** after 48–72 hours [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up after successful nonoperative treatment

### Colonoscopy

After successful nonoperative management of a diverticular abscess, **early colonic evaluation** is recommended to exclude malignancy and assess disease extent [^7975162e] [^fe8081ce]. WSES 2020 recommends colonoscopy within **4–6 weeks** [^7975162e] [^fe8081ce].

---

### Indications for elective surgery

Routine elective sigmoid resection after a single resolved abscess is **not mandatory** [^0499878d]. Elective surgery should be individualized based on:

- **Recurrent diverticulitis**: Higher recurrence risk after abscess [^e71c4844] [^bef21a24].
- **Complicated disease**: Persistent symptoms, fistula, stricture, or chronic pain [^a07c0ae2].
- **Patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, immune status, and preferences [^f78072af].

---

### Long-term outcomes and recurrence

Nonoperative management of small abscesses has favorable outcomes, with **recurrence rates around 11–28%** [^e71c4844] [^a9d47180] and low rates of emergency surgery [^351b07f0]. Recurrence risk is higher with larger abscesses, pelvic location, or immunocompromise [^c21ce4f3] [^e71c4844].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Small abscess (< 4–5 cm) in stable, immunocompetent patient | Antibiotics alone with close monitoring [^7064a95f] [^1e42fae6] |
| Large abscess (≥ 4–5 cm) or clinical deterioration | Percutaneous drainage + antibiotics [^1e42fae6] [^4f7677ec] |
| Successful nonoperative treatment | Colonoscopy in 4–6 weeks [^7975162e] [^fe8081ce] |
| Elective surgery | Individualized based on recurrence, complications, and patient factors [^bda72152] [^f78072af] |

Treatment of complicated AD (Hinchey stages Ib to IV)

Hinchey Ib or II includes pericolic or mesocolic (< 5 cm) abscess or intra-abdominal, pelvic, or retroperitoneal abscess, or abscess distant from the primary inflammation. Only 15% of patients suffering an episode of AD will develop a complicated episode with pericolic/distant confined abscess or worse. In these cases, inpatient management should be indicated, and treatment varies with the size of the abscess. Conservative treatment with nothing other than a broad-spectrum antibiotic has a success rate up to 70% in abscesses smaller than 4 cm, leaving image-guided percutaneous drainage for previous treatment failures and larger abscesses with a successful treatment rate in up to 80% of cases. Surgery should be planned when conservative treatment fails.

Hinchey III or IV includes generalized purulent peritonitis/fecal peritonitis. Data show a mortality rate of 14% in patients with complicated Hinchey III and IV in AD. In the vast majority of hemodynamically stable cases, early surgery with primary anastomosis with or without fecal diversion is preferable when the patient's clinical condition can influence different surgery treatments. Hartmann's surgery procedure is performed in hemodynamically unstable patients.

There is debate concerning the best surgical strategy in complicated AD. Laparoscopic surgery seemed to offer better outcomes than open surgery in AD in a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-arm RCT of 104 patients with Hinchey I, IIa, or IIb, symptomatic stricture, or severe rectal bleeding. Laparoscopic surgery was associated with a 15.4% reduction in major complication rates, less pain, improved quality of life, and shorter hospitalization. Both the short-term and long-term results of the Sigma trial show a 27% reduction in major morbidity for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for diverticular disease. A multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, open-label trial, however, showed no superiority of laparoscopic lavage compared with sigmoidectomy in patients with purulent perforated diverticulitis. In a recent case–control study of 1175 patients undergoing surgery for Hinchey III or IV peritonitis, preoperative assessment based on an Apgar scoring system integrated with peritonitis exposure in complicated diverticulitis offered the best surgical management strategy for reducing local infection, complications, and the need for ostomy.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guideline — management of diverticular abscess: Image-guided percutaneous drainage is usually recommended for stable patients with abscesses > 3 cm in size (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation occurs in 15% to 40% of patients who present with acute sigmoid diverticulitis, and nonoperative treatment with either antibiotics alone or with percutaneous drainage is successful in up to 80% of cases. Treatment failure is typically defined as requiring surgery, developing worsening sepsis, or having a recurrent abscess within 30 days. Antibiotic treatment alone for abscesses smaller than 3 cm is typically successful and, in stable patients, treatment can usually be administered in the outpatient setting; however, for larger abscesses (> 3 cm) antibiotics alone have a much higher failure rate (up to 34%). Although recurrence after antibiotic treatment ranges from 25% to 60% of patients, recurrence after percutaneous drainage is significantly lower (15%–25%). Patients without a safe access window for percutaneous drainage or who do not respond to medical treatment including percutaneous drainage should typically be considered for surgery, and laparoscopic abscess drainage rather than surgical resection can be considered in certain cases.

Acute diverticulitis — management with extraluminal or free air emphasizes non-operative care in stable patients and identifies predictors of failure. The majority of stable patients with radiological evidence of extraluminal air and no extravasation of contrast can be successfully managed non-operatively. The presence of an associated abscess or distant air are predictors of failure of non-operative management. In stable patients diagnosed with free air, we recommend initial non-operative management.

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^b663af4b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment of localized complicated diverticulitis

10) Patients with CT findings of pericolic air or small fluid collection should be managed by antimicrobial therapy. (Recommendation 1 C).

High mortality associated with sepsis, requires maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion for deterioration and more aggressive management. WSES expert panel routinely recommends antimicrobial therapy in patients with pericolic air or small fluid collection. CT findings of pericolic air in the form of air bubbles or little pericolic fluid without abscess and distant air indicates a complicated acute diverticulitis and antimicrobial therapy should always recommended.

Treatment of diverticular abscesses

11) Patients with small diverticular abscesses (< 4–5 cm) may be treated by antibiotics alone (Recommendation 1 C).
12) Patients with large abscesses (> 4–5 cm) can best be treated by percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment (Recommendation 1 C).
13) Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by antibiotic therapy alone. However careful clinical monitoring is mandatory. (Recommendation 1 C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The size of 3–6 cm has been generally accepted as (all of low level of evidence), to be a reasonable limit between antimicrobial versus percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses. The size of 4–5 cm may be a reasonable limit between antibiotic treatment alone versus percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment in the management of diverticular abscesses. Based on the clinical conditions also patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by antibiotic therapy alone. However careful clinical monitoring is mandatory. A CT scan should be repeated if the patient fails to show clinical and laboratory improvement.

Stage 2 B

A critical issue may be the CT presence of distant free air. Distant air is defined as air collections in the abdominal or retroperitoneal cavity with a distance > 5 cm from the inflamed bowel segment (Figure 5).

Figure 5
Distant retroperitoneal free gas by perforated diverticular disease.

Distant pneumoperitoneum is pathognomonic for sigmoid perforation even in absence of CT findings of diffuse peritoneal fluid.

Free air, seen on CT, has already been reported to be a useful predictor of failure of nonoperative treatment even if Dharmarajan et al. reported high success rate for nonoperative management in patients with diverticulitis and a pneumoperitoneum, excluding those with hemodynamic instability. In this study 136 patients were identified with perforated diverticulitis: 19 had localized free air, 45 had abscess < 4 cm or distant free air measuring < 2 cm, 66 had abscess > 4 cm or distant free air > 2 cm, and 6 had distant free air with free fluid. Thirty-eight patients (28%) required percutaneous abscess drainage and 37 (27%) required parenteral nutrition. Only 5 patients (3.7%) required urgent surgery at the time of admission, and 7 (5%) required urgent surgery for failed non-operative management.

An interesting retrospective cohort analysis was recently published to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of non-operative treatment of acute diverticulitis with extraluminal air.

A total of 132 patients underwent non-operative treatment and 48 patients were primarily operated on. Patients treated non-operatively were divided into 3 groups. Patients with pericolic air without abscess had a 99% success rate with 0% mortality. Patients with distant intraperitoneal air had a 62% success rate.

Whereas small series have demonstrated successful initial non-operative management of patients with acute complicated diverticulitis with perforation, even in the face of pneumoperitoneum, this strategy is reserved for highly selected stable patients without diffuse peritoneal findings with the goal of converting an emergent or urgent situation to one where an elective, single-stage operation can be performed.

Patients with distant air (> 5 cm from inflamed bowel segment) may be treated by conservative treatment in selected cases.

However it is associated with failure and may necessitate surgical operation. Careful clinical monitoring is mandatory. A CT scan should be repeated early on the basis of the clinical evolution.

Surgical resection and anastomosis with or without stoma is suggested in stable patients without multiple co-morbidities. Hartmann resection is suggested in unstable patients or in patients with multiple co-morbidities.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^549aeb7a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — initial management of acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis: "ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)". For select patients with abdominal tenderness, "it is reasonable to initially manage them by observation with supportive care (for example, bowel rest and hydration) and without the use of antibiotics", and "Select patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with mild, uncomplicated disease who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support". Evidence cited states there "may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications (such as abscess, fistula, stenosis, and obstruction), quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics", though "antibiotic treatment may slightly decrease treatment failure rates (defined as "ongoing diverticulitis" within 3 months of treatment) compared with no antibiotic treatment". Clinical considerations specify this "does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment", and that "Initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, based on individual clinical judgment".

### Multicentre study of non-surgical management of diverticulitis with abscess formation [^d8d004bd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diverticulosis is common in the Western world and is estimated to affect more than half of the population over the age of 65 years 1. Diverticulosis might lead to diverticulitis in approximately 4.3–7 per cent of patients 2, 3, of which 25 per cent present with acute complicated diverticulitis; this can consist of severe complications, such as abscess, perforation, stenosis or fistula 4. Abscess formation occurs in approximately 15 per cent of patients with acute complicated diverticulitis 5, 6, 7. It can be classified according to the modified Hinchey classification as type Ib (confined pericolic abscess smaller than 5 cm) or Hinchey II (pelvic, distant intra‐abdominal or retroperitoneal abscess at least 5 cm in size) 8, 9.

Over the years, treatment strategies for diverticulitis with abscess formation have gradually shifted from (emergency) surgical treatment to non‐surgical management comprising antibiotics with or without percutaneous drainage (PCD) 10. Currently, guidelines 11, 12, 13 advise that small pericolic abscesses can be treated with antibiotics, whereas distant (pelvic) or larger abscesses, usually defined as those with a diameter of 3–5 cm or larger, should be treated with PCD, if possible. As patients undergoing non‐surgical treatment are at risk of adverse outcomes such as emergency surgery, disease recurrence, readmission and even death (both in the short and long term) 10, 14, adequate patient selection for the optimal choice of treatment has come to play an important role in the management of these patients.

However, the clinical course of complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation after non‐surgical treatment, as well as the risk factors for adverse outcomes, have not been analysed adequately 10, 12. Most of the existing studies 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 addressing these topics are limited by a short follow‐up, small and single‐institution study populations and a lack of time‐to‐event analysis.

Therefore, the primary aim of this multicentre retrospective study was to assess both the short‐ and long‐term outcomes of initial non‐surgical treatment strategies for acute complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation (Hinchey Ib and II) in a large number of patients. The second aim was to identify risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, to help facilitate adequate patient selection and assess the optimal treatment strategy.

Statement 9

Highly selected patients with perforated diverticulitis (including those with an abscess < 4 cm in diameter), a peri-appendiceal mass, or a perforated peptic ulcer can be managed without definitive source control if responding satisfactorily to antimicrobial therapy and other supportive measures. (Recommendation 1 B).

An operative intervention remains the most viable therapeutic strategy for managing intra-abdominal sepsis. Surgical source control entails resection or suture of a diseased or perforated viscus (e.g. diverticular perforation, gastroduodenal perforation), removal of the infected organ (e.g. appendix, gallbladder), debridement of necrotic tissue, resection of ischemic bowel, and repair/resection of traumatic perforations with primary anastomosis or exteriorization of the bowel.

However, some data indicate highly selected patients can be managed without definitive source control if responding satisfactorily to antimicrobial therapy alone.

In addition, well-localized fluid collections of appropriate density and consistency (i.e. lack of extensive loculations) may be drained percutaneously with acceptable morbidity and mortality.

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. These abscesses may be initially treated by intravenous antibiotics alone with or without percutaneous drainage, depending on the size of the abscess. A maximum diameter of 3–6 cm has been generally accepted as a reasonable limit for treatment with antimicrobial therapy alone without drainage.

Although the absolute prevalence of perforated diverticulitis complicated by generalized peritonitis is low, it has a significant post-operative mortality, regardless of selected surgical strategy. However, CT findings of distant free air (a known predictor of failure of non-operative treatment) does not necessarily obligate a surgical approach. Dharmarajan et al. described a high success rate for non-operative management in patients with acute diverticulitis and a pneumoperitoneum, excluding those with hemodynamic instability.

Perform an operative intervention as an alternative option.

Figure 1
Management algorithm for Acute Colonic Diverticulitis.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is common. Each year, in the United States alone, approximately half a million patients with ACD will present to an Emergency Department, with more than 200,000 hospital admissions required. While the prevalence of ACD increases with aging, particularly in women, there is a notable increase in younger age bands. The vast majority of patients in North America develop left-sided disease, particularly in the sigmoid colon, whereas right-sided disease is more prevalent in other parts of the world such as Asia.

For patients presenting with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, and laboratory evidence of inflammation, which may include an elevated CRP or white blood cell count, the diagnostic evaluation should begin with an abdominal computed tomography (CT). Computed tomography with intravenous contrast is the defacto gold standard imaging modality as it will confirm the diagnosis, exclude concurrent pathology, and provide information on the extent of disease, which is critical to subsequent clinical decision-making. The CT can also be utilized to track the clinical response to treatment. In contemporary practice, the extent of disease visualized on CT is utilized to classify ACD. In particular, careful note should be taken of the location of the diverticuli, as well as the extent of inflammation involving the bowel wall and contiguous structures. The location and characteristics of any associated air or fluid as well as the location, size and percutaneous accessibility of any abscess collections should also be delineated on the index CT.
Multiple contemporary classification systems are available to describe the severity of ACD (Table 1). These classification systems are important for clinical decision-making, documentation of the extent of disease, and research. In general, the classification systems separate patients into those with complicated versus uncomplicated disease. The seminal 1978 Hinchey classification, has been modified, to better incorporate CT findings (Table 1). One of the most commonly cited modificationssubdivides the Hinchey classification into six stages. Stage 0 consists of mild, uncomplicated diverticulitis. Stage 1 is subdivided into Stage 1a, where there is limited pericolic inflammation, and 1b, where there is inflammation with an associated pericolic abscess, confined to the pericolonic region. In Stage 2, there is a distal abscess, which may be located for example in the pelvis or retroperitoneum, away from the area of colonic inflammation. In Stage 3, similar to the original Hinchey description, there is generalized purulent peritonitis, and Stage 4 is characterized by free perforation with feculent peritonitis. The AAST grading system is also frequently cited. Here, Grade 1 is described as colonic inflammation, progressing to Grade 2 with microperforation or pericolic phlegmon without abscess. Grade 3 describes patients with a localized abscess, Grade 4 is characterized by the presence of a distant abscess, and Grade 5 is reserved for patients with a free perforation and generalized peritonitis. Multiple studies have compared the different classification systems for ACD and found them to be similar in their ability to predict the need for procedural interventions, complications and outcomes
For patients with uncomplicated ACD, without evidence of abscess or generalized peritonitis requiring acute surgical or percutaneous intervention, the classic mainstay of treatment included admission for a course of IV antibiotics. The balance of the available evidence however no longer supports admission or the universal use of antibiotics for all patients. In the AVOD trial, which enrolled patients in Sweden and Iceland, 623 patients with acute uncomplicated left sided ACD on CT were randomized to treatment with either antibiotics or symptomatic treatment without the use of antibiotics. There was no difference in the complication or recurrence rate, and antibiotic treatment did not decrease recovery time. Long-term follow-up to a median of 11 years demonstrated no difference between the treatment arms. In the DIABOLO trial,528 patients in the Netherlands with CT-proven acute uncomplicated diverticulitis were randomized to a management strategy of antibiotics or treatment without antibiotics. Those patients treated without antibiotics had a decreased hospital length of stay, and no difference was seen in any of the secondary outcome measures including complications, recurrence, need for surgery or adverse events. Longer-term follow-up out to 24 months demonstrated no difference in complications, recurrence, or need for sigmoid resection. In the DINAMO study,480 patients with ACD were randomized to antibiotics versus symptomatic treatment alone, with no difference seen in the primary outcome measure of hospital admission. A recent meta-analysis of 2505 patients demonstrated that there was a decrease in hospital length of stay when antibiotics were not used, with no increase in the need for additional treatments, complications, or recurrence. One area of controversy is the patient with extracolonic gas visible on CT. In a recent analysisof patients enrolled in the DIABOLO trial, Hinchey 1a patients with extracolonic gas localized to an area < 5 cm from the inflamed area of the colon could also able to be managed successfully without an operation. However, there was insufficient data to provide a recommendation on the need for antibiotics. Overall, while most patients undergoing non-operative management of ACD will not require antibiotics, despite the available data, because of the restrictive inclusion criteria utilized to enroll into these randomized trials, there may still be patients who benefit from receiving antibiotics. This is an individualized decision and will depend on intrinsic patient factors. As summarized by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) statement on ACD, antibiotics should be considered in patients with significant comorbidities, overt signs of systemic infection, or those who are immunosuppressed. Practically, when it comes to the route of administration, if a decision is made to utilize antibiotics, a meta-analysis of 355 patientsreported that oral antibiotics did not result in an increase in treatment failure or recurrence when compared with IV antibiotics. This also facilitates decision-making regarding outpatient versus inpatient treatment. In the DIVER trial,132 patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis were randomized to in-hospital versus outpatient treatment. There was no difference in treatment failure rates when treatment was completed as an outpatient. Outpatient treatment was associated with a significant decrease in costs but equivalent measured quality of life. For patients who fail treatment, with or without antibiotics, we recommend repeat imaging to re-evaluate the extent of inflammation, and to examine for the development of complications. For those patients who are successfully managed non-operatively, consideration should be given to post-discharge colonoscopy.
For patients with complicated ACD with an abscess identified on CT, subsequent decision-making centers around the size, and percutaneous accessibility of the collection. While operative source control is always an option, image-guided percutaneous drainage when available, is favored. For small fluid collections, a trial of antibiotics can be attempted. The definition of small varies, but in general 3 cmto 4 cm, is often used as a pragmatic size cutoff. For those undergoing percutaneous drainage, a total course of 4 days of antibiotics are recommended based on the STOP-IT trialresults. For patients who fail percutaneous management, operative management remains an option.
For patients who present with diffuse peritonitis, or, are hemodynamically abnormal as a result of the inflammatory process, operative intervention is required. This may also be the case for patients who do not tolerate a trial of nonoperative management attempt, which includes failed percutaneous drainage of a localized collection. Traditionally, for patients with Hinchey Class 3 or 4 complicated diverticulitis, the operative intervention consisted of a classic Hartmann's procedure. This included a sigmoid resection, with an end colostomy at the index operation, followed by a delayed reconstruction. In the recent past, there have been multiple trials examining surgical options other than a Hartmann's procedure. – The primary comparator to the Hartmann's procedure in these trials was a single-stage colon resection, with primary anastomosis, with or without a protective proximal ileostomy. In the DIVERTI trial, those undergoing primary anastomosis had a higher rate of stoma closure than those undergoing a Hartmann's procedure, with no increase in mortality or complication rate. In a subset of the LADIES trial,133 patients with Hinchey III or IV ACD were randomized to resection and primary anastomosis versus Hartmann's procedure, demonstrating that the stoma-free survival was higher in the primary anastomosis group. In a recent meta-analysis, primary anastomosis was found to be associated with fewer major complications related to the stoma reversal procedure, and patients were more likely to be stoma-free at 12 months. When performing a resection and primary anastomosis for ACD, the need for a protective diverting loop ileostomy proximal to the anastomosis remains a matter of debate. Although there are ongoing trials including DIVERTI 2, at this time, there is insufficient foundation data to make an evidence-based recommendation. Consequently, this decision should be individualized to the patient depending on patient physiologic factors, and the local conditions seen intra-operatively at the time of the operation. If a stoma is created, early reversal when feasible should be considered. In a recent analysis of the National Readmissions Database, the timing of loop ileostomy reversal was examined in 5,757 patients who underwent emergent sigmoidectomy with primary anastomosis for perforated diverticulitis. Early reversal, 6 weeks to 8 weeks after the index operation, was associated with fewer complications, a shorter length of stay, and lower costs compared with late reversal. While resection with primary anastomosis is now the contemporary evidence-based standard for the index operation, for immunocompromised patients, those with significant co-morbidities, malnutrition, or where there are other technical reasons why a higher risk of anastomotic failure may be expected, the classic Hartmann's procedure remains a viable operative option.
ACD patients presenting in a state of hemodynamic instability, in concert with resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, should undergo source control and colonic resection limited to the area of perforation without mobilization of any unnecessary areas of the colon, such as the splenic flexure. In the index operation, an open-abdomen strategy with a planned second look should be utilized. All other surgical steps such as defining the definitive proximal and distal resection margins and stoma creation should be delayed until the patient is better able to physiologically tolerate completion of the procedure.
The role of laparoscopic lavage as the primary surgical treatment option has also been examined in several randomized controlled trials. This is not recommended for patients with Hinchey Class IV feculent peritonitis with ongoing spillage, as these patients have been excluded from the collection of contemporary randomized trials. For patients with Hinchey Class III ACD with purulent peritonitis, theoretically, laparoscopic lavage will allow the surgeon to survey the abdomen, ensure the colonic perforation has sealed, and irrigate the abdominal cavity to decrease contamination and provide source control. This could then bridge the patient to an elective sigmoid resection under optimal conditions, allowing the procedure to be completed in a single stage. When the aggregate data available to date is reviewed, there does not appear to be an advantage to this treatment option and as such, laparoscopic lavage has not been universally adopted as a stand-alone index treatment option. There have been three randomized trials examining this minimally invasive operative option. In the SCANDIV trial, 199 patients with peritonitis on physical examination, and a CT demonstrating free air were randomized to laparoscopic lavage or resection. The resection could be performed open or laparoscopic, with or without primary anastomosis. With a median follow-up of 59 months, there was no increase in mortality, or in severe complications in either treatment arm. However, while there may be a lower rate of stoma formation overall, a recurrence was more likely in those patients randomized to laparoscopic lavage. In the DILALA trial, 83 patients were randomized to lavage versus a Hartmann's procedure during the index operation. There was no difference in the readmission rate, or survival, but the patients undergoing lavage had a lower chance of requiring operative intervention in the 2 years following randomization. Finally, the LOLAarm of the LADIES trial enrolled patients with purulent, but not feculent peritonitis, and randomized them to lavage versus either a Hartmann's procedure or resection with primary anastomosis. The study was terminated early, prior to study completion, due to increased complications, particularly abscess formation, in the lavage arm. Follow-up to 3 years showed that there was no difference in mortality or complication burden however, there may be a lower stoma rate among those undergoing lavage who had survived to that point. A meta-analysis of 589 patients, including 85% with Hinchey III ACD, demonstrated that compared with colonic resection, laparoscopic lavage was associated with a threefold increase in the risk of persistent peritonitis, intraabdominal abscesses and the need for emergency surgery. Another meta-analysis of 294 patients from three RCTs reported that at 3 years, laparoscopic lavage was associated with a significantly decreased likelihood of having a stoma, but an increase in recurrent diverticulitis. The balance of the available data does not support universal application of laparoscopic lavage as a first-line treatment option for ACD. In the 2020 ASCRS guidelines, colectomy is recommended over laparoscopic lavage, citing the higher rates of secondary intervention required. In the EAES and SAGES evidence-based practice recommendations, as well as in the WSES guidelines, laparoscopic lavage is presented as an option for select patients with Hinchey III ACD, provided the expertise is available, along with the ability to closely monitor the patient for what will likely be a higher complication rate and need for re-intervention. As pointed out in a recent review by Biffl et al, following this treatment pathway leads to a decrease in the presence of a stoma in those that survive long-term. This is an option that should be discussed with patients, as many of them have a strong aversion to colostomy. If there is a reasonable chance of resection and primary anastomosis without a diverting ileostomy, this procedure offers no benefit. However, if the goal is to resolve sepsis and bridge the patient to elective resection without an ostomy, minimally invasive lavage may provide a pathway to achieve this goal. It should only be considered for patients who can tolerate the excess complication burden and recurrent infections.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^1893577d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

For some cases of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, NOM without antibiotics is effective. A 2017 RCT (DIABOLO trial) of observation versus systemic antibiotic treatment for a first episode of CT-proved acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis of Hinchey grades 1a and 1b included 528 patients. Median time to recovery was 2 days longer for observation (hazard ratio [HR] for recovery of 0.91, p = 0.151), but hospital stay was significantly shorter. No differences were found for secondary endpoints of complicated, ongoing, or recurrent diverticulitis; sigmoid resection; readmission; adverse events, or mortality. Outcomes of DIABOLO study enrollees at 24 months' follow-up showed no differences in rates of recurrent or complicated diverticulitis, or sigmoid resection.

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess by CT scan. Smaller diverticular abscesses may be treated by systemic antibiotics alone with or without percutaneous drainage, depending on the diameter of the abscess, with up to ~ 4 cm accepted as a reasonable limit for treatment with antibiotic therapy alone. Although the prevalence of perforated diverticulitis complicated by generalized peritonitis (Hinchey 3–4) is low, there is a risk of mortality regardless of the surgical approach. However, distant free air by CT (a known predictor of failure of NOM) does not obligate surgical intervention. Dharmarajan et al. described successful NOM for patients with acute diverticulitis and pneumoperitoneum, excluding those with hemodynamic instability. Sallinen et al. reported results of NOM in patients with CT-verified extra-luminal gas. NOM was feasible for hemodynamically stable patients with pericolic extra-luminal gas, or only a "small amount" of distant intraperitoneal gas in the absence of clinical diffuse peritonitis or fluid in the fossa of Douglas. However, a large amount of distant intra- or retroperitoneal gas was associated with a high failure rate (~ 60%) of NOM, even in the absence of generalized peritonitis.

Antibiotics alone may be used to treat selected patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, although there is a significant risk (~ 40%) of subsequent recurrence. In patients with complicated appendicitis presenting with abscess or phlegmon, optimal management is controversial. One study showed that NOM for a peri-appendiceal abscess or mass resulted in fewer complications and shorter hospitalization.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^3aae81cc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

When abscess diameter is larger, antibiotics could fail to reach the adequate concentration inside the abscess leading to an increased failure rate.

The size of 4–5 cm may be a reasonable limit between antibiotic treatment alone, versus percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment in the management of diverticular abscesses. When the patient's clinical conditions allow it and percutaneous drainage is not feasible, antibiotic therapy alone can be considered. However, careful clinical monitoring is mandatory. A high suspicion for surgical control of the septic source should be maintained and a surgical treatment should be performed if the patient shows a worsening of inflammatory signs or the abscess does not reduce with medical therapy.

There are currently no randomized studies available on the best treatment of intra-abdominal abscess from acute diverticulitis, and current recommendations are based only on observational studies. A retrospective study comparing outcomes of selected patients treated with initial antibiotics alone versus percutaneous drainage was published in 2015 by Elagili et al. All patients with diverticular abscess ≥ 3 cm in diameter treated in a single institution in 1994–2012 with percutaneous drainage or antibiotics alone followed by surgery were identified from an institutional diverticular disease database. Groups were compared based on patient and disease characteristics, treatment failures, and postoperative outcomes. Thirty-two patients were treated with antibiotics alone because of either technically impossible percutaneous drainage or surgeon preference, while 114 underwent percutaneous drainage. Urgent surgery was required in 8 patients with persistent symptoms during treatment with antibiotics alone (25%) and in 21 patients (18%) after initial percutaneous drainage (p = 0.21). Patients treated with antibiotics had a significantly smaller abscess diameter (5.9 vs. 7.1 cm, p = 0.001) and shorter interval from initial treatment to sigmoidectomy (mean 50 vs. 80 days, p = 0.02). Postoperative complications following antibiotics alone were significantly less severe than after percutaneous drainage based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (p = 0.04).

In patients displaying an appropriate clinical improvement, the drainage catheter can be removed when the output has ceased or decreased substantially. In doubtful cases, a CT scan can be performed with water-soluble contrast via the percutaneous drainage catheter prior to drain removal. If no identifiable cavity remains, the catheter should be removed. If resolution of the abscess is not reached and the patient has no clinical improvement, further drainage or catheter repositioning might be indicated and may eventually necessitate surgery.

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^3e17707b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Sigmoid diverticulitis is an increasingly common Western disease associated with a high morbidity and cost of treatment. Improvement in the understanding of the disease process, along with advances in the diagnosis and medical management has led to recent changes in treatment recommendations. The natural history of diverticulitis is more benign than previously thought, and current trends favor more conservative, less invasive management. Despite current recommendations of more restrictive indications for surgery, practice trends indicate an increase in elective operations being performed for the treatment of diverticulitis. Due to diversity in disease presentation, in many cases, optimal surgical treatment of acute diverticulitis remains unclear with regard to patient selection, timing, and technical approach in both elective and urgent settings. As a result, data is limited to mostly retrospective and non-randomized studies. This review addresses the current treatment recommendations for surgical management of diverticulitis, highlighting technical aspects and patterns of care.

### Long-term follow-up after an initial episode of diverticulitis: what are the predictors of recurrence? [^8287f1c3]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of our study was to determine the clinical and CT predictors of recurrent disease after a first episode of diverticulitis that was successfully managed nonoperatively.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 954 consecutive patients who presented to our institution with diverticulitis from 2002 to 2008. Patients were identified with International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision/Current Procedural Terminology codes. Patients were excluded if they had subsequent colectomy based on the first attack (n = 81), or if the attack they had between 2002 and 2008 was not their first attack (n = 201). We evaluated CT variables chosen by a panel of expert gastrointestinal radiologists. These radiologists reviewed the available published literature for CT imaging characteristics thought to predict diverticulitis severity. CT variables (n = 20) were determined by prospective reevaluation of scans by blinded study radiologists. Clinical variables (n = 43) were coded based on a retrospective chart review. Univariate analysis of variables in relation to recurrent disease was performed by a log-rank test of Kaplan-Meier estimates. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Variables with P < .2 on univariate analysis were included in a stepwise selection algorithm.

Results

The study population included 672 patients; mean age, 61 ± 15 years; mean follow-up, 42.8 ± 24 months. The index presentation of diverticulitis was most commonly located in the sigmoid colon (72%), followed by descending colon (33%), right colon (5%), and transverse colon (3%). Overall recurrence at 5 years was 36% by (95% CI 31.4%-40.6%) Kaplan-Meier estimate. Complicated recurrence (fistula, abscess, free perforation) occurred in 3.9% (95% CI 2.2%-5.6%) of patients at 5 years by Kaplan-Meier estimate. Family history of diverticulitis (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.2), length of involved colon > 5 cm (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.3), and retroperitoneal abscess (HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.1–18.4) were associated with diverticulitis recurrence. Right colon disease (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09–0.86) was associated with freedom from recurrence.

Conclusion

Although diverticulitis recurrence is common following an initial attack that has been managed medically, complicated recurrence is uncommon. Patients who present with a family history of diverticulitis, long segment of involved colon, and/or retroperitoneal abscess are at higher risk for recurrent disease. Patients who present with right-sided diverticulitis are at low risk for recurrent disease. These findings should be taken into consideration when counseling patients regarding the potential benefits of prophylactic colectomy.

### A proposal for a CT driven classification of left colon acute diverticulitis [^df0d56a0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Stage 2 A

Acute left diverticulitis with abscesses > 4 cm respond better to percutaneous drainage with intravenous antibiotics (Figure 4). This is regardless of location (pelvic versus pericolic abscess). Percutaneous drainage has the advantage of allowing patients to avoid urgent operation. The location of the abscess and its suitability and accessibility for radiologically percutaneous guided aspiration or drainage also needs to be carefully considered. In addition, patients with critical illness (for example severe sepsis or septic shock) may not be suitable candidates for radiological drainage and may be better treated with emergency surgery if they are fit enough. Antimicrobial therapy should always be given in addition to appropriate source control.

Figure 4
Sigmoid diverticulitis with associated abscess formation.

In selected cases when radiological drainage is not suitable or fails, laparoscopic/open peritoneal lavage and drainage, appears to be a useful option.

Abscesses having a diameter of more than 4 cm are best treated by percutaneous drainage and intravenous antibiotics long as the patients do not have severe sepsis/septic shock. Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, both surgical drainage of the abscess and surgical resection and anastomosis are viable options.

CT scan should be repeated to demonstrate the resolution of the abscess. In patients who have persistent or recurrent clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection after 4–6 days of therapy, CT imaging should be undertaken.

Emergency surgery for acute diverticulitis — "Urgent sigmoid colectomy is typically advised for patients with diffuse peritonitis or for those in whom nonoperative management of acute diverticulitis fails" (Grade of Recommendation: "Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C"). Although most hospitalized patients respond to nonoperative care, "15% to 32% may require an emergency operation". In a retrospective NSQIP analysis, "in 2214 patients, the overall 30-day operative mortality was 5.1%", with mortality predictors "age > 80 years, ASA class 4 or 5, serum creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL, and an albumin < 2.5 g/dL", and "Patients with 2, 3, or 4 of these predictors had a 30-day mortality rate of 10%, 22.9%, and 53.4%". A "small proportion of highly selected, stable patients with perforated diverticulitis, even with pneumoperitoneum but without diffuse peritoneal findings, may be successfully managed nonoperatively", and "attempts can be made to convert an urgent or emergent operation to an elective operation to try to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality".

Hinchey III-IV

The incidence of free perforation (purulent and feculent peritonitis) appears to have remained stable in recent years at around 1.5%. Patients who present with sepsis and diffuse peritonitis require urgent operative intervention. Two single institution studies, however, have recently suggested nonoperative management for select patients in the absence of severe sepsis.

When treated nonoperatively, complicated diverticulitis is associated with high recurrence rates, reported up to 50%. When compared to those with uncomplicated diverticulitis higher incidences of late complications including persistent symptoms, abscess, fistula and stricture have been reported. In several studies, the severity of the initial disease presentation, based on CT findings, is directly correlated to an increased risk of recurrence and subsequent complications. To further evaluate this relationship, Ambrosetti et al developed a CT-based severity grade and correlated this retrospectively with patient outcomes, elucidating the value of imaging as a prognostic indicator to guide management. A "severe grade" on CT, which included evidence of abscess, extraluminal air, or extraluminal contrast was statistically predictive of medical treatment failure in the acute phase, and for increased risk of recurrence or additional complications after successful nonoperative management.

Location and size of the abscess on presentation also contributed to the risk of recurrence and failure of nonoperative treatment. In a prospective study of 73 patients with diverticular abscesses, pelvic abscesses were associated with worse outcomes when compared to mesocolic abscesses. In a retrospective study of 218 patients undergoing percutaneous drainage, a larger abscess, defined as size greater than 5 cm, was also significantly associated with higher recurrence rates.

Controversy exists as to whether or not elective colon resection after successful nonoperative management of complicated diverticulitis is necessary. This notion is supported by the fact that observation after percutaneous drainage appears to be safe in selected patients.

According to the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) practice parameters, elective colon resection should typically be advised after a complicated episode is initially treated nonoperatively, due to the high incidence of medical treatment failure, recurrence, and late complications. In addition, patients with fistula formation or stricturing disease are recommended for resection. A summary of recommendations from the ASCRS Practice Parameters for Sigmoid Diverticulitis and the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) Position Statement on Elective Resection for Diverticulitis are presented in Table 2.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^5bbf9ff6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The grade and stage of diverticulitis are determined by clinical severity and Hinchey classification of disease, and used to identify patents likely to fail medical management or require surgery. Hinchey's classification provides a means of consistent classification of severity of disease for clinical description and decision making. Perforation with operative findings of purulent peritonitis corresponds to Hinchey stage III, and feculent peritonitis to Hinchey stage IV. Stage I and Stage II refer to inflammatory phlegmon and paracolic abscesses.

Systemic antibiotic treatment alone is usually the most appropriate treatment for patients with small (< 4 cm in diameter) diverticular abscesses; image-guided (ultrasound- or CT-guided) percutaneous drainage is suggested for patients with large diverticular abscesses (> 4 cm in diameter) (Recommendation 2B).

For patients with diverticulitis complicated by peridiverticular abscesses, the size of an abscess is an important factor in determining the proper course of action and in deciding whether or not percutaneous drainage is the optimal approach.

Patients with small pericolic abscesses (< 4 cm in diameter) without generalized peritonitis (Hinchey Stage 1) can be treated conservatively with bowel rest and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

For patients with peridiverticular abscesses larger than 4 cm in diameter, observational studies indicate that CT-guided percutaneous drainage is the treatment of choice.

Recommendations for elective sigmoid colectomy following recovery from acute diverticulitis should be made on a case-by-case basis (Recommendation 1C).

The role of prophylactic surgery following conservatively managed diverticulitis remains unclear and controversial.

Although elective resection is often recommended after single episodes of complicated acute diverticulits that were resolved with conservative treatment, such an invasive procedure following a favorable response to noninvasive methods has serious implications and should be made on an individual basis.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^94358ffb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Sallinen et al. reported results of non-operative management in patients with CT verified extra-luminal air. This study showed that non-operative treatment was feasible therapy only for hemodynamically stable patients with CT findings of pericolic extra-luminal air or only a small amount of distant intraperitoneal air in the absence of clinical diffuse peritonitis or fluid in the fossa of Douglas. A large amount of distant intraperitoneal air or distant retroperitoneal air even in the absence of clinical generalized peritonitis was associated with a high failure rate (57–60%) of non-operative management.

Recent WSES guidelines for management of acute left colonic diverticulitis state that patients with CT findings of distant air without diffuse fluid may be treated by conservative treatment in selected cases; however, a risk of treatment failure and need for emergency surgery exists.

Antibiotics alone may be used to treat patients with early, non-perforated appendicitis, although there is a significant risk of subsequent recurrence.

In patients with complicated appendicitis, presenting with abscess or phlegmon, the optimal management strategy has been somewhat controversial. Several studies have found that non-operative treatment for a peri-appendiceal abscesses or masses results in fewer complications and shorter overall hospitalization.

In 2010, a meta-analysis was published comparing conservative treatment (i.e. antibiotic therapy with or without percutaneous abscess drainage) to appendectomy for the treatment of complicated appendicitis (cases exhibiting abscess or phlegmon). Seventeen studies (16 non-randomized/retrospective and one non-randomized/prospective) reported clinical data for 1572 patients of whom 847 patients received conservative treatment and 725 underwent acute appendectomy. Conservative treatment was associated with significantly fewer complications, wound infections, abdominal/pelvic abscesses, ileus, bowel obstruction, and additional follow-up surgeries. No significant differences were found in the overall length of hospitalization or in the duration of intravenous antibiotic infusion. Overall, clinical data supports the utility of conservative management rather than appendectomy in selected patients presenting with a peri-appendiceal abscess or phlegmon.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^cce4f643]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Systemic antibiotic treatment alone is usually the most appropriate treatment for patients with a small (< 4 cm in diameter) diverticular abscess and image guided percutaneous drainage is for those with a large (> 4 cm in diameter) one (Recommendation 2 B).

For patients in whom diverticulitis is complicated by peridiverticular abscess formation, the size of the abscess is an important determinant of the need for percutaneous drainage. Many patients who have small pericolic abscesses (4 cm or less in diameter) without peritonitis (Hinchey stage 1) can be treated conservatively with bowel rest and broad-spectrum antibiotics. For patients with peridiverticular abscesses that are larger than 4 cm in diameter (Hinchey stage 2), observational studies indicate that CT-guided percutaneous drainage can be beneficial. This procedure typically eliminates or reduces the size of the abscess, with a reduction in pain, resolution of leukocytosis, and defervescence usually seen within several days. Percutaneous drainage may allow for elective rather than emergency surgery, increasing the likelihood of a successful one-stage procedure. Patients whose abscess cavities contain gross feculent material tend to respond poorly, and early surgical intervention is usually required.

Elective colon resection should typically be advised if an episode of complicated diverticulitis is treated non-operatively (Recommendation 2 C).

After percutaneous drainage of a diverticular abscess, a later colectomy usually should be planned, because 41 percent of patients will otherwise develop severe recurrent sepsis. Some, but not all, retrospective studies suggest that the number of recurrences is associated with the chance that emergency surgery will be required at some point in the future.

The resection should be carried proximally to the compliant bowel and extend distally to the upper rectum (Recommendation 1 C).

It is usually sufficient to remove only the most severely affected segment; however, the proximal margin of resection should be in an area of pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed. Usually a sigmoid colectomy will suffice; however, occasionally the proximal resection margin must extend well into the descending colon or to the left transverse colon. Distally, the margin of resection should be where the taenia coli splay out onto the upper rectum. After sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis, an important predictor of recurrent diverticulitis is a colosigmoid rather than a colorectal anastomosis.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^6d0df3c7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Non-operative treatment, with bowel rest and antibiotics, is suggested in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

Conservative treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is successful in 70 to 100 percent of patients. Uncomplicated diverticulitis may be managed as an outpatient (dietary modification and oral antibiotics) for those without appreciable fever, excessive vomiting, or marked peritonitis, as long as there is the opportunity for follow-up. The patient should be able to take liquids and antibiotics by mouth. Hospitalization is indicated if the patient is unable to take liquids or has severe pain, or if symptoms fail to improve despite adequate outpatient therapy. Antibiotics should be selected to treat the most common bacteria found in the colon: gram-negative rods and anaerobic bacteria. Non-operative treatment will resolve acute diverticulitis in 85 percent of patients, but approximately one-third will have a recurrent attack often within one year.

The decision to recommend elective sigmoid colectomy after recovery from acute diverticulitis should be made on a case-by-case basis (Recommendation 1 C).

The overall rate of recurrence appears to be approximately 10 to 30% within a decade after a first documented attack and that the majority of patients who have a single episode of diverticulitis will not have another. In one report involving an average follow-up of 9 years with 2551 patients whose initial episode of diverticulitis was treated successfully without surgery, only 13% had recurrent attacks and only 7% required colectomy. These observations imply that routine elective colectomy is probably unwarranted if the disease is successfully managed on initial presentation and that surgical treatment should be limited to patients whose symptoms persist despite conservative therapy. Thus, continued observation may be appropriate for most patients who have repeated attacks of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Sigmoid diverticulitis: a systematic review [^00302677]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Diverticulitis is a common disease. Recent changes in understanding its natural history have substantially modified treatment paradigms.

Objective

To review the etiology and natural history of diverticulitis and recent changes in treatment guidelines.

Evidence Review

We searched the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for English-language articles pertaining to diagnosis and management of diverticulitis published between January 1, 2000, and March 31, 2013. Search terms applied to 4 thematic topics: pathophysiology, natural history, medical management, and indications for surgery. We excluded small case series and articles based on data accrued prior to 2000. We hand searched the bibliographies of included studies, yielding a total of 186 articles for full review. We graded the level of evidence and classified recommendations by size of treatment effect, according to the guidelines from the American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.

Findings

Eighty articles met criteria for analysis. The pathophysiology of diverticulitis is associated with altered gut motility, increased luminal pressure, and a disordered colonic microenvironment. Several studies examined histologic commonalities with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome but were focused on associative rather than causal pathways. The natural history of uncomplicated diverticulitis is often benign. For example, in a cohort study of 2366 of 3165 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis and followed up for 8.9 years, only 13.3% of patients had a recurrence and 3.9%, a second recurrence. In contrast to what was previously thought, the risk of septic peritonitis is reduced and not increased with each recurrence. Patient-reported outcomes studies show 20% to 35% of patients managed nonoperatively progress to chronic abdominal pain compared with 5% to 25% of patients treated operatively. Randomized trials and cohort studies have shown that antibiotics and fiber were not as beneficial as previously thought and that mesalamine might be useful. Surgical therapy for chronic disease is not always warranted.

Conclusions and Relevance

Recent studies demonstrate a lesser role for aggressive antibiotic or surgical intervention for chronic or recurrent diverticulitis than was previously thought necessary.

Elective surgical interventions to prevent recurrence of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — The review identified 2 small RCTs reported in 4 articles and 1 large nonrandomized controlled trial comparing elective surgery (laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy or colectomy) with nonoperative management in adults with a history of acute complicated or uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis with smoldering symptoms (persisting > 3 months) or frequent recurrences (≥ 3 episodes within 2 years). In addition, 16 comparative studies reporting on adverse events after surgery were also considered. Across studies, abscess was diagnosed in 42% to 58% of enrolled participants, participant ages were in their mid 50s, and 28% to 63% were males. All outcomes were rated as critical.

### Diverticular abscess managed with long-term definitive nonoperative intent is safe [^351b07f0]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Initial nonoperative management of diverticular abscess has become the standard of care; however, the need for elective resection after this index episode is unclear.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of expectant management after initial nonoperative treatment of diverticular abscess.

Design

This was a retrospective chart review with prospective telephone follow-up of patients.

Settings

The study was conducted at a large tertiary academic colorectal surgery practice in Canada.

Patients

Adult patients with CT-documented acute sigmoid diverticulitis complicated by abscess managed nonoperatively from 2000 to 2013 were included.

Interventions

Long-term definitive nonoperative management of diverticular abscess.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was emergency sigmoidectomy or death from recurrent diverticulitis. Secondary outcomes were recurrent diverticulitis and elective sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis.

Results

Of 135 patients with acute diverticulitis complicated by abscess, a total of 73 patients were managed with nonoperative intent and long-term expectant management. The median follow-up was 62 (Q1 to Q3: 28–98) months. After resolution of the index episode, 22 patients [30.1% (95% CI, 19.6%-40.6%)] experienced a recurrent episode of diverticulitis at a median of 23 (range, 9–40) months. Two patients [2.7% (95% CI, -1.0% to 6.4%)] had a recurrent episode with peritonitis that required sigmoidectomy with stoma at 6 and 64 months. Both patients underwent reversal after 4 and 8 months. Seven [9.6% (95% CI, 2.8%-16.4%)] patients experienced a complicated recurrence and underwent an elective sigmoidectomy [median time to colectomy, 33 (range, 16–56) months]. Thirteen patients [17.8% (95% CI, 9.0%-26.6%)] experienced an uncomplicated recurrence, all of whom were managed with continued nonoperative intent [median follow-up, 81 (range, 34–115) months]. No mortality occurred. On multivariate logistic regression, female gender (p = 0.048) and a previous episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis before the index diverticular abscess (p = 0.020) were associated with a recurrent episode.

Limitations

This study was limited by its retrospective design and modest sample size.

Conclusions

After initial successful nonoperative management of diverticulitis with abscess, expectant management with nonoperative intent is a safe long-term option with low rates of surgery, especially in the emergency setting.

### Management of colonic diverticulitis [^1618d37c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Left sided colonic diverticulitis is a common and costly gastrointestinal disease in Western countries, characterized by acute onset of often severe abdominal pain. Imaging is necessary to make an initial diagnosis and determine disease severity. Colonoscopy should be done six to eight weeks after diagnosis to rule out a missed colon malignancy. Antibiotic treatment is used selectively in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The clinical course of diverticulitis commonly includes unpredictable recurrences and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, which are a detriment to quality of life. A better understanding of prognosis has prompted a shift toward non-operative approaches. The decision to undergo prophylactic colon resection should be individualized to consider the severity of diverticulitis, the patient's health and immune status, and the patient's preferences and values, as well as benefits and risks. Because only a section of colon is removed, recurrent diverticulitis remains a risk. Acute diverticulitis with an abscess is treated with antibiotics that cover Gram negative and anaerobic bacteria, with or without percutaneous drainage. Acute diverticulitis with purulent or feculent contamination of the peritoneal cavity is managed with surgery; primary resection and anastomosis is the procedure of choice in stable patients.

Management of complicated diverticulitis

Need for hospitalization

Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses support the safety of treating patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis in the outpatient setting, though patients with significant comorbidities or immunosuppression are often excluded. Just 2 studies to date examining outpatient therapy for diverticulitis have included patients with any complicated disease. Joliat et al included stable patients with mild complicated diverticulitis (defined as abscess < 4 cm or pneumoperitoneum < 2 cm) in their retrospective outpatient study and determined it was safe to manage this group as outpatients with close follow up. Sirany et al also retrospectively analyzed patients with diverticulitis and found a very small subset (n = 6) who had complicated disease and were discharged home from the emergency department with a 50% readmission rate, thus preventing the authors from drawing any conclusions about the safety of managing patients with complicated disease in the outpatient setting. Further work is needed to determine which subgroups of patients with complicated diverticulitis may be appropriate for outpatient care.

Non-operative therapy

Non-operative and/or percutaneous management of complicated diverticulitis has long been favored for stable patients. Internationally, mixed guidelines exist on the role of elective resection following non-operative treatment of complicated disease. Generally, the literature supports the fact that patients who do not have resections following the treatment of complicated disease will go on to have recurrent episodes, if not ongoing smoldering symptoms. However, additional outcomes are less well studied.

A recent retrospective review of Swiss and Scottish patients from 2005–2015 attempted to answer the question of whether elective interval resection for initially non-operatively managed complicated diverticulitis is associated with adverse outcomes. While 25% of Swiss and 5% of Scottish patients underwent interval resection, the authors found no difference in the rates of emergency surgical intervention or death between the populations (5% in both groups). The authors challenged the routine recommendation of prophylactic surgery following nonoperative management of complicated diverticulitis, as is the current practice according to German and American guidelines. An RCT is needed to determine the long-term safety of non-operative treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

Definition of outcomes

The primary study endpoint was the occurrence of non-operative treatment failure, defined as failure whenever a patient required emergency surgery or died due to abdominal sepsis during the hospital stay despite the planned non-operative treatment. The non-operative treatment was defined as successful when the acute infective condition was resolved conservatively, with the regression of symptoms and the normalization of inflammatory indexes, and the patient was discharged without the need for surgical intervention. Clinical definitions of non-operative treatment failure included at least one of the following: the occurrence of diffuse peritonitis, septic shock, increased size of the abscess at the follow-up CT scan, presence of four-quadrant free abdominal fluid at the follow-up CT scan, or lack of dimensional improvement of the abscess at the follow-up CT scan. Follow-up CT scans were performed during the index hospital admission. In all cases, in order to define the failure of conservative therapy, patient's clinical deterioration had to be documented.

Patients with planned colorectal resection for complicated acute diverticulitis after the success of non-operative treatment were excluded. Any adverse events after the discharge date (readmission, radiologic interventions, surgical intervention, and mortality) were not considered failures of non-operative treatment.

The secondary outcome was the recurrence of acute diverticulitis requiring hospital readmission within 90 days after discharge (within 30 days or after 30 days from the index episode). Admissions for elective operations were excluded from this outcome. In-hospital morbidity (infections, surgical complications, adverse drug reactions) was graded based on severity according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, based on the number of patients with at least one complication. Although policies for percutaneous drainage placement may differ from centre to centre, guidelines for establishing the correct indication of the procedure were followed in the participating sites.

After the initial attempt of conservative treatment with antibiotics plus/minus percutaneous drainage, if the patient required emergency surgery, a consultant-level on-call surgeon decided to operate based on the clinical condition, laboratory parameters, and radiological findings suggestive of patient deterioration, clinical worsening, or not improving conditions. The reasons for the decision to operate were registered in the clinical notes and translated into the database. The > 30 days patient follow-up was conducted by contacting the patients via telephone and obtaining all the pertinent clinical notes on eventual further episodes of recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis requiring hospital admission after the initial non-operative approach.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^a3fa9f82]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis — conclusions state that colonic diverticulitis is a painful disease that occurs unpredictably; although most patients never experience a perforation or abscess, uncomplicated recurrences are a burden to patients and many worry about recurrence, perforation, and need for surgery. Gastroenterologists can alleviate many of these concerns by making an accurate diagnosis, addressing chronic sequelae, and educating patients on risk factors, prognosis, and indications for surgery. Although the advice in this document is based on low- to moderate-quality evidence, research is ongoing and has the potential to eventually identify better options for diverticulitis treatment and prevention.

### Randomized clinical trial of elective resection versus observation in diverticulitis with extraluminal air or abscess initially managed conservatively [^cb1421fc]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this RCT was to determine whether elective resection following successful non-operative management of a first episode of acute sigmoid diverticulitis complicated by extraluminal air with or without abscess is superior to observation in terms of recurrence rates.

Methods

This was a single-centre, sequential design RCT. Patients were randomized to elective surgery or observation following non-operative management and colonoscopy. Non-operative management included nil by mouth, intravenous fluids, intravenous antibiotics, CT with intravenous contrast on arrival at hospital, and repeat CT with intravenous and rectal contrast on day 3 in hospital. The primary endpoint was recurrent diverticulitis at 24months. Patients with a history of sigmoid diverticulitis, immunosuppression or peritonitis were not included.

Results

Of 137 screened patients, 107 were assigned randomly to elective surgery (26) or observation (81), and underwent the allocated intervention after successful non-operative management. Conservative management failed in 15 patients. Groups were similar in age, sex, BMI, co-morbidities and colorectal POSSUM. Rates of recurrent diverticulitis differed significantly in the elective surgery and observation groups (8 versus 32 per cent; P = 0.019) at a mean(s.d.) follow-up of 37.8(8.6) and 35.2(9.2)months respectively. There was also a significant difference in time to recurrence (median 11 versus 7months; P = 0.015). A total of 28 patients presented with recurrent diverticulitis complicated by extraluminal air and/or abscess (2 elective surgery, 26 observation), all of whom recovered with repeat non-operative management.

Conclusion

The majority of patients observed following conservative management of diverticulitis with local extraluminal air do not require elective surgery. Registration number: NCT01986686 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^95ef38c6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — outpatient care: ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). In the absence of evidence suggesting a benefit of routine hospitalization, the initial (default) management can be as an outpatient and applies to most immunocompetent patients who have no evidence of systemic inflammatory response and can continue treatment at home under medical supervision with adequate family and social support and follow-up. Low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in risk for elective surgery or long-term diverticulitis recurrence for outpatient compared with inpatient management, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with suspected complicated diverticulitis, recent antibiotic use, concomitant unstable comorbid conditions, immunosuppression, or signs of sepsis.

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^0526931f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition that is frequently encountered by primary care and emergency department practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It is often diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, the presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^a7c2e87a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

This position paper updates the literature related to the management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with the goals of identifying a) key management decisions, b) alternative management options and c) gaps in our knowledge base that can be targeted in a future emergency surgery research agenda. From this we have created a decision making algorithm that can be modified based on evolving evidence and local resources to guide institutional practices. This manuscript will provide the basis for a future evidence based guideline (EBG) that will be developed and endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery and published in the World Journal of Emergency Surgery. We envision that the EBG recommendations will be graded based on the level of evidence and will identify the resources needed to provide optimal care. Recognizing the tremendous variability in hospital resources available worldwide, this optimal resource information will be used to designate levels of acute care surgery hospitals (similar to trauma centers). This designation process will be used to leverage hospitals to upgrade their resources to optimize their emergency surgery capabilities.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^143efc60]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Surgical Infection Society — source control timing and selective nonoperative management in intra-abdominal infection (IAI) emphasizes that expeditious source control is the standard, but certain highly selected patients with localized IAI have been treated successfully with antibiotic therapy alone, including those with acute colonic diverticulitis limited to peri-colonic tissues, perforated appendicitis with a peri-appendiceal phlegmon, selected localized upper gastrointestinal perforations, and relatively small diverticular or peri-appendiceal abscesses (generally less than 3–4 cm in diameter). For timing, most patients with peritonitis should undergo a source control procedure within 24 hours of diagnosis, and studies suggested that delays of only 3–6 hours were associated with increased death; multivariable analyses indicate time from diagnosis to source control predicts death. Accordingly, most patients with IAI should undergo source control within 24 hours, and patients with sepsis or septic shock should undergo earlier source control, although a short delay to allow for rapid resuscitation may be needed in hemodynamically unstable sepsis.

The last problem are the localized peritonitis, that not properly treated can evolve into an abdominal abscess, that are associated with an acute mortality of 5–10%. Treatment of these abscess depends on size, localization and patient's general condition. Though solid supporting evidence is lacking, most abscess ≤ 3 cm in diameter are treated safely with antibiotics. For larger abscesses there is much evidence supporting the advantages of percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotics. There is no evidence supporting a specific drainage or the aspiration technique. If an abscess cannot be drained percutaneously, an urgent surgical procedure is advised. Resection with primary anastomosis is the intervention of choice: there is increasing evidence that a drainage through a laparoscopic approach can be successful avoiding a further resection or deferiing it to an elective setting. After a successful percutaneous drainage of an abscess there is no agreement or evidence supporting a conservative or surgical policy.

Despite limitations due to the lack of strong evidence for the reasons discussed above, we summarize and propose a treatment for various clinical scenarios below:
Patient in a good general condition with Hinchey I or II – Initially stabilize with medical treatment with or without percutaneous drainage; followed by elective PRA without protective stoma if required and/or suitable.
Above scenario, but non-responder to initial management: two-stage procedure (emergency HP with or without a mucous fistula, followed by elective reversal if suitable) or PRA with or without a de functioning stoma.
Selected cases Hinchey II-III – LPL.
Hinchey III not suitable for LPL – PRA or HP.
Hinchey IV – HP.

On this issue the results of two ongoing studies are waited: one RCT study, LapLand and one multicenter retrospective study on patients submitted to laparoscopic lavage, the LLOStudy.

After preliminary promising results, future ongoing experiences might confirm the feasibility and demonstrate the safety of laparoscopy and primary anastomosis even in cases of selected, hemodynamically stable, patients with Hinchey IV perforated diverticulitis and feacal peritonitis, if performed by experienced colorectal surgeons.

Discussion

Over the years, treatment strategies for acute diverticulitis with abscess formation have gradually shifted from acute surgery to non-operative management comprised of antibiotic therapy with or without percutaneous drainage. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Fowler et al. found that the failure rates following non-operative management of diverticular abscess did not significantly decrease over the past three decades. Within this context, identifying risk factors for failure can indicate which patients' careful supervision is necessary to avoid further complications through a septic progression of the disease.

This multicentre observational study conducted in twelve high-volume Italian surgical units for emergency surgery indicates that non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone or with the placement of a CT- or Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage is an effective strategy in avoiding emergency surgery for patients with diverticular abscess. The results of our study showed success rates of 72.96% in the general population of patients with diverticular abscess, in line with the results of previous studies.

Previous studies suggest that patients presenting for the first time typically exhibit more severe disease manifestations than those with recurrent episodes. Additionally, the literature indicates that complications such as perforation or complicated diverticulitis occur more frequently in patients during their initial episode compared to subsequent occurrences. Given this evidence, we believe that our study's focus on the initial episode of acute diverticulitis with abscess formation allows for a more precise assessment of the condition's severity and the effectiveness of the treatment approaches under investigation.

Despite lacking high-quality evidence, international guidelines recommend percutaneous drainage according to abscess size. A diverticular abscess diameter of 5 cm is generally accepted as a cut-off determining whether percutaneous drainage is suggested in addition to antibiotics. Our findings reflect a percutaneous drainage rate appearing low (11.88%) compared with the range reported in the literature, which varies from 24 to 48% for CT scan Hinchey II abscesses. This variability can largely be attributed to the nature of the evidence guiding these recommendations, which stems from small-scale, non-randomised studies. The lack of large, definitive randomised controlled trials in this area has led to considerable heterogeneity in clinical practice, as reflected in our study population.

### Elective resection versus observation after nonoperative management of complicated diverticulitis with abscess: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a9d47180]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Initial management of diverticulitis with abscess formation has progressed from a surgical emergency to nonoperative management with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage followed by delayed resection. Controversy has arisen regarding the necessity of elective surgery, when nonoperative management has successfully resolved the index attack.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the literature to determine the recurrence rate in those patients who were successfully managed nonoperatively and determine the role of elective surgical resection.

Data Sources

An electronic literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews performed from 1986 to 2014. The search terms used were as follows: "diverticulitis", "abscess", "diverticular abscess", "percutaneous drainage", and "surgery".

Study Selection

Studies included for review evaluated the management of diverticular abscesses and the subsequent role of delayed elective resection.

Interventions

All of the studies were systematically reviewed and underwent a meta-analysis.

Main Outcome Measures

End points were the need for surgery and recurrent attacks without surgery.

Results

Twenty-two studies reporting a total of 1051 patients with acute diverticulitis with abscess formation (modified Hinchey grades IB and II) were included in the review. Percutaneous drainage was successful in 49% patients (diameter, > 3 cm) and antibiotic therapy in 14% patients. Urgent surgery during the index hospitalization was performed in 30% of patients, elective resection in 36%, and no surgery in 35%. Recurrence rates were high, with 39% in patients awaiting elective resection and 18% in the nonsurgery group, with an overall recurrence rate of 28%. Of the whole cohort, only 28% had no surgery and no recurrence during follow-up.

Limitations

Sample size, heterogeneity, selection and treatment bias, and limited follow-up of included studies were limitations to this study.

Conclusions

The evidence from the literature is weak but still suggests that complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation is associated with a high probability of resective surgery, whereas conservative management may result in chronic or recurrent diverticular symptoms.

### Acute colonic diverticulitis [^d05ff84c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a gastrointestinal condition frequently encountered by primary care practitioners, hospitalists, surgeons, and gastroenterologists. Clinical presentation ranges from mild abdominal pain to peritonitis with sepsis. It can often be diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone, but imaging is necessary in more severe presentations to rule out such complications as abscess and perforation. Treatment depends on the severity of the presentation, presence of complications, and underlying comorbid conditions. Medical and surgical treatment algorithms are evolving. This article provides an evidence-based, clinically relevant overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of acute diverticulitis.

### Towards a tailored approach for patients with acute diverticulitis and abscess formation. the divAbsc2023 multicentre case-control study [^fb2f50b8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease is a common clinical entity whose prevalence has risen steadily in Western countries over the past few decades. It might lead to acute diverticulitis in approximately 4–7% of patients, among which 15–20% are complicated by an intra-abdominal abscess. Complicated acute diverticulitis with abscess can be classified according to the original or the modified Hinchey classifications as type Ib (confined pericolic abscess smaller than 5 cm) or Hinchey II (pelvic, distant intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal abscess at least 5 cm in size). According to the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) classification system, the Ib stage indicates the presence of an abscess ≤ 4 cm, while the IIa stage indicates an abscess > 4 cm. Although there has been a wealth of research in the form of both observational and randomized studies focussing upon the treatment of Hinchey I, III, or IV disease stages, little focus has been placed upon the cohort of patients presenting with acute diverticulitis complicated by pericolic or pelvic abscesses. Abscess size of 4–6 cm is generally accepted as a reasonable cut-off determining the choice of treatment between antibiotic therapy and antibiotic therapy plus percutaneous drainage. Unfortunately, the available data to suggest this approach consists of a short list of studies with a limited number of patients, often associated with a short follow-up period, which is insufficient to assess the value of percutaneous drainage as the mainstay of treatment.

### The WSES / SICG / ACOI / SICUT / AcEMC / SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^65aad218]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Omitting antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated ALCD did not result in more complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis or sigmoid resections at long-term follow-up. As the DIABOLO trial was not powered for these secondary outcome measures, some uncertainty remains whether (small) non-significant differences could be true associations.

A systematic review and meta-analysis including 2469 patients (including elderly patients) with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis showed that treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis without antibiotics might be feasible with outcomes that are comparable to antibiotic treatment and with potential benefits for patients and the overall health economic system.

Furthermore, antibiotic use in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis seems to increase the length of hospital stay.

Finally, current evidence does not support the administration of antibiotics to improve outcomes in carefully selected healthy patients with uncomplicated ALCD. However, this evidence comes from young patients (mean age in AVOD trial: 57; age range in DIABOLO trial: 48–64). For this reason, for elderly patients, the recommendation has very low-quality evidence. Further studies should help identify specific subpopulations of patients who would derive benefit from antibiotic therapy and help define appropriate antibiotic regimens and treatment durations that minimize cost, adverse effects, and risk of anti-microbial resistance. Due to the low event rate, it remains uncertain whether antibiotic treatment is necessary in cases with isolated pericolic gas, whether in young or elderly patients.

What factors should be considered in planning elective resection in cases of acute diverticulitis treated non-operatively?

We suggest evaluating patient-related factors and not number of previous episodes of diverticulitis in planning elective sigmoid resection (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

After an episode of ALCD treated conservatively, we suggest planning of an elective sigmoid resection in high-risk patients, such as immunocompromised patients (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

Recurrence of acute diverticulitis is lower than previously thought. Historically, it has been reported that about one third of all patients with acute diverticulitis will have a recurrent attack, often within 1 year. However, the recurrence after an uncomplicated episode of diverticulitis appears much lower: with a recent prospective study reported a recurrence of only 1.7% over 5 years of follow-up. After a follow-up of 4 years, El Sayed et al. in an English study of over 65,000 patients managed non-operatively for their first episode of diverticulitis, found the recurrence rate to be around 11.2%. Emergency and elective colectomy rates were 0.9 and 0.75%, respectively. Female gender, young age, smoking, obesity, and complicated initial disease were risk factors for readmission and emergency surgery. The study also pointed out that some factors associated with recurrence are modifiable; weight reduction and smoking cessation can be championed.

Stage 1 B

Although the clinical presentation of acute left diverticulitis with associated abscess formation has increased in recent years, the therapeutic strategies for these patients are still debated. Deciding which patients with diverticular abscesses require percutaneous drainage rather than medical management therefore remains controversial. Diverticular abscesses may be initially treated by intravenous antibiotics alone and/or percutaneous drainage, depending on the size of the abscess rather than the location (pelvic versus pericolic). The size of 4 cm (local severe diverticulitis) may be a reasonable limit between antimicrobial versus percutaneous drainage in management of diverticular abscesses. It is generally observed that abscesses with a size of up to 4 cm seem to respond better to intravenous antibiotics alone. After initial antimicrobial therapy, no improvement of clinical conditions or rapid deterioration of clinical conditions suggest percutaneous drainage.

Diverticular abscesses having a diameter of less than 4 cm may be treated by antibiotics alone. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest are initially demanded. If antimicrobial treatment fails percutaneous drainage is suggested. CT scan should be repeated to demonstrate the resolution of the abscess. In patients who have persistent or recurrent clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection after 4–6 days of therapy, CT imaging should be undertaken.

Perforation with localised abscess collection is an uncommon presentation of colonic malignancy, and it may mimic complicated diverticular disease. After the inflammation from a new onset of diverticulitis has resolved, traditionally patients have undergone colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer. However, the need for routine colonoscopy has recently been questioned.

A recent study by Sallinen et al. provides additional insight into this debate. The study enrolled 633 patients with CT-diagnosed acute diverticulitis. Of these patients, 97 underwent emergency resection, whereas 536 were treated conservatively, 394 of whom underwent colonoscopy. The findings showed 17 cancers (2.7%) in patients with an initial diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. As shown by CT, 16 cancer patients (94%) had abscess, whereas one patient had pericolic extraluminal air but no abscess. Of the patients with abscess, 11.4% had cancer mimicking acute diverticulitis. No cancer was found in the patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis.

In patients with diverticular abscess treated conservatively, especially in those who do not respond to conservative management early colonoscopy (4–6 weeks) should be always planned.

Uncomplicated diverticulitis after recovery — decision to recommend elective sigmoid colectomy should be individualized (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). Nonoperative series report recurrence rates ranging from 13% to 33% with low rates of subsequent complicated disease or emergency operation, and after an initial episode the estimated risk of emergency surgery with stoma is 1 in 2000 patient-years; based on these data, 18 patients would need elective colectomy to prevent 1 emergency surgery, so recommending colectomy to prevent a future recurrence requiring stoma formation should be discouraged. Population data showed that among 84,313 hospitalized patients the elective colectomy rate more than doubled without a significant decrease in emergency surgery, and 80% to 90% of emergency resections occur during index attacks, supporting the practice of continued medical therapy rather than elective colectomy for patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Patients admitted for a recurrence are at increasing risk of further attacks; among 181,115 patients, 8.7% had a second admission, and of those admitted twice, 23% required a third admission and 36% ultimately had 4 or more hospitalizations. Consideration of elective colectomy after repeated bouts should assess operative risks, prior flare frequency/severity, residual symptoms, operative morbidity, risk of persistent or recurrent symptoms after resection, and patient preferences.

### Nonoperative management of right colonic diverticulitis using radiologic evaluation [^5998bc6f]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although a few reviews have been conducted, nonoperative management may be the mainstay of therapy for uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis. With increasing use of radiological evaluation for diverticulitis, the status of the disease is becoming more accessible. In this study, clinical outcomes of nonoperative management for right colonic diverticulitis were assessed according to disease status using radiological evaluation.

Method

From April 2000 to March 2007, 296 patients were admitted for acute right colonic diverticulitis upon first attack and were treated with nonoperative management. The status of diverticulitis was classified using ultrasonography and/or computed tomography as inflamed diverticulum or phlegmon in 276 patients or pericolic abscess in 20 patients. Uncomplicated diverticulitis was defined as inflamed diverticulum or phlegmon. Length of hospital stay, antibiotic use, failure of initial therapy and the incidence of recurrence after nonoperative management were assessed.

Results

The mean length of hospital stay and antibiotic use were 6 and 4.7 days respectively. All patients were successfully treated with the initial medical therapy and their hospital stays were uneventful. Of the 276 patients with an uncomplicated diverticulitis, two patients (1%) had a recurrence during follow-up that could be managed nonoperatively. Of the 20 patients with pericolic abscesses, four patients (20%) had a recurrence. One patient underwent laparoscopic ileocolic resection and the other patients were treated nonoperatively.

Conclusion

Nonoperative management may be the treatment of choice for right colonic diverticulitis with inflamed diverticulum or phlegmon. Diverticulitis with pericolic abscess should be treated with additional care.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^af5dd991]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

ACP clinical guideline — site of care for acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis states that ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). In the absence of evidence suggesting a benefit in routine hospitalization for patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, the initial (default) management of uncomplicated diverticulitis can be as an outpatient, and patients should have adequate family or social support and follow-up. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in risk for elective surgery or long-term diverticulitis recurrence after outpatient compared with inpatient management, and the available evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) for most critical and important outcomes (including emergency surgery, mortality, quality of life, and treatment failure), but few patients had these outcomes after management in outpatient or inpatient settings. The CGC also judged that outpatient management would likely have lower associated costs than inpatient management, with indirect evidence from outside the United States suggesting a cost savings of 35% to 83% per episode of acute diverticulitis. This recommendation does not apply to patients with suspected complicated diverticulitis, recent antibiotic use, concomitant unstable comorbid conditions, immunosuppression, or signs of sepsis.

### A proposal for a CT driven classification of left colon acute diverticulitis [^53ef0487]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Stage 1 A

Stage 1 A diverticulitis is a confined inflammatory process that may include a microperforation but excludes an abscess, and/or peritonitis. CT findings include pericolic air in the form of air bubbles or little pericolic fluid without abscess. Pericolic air is defined as air bubbles or air collection within 5 cm of the inflamed bowel segment without distant air (Figure 3). Patients have left iliac fossa pain, initial localized tenderness and there are usually signs of sepsis. Small locules of pericolic air is a feature of a (micro) perforation of a diverticulum. Stage 1 A diverticulitis may progress to more complicated clinical forms if it is not treated promptly. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are therefore indicated in stage 1 A patients. Antibiotics should be always given to the patients with pericolic air or small fluid collection. Various antimicrobial regimens may be used in the treatment of acute diverticulitis in order to ensure complete coverage against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and aerobic–anaerobic bacterial strains. Antimicrobial regimens with beta-lactamase inhibiting antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole are appropriate for community acquired acute diverticulitis, although high rates of resistance to quinolones have reported in many countries. In critically ill patients or in immunocompromised patients broader-spectrum regimens should be used. An appropriate antimicrobial therapy given for an appropriate duration has minimal impact on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

Figure 3
Diverticular disease, colonic wall thickening, fat stranding and pericolic fluid and air bubbles.

Patients with CT findings of pericolic air and signs of sepsis and initial tenderness should require bowel rest, intravenous fluid hydration and empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy. In these patients to optimize antimicrobial therapy and minimize hospital stay, antimicrobial therapy may be started initially intravenously and switched to oral therapy as soon as clinical conditions improve.

Patients with pericolic air or small fluid collection should be managed by antimicrobial therapy. Patients with signs of sepsis and initial tenderness should demand bowel rest, intravenous fluid hydration and empirical intravenous antimicrobial therapy. In these patients intravenous antimicrobial therapy may be switched to oral therapy as soon as clinical conditions improve.

Clinical findings should be sufficient to monitor resolution of the acute episode. In patients who have persistent or recurrent clinical evidence of intra-abdominal infection after 4–6 days of therapy, new CT imaging should be undertaken.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaLeft lower quadrant pain-suspected diverticulitis [^b0d870f4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding imaging of suspected diverticulitis as an etiology for left lower quadrant pain, and imaging of complications of acute diverticulitis. The most common cause of left lower quadrant pain in adults is acute sigmoid or descending colonic diverticulitis. Appropriate imaging triage for patients with suspected diverticulitis should address the differential diagnostic possibilities and what information is necessary to make a definitive management decision. Patients with diverticulitis may require surgery or interventional radiology procedures because of associated complications, including abscesses, fistulas, obstruction, or perforation. As a result, there has been a trend toward greater use of imaging to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis, evaluate the extent of disease, and detect complications before deciding on appropriate treatment. Additionally, in the era of bundled payments and minimizing health care costs, patients with acute diverticulitis are being managed on an outpatient basis and rapid diagnostic imaging at the time of initial symptoms helps to streamline and triage patients to the appropriate treatment pathway. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

On the basis of clinical conditions, patients with diverticular smaller abscesses may be treated by antibiotics alone (Recommendation 1C).

Patients with abscesses having a large diameter should be treated by percutaneous drainage and intravenous antibiotics (Recommendation 1C).

Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by antibiotic therapy alone. However careful clinical monitoring is mandatory (Recommendation 1C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with ALCD have an abscess, and the treatment should be either antibiotics with or without percutaneous and/or surgical drainage. The use of antibiotics and percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses facilitates single-stage operation to perform subsequently an elective sigmoidectomy. The size of 3–6 cm has been generally accepted, despite the low level of evidence, to be a reasonable limit between antimicrobial versus percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses.

A retrospective study assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics as sole initial therapy in patients with large diverticular abscess was published in 2015 by Elagili et al. Thirty-two patients were managed by antibiotics alone while 114 underwent percutaneous drainage.

Failure of initial treatment required urgent surgery in eight patients with persistent symptoms during treatment with antibiotics alone (25%) and in 21 patients (18%) after initial percutaneous drainage (p = 0.21). Patients treated with antibiotics had a significantly smaller abscess diameter (5.9 versus 7.1 cm, p = 0.001). Postoperative complications in patients treated with antibiotics alone were significantly less severe than after percutaneous drainage based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (p = 0.04).

Hartmann's procedure remains useful in the management of diffuse peritonitis in critically ill patients. However, in clinically stable patients, primary resection with anastomosis, with or without a diverting stoma, may be performed (Recommendation 1B).

### The WSES / SICG / ACOI / SICUT / AcEMC / SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^b7d66775]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Statement 5.1 In elderly stable patients with an abscess from acute left colonic diverticulitis (WSES stage 1b-2a) and without peritonitis, we suggest the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. [Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidences]
Statement 5.2 We suggest adding percutaneous drainage to antibiotic therapy in elderly patients with acute left colonic diverticulitis and an abscess larger than 4 cm (WSES stage 2a), when skills and facilities are available. Cultures from percutaneous drainage should be carried out to guide the antibiotic therapy. [Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidences]

ALCD is associated with an abscess in nearly 20% of cases. Current evidence is of poor quality with no randomized studies, and there are no studies focused on the elderly.

The rationale for percutaneous drainage is to remove the source of sepsis where antibiotics could fail to reach adequate concentrations, with a consequent failure of the non-operative treatment. As with all the non-operative management strategies, it is indicated only in patients who remain stable without septic shock, where prompt and adequate source control is mandatory.

The treatment with percutaneous drainage has been considered the preferred treatment option since its dissemination and generally, a size of 4 cm has been considered as the cut-off for the indication to drain.

In a systematic review of observational and retrospective studies, the treatment of abscess with a median size of 4 cm (range: 1.5–5–0 cm) with antibiotic therapy alone failed in 18.7% of cases with a low mortality rate; percutaneous drainage of abscesses with a median size of 6.1 cm (range 4.6–8.7 cm) failed in 21.1%. Surgery is associated with a higher mortality rate in the elderly, and it is not the preferred first-line option in stable patients. Rather, it is reserved for failure of non-operative management.
