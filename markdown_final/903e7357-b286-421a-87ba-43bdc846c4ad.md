## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis and treatment plan for a young woman presenting with chest pain, sinus tachycardia, a recent viral illness, and a history of mitral valve prolapse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and hemodynamic stability. Then, I should build and prioritize the differential diagnosis, including myopericarditis, pericarditis, acute myocarditis, and MVP-related complications. Next, I will outline time-sensitive diagnostic testing and risk stratification. After that, I need to consider management pathways tailored to likely diagnoses, including anti-inflammatory therapy and MVP risk mitigation. Finally, I will integrate safety issues like NSAID allergy, address potential medication pitfalls, and close with disposition, follow-up, and counseling, ensuring each step is supported by current guidelines and key evidence.

> Let me first confirm immediate triage and stability. With blood pressure 96/60 mmHg, heart rate 125 bpm, and respiratory rate 25/min, I should consider her borderline hemodynamically stable but clearly tachythermic and symptomatic, which warrants urgent evaluation and at least continuous telemetry, intravenous access, and repeat vitals. Given her pleuritic chest pain that improves with leaning forward and a recent viral prodrome, myopericarditis rises on the list and needs prompt exclusion of tamponade and arrhythmic risk, so a STAT bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is appropriate as first-line imaging in the ED to assess pericardial effusion, ventricular function, and MVP status, per contemporary pericarditis and acute chest pain guidance [^115ZHtXH] [^116uZDZ5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the working differential. The leading considerations are acute pericarditis/myopericarditis given the viral prodrome, pleuritic pain with positional variation, and sinus tachycardia; I also need to consider isolated acute myocarditis if myocardial injury is present without frank pericardial inflammation; and I should not overlook MVP-related complications, including mitral regurgitation exacerbation, arrhythmogenic MVP with ventricular ectopy, or even post-viral autonomic effects that can worsen MVP symptomatology, particularly with exertional chest pain and palpitations in young women, as contemporary MVP arrhythmia literature highlights a nontrivial risk profile in selected patients [^111bL4bb] [^115uuh37].

> I need to check which historical features push me toward pericarditis/myopericarditis rather than ischemia. Pleuritic chest pain worsened by supine position and improved by sitting forward, an antecedent viral illness, diffuse ST-segment elevation or PR-segment depression on ECG, a pericardial friction rub, and elevated inflammatory markers are classic anchors; she lacks risk factors for obstructive coronary disease, making myocarditis/pericarditis more likely than ACS, and I should be prepared to proceed with coronary CT angiography or invasive angiography if troponin is significantly elevated and ECG suggests ischemia to exclude a coronary cause, consistent with myocarditis pathways and acute chest pain protocols [^115ZHtXH] [^111FXW88].

> Wait, let me verify the MVP contribution and potential red flags. A soft systolic murmur with prior MVP could reflect regurgitation, but exertional chest pain, palpitations, and documented sinus tachycardia in a young woman with MVP should prompt me to consider arrhythmogenic MVP features and even post-viral autonomic modulation. Bileaflet prolapse, mitral annular disjunction, and inferolateral T-wave inversions portend higher arrhythmic risk, so I should screen ECG carefully for repolarization abnormalities and consider ambulatory rhythm monitoring if ectopy is suspected, recognizing that many such patients are women in their 40s and 50s with nonsustained VT or syncope histories [^111bL4bb] [^115uuh37].

> Next, I should review immediate diagnostic testing with attention to timing. STAT bedside TTE to evaluate pericardial effusion size, tamponade physiology, ventricular function, and MVP anatomy is first-line. If TTE is limited, I should escalate to CT or CMR for pericardial characterization and myocardial edema/fibrosis assessment. Labs should include high-sensitivity troponin, CRP or ESR, CBC, renal function, and D-dimer if PE is on the table. I should avoid routine viral serologies except HIV, hepatitis C, and Lyme disease unless epidemiologically indicated. And I will obtain serial ECGs to look for evolving pericarditic changes or ischemia, aligning with pericarditis and myocarditis guidance [^115ZHtXH] [^116M7xFQ] [^116uZDZ5].

> I will now examine risk stratification to decide on disposition. High-risk features mandating admission include hypotension, tachycardia with hemodynamic compromise, large pericardial effusion, tamponade physiology, elevated troponin with ventricular dysfunction, refractory pain, or immunocompromised status; given her borderline BP and tachycardia, I should have a low threshold for telemetry and observation even if she initially appears stable, consistent with ESC and ACC pericarditis guidance on high-risk presentations [^113JDYw2] [^113kqH3S].

> Let me consider the pericarditis/myopericarditis management pathway if that diagnosis crystallizes. First-line therapy is high-dose aspirin or an NSAID with gastric protection plus colchicine for 3 months in a first episode. Given her NSAID allergy, aspirin 750–1000 mg three times daily with a PPI is reasonable, with colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily. I should confirm no significant renal or hepatic impairment and adjust colchicine if interacting medications are present. Strict exercise restriction with heart rate less than 100 bpm for at least 30 days is advised. If she cannot tolerate aspirin, I should consider an anti–IL-1 agent such as anakinra or rilonacept in an inflammatory phenotype, reserving corticosteroids for refractory or noninflammatory cases due to recurrence risk, per ACC and ESC statements [^116pMNfn] [^116aTHXj] [^113JDYw2] [^114PL9fn] [^113uFs4L].

> But wait, what if myocarditis predominates without overt pericarditis. Supportive care remains foundational, and I should consider beta-blockers for symptom control and arrhythmia prevention, especially with elevated troponin, continuing for at least 6 months; if sustained or symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias occur, I should involve electrophysiology and consider catheter ablation in specialized centers; temporary pacing may be needed for high-grade conduction disease as a bridge to recovery, consistent with ESC myocarditis guidance [^113do15t] [^113KpVSZ] [^115HA7rA].

> I should double-check MVP-specific management and arrhythmia mitigation. If MVP-related chest pain and palpitations persist, beta-blockers can reduce catecholamine surge and mitigate symptoms. I need to ensure we avoid CNS stimulants such as modafinil or armodafinil in patients with MVP who have experienced MVP syndrome features, given FDA warnings linking these agents to chest pain, ischemic ECG changes, and even asystole in susceptible patients. Ambulatory ECG monitoring can help quantify ectopy and guide therapy or EP referral if malignant features emerge [^111W5ovk] [^111dKtbw] [^111bL4bb].

> Hold on, I should verify medication safety and allergy considerations. Her NSAID allergy complicates standard ibuprofen-based regimens, reinforcing aspirin with PPI as the preferred anti-inflammatory strategy; I need to check for drug–drug interactions with colchicine, especially CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors, and reduce colchicine dose if needed; I should also avoid nitrates reflexively for chest pain because they can precipitate hypotension in pericarditis and are contraindicated in HOCM, which I must keep in mind if dynamic outflow obstruction is suspected [^116aTHXj] [^112ksvco].

> Next, I should review disposition and follow-up. If high-risk features are absent, close outpatient follow-up with repeat TTE in 1–2 weeks, symptom tracking, and inflammatory marker normalization is acceptable. If any deterioration occurs — worsening pain, dyspnea, syncope, new arrhythmias, or hypotension — she should return immediately. I will counsel on recurrence risk of pericarditis (15–30% after a first episode) and the importance of completing a full 3-month colchicine course to reduce recurrence, aligning with ACC guidance on duration and recurrence definitions [^115bhvie] [^113JDYw2].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. The most parsimonious diagnosis is viral myopericarditis in the setting of a recent upper respiratory infection, with contributory MVP physiology and possible autonomic modulation. Immediate priorities are to exclude tamponade, assess myocardial involvement, and initiate guideline-directed anti-inflammatory therapy while monitoring for arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise. This approach balances the competing diagnoses and leverages current ACC/ESC pericarditis and myocarditis pathways to guide testing and treatment decisions [^115ZHtXH] [^114MkCVe] [^116bGWGU].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **acute pericarditis** [^112aSEw3] given the pleuritic, positional chest pain, recent viral prodrome, sinus tachycardia, and absence of ischemic ECG changes. The top priorities are to **exclude myocarditis** [^116bGWGU] and **mitral valve complications** [^114UrdnT] with urgent echocardiography [^114UrdnT], troponin, and inflammatory markers [^116uZDZ5]. Start **colchicine and high-dose aspirin** [^115UKyoS] with PPI if NSAIDs are contraindicated; avoid NSAIDs due to allergy. Admit for monitoring if high-risk features are present [^114MkCVe] (large effusion, tamponade, elevated troponin, or refractory symptoms). If myocarditis is confirmed, manage supportively with beta-blockers [^113do15t] and consider immunosuppression in select cases [^116u8EL3].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Rationale** | **Supporting features** | **Refuting features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute pericarditis | - Pleuritic chest pain <br/> - Positional relief <br/> - Recent viral illness <br/> - Sinus tachycardia | - Pleuritic chest pain <br/> - Positional relief <br/> - Recent viral illness <br/> - Sinus tachycardia | - None significant |
| Myocarditis | - Recent viral illness <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Sinus tachycardia | - Recent viral illness <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Sinus tachycardia | - No ECG changes of ischemia or conduction abnormalities |
| Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) complications | - Known MVP <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Murmur | - Known MVP <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Murmur | - No new murmur or significant regurgitation on exam |
| Pulmonary embolism (PE) | - Chest pain <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypotension | - Chest pain <br/> - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypotension | - No risk factors or symptoms of DVT |
| Pneumonia/respiratory infection | - Recent viral illness <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Wheezing | - Recent viral illness <br/> - Chest pain <br/> - Wheezing | - No fever or focal lung findings |

---

Given the clinical presentation, **acute pericarditis** is the most likely diagnosis [^112aSEw3], with myocarditis and MVP complications as important differentials [^116bGWGU] [^111bL4bb].

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Immediate tests

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Look for diffuse ST-segment elevation, PR-segment depression, or other ischemic changes [^112TB9eB].
- **Cardiac biomarkers**: Troponin I/T, CRP, ESR to assess myocardial injury and inflammation [^116uZDZ5].
- **Chest X-ray**: Evaluate for cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, or pulmonary infiltrates.
- **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)**: Assess pericardial effusion, myocardial function, and mitral valve status [^114UrdnT].

---

### Additional tests (if indicated)

Additional testing may include **cardiac MRI** [^116bGWGU] to evaluate for myocarditis or pericarditis when initial tests are inconclusive, and **CT pulmonary angiography** if pulmonary embolism is suspected. Viral serology is generally not recommended routinely [^116M7xFQ] but may be considered in select cases.

---

## Management plan

### Medical management

- **Colchicine**: 0.6 mg twice daily for 3 months as first-line therapy for acute pericarditis [^116aTHXj].
- **Aspirin**: High-dose aspirin (750–1000 mg three times daily) with PPI gastroprotection, given NSAID allergy [^116pMNfn].
- **Beta-blockers**: Consider for symptom control and arrhythmia prevention if myocarditis is confirmed [^113do15t].
- **Avoid NSAIDs**: Due to documented allergy.

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **serial ECGs** to track resolution of pericarditis changes, as well as echocardiography to monitor for effusion or myocardial dysfunction. Follow-up should occur within 1–2 weeks to assess symptom resolution and medication tolerance.

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated if any of the following high-risk features are present:

- Large pericardial effusion or tamponade physiology [^113JDYw2]
- Elevated troponin indicating myocarditis [^113kqH3S]
- Refractory symptoms despite medical therapy [^113JDYw2]
- Hemodynamic instability or significant arrhythmias [^notfound]

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education should explain the diagnosis, expected course, and the importance of adherence to therapy. Counsel on **activity restriction** — avoiding strenuous activity until symptoms resolve and inflammatory markers normalize [^notfound]. Discuss warning signs that require urgent care, including worsening chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or palpitations.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable** [^113kqH3S]; most cases of acute pericarditis resolve without recurrence. Recurrence rates vary from 15% to 30% after the initial episode and increase with subsequent flares [^115bhvie].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **acute pericarditis** [^notfound]. Immediate priorities are to exclude myocarditis and mitral valve complications with echocardiography, troponin, and inflammatory markers. Start colchicine and high-dose aspirin with PPI if NSAIDs are contraindicated, and admit for monitoring if high-risk features are present [^115UKyoS] [^116pMNfn] [^114MkCVe].

COVID-19 virus-associated pericardial effusion

COVID-19 caused one of the most catastrophic health crises of our era, and there was a wide range of symptoms and signs which could be seen in the presentation of the COVID-19 patients. The manifestation can be a mild fever and respiratory discomfort or much more severe, such as rapid progression toward acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Although many effective strategies have been introduced to combat the severity of the impact of COVID-19 on societies, during the last four years, several surges in the incidence of this disease have happened, and it has been a major health concern. Being well-prepared for new virus strains that might involve the population is crucial. The most vulnerable part of the population for rapid progress of the disease includes those older > 60 years, men, those with extensive lung involvement, patients with cardiac or vascular diseases, patients with a history of pericardial effusion, diabetes, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

### Discrepancies in beta-lactam antibiotics cross-reactivity: implications for clinical practice [^111vEQiT]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Using non‐beta‐lactam antibiotics where beta‐lactam antibiotics would suffice has several disadvantages such as higher costs, infection‐treatment failure, prolonged treatment and higher readmittance rates. Furthermore, many publications suggest more post‐operative infections and there is overwhelming evidence that it leads to antimicrobial resistance. Up to now, however, most clinicians find it safer and easier to deviate to second‐line treatment in case of a beta‐lactam allergy, whereas it would be preferable to use an alternative beta‐lactam antibiotic instead.

Although multiple sources have published tables with information regarding cross‐reactivity and safe alternatives within the group of beta‐lactam antibiotics, the disadvantage of these tables is that they are not readily available and identifying a suitable alternative is time‐consuming, especially if patients are allegedly allergic to more than one beta‐lactam antibiotic. A digital tool to choose an alternative beta‐lactam antibiotic could be of added value by preventing unnecessary use of second‐ or third‐line antibiotics.

The general presumption is that the various tables of cross‐reactivity are interchangeable when it comes to safe alternatives, potential risks and high‐risk alternatives. However, in this article, we show that the three most used tables worldwide as well as the recently published Dutch guideline on management in antibiotic allergy not only have internal discrepancies, but the authors also disagree on both safe alternatives in case of (suspected) beta‐lactam allergy and the cause of cross‐reactivity. These discrepancies might lead to hampered clinical outcomes.

Diagnosis of myocarditis — clinical symptoms: The initial step for a clinician in the assessment of a patient with possible myocarditis is to recognize that a clinical scenario is consistent with this diagnosis, and clinicians should be aware of 3 classic presentations — chest pain, arrhythmia, or heart failure (HF)/cardiogenic shock. The history of an antecedent viral infection in a young person, a prior diagnosis of myocarditis or autoimmune disease, a family history of cardiomyopathy or unexplained sudden death, or exposure to known cardiotoxin followed by related symptoms should raise the suspicion for this condition.

### Armodafinil [^112aLA4a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Cardiovascular Events

In clinical studies of modafinil, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea and transient ischemic T-wave changes on ECG were observed in three subjects in association with mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy. It is recommended that armodafinil tablets not be used in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or in patients with mitral valve prolapse who have experienced the mitral valve prolapse syndrome when previously receiving CNS stimulants. Findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse syndrome include but are not limited to ischemic ECG changes, chest pain, or arrhythmia. If new onset of any of these findings occurs, consider cardiac evaluation.

Blood pressure monitoring in short term (≤ 3 months) pre-approval controlled trials of OSA, SWD, and narcolepsy showed small average increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving armodafinil as compared to placebo (1.2 to 4.3 mmHg in the various experimental groups). There was also a slightly greater proportion of patients on armodafinil requiring new or increased use of antihypertensive medications (2.9%) compared to patients on placebo (1.8%). There was a small, but consistent, average increase in pulse rate over placebo in pre-approval controlled trials. This increase varied from 0.9 to 3.5 BPM. Increased monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on armodafinil. Caution should be exercised when prescribing armodafinil to patients with known cardiovascular disease.

A 23-year-old man presented to the ED with a history of respiratory distress, cough, and fever for 10 days. He was evaluated in the ED, where he received a diagnosis of pulmonary edema, secondary to mitral regurgitation with mitral valve prolapse syndrome. He was treated with antibiotics and diuretics and discharged to home. Three months later, he returned to the ED with similar complaints, for which he was treated symptomatically and discharged. After 4 months, the patient once again appeared with worsening respiratory distress and cough with fever. The dyspnea was not accompanied by orthopnea, pedal edema, or palpitation. The patient was admitted to the medical ICU. He had no history of arthralgia, myalgia, skin rash, or other signs of autoimmune disease. He denied any history of smoking, work-related or occupational exposures, drug intake, or recent travel.

### Nabumetone [^113vGXga]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Renal Effects: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID results in a dose-dependent decrease in prostaglandin synthesis and, secondarily, in a reduction of renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.

Advanced Renal Disease: No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of nabumetone tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with nabumetone tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If nabumetone tablets therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.

### Targeting investigation and treatment in Type 2 myocardial infarction: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^111FXW88]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Complex intervention: investigation

The complex intervention was a structured management plan to guide; 1) risk assessment; 2) targeted investigation; and 3) secondary preventative therapy delivered after consultation with a cardiologist. The intervention was individualized and delivered by a single principal investigator (consultant cardiologist) at each site. The cardiologist estimated if the pretest probability of coronary artery disease or left ventricular impairment was low, intermediate, or high based on symptoms, cardiovascular risk factors, previous medical history, and an evaluation of the presenting illness and initial assessment including a physical examination, routine blood tests, the 12-lead electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray. Where the pretest probability of coronary disease or left ventricular impairment was low, further investigation was not recommended. Where the pretest probability of coronary artery disease was intermediate, coronary computed tomography angiography was recommended and performed according to previously published methods and reported in line with SCCT (Society of Cardiac Computed Tomography) guidelines. Where the pretest probability of obstructive coronary disease was considered high or if the patient had ongoing symptoms of myocardial ischemia, invasive coronary angiography was recommended. Where the patient was known to have coronary artery disease, no further coronary imaging was recommended unless there was a clinical suspicion of worsening disease severity.

Where the pretest probability of left ventricular impairment was intermediate or high, a transthoracic echocardiogram was recommended and conducted in accordance with guidance from the British Society of Echocardiography. Where there was a suspicion of underlying cardiomyopathy or type 1 MI based on echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance and coronary imaging were considered (if not already performed) to identify areas of scar or to clarify the final diagnosis in line with usual recommendations for clinical practice. We aimed to deliver all investigations within 30 days.

Complex intervention: treatment

Treatment was individualized and in line with clinical practice guidelines. In patients found to have coronary artery disease, aspirin or P 2 Y 12 inhibitors and lipid-lowering therapy with statins were recommended. P 2 Y 12 inhibitors were recommended in those with aspirin intolerance or previous stroke. In patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography, revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention was recommended if there was evidence of recent plaque rupture or where high-risk features were present. Revascularization was also considered in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease who reported limiting anginal symptoms despite medical therapy. In patients with evidence of left ventricular impairment, additional therapies including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or angiotensin receptor blocker or aldosterone/neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were recommended in line with guideline recommendations.

Evaluation and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) — evaluation starts with a thorough history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests with particular attention to sedimentation rate, CRP, and troponin if myocarditis is suspected; TTE remains the first-line imaging modality for assessing suspected pericarditis, TTE findings may include pericardial effusion (without or with tamponade), pericardial thickening, features of constrictive physiology, and/or myocardial involvement, TTE can be serially used to monitor for improvement or worsening of these abnormalities, and TTE's main limitation is the inability of tissue characterization to identify and grade pericardial inflammation.

### Management of echocardiography requests for the detection and follow-up of heart valve disease: a consensus statement from the British heart valve society [^114UrdnT]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1.4.1 Recommendation 5

Discuss clinical urgency and level of echocardiography with a clinician.

1.4.1.1 Background to Recommendation 5

The need for clinical collaboration is greater for inpatient than for outpatient requests since the presentation may be acute, not necessarily associated with a murmur and the dangers of progression much higher.

There can be no safe target time‐delays and every case must be considered individually.

No level of echocardiography is universally applicable. A combination of a basic/level 1 study can be used to exclude life‐threatening pathology and a minimum standard study performed at greater leisure if required.

1.4.1.1.1 Examples of Indications Suitable for an Initial Basic/Level 1 Study

Incidental murmur in a patient admitted with a nonvalve problem for example, neck of femur fracture. It is reasonable to perform a basic/level 1 study in patients with a murmur as an emergency if identifying HVD will change management.

After insertion of an electrical device or other invasive intervention a basic/level 1 study is frequently sufficient to exclude a new pericardial effusion.
In an acutely unwell patient, a basic/level 1 study may indicate the need for immediate life‐saving treatment.

1.4.1.1.2 Examples of Indications Suitable for a Focussed Study

Predischarge after cardiac surgery to detect pathology that might require immediate management for example, large pericardial effusion or LV dysfunction or prosthetic valve dysfunction.

1.4.1.1.3 Examples of Indications Requiring a Minimum Standard Study

Patients with known HVD admitted with heart failure.
Murmur after acute myocardial infarction since it may indicate mitral regurgitation or a VSD.
Urgent echocardiography should be done if there is unexplained LV failure or shock since these might complicate critical HVD.

1.4.1.1.4 Examples of Studies Often Not Indicated

Fever with a low clinical likelihood of infective endocarditis (see recommendation 6).
Recent TTE with no evidence of clinical deterioration.

Pericarditis management — first-line pharmacological therapy, exercise restriction, and admission considerations are outlined. "First-line pharmacological treatment includes dual anti-inflammatory therapy with colchicine (3 months following first flare, ≥ 6 months following first recurrence) and NSAIDs or aspirin (starting at high dose and tapering after symptoms resolve and inflammatory markers normalize)". Acid suppression therapies "are often concomitantly prescribed with NSAIDs for gastric protection". Exercise restriction is advised for " ≥ 1 month (maximal heart rate < 100 beats/min with physical activity) until clinical remission". "Hospital admission may be necessary in complicated high-risk cases, such as large pericardial effusion and/or tamponade, severe pain refractory to first-line therapies, and symptomatic constrictive pericarditis".

Pericardiocentesis — indications, sequencing, and approach — states that "Pericardiocentesis is therapeutically performed in cases of impending or established cardiac tamponade, especially in urgent or emergency settings with echocardiography guidance, and diagnostically when there is concern for specific causes, such as bacterial, tuberculous, or malignant etiologies", while "In patients with an inflammatory pericardial effusion and no concern for tamponade, anti-inflammatory therapy should be pursued prior to pericardiocentesis". Approaches are outlined as "Anatomical approaches to pericardiocentesis include subxiphoid, apical, and parasternal. In an emergency, a subxiphoid or apical approach is preferred", with image guidance where "Echocardiography, fluoroscopy, and/or computed tomography may be utilized to guide the pericardiocentesis procedure", and escalation that "Surgical creation of a pericardial window is considered in select patients with recurrent large pericardial effusions and/or cardiac tamponade despite prior pericardiocentesis" and "In certain rare cases, radical pericardiectomy surgery may be indicated for recurrent pericardial effusions, even following the creation of a pericardial window, especially when there is concomitant medically refractory constrictive pericarditis or pericarditis".

### Amantadine hydrochloride (amantadine HCl) [^1165CV1y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

Mechanism of Action: Antiviral The mechanism by which amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. In certain cases, amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine.

Antiviral Activity: Amantadine inhibits the replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the subtypes, i.e. H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. It has very little or no activity against influenza B virus isolates. A quantitative relationship between the in vitro susceptibility of influenza A virus to amantadine and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in man. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of amantadine required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus (ED50) in tissue culture vary greatly (from 0.1 mcg/mL to 25.0 mcg/mL) depending upon the assay protocol used, size of virus inoculum, isolates of influenza A virus strains tested, and the cell type used. Host cells in tissue culture readily tolerated amantadine up to a concentration of 100 mcg/mL.

Drug Resistance: Influenza A variants with reduced in vitro sensitivity to amantadine have been isolated from epidemic strains in areas where adamantane derivatives are being used. Influenza viruses with reduced in vitro sensitivity have been shown to be transmissible and to cause typical influenza illness. The quantitative relationship between the in vitro sensitivity of influenza A variants to amantadine and the clinical response to therapy has not been established.

Mechanism of Action: Parkinson's Disease The mechanism of action of amantadine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions is not known. Data from earlier animal studies suggest that amantadine hydrochloride may have direct and indirect effects on dopamine neurons. More recent studies have demonstrated that amantadine is a weak, non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (K1 = 10µM). Although amantadine has not been shown to possess direct anticholinergic activity in animal studies, clinically, it exhibits anticholinergic-like side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^113WRvda]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — medical treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) provides the following directive: Bracing may be considered for adults for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific type of brace. Grade of Recommendation: C. In a prospective comparative study, the authors concluded that "the 12-week rigid-brace treatment for acute vertebral compression fractures did not result in statistically greater prevention of spinal deformity, better QOL, or lesser back pain than soft-brace treatment at 48 weeks", and therefore "the routine use of a custom-made rigid brace for acute vertebral compression fractures is not justified", with Level II evidence in women showing no significant difference in clinical and radiographic outcomes at 48 weeks between rigid custom-made back support and soft support. In another prospective comparative study, compared to a 3-point orthosis, patients treated with dynamic orthosis had a greater reduction in pain and a greater improvement in quality of life and in respiratory function, with equal effectiveness in stabilizing the fracture, and fewer complications, providing Level II evidence that in patients with acute back pain due to acute OVCF, a dynamic corset produced statistically significant better clinical outcomes than a 3-point brace. In a subacute-stage comparative study of soft lumbar orthosis versus a specific orthosis made of metal with soft padding, the authors concluded that "The effect of the two types of spinal orthoses on the pain level reduction and functional mobility level gain did not show significant difference (p > 0.05) at the subacute stage", and the workgroup downgraded this potential Level II paper due to nonconsecutive and nonmasked patients, nonmasked reviewers, lack of subgroup analysis, and the diagnosis method not being stated, noting Level III evidence that in female patients with acute OVCF there was no difference in clinical outcomes after 3 weeks.

Pathophysiology of pericardial inflammation — injury to the pericardium releases damage‑associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen‑associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), induces NF‑κB, increases transcription of NLRP3 inflammasome components (NLRP3, ASC, pro‑caspase‑1), and ultimately releases interleukin‑1β and interleukin‑18; NF‑κB also stimulates phospholipase‑A2, promotes the arachidonic acid pathway, and leads to prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, contributing to acute inflammation with pain, edema, and effusion; the IL‑1 receptor has a central role, with IL‑1α acting as an alarmin and IL‑1β processed and released by the inflammasome.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^111WXERt]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In other respects our findings run counter to clinical intuition. The frequency of SVT events on monitoring is poorly correlated with induction, probably because the number of sustained episodes is overwhelmed by a high background of short bursts of atrial tachycardia. Patients who report more frequent symptoms are more likely to have SVT induced, so if short bursts were screened out such a correlation might exist. Sudden onset of symptoms does not by itself predict successful induction or ablation of SVT, nor does a history of syncope. The mode of presentation (ER, clinic, or incidental) makes no difference. Failure of an arrhythmia to terminate with adenosine or vagal stimulation carries less information than termination. In such cases the arrhythmia mechanism may not have been of a type that would respond, or the effect of the intervention may have been insufficient to cause termination.

Perhaps most importantly, our findings identify a group of patients in whom induction or ablation of SVT is unlikely and in whom EPS could be avoided. These patients characteristically have shorter recorded episodes of SVT. Patients with shorter bursts of SVT would be more likely to have the initiation or termination captured on a 12 lead EKG, which we find suggests non‐induction. A second characteristic of non‐inducible patients is an irregular tachycardia. Irregularity was associated with short duration episodes; about 2/3 of the irregular tachycardias recorded on an EKG started or stopped while the EKG was being recorded and vice‐versa. Additionally, irregular episodes of tachycardia captured on monitoring tended to be shorter than regular episodes (Figure 4B). Irregularity suggests that the tachycardia mechanism is non‐reentrant FAT, either because of variable AV block or because the tachycardia focus itself fires irregularly (Figure 2 I‐J). Patients with an irregular SVT noted pre‐operatively were more likely to have FAT diagnosed at EPS than the total population (not shown). Nevertheless, ~85% of preoperative recordings from patients diagnosed with FAT showed a regular SVT.

### Infection mimicking appendicitis case report: new differential diagnosis considerations [^113CPutN]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

An 8-year-old female presented to urgent care with sharp, acute-on-chronic right lower-quadrant abdominal pain, which began the morning of presentation and persisted throughout the afternoon. Her mother described her as having difficulty ambulating due to the pain. They were unable to indicate whether the pain had migrated from the periumbilical region. She had abdominal pain that had been ongoing for the past 3 weeks with a waxing and waning presentation and had taken polyethylene glycol in the past for constipation. She denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, fever, diarrhea, hematochezia, or melenic stools. She denied cough, congestion, or rhinorrhea. She did not have any unexplained pruritus. She also had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or urgency.

She had no other chronic conditions for which she took any medication and had no history of abdominal or inguinal hernias or previous surgeries. Her family history was notable for multiple close family members with a history of appendectomy, including her mother.

She and her mother recently arrived in the United States from rural Peru 3 months prior. Her workup upon arrival was negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, syphilis, and active tuberculosis. She had a recent normal lead level. Her mother expressed concern for general parasitosis in their home community in Peru; however, the patient had never had specific symptoms and had not had any testing done.

In clinic, her vital signs were notable for tachycardia and tachypnea. She was afebrile. Her weight was in the 73rd percentile. Her general exam was notable for an uncomfortable appearance, not moving on the exam table. Her abdominal exam demonstrated active bowel sounds. She voluntarily tensed her abdominal muscles throughout the exam. She exhibited acute tenderness to palpation with rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant (McBurney's point) with generalized tenderness in all other quadrants, including the suprapubic region. Pain could be reliably elicited in her right lower quadrant with palpation of her left lower quadrant (Rovsing sign). Supine internal and external flexed hip rotation (obturator sign) and straight leg left against resistance (psoas sign) elicited intense pain in her right lower quadrant. She was unable to participate in a jump test to further assess for peritonitis.

Recurrent pericarditis treatment algorithm — Initial management is NSAID or aspirin plus colchicine, progressing to tapering if stable; if an inflammatory phenotype is present, add anti–IL–1 agent (rilonacept, anakinra, goflikicept) and consider corticosteroid, whereas without the inflammatory phenotype add corticosteroid and consider an anti–IL–1 agent; refractory cases warrant consideration of radical pericardiectomy at high‑volume surgical centers. Footnotes specify anti–IL–1 agent duration (rilonacept ≥ 12 months; anakinra and goflikicept ≥ 12 months, can be years or long‑term) and corticosteroid initiation and tapering (start at moderate dose, slow taper over months), and define NSAID as nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drug and IL‑1 as interleukin‑1.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^117Cofcd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 The 12 Lead EKG

Patients who had SVT documented on a preoperative 12 lead EKG were more likely to have SVT induced at EPS than patients who did not (Figure 3A, Table 1A). Most SVT EKGs (87%) showed a regular tachycardia that persisted the entire duration of the recording, and most patients with this typical EKG pattern (87%) had SVT induced. Among patients with typical SVT EKGs, those exhibiting all types of P wave patterns (no P wave, rSr', short RP, or long RP, Figure 2A–D) were highly likely to have SVT induced (80%–90%).

Table 1
Factors predicting SVT induction, derivation cohort.

Figure 2
Typical and non‐typical SVT EKG patterns. (A–D) Typical SVT EKGs. (E–J) non‐typical SVT EKGs. Sinus rhythm (SR) complexes from the same lead are shown for comparison. Arrowheads indicate P waves.

In contrast, patients whose SVT EKG did not fit this typical pattern had a lower likelihood of SVT induction (Figure 2E–J). This group included patients whose tachycardia was irregular, patients whose tachycardia initiated or terminated during the recording, and patients whose tachycardia showed an EKG pattern consistent with sinus tachycardia, AF, or AFL. About 2/3 of the irregular tachycardias either started or stopped during the 10‐second recording period; conversely, about 2/3 of the tachycardias that started or stopped during recording were irregular. About half the patients whose tachycardia started or stopped during the recording had another EKG taken during the same clinical encounter that showed a continuous recording. Overall, only 34% of patients with a non‐typical EKG pattern were inducible.

For more information about side effects, see the section " What are the possible side effects of TRUVADA? "

Other important information for people who take TRUVADA to help reduce their risk of getting human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, also called pre-exposure prophylaxis or "PrEP":

Before taking TRUVADA to reduce your risk of getting HIV-1 infection:

You must be HIV-1 negative to start TRUVADA. You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV-1 infection.
Do not take TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP unless you are confirmed to be HIV-1 negative.
Some HIV-1 tests can miss HIV-1 infection in a person who has recently become infected. If you have flu-like symptoms, you could have recently become infected with HIV-1. Tell your healthcare provider if you had a flu-like illness within the last month before starting TRUVADA or at any time while taking TRUVADA. Symptoms of new HIV-1 infection include:
tiredness
fever
joint or muscle aches
headache
sore throat
vomiting or diarrhea
rash
night sweats
enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin

While you are taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP:

TRUVADA does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to reduce the risk of getting STIs.
You must stay HIV-negative to keep taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP.
Know your HIV-1 status and the HIV-1 status of your partners.
Ask your partners with HIV-1 if they are taking anti-HIV-1 medicines and have an undetectable viral load. An undetectable viral load is when the amount of virus in the blood is too low to be measured in a lab test. To maintain an undetectable viral load, your partners must keep taking HIV-1 medicines every day. Your risk of getting HIV-1 is lower if your partners with HIV-1 are taking effective treatment.
Get tested for HIV-1 at least every 3 months or when your healthcare provider tells you.
Get tested for other STIs such as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. These infections make it easier for HIV-1 to infect you.
If you think you were exposed to HIV-1, tell your healthcare provider right away. They may want to do more tests to be sure you are still HIV-1 negative.
Get information and support to help reduce sexual risk behaviors.
Do not miss any doses of TRUVADA. Missing doses increases your risk of getting HIV-1 infection.
If you do become HIV-1 positive, you need more medicine than TRUVADA alone to treat HIV-1. TRUVADA by itself is not a complete treatment for HIV-1.
If you have HIV-1 and take only TRUVADA, over time your HIV-1 may become harder to treat.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Primary outcome measure

The primary outcome was diagnosis of postoperative pericarditis. We identified the patient cohort meeting this diagnosis by 3 criteria: 1) no prior documented history of pericarditis (acute or recurrent); 2) meeting at least 2 out of 4 diagnostic criteria for acute pericarditis (chest pain, pericardial friction rub, ECG changes [diffuse nonlocalizing ST-elevations or PR-depressions], and new or worsening pericardial effusion); and 3) clinical presentation warranting treatment with either colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (first line), corticosteroids, or interleukin 1 inhibition. These therapies are in line with prior treatment algorithms for PCIS.ECGs were manually reviewed given possibility of machine error in diagnosis. We additionally collected data points for pericardial effusion size, pleural effusion, development of fever within 48 hours postop, and treatment type.

Continuous variables are expressed as median with 25th-75th percentiles (Q1-Q3) and categorical variables as number (n) with percentage. Assumptions of linearity for continuous variables were determined by visual inspection of scatterplots. Percentages for dichotomous variables are calculated by total number of cases in a given group (typically out of total cases that developed postoperative pericarditis vs total cases that did not develop postoperative pericarditis). Percentages for categorical variables are calculated as percentages of a given subcategory. Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and categorical variables were compared with the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test if expected cell count was < 5. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the impact of demographic and clinical characteristics on ASD repairs (multivariable covariates included age, sex, Asian race, body mass index (BMI), and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time using univariable covariates with P < 0.20). Variables with incidence rate < 5% were excluded from the univariable analysis. Results are presented as OR with 95% CI. A 2-sided P value < 0.05 was determined to be statistically significant. Kaplan-Meier analysis for postoperative time to pericarditis was conducted using the survminer package in R. Censoring time was up to day 30.

Efficacy Results

The results for clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit at Day 7 to 14 after end of treatment are shown in Table 15.

The 30-day all-cause mortality rates in the ITT population were 5/314 (1.6%) for patients treated with ZEVTERA, and 8/324 (2.5%) for patients treated with ceftriaxone ± linezolid group.

As this study was designed prior to the current regulatory guidelines, post-hoc re-analyses were conducted to determine the consistency of study results with these guidelines. These post-hoc analyses considered an earlier timepoint of clinical success at Day 3 in patients in the ITT population, based on survival and the improvement in at least two, and no worsening in any, of the following symptoms: pleuritic chest pain, cough, purulent sputum production or respiratory secretion, tachypnea.

Clinical success at Day 3 was also evaluated in the following analysis populations which were also defined post-hoc:

The Day 3-ITT population included 97% (618 of 638) of ITT patients who had at least two of the following symptoms at baseline: difficulty breathing, cough, production of purulent sputum, or chest pain.

The Day 3-modified ITT population included Day 3-ITT patients with baseline PORT classification of PORT Risk Class ≥ III, at least two of fever, hypothermia, hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea, as well as, at least one of new-onset hypoxemia, rales or pulmonary consolidation, and leukocytosis or leukopenia and new radiographic infiltrates (not related to another disease process) consistent with the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.

The Day 3-micro ITT population was the subset of the Day 3-ITT patients who had a valid pathogen at baseline.

Results of early clinical success at Day 3 in the Day 3-ITT and Day 3- modified ITT populations are shown in Table 16 below:

Clinical response rates at TOC by most common baseline pathogen in the mITT population, defined as all randomized patients with a baseline pathogen, are presented in Table 17.

Pericarditis episode definitions and recurrence rates — "Acute pericarditis refers to the diagnosis with full resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks". "Recurrent pericarditis is diagnosed when there is a relapse of symptoms following a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks after the initial flare, with completion of medical therapy". "Recurrence rates after an initial episode vary from 15% to 30% and further increase to 50% after a first recurrence".

Pericarditis epidemiology and distribution — burden, demographics, and setting-specific causes are as follows: Pericarditis accounts for 0.1% of hospital admissions and 5% of emergency department evaluations for chest pain, and approximately 0.2% of all cardiovascular admissions are attributable to acute pericarditis. Acute pericarditis occurs more commonly in men aged 16 to 65 years and declines by an estimated 51% per 10-year increase in age, whereas recurrent pericarditis is more common in women. Pericarditis is classified based on etiology, clinical course, morphology, and associated impact of fluid characteristics, size, and hemodynamics. Idiopathic and viral etiologies are the most common cause of pericarditis in high-income countries, whereas tuberculosis, often HIV-associated, is the most common cause in low-income countries.

Anti–IL–1 therapy and adjuncts in recurrent pericarditis — For patients with an autoinflammatory process, these agents should be considered the preferred option over corticosteroids; other anti‑inflammatories may be sequentially weaned after anti–IL–1 initiation (prednisone, then NSAID, then colchicine), with colchicine sometimes continued for additive or synergistic benefit, particularly with anakinra. Recurrence while on therapy is very low, but many patients (~50%–75%) recur after discontinuation, and a long‑term extension of RHAPSODY supports prolonged therapy beyond 18 months. Low‑dose corticosteroids are typically utilized when there is no inflammatory phenotype. Azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulins may also be considered after failure of corticosteroids and anti–IL–1 agents. If radical pericardiectomy on cardiopulmonary bypass is pursued as a last‑resort or alternative option at high‑volume experienced centers, anti‑inflammatory medications may be continued until surgery and for 3 to 6 months when indicated for ongoing pericardial inflammation.

### Characteristics and prognosis in acute myocarditis and unexplained acute chest pain: a nationwide longitudinal cohort study [^116u8EL3]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute myocarditis (AM) is an inflammation of the heart muscle due to infectious, toxic or autoimmune processes. The clinical presentation of AM can vary wildly, ranging from mild symptoms, such as chest pain and fever, to severe presentation including fulminant haemodynamic collapse and sudden death. The long-term prognosis also differs significantly depending on the severity of the initial inflammation and the extent of heart muscle damage, with outcomes ranging from complete recovery to the development of advanced heart failure (HF), the need for heart transplantation or death. Treatment is mostly supportive, but in certain cases, immunosuppressive treatments are needed. Men are more susceptible to AM than women, especially at a younger age.

As high-sensitivity troponin assays and cardiac MR (CMR) imaging become integral to clinical practice, the AM population is undergoing notable changes, with milder cases now being detected more frequently. Notably, multiple recent studies indicate that these patients tend to have a favourable prognosis.

AM often mimics acute coronary syndrome (ACS), presenting with sudden chest pain and ECG abnormalitiesmaking the differential diagnosis challenging. This overlap in clinical presentation often requires invasive coronary angiography to rule out obstructive coronary artery disease. Despite its clinical significance, the published data on AM, particularly among patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction, remain sparse and are limited to case reports and case series on young males. Culprit-free coronary angiography is found in 5%–13% of patients with suspected ACS, with many of these patients later diagnosed with AM. Another group of patients presenting with acute chest pain and culprit-free coronary angiography are classified as unexplained acute chest pain (UCP). UCP is characterised by sudden, severe chest discomfort with no obvious cause. The diagnosis is typically made once alternative explanations (such as ACS) are ruled out. Studies show that patients with UCP are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Both AM and UCP have better prognosis than acute myocardial infarction. Accurately differentiating AM from UCP poses a considerable clinical challenge, as both conditions share similar presentations but necessitate distinct diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Additionally, the lack of comparative outcome data emphasises the pressing need for further investigation in this area.

We used data from the national registry SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web System for Enhancement of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) which includes all patients admitted to hospitals with coronary care units (CCU) in Sweden. Our aim was to characterise patients with AM in comparison to those with UCP and investigate the prognosis in each group.

### Characteristics of patients with the arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse syndrome and sudden cardiac arrest and sustained ventricular arrhythmias [^115uuh37]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse syndrome are at increased risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, but studies have been limited by small sample sizes. We sought to assemble an international arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse syndrome registry to delineate the clinical, imaging, and treatment characteristics of patients with arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse syndrome who survived sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or had sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation.

Methods

In this descriptive registry, we characterized patients with arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse syndrome who survived SCA, sustained VT, or ventricular fibrillation. Deidentified data were abstracted locally and combined centrally.

Results

We included 148 patients who had SCA or VT/ventricular fibrillation. Patients had a mean age of 43.7 ± 15.4 years; 68% were women, 73% had bileaflet prolapse, 65% had mitral annular disjunction, 67% had nonsustained VT, and 59% had inferolateral T-wave inversions. Syncope (n = 54, 48%) and anterolateral T-wave inversion (n = 26, 22%) were relatively common. Catheter ablation was performed in 50 (35%) patients for premature ventricular complexes and in 18 (17.7%) patients for VT. Sites of origin for arrhythmias were commonly in the papillary muscles, fascicles, mitral annulus, and inferior/inferolateral left ventricle.

Conclusions

In this international descriptive registry of patients with arrhythmogenic mitral valve prolapse syndrome and SCA, patients were young, women, and had bileaflet mitral valve prolapse, mitral annular disjunction, inferolateral T-wave inversions, and nonsustained VT. A history of syncope and anterolateral T-wave inversions was relatively common in patients who survived SCA or sustained VT/ventricular fibrillation.

### Clozapine (Versacloz) [^112NxbAz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Hepatotoxicity

Severe, life threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis have been reported in patients treated with clozapine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Monitor for the appearance of signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Perform serum tests for liver injury and consider permanently discontinuing treatment if hepatitis or transaminase elevations combined with other systemic symptoms are due to clozapine.

5.13 Fever

During clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak incidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and self-limited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase or decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia or infection[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

5.14 Pulmonary Embolism

Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine. Consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein thrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether pulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some characteristic(s) of patients is not clear.

5.15 Anticholinergic Toxicity

VERSACLOZ has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with VERSACLOZ can result in CNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity, especially at higher dosages or in overdose situations [see Overdosage (10)]. Use with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of constipation, urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in which anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions. When possible, avoid concomitant use with other anticholinergic medications because the risk for anticholinergic toxicity or severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions is increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 7), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.16 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

VERSACLOZ can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that VERSACLOZ does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related. Consider reducing the dose if they occur.

Case presentation

A woman in her 30s presented with a 2-month history of progressive exertional dyspnoea and fatigue accompanied by drenching night sweats and widespread arthralgias. Two weeks prior to her presentation, she was experiencing severe dyspnoea at rest with intermittent pleuritic chest pain, without any associated cough, palpitations, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea or haemoptysis. In the days prior to her presentation, she also experienced subjective fevers and rigors due to developing macrophage activation syndrome.

Medical history was significant for SLE diagnosed at age 13 years after presenting with polyarthralgia, alopecia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Other manifestations of SLE include pulmonary arterial hypertension, which resolved with rituximab at age 19 years, and refractory LN class IV. The patient has no obstetric history. Despite multiple immunosuppressive treatments, no long-term sustained remission of her LN was achieved. The patient had proteinuria since diagnosis at age 12 years, apart from a transient resolution of proteinuria with rituximab at age 25 years. Figure 1 shows prior immunosuppression treatment of the patient for LN, as well as historical proteinuria and serum creatinine trend. At the time of this presentation, she was managed with mycophenolic acid 720 mg two times a day, prednisolone 20 mg daily, hydroxychloroquine 200 mg a day, candesartan 32 mg and spironolactone 25 mg a day.

Brugada Syndrome

BrS is an inherited channelopathy that predisposes patients to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Its prevalence is around 3 to 5 per 10 000 people, and it is 8 to 10 times more frequent in male patients. The clinical manifestations of BrS vary, with approximately two thirds of patients being asymptomatic and one third presenting with syncope or palpitations and dizziness. Nonetheless, SCD can be the first manifestation of the disease, with BrS being involved in 4% to 12% of all SCD cases and up to 28% of SCDs in individuals with structurally normal hearts. SCD and arrythmias tend to occur during periods of rest, sleep, or after consuming large meals, which are associated with episodes of enhanced vagal tone and bradycardia. BrS is also associated with other conduction abnormalities, including first‐degree atrioventricular block, right bundle branch block, intraventricular conduction delay, and sick sinus syndrome.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111upusP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia in individuals with HIV — clinical and radiographic presentation is similar to that in individuals without HIV, with patients caused by bacteria such as S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus characteristically having acute onset (3 to 5 days) of fevers, chills, rigors, chest pain or pleurisy, cough productive of purulent sputum, and dyspnea; tachypnea and decreased arterial oxygen saturation indicate moderate-to-severe pneumonia, and in such cases, clinicians should strongly consider hospitalizing the patient. Patients with bacterial pneumonia typically have signs of focal consolidation, such as egophony, and/or pleural effusion on examination, whereas in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) lung examination often is normal and, if abnormal, reveals inspiratory crackles. In bacterial pneumonia the white blood cell (WBC) count usually is elevated, the elevation may be relative to baseline in those with advanced HIV, and neutrophilia or a left shift may be present. Chest radiographs characteristically show unilateral, focal, segmental, or lobar consolidation; those with S. pneumoniae or Haemophilus typically present with consolidation, whereas cavitation may be more suggestive of P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.

Table 2 lists the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the individual features calculated over the total population. Termination with adenosine and a typical SVT EKG had the highest sensitivity and PPV (85%–95%). Termination with vagal stimulation had a high PPV (85%) but a low NPV (21%), reflecting the fact that vagal stimulation is often insufficient to terminate SVT. A monitored event lasting ≥ 30 s had a moderate PPV and NPV (76% and 49%), reflecting the sporadic nature of SVT events. Pre‐excitation was highly predictive of an ablation being performed, but only modestly predictive of SVT induction.

Table 2
Statistical parameters.

We generated a point‐based score system for estimating the preoperative probability that SVT will be induced or ablated (Figure 6B). The score reflects the relative predictive strength of each feature. Patients with any score ≥ 3 (i.e. any individual feature except pre‐excitation) have a probability of SVT induction and ablation of at least 60%. Other scoring systems based on patient questionnaires agree that those who report documentation of tachycardia, termination with medications or vagal maneuvers, or longer symptomatic episodes are more likely to have SVT induced.

In many respects our findings corroborate what would be expected from clinical intuition. One common thread is that longer duration tachycardia episodes predict successful SVT induction and ablation. We found that the cutoff duration of a monitored episode that best distinguishes inducible from noninducible patients is 30 s (Figure 4D). Some of other positively predictive features also reflect longer duration episodes. For example, to have a 12 lead EKG taken during SVT or to be given adenosine, the patient's tachycardia would have to last long enough for them to seek medical attention and undergo at least a rudimentary evaluation.

Termination of tachycardia by adenosine strongly suggests that the arrhythmia is a form of SVT that uses the AV node as part of the circuit, such as AVNRT or AVRT. Adenosine also suppresses triggered activity and can terminate the majority of FATs, many of which have a triggered mechanism. Adenosine causes only transient slowing of other common narrow complex tachycardias such as sinus tachycardia, AF, or AFL. Vagus nerve stimulation also slows AV conduction and suppresses triggered activity, but not to the same extent as adenosine.

### Provigil [^111W5ovk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Cardiovascular Events

In modafinil clinical studies, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, and transient ischemic T-wave changes on ECG occurred in three subjects in association with mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy. In a Canadian clinical trial, a 35 year old obese narcoleptic male with a prior history of syncopal episodes experienced a 9-second episode of asystole after 27 days of modafinil treatment (300 mg/day in divided doses). PROVIGIL is not recommended in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or in patients with mitral valve prolapse who have experienced the mitral valve prolapse syndrome when previously receiving CNS stimulants. Findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse syndrome include but are not limited to ischemic ECG changes, chest pain, or arrhythmia. If new onset of any of these findings occurs, consider cardiac evaluation. Consider increased monitoring in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

Blood pressure monitoring in short term (≤ 3 months) controlled trials showed no clinically significant changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving PROVIGIL as compared to placebo. However, a retrospective analysis of the use of antihypertensive medication in these studies showed that a greater proportion of patients on PROVIGIL required new or increased use of antihypertensive medications (2.4%) compared to patients on placebo (0.7%). The differential use was slightly larger when only studies in OSA were included, with 3.4% of patients on PROVIGIL and 1.1% of patients on placebo requiring such alterations in the use of antihypertensive medication. Increased monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on PROVIGIL. Caution should be exercised when prescribing PROVIGIL to patients with known cardiovascular disease.

Novel diagnostic criteria and classification by duration for pericarditis — diagnosis requires "Pleuritic chest pain or equivalent suggestive clinical presentation (must be present)" plus "at least 1 more finding (0 = unlikely, 1 = possible, 2+ = definite diagnosis)" from the following: "Pericardial friction rub"; "ECG changes: diffuse ST-elevation and/or PR-segment depression"; "Inflammatory biomarkers elevation (C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate)"; "Cardiac imaging evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion (especially echocardiography, other imaging modalities as alternative)"; or "Cardiac imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation (cardiac magnetic resonance pericardial late gadolinium enhancement and/or edema, computed tomography with contrast as alternative)". Duration classification is listed as: "Acute: Event lasting < 4–6 weeks", "Incessant: Event lasting > 4 to 6 weeks without remission", "Recurrent: New episode with signs and symptoms of pericardial inflammation after a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks", and "Chronic: Event lasting > 3 months".

### Cabergoline [^114dkRJk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cardiac Valvulopathy and Pericardial Fibrosis

Before initiating CABERGOLINE, perform a cardiovascular evaluation, including with an echocardiogram, to evaluate for valvular disease. CABERGOLINE is contraindicated in the presence of valvular disease or pericardial fibrosis [see Contraindications (4)].

Cases of valvular and pericardial fibrosis have often manifested as heart failure. Following CABERGOLINE treatment initiation, monitor for the development of valvulopathy with a cardiac echocardiogram at intervals of 6 to 12 months or as clinically indicated with new onset edema, cardiac murmur, dyspnea, or heart failure. During CABERGOLINE treatment, monitor for chest pain and signs and symptoms of heart failure and if heart failure occurs, valvular fibrosis and pericarditis should be excluded. Consider clinical and diagnostic monitoring such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum creatinine measurements, chest-x- ray, and other investigations and cardiac imaging at baseline and as necessary while patients are treated with during CABERGOLINE treatment. Use CABERGOLINE in patients treated with other drugs associated with valvulopathy only if the potential benefit of CABERGOLINE outweighs the risk.

Discontinue CABERGOLINE if the patient has a new diagnosis of valvular regurgitation, valvular restriction, valve leaflet thickening, or pericarditis.

Postmarketing cases of cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in patients who received CABERGOLINE. These cases have generally occurred during administration of high doses of CABERGOLINE (> 2 mg/day) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) (CABERGOLINE is not approved for the treatment of PD). Cases of cardiac valvulopathy have also been reported in patients who received lower dosages of CABERGOLINE for the treatment of hyperprolactinemic disorders. In a 12-year, multi-country retrospective cohort study, the use of CABERGOLINE for PD was associated with an increased risk of cardiac valvular regurgitation (CVR). Compared to non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists and levodopa, CVR with CABERGOLINE use had an incidence rate per 10,000 person years of 68 (95% CI: 37, 115) versus 10 (95% CI: 5, 19) for non-ergot dopamine agonists and 11 (95% CI: 7, 17) for levodopa.

5.7 Cardiovascular Events

In clinical studies of modafinil, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea and transient ischemic T-wave changes on ECG were observed in three subjects in association with mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy. It is recommended that NUVIGIL tablets not be used in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or in patients with mitral valve prolapse who have experienced the mitral valve prolapse syndrome when previously receiving CNS stimulants. Findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse syndrome include but are not limited to ischemic ECG changes, chest pain, or arrhythmia. If new onset of any of these findings occurs, consider cardiac evaluation.

Blood pressure monitoring in short term (≤ 3 months) pre-approval controlled trials of OSA, SWD, and narcolepsy showed small average increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving NUVIGIL as compared to placebo (1.2 to 4.3 mmHg in the various experimental groups). There was also a slightly greater proportion of patients on NUVIGIL requiring new or increased use of antihypertensive medications (2.9%) compared to patients on placebo (1.8%). There was a small, but consistent, average increase in pulse rate over placebo in pre-approval controlled trials. This increase varied from 0.9 to 3.5 BPM. Increased monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on NUVIGIL. Caution should be exercised when prescribing NUVIGIL to patients with known cardiovascular disease.

The role of inflammation in pericardial disease — pericarditis is characterized by a severe inflammatory response to injury of mesothelial cells triggered by viral infections, cardiac surgery or procedures, or immune derangements; etiologies including infectious, autoimmune, or mechanical injury promote transcription and translation of proinflammatory genes and inflammasome components, leading to caspase‑1 activation and maturation of interleukin‑1β and other cytokines; derangements in innate and adaptive immunity contribute to disparate clinical phenotypes, significant patient‑level variability, and dysregulated immunity is often implicated in recurrent and chronic cases where identifying these derangements can refine targeted immunosuppressive therapies.

Case presentation

Case history/examination

A 31-year-old white male patient presented to the outpatient clinic with the chief complaint of exertional chest pain and dyspnea consistent with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III for the past three months. The symptoms progressively worsened over time. The only significant point in the patient's past medical and surgical history was a pericardiectomy due to idiopathic constrictive pericarditis three years ago.

The patient's physical exam upon admission revealed significant edema of the lower extremities and anxiety. The patient's vital signs were normal, including a blood pressure of 110/70, a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, a body temperature of 36.8 °C, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The physical examination indicated symmetrical 2 + pretibial edema on both sides. The initial ECG showed normal sinus rhythm, right axis deviation, and T-wave inversions in leads V1 to V4. Doppler echocardiography revealed several significant findings. The left ventricular systolic function was normal; however, the right ventricle displayed mild enlargement and moderate systolic dysfunction, indicated by a fractional area change (FAC) of 23% and a tissue Doppler S wave velocity of 5 cm/s.

Differential diagnosis, investigations, and treatment

Upon initial assessment through the standard echocardiographic view, we found an echo-free space located apical to the RV apex (Fig. 1), with a mild effusion around the heart's apex. Further evaluation using off-axis views revealed an outpouching sac in the apical position of the RV (Table 1). The sac exhibited dynamic behavior, expanding during systole and contracting during diastole. The outpouching measured 21 mm by 14.3 mm during maximum expansion, with a notably narrow neck measuring 6 mm long and 3.5 mm in diameter (Fig. 2 A and B). Color Doppler and pulse wave Doppler study revealed a distinctive "to and from" pattern that aligned with the echocardiographic findings of the RV pseudoaneurysm (Fig. 3 A and B).
