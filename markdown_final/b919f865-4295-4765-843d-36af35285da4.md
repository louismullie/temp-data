## Question

What are possible causes of serous drainage from the umbilicus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about possible causes of serous (clear, watery) drainage from the umbilicus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "serous" implies pathophysiologically and how it can appear in early infection versus noninfectious fistulous causes. Then, I should consider age-specific etiologies, especially congenital anomalies in neonates and infants such as urachal and omphalomesenteric duct remnants. Next, I will examine infectious and inflammatory causes like omphalitis and how they can initially produce serous exudate. After that, I need to check for less common entities (e.g., umbilical endometriosis or tumors) that can present with discharge. Finally, I will outline a focused diagnostic workup distinguishing urine, enteric, and inflammatory sources, and then review evidence-based management strategies, making sure to verify each step against the cited literature [^114d8von] [^111WnHrU] [^113HpEug].

> Let me first confirm what "serous drainage" connotes clinically. Serous fluid is typically clear to straw-colored and protein-poor; in cutaneous infection, early inflammatory exudate can look serous before turning purulent as neutrophils and bacteria accumulate, so I should not prematurely exclude infection if the fluid is only clear at presentation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — "true" watery discharge can also reflect fistulous communication with another organ, most importantly the bladder via a patent urachus, which would be continuous and urine-like rather than intermittently exudative [^114d8von] [^113HpEug].

> I will now examine infectious and inflammatory causes. Omphalitis in neonates typically presents with peri-umbilical erythema, induration, local tenderness, and may have purulent drainage; however, early presentations can produce serous fluid before purulence develops. Wait, let me verify — recent pediatric data indicate most omphalitis is localized soft tissue infection with low rates of concurrent serious bacterial infection, but umbilical drainage in infants should prompt consideration of underlying urachal anomalies as contributors or mimics. Management is primarily antibiotic therapy; surgical intervention is rarely needed unless complications arise. I need to ensure we distinguish early serous omphalitis from fistula to avoid delay in addressing a remnant if present [^114d8von].

> Next, I should review congenital urachal anomalies, the leading cause of persistent watery "serous" umbilical leakage in infants. A patent urachus creates a direct bladder–umbilicus tract, allowing urine to leak from the umbilicus; features include continuous clear drainage that may smell like urine, skin maceration, and exacerbation with crying or voiding. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic pathway: ultrasound to identify a tract or associated cyst, and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or cystography for confirmation; in rare cases, bladder mucosa can prolapse through the tract, presenting as an umbilical mass, rapidly confirmed by cystography. Evidence-ranging from guidelines to case series — supports considering patent urachus early when the discharge is frankly watery and persistent [^113HpEug] [^114Fr4gU] [^114hEbE8] [^113t5qFj].

> But wait, what if the urachus is not fully patent? Urachal remnants (urachal sinus, urachal cyst, vesico-urachal diverticulum) can present variably with umbilical discharge that may be serous when uncomplicated and purulent with infection; adults can present with "discharging umbilical swelling" from infected urachal cysts. I should double-check guideline summaries: pediatric urology guidance lists umbilical discharge and urine leakage among common presenting symptoms of urachal disease, reinforcing that even intermittent clear drainage warrants imaging for remnants. In neonates and young infants, infected umbilical urachal sinuses have been documented and require both antimicrobial therapy and definitive surgical management once inflammation subsides [^114LvURc] [^113HpEug] [^117E9YW7].

> Let me consider omphalomesenteric duct (OMD) anomalies. A fully patent OMD (vitellointestinal duct) typically produces enteric or bilious discharge, sometimes with flatus from the umbilicus; that is not truly "serous". Wait, I should verify nuances: OMD-related cutaneous lesions (umbilical polyp, mucosal remnants) can present with mucous discharge and granulation tissue, which can be misinterpreted as serous fluid early on. A systematic review emphasizes that OMD lesions are often misdiagnosed and that delayed recognition leads to morbidity; careful inspection during crying/straining and targeted ultrasound can reveal a persistent tract or mucosal tissue. Rare iatrogenic complications occur if an OMD is inadvertently cannulated. So, while classic OMD discharge is not purely serous, early or mixed presentations still belong in the differential for umbilical leakage, especially with green-brown, malodorous, or gas-associated outflow [^111WnHrU] [^114527Ny] [^116ixtY1] [^113BSdHC].

> Hmm, wait a minute — am I overlooking benign umbilical lesions that can weep clear fluid? Umbilical granulomas can ooze small amounts of serous exudate from friable granulation tissue, but they usually follow cord separation and appear as moist, pink granulation; they are not well captured in these references but are clinically common. I should confirm that persistent drainage beyond normal healing or atypical features (copious output, urine odor, green/brown color, gas) push me away from simple granuloma and toward urachal or OMD etiologies supported by the literature cited above [^114d8von] [^111WnHrU].

> In older children and adults, I need to check for rarer etiologies of umbilical discharge. Urachal remnant disease persists beyond infancy and can cause umbilical discharge or even urine leakage; risk of malignant transformation later in life supports definitive excision when feasible. Other uncommon causes include umbilical endometriosis with cyclical bloody-brown discharge and tumor-like nodules, and very rare intra-abdominal pathologies fistulizing to the umbilicus, such as appendiceal mucinous lesions presenting with purulent discharge — these are not typical for serous fluid but should be considered when the clinical context fits. Hold on, I should verify the malignancy concern and adult presentations — case-based literature and guideline summaries align with a surgical approach in persistent urachal disease, including adolescents and adults [^113HpEug] [^117TE7kn] [^112y9ZTQ] [^113SK299].

> Next, I should review a focused diagnostic approach that distinguishes urine, enteric, and inflammatory sources. Let me first confirm bedside steps: inspect for continuous versus intermittent leakage, assess odor and color, and note association with voiding or straining. If urine is suspected, I should test the fluid for urea/creatinine or perform a dipstick for urine indicators while arranging ultrasound of the umbilicus and bladder dome and a VCUG or cystography as indicated. If enteric communication is suspected (green-brown discharge, flatus), targeted ultrasound of the umbilical tract and small bowel, and surgical consultation are appropriate. For suspected infection, obtain swabs for culture and initiate empiric antibiotics while evaluating for underlying anomalies. I need to ensure imaging selection aligns with the literature supporting ultrasound as a first-line modality and cystography/VCUG for urachal communications [^114Fr4gU] [^113t5qFj] [^113HpEug] [^111WnHrU].

> Now, management — let me verify principles by etiology. For omphalitis, treat promptly with systemic antibiotics and local care; most cases are localized and respond without surgery, but persistent drainage or atypical features should trigger imaging for an underlying urachal or OMD remnant. For patent urachus and most urachal remnants, definitive management is surgical excision of the tract/remnant after stabilization; there is a low-quality signal that brief bladder catheter drainage can promote closure in select neonates, but this is not standard and requires careful follow-up imaging. For OMD remnants, surgical resection is standard, especially for patent ducts or symptomatic polyps. I should confirm the malignancy and recurrence risks driving excision in older patients with urachal disease. Throughout, I need to ensure antibiotic coverage if infection is present and to coordinate pediatric surgery or urology early when a remnant is suspected [^114d8von] [^113HpEug] [^114hpuEz] [^111WnHrU].

> Let me reconsider the initial premise to avoid a misstep. I initially leaned toward infection as the most common overall cause of umbilical drainage, which is true in many neonatal settings; however, when the drainage is truly watery and persistent, the balance of probability shifts toward urachal anomalies rather than early serous infection. Preserving both possibilities is crucial, but the character of the fluid, temporal pattern, and associated signs (odor of urine, exacerbation with voids, flatus, green-brown color) should guide the immediate workup. I should double-check that guidelines explicitly flag umbilical drainage as a red flag for underlying urachal abnormalities, which they do, supporting early imaging and specialist involvement [^114d8von] [^113HpEug].

Serous umbilical discharge most often arises from a **benign umbilical granuloma** [^111WnHrU] or a **urachal remnant** [^113HpEug] (patent urachus [^114Fr4gU], urachal sinus, or cyst [^114LvURc]). Other causes include omphalomesenteric duct remnants [^111WnHrU], omphalitis [^114d8von], umbilical hernia, endometriosis [^1122cTst], and iatrogenic injury [^116ixtY1]. Evaluation should include a **focused exam, ultrasound, and culture** [^113HpEug] [^114tcLmS] [^114d8von]; management is cause-directed, with silver nitrate for granulomas [^111WnHrU], antibiotics for infection [^114d8von], and surgical excision for persistent embryonic remnants [^113HpEug] or endometriosis [^1122cTst].

---

## Embryological remnants

### Urachal anomalies

In urachal anomalies [^113HpEug], a **patent urachus** is a persistent urachal tract causing clear or serous, urine-like discharge and may even present with bladder prolapse through the umbilicus [^114Fr4gU] [^113t5qFj], whereas a **urachal sinus or cyst** results from partial urachal obliteration with intermittent serous discharge, often complicated by infection or inflammation [^114LvURc] [^117E9YW7].

---

### Omphalomesenteric duct remnants

In omphalomesenteric duct remnants, a **persistent omphalomesenteric duct** reflects failure of involution of the embryonic connection between the midgut and yolk sac, leading to serous or mucous discharge and sometimes umbilical polyps or granulation tissue [^111WnHrU] [^113BSdHC].

---

## Infectious etiologies

In infectious etiologies, **omphalitis** [^114d8von] is an umbilical stump infection — typically in neonates — characterized by erythema, induration, and serous or purulent discharge and can progress to systemic infection if untreated [^114oZFge] [^1135qwVB]. **Chronic bacterial colonization** (e.g. hemolytic streptococcus) can cause a persistent low-grade infection with chronic serous discharge [^114ywxnN].

---

## Inflammatory and granulomatous conditions

In inflammatory and granulomatous conditions, an **umbilical granuloma** is benign granulation tissue at the umbilicus and commonly causes serous discharge in infants, whereas **umbilical endometriosis** involves ectopic endometrial tissue at the umbilicus with cyclical serous or bloody discharge that correlates with menses [^111WnHrU] [^117TE7kn] [^1122cTst].

---

## Hernias and structural abnormalities

In hernias and structural abnormalities, an **umbilical hernia** is a protrusion of intra-abdominal contents through the umbilical ring and may cause serous discharge when associated with irritation or minor trauma.

---

## Iatrogenic and traumatic causes

For iatrogenic and traumatic causes, **surgical or procedural trauma** — such as umbilical trocar insertion [^111arnGG] or other surgical interventions — can cause serous discharge due to local tissue injury or inflammation [^114tcLmS].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A structured **diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **Clinical examination**: Assess for erythema, induration, granulation tissue, hernia, or mass [^114d8von].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound is first-line to identify urachal or omphalomesenteric remnants, cysts, or hernias; CT or MRI may be needed for complex cases.

- **Laboratory tests**: Culture discharge to identify infectious organisms [^114d8von]; urinalysis if urine-like discharge suggests patent urachus [^114Fr4gU].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the underlying **etiology**:

| **Etiology** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Urachal anomalies | Surgical excision of the urachal remnant; antibiotics if infected [^113HpEug] [^114LvURc] |
| Omphalomesenteric duct remnants | Surgical excision of the remnant [^111WnHrU] |
| Omphalitis | Systemic antibiotics; surgical intervention if severe or unresponsive [^114d8von] |
| Umbilical granuloma | Topical silver nitrate cauterization [^111WnHrU] |
| Umbilical endometriosis | Surgical excision; medical management for recurrence prevention [^1122cTst] |
| Umbilical hernia | Surgical repair if symptomatic or persistent |
| Iatrogenic or traumatic causes | Conservative management; surgical intervention if persistent or complicated [^111arnGG] [^114tcLmS] |

---

Serous umbilical discharge has a broad differential — including embryological remnants, infection, inflammation, hernias, and trauma — and requires **targeted evaluation and cause-specific therapy** for resolution [^111WnHrU].

### Omphalitis: Clinical presentation and approach to evaluation and management [^114d8von]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Omphalitis is an uncommon but potentially serious infection in neonates. Findings include erythema and induration around the umbilical stump, and purulent drainage may be present. Fever and signs of systemic illness may occur, or there may only be signs of localized soft tissue infection. Until recently, there have been very few cohort studies of omphalitis in high-income countries, and no literature was available regarding the incidence of concurrent serious bacterial infection such as meningitis or urinary tract infection. A recent large, multicenter study suggests that most omphalitis presents as localized soft tissue infection, with very low rates of concurrent serious bacterial infection or adverse outcomes. Underlying urachal abnormalities should be considered in the infant with umbilical drainage. Treatment of omphalitis consists primarily of antibiotic administration, with surgical intervention rarely needed. Although antibiotics are typically administered intravenously, there may be a role for oral antibiotics in some lower-risk infants with omphalitis.

### Surgical management of umbilical endometrioma within an umbilical hernia [^1122cTst]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

In summary, umbilical endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of umbilical tumors, and the workup should include a search for pelvic endometriosis. Surgical excision in this reported case resulted in a 2-year recurrence-free interval but was complicated by a surgical site infection. Several umbilicoplasty techniques exist for optimal cosmesis. We agree with the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines, which state that surgical management is preferred for extrapelvic endometriosis as it removes the symptomatic mass and provides a histopathological diagnosis. Medical management may have a role in the treatment of umbilical endometriosis, although further studies in cases of endometriosis within a hernia are warranted, as attempting medical therapy may be futile and prolong time to surgery. The role of medical management after surgery to prevent recurrence also deserves further study, especially in the presence of pelvic endometriosis.

- **Learning points**: Recognize the prevalence of extrapelvic endometriosis in reproductive age women. Umbilical endometriosis usually presents with catamenial symptoms and can exist within an umbilical hernia. After complete surgical excision, individualized approaches to umbilical reconstruction based on patient and disease characteristics may be warranted.

### Cutaneous presentations of omphalomesenteric duct remnant: A systematic review of the literature [^111WnHrU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Disorders of the umbilicus are commonly seen in infancy, including hernias, infections, anomalies, granulomas, and malignancies. Meticulous inspection of the umbilicus at birth might reveal a persisting embryonic remnant, such as an omphalomesenteric duct (OMD), manifested by a variety of cutaneous signs, such as an umbilical mass, granulation tissue, or discharge.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the available data regarding the presence and management of OMD remnant with cutaneous involvement to suggest a practical approach for diagnosis and treatment.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature evaluating OMD anomalies presenting with cutaneous symptoms was performed. In addition, an index case of an 11-month-old patient is presented.

- **Results**: We included 59 publications reporting 536 cases; 97% of the patients whose age was noted were infants (mean age 11 months). In 7.5% of the cases, diagnosis was established only after treatment failure. In 6.4% of patients, nonlethal complications were reported, and in 10.3%, the outcome was death, partly due to delayed diagnosis or mismanagement.

- **Limitations**: Limited quality of the collected data and reporting bias.

- **Conclusion**: OMD is relatively rare; however, the clinician must consider this remnant while examining patients with umbilical abnormalities because mismanagement could cause severe morbidity and mortality.

### Cord pilot trial, comparing alternative policies for timing of cord clamping before 32 weeks gestation: Follow-up for women up to one year [^115ps2Zk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The Cord Pilot Trial compared cord clamping after at least two minutes, with immediate neonatal care if needed while the cord remained intact (deferred clamping), versus clamping within 20 seconds followed by neonatal care after clamping (immediate clamping) at very preterm birth (before 32 weeks gestation). The trial was conducted at eight UK tertiary maternity units. The protocol has been published. Initially, the objective was to assess the feasibility of conducting a large multicenter UK trial. Once feasibility was demonstrated, recruitment continued while funding for the full trial was sought. Recruitment ceased when the funding application for the full trial was unsuccessful.

- **Consent pathways**: Two different consent pathways were used within the trial. Where possible, the usual written consent process was employed (one-stage consent pathway). However, if birth was imminent and there was insufficient time for the usual consent process, women could give oral assent to the trial prior to birth. Following birth, written consent for follow-up participation was sought from women who had provided oral assent (two-stage consent pathway).

- **Follow-up and questionnaires**: Women were asked to complete two similar questionnaires: the first between four and eight weeks postpartum, and the second at one year. Initially, the first questionnaire was planned to be posted to the woman's home six weeks after the birth, but this often coincided with the baby's discharge, which was not an ideal time for the women to receive it. Therefore, an adjustment was made, and if the baby was still hospitalized at four weeks, the research midwife or nurse would provide the questionnaire.

### Delayed interval delivery in a quadruplet pregnancy: A case report and literature review [^114HWFb7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

At 23 3/7 weeks of pregnancy, a small amount of vaginal liquid was leaked, which was confirmed via speculum examination, suggesting amniotic fluid leakage. Laboratory examinations revealed mildly elevated white blood cell count (11.1×10⁹/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (18.94 mg/L, with an upper normal laboratory limit of 10 mg/L). Chorioamnionitis was highly suspected, and amniocentesis was recommended to confirm the diagnosis; however, the patient declined amniocentesis and requested to continue the pregnancy. Informed consent was obtained.

At 25 4/7 weeks of pregnancy, the culture of vaginal discharge was suggestive of Candida albicans infection, and clotrimazole vaginal tablets were administered for intravaginal placement. At 25 6/7 weeks of pregnancy, a large amount of streaky discharge was observed, and the cervix was dilated about 6 cm. Cervical cerclage was removed, and a male fetus was delivered, weighing 735 g, with Apgar scores of 6 at the first minute and 8 at five minutes; he was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for treatment. Uterine contractions gradually decreased, and no signs of active labor were noticed.

After informing the patient and family in detail of the possible benefits and complications, they chose to delay the delivery of the other fetuses. Cervical cerclage was performed after high ligation of the umbilical cord, and the vagina was rinsed with iodophor. Ritodrine hydrochloride and indomethacin were used to prolong the pregnancy, and antibiotic therapy (cefazoline and metronidazole) was continued while continuously monitoring the patient and fetuses.

### Efficacy and safety of umbilical cord milking at birth: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PvUbp]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Umbilical cord milking (UCM) is suggested to improve neonatal outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UCM in full-term and preterm neonates. A comprehensive search was performed using databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists of retrieved articles, covering literature from 1940 to 2014.

Randomized clinical trials comparing UCM with alternative umbilical cord handling strategies in full-term and preterm infants were selected. From the initial 18 studies identified, 7 were selected for analysis. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial bias risk according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

The primary outcome measured was neonatal mortality before hospital discharge. Analysis included 7 randomized clinical trials with 501 infants. Among infants with a gestational age of less than 33 weeks, those allocated to UCM showed no difference in mortality risk (risk ratio [RR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.35 to 1.64]; risk difference [RD], -0.02 [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.04]), hypotension requiring volume expanders (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.25]; RD, -0.09 [95% CI, -0.22 to 0.05]), or inotrope support (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.51 to 1.17]; RD, -0.10 [95% CI, -0.25 to 0.05]). However, UCM was associated with higher initial levels of hemoglobin (mean difference, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.3–2.7] g/dL) and hematocrit (mean difference, 4.5% [95% CI, 1.5%-7.4%]).

### "The cord is the child": Meanings and practices related to umbilical cord care in Central Uganda [^112VhPDK]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

We found that the umbilical cord carried symbolic meanings that extended beyond the health of the child and the newborn period. The way it was treated and kept reflected parental care and responsibility and was understood to be important for the future well-being of the child. One study participant explained the significance attributed to the cord by stating, "the cord is the child". We aim to uncover what this concept involved and to describe the various meanings associated with the cord. Using Mary Douglas' conceptualization of the body and its boundaries, and her elaboration of how matter changes meaning when it passes boundaries, we explore how the meaning of the cord changes as it transcends from inside the womb to the outside, and from the surface of the baby's body until it falls off.

- **Inside the womb**: The participants appreciated the umbilical cord as a vital organ necessary for child growth in the uterus. Consistent with biomedical thinking, the umbilical cord was seen as a source of nourishment to the baby and was associated with life and death. A traditional birth attendant (TBA) told us, "We see this umbilical cord as the center of life ". Explaining further, a participant in a focus group discussion (FGD) told us, "The umbilical cord is the life of the child because it is where the child breathes. If it is cut off before time, the child could die ".

Below, we shall see how the meanings and understandings of the umbilical cord change as the baby passes through the birth canal and is detached from…

### Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping of term infants on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^117XNpgT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Policies for timing of cord clamping vary, with early cord clamping generally carried out in the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord more than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has ceased. The benefits and potential harms of each policy are debated.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of early cord clamping compared with late cord clamping after birth on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 February 2013).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing early and late cord clamping.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: We included 15 trials involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs. We judged the trials to have an overall moderate risk of bias.

Maternal outcomes: No studies in this review reported on maternal death or on severe maternal morbidity. There were no significant differences between early versus late cord clamping groups for the primary outcome of severe postpartum hemorrhage (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.65; five trials with data for 2066 women with a late clamping event rate (LCER) of ~3.5%, I² 0%) or for postpartum hemorrhage of 500 mL or more (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.44; five trials, 2260 women with a LCER of ~12%, I² 0%). There were no significant differences between subgroups depending on the use of uterotonic drugs.

### Umbilical cord-care practices in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review [^114VaStg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Our initial search focused on studies that described traditional umbilical cord care practices globally. For the purposes of this article, traditional practices were those that focused on the cultural beliefs and customs that guided how the umbilical cord was cared for, including the length of the cord stump, substances applied, and the decisions regarding disposal of the cord stump. We developed systematic searches for PubMed and Google Scholar using controlled vocabulary (Additional file 1: Search Terminology). Initial criteria for eligibility were determined by topic, time period, and language of the publication. We included articles that were published between January 1, 2000, and January 30, 2016. A second search was performed in August 2016 to account for any publications during the intervening months. The language of publication was limited to English. References in the identified articles were reviewed to determine if other sources would be pertinent, and additional articles were abstracted if relevant.

The original search yielded 321 articles, from which 107 duplicates were excluded. A reviewer then screened the titles and abstracts of the remaining 214 articles to determine suitability for inclusion. Articles that did not meet the criteria included those unrelated to the application of substances to the umbilical cord, articles focused on clinical trials comparing a variety of antiseptic applications to the umbilical cord, articles wherein the authors related only secondary data sources regarding umbilical cord-care practices, and articles that were unrelated.

### Umbilical cord cysts: Classification, diagnosis, prognosis, and pregnancy recommendations [^115dosfq]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Low credibility.

Umbilical cord cysts (UCCs) are cysts located in the umbilical cord that result from an abnormal embryonic development process. These cysts are typically discovered incidentally during prenatal ultrasound and can be classified as either pseudocysts or true UCCs. Pseudocysts result from focal edema or degeneration of Wharton jelly, while true UCCs arise from the remnants of embryonic development.

Due to the relative rarity of UCCs, clinical guidance is currently unavailable. The aim of this paper is to discuss the classification, diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management of UCCs through a thorough literature review. This should enhance the understanding of UCCs among clinical obstetricians and pediatricians.

### An International Continence Society (ICS)/ International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) joint report on the terminology for the assessment and management of obstetric pelvic floor disorders [^115worFT]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Postpartum bleeding, discharge, and infection include complaints of abnormal vaginal and/or vulvo-perineal bleeding, mucus or pus discharge during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery.

- **Obstetric pelvic floor trauma-related sexual dysfunction symptoms**:
	- **Postpartum dyspareunia**: Pain or discomfort associated with attempted or complete vaginal penetration during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery.
	- **Postpartum vaginal laxity**: Feeling of vaginal looseness during the postpartum period and up to 12 months after delivery.
	- **Postpartum obstructed intercourse**: New onset difficulty or obstruction of vaginal intercourse that occurs during the postpartum period and within 12 months after delivery.
	- **Postpartum anorgasmia or difficulty in achieving orgasm**: Lack of orgasm during the postpartum period and within 12 months after delivery, or difficulty, delay, or absence of attaining orgasm following sufficient sexual stimulation and arousal, which causes personal distress.
	- **Postpartum decreased arousal**: Inability to achieve or maintain sexual excitement during the postpartum period and within 12 months after delivery. This may be expressed as lack of excitement, lack of lubrication, lack of vaginal and clitoral engorgement, or lack of expression of other somatic responses.
	- **Postpartum decreased libido or sexual desire**: Absent or diminished feelings of sexual interest or desire, absent sexual thoughts or fantasies, and a lack of response.

### Baby-directed umbilical cord clamping: A feasibility study [^115JTLm2]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Over five percent of infants born worldwide will need help breathing after birth. Delayed cord clamping (DCC) has become the standard of care for vigorous infants. DCC in non-vigorous infants is uncommon because of logistical difficulties in providing effective resuscitation during DCC. In baby-directed umbilical cord clamping (Baby-DUCC), the umbilical cord remains patent until the infant's lungs are exchanging gases. We conducted a feasibility study of the Baby-DUCC technique.

- **Methods**: We obtained antenatal consent from pregnant women to enroll infants born at ≥ 32 weeks. Vigorous infants received ≥ 2 min of DCC. If the infant received respiratory support, the umbilical cord was clamped ≥ 60 s after the colorimetric carbon dioxide detector turned yellow. Maternal uterotonic medication was administered after umbilical cord clamping. A pediatrician and researcher entered the sterile field to provide respiratory support during a cesarean birth. Maternal and infant outcomes in the delivery room and prior to hospital discharge were analyzed.

- **Results**: Forty-four infants were enrolled, 23 delivered via cesarean section (8 unplanned), and 15 delivered vaginally (6 via instrumentation). Twelve infants were non-vigorous. ECG was the preferred method for recording HR. Two infants had a HR ≥ 100 BPM by 80 s after birth. Median time to umbilical cord clamping was 150 and 138 s in vigorous and non-vigorous infants, respectively. Median maternal blood loss was 300 ml.

- **Conclusions**: It is feasible to provide resuscitation to term and near-term infants using the Baby-DUCC technique.

### Necrotizing funisitis and calcification of umbilical vein: case report and review [^112SQPt7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Necrotizing funisitis (NF) is a rare, chronic stage of funisitis, characterized by severe inflammation of the umbilical cord, posing a significant risk for adverse fetal outcomes. NF manifests as yellow-white bands running parallel to the umbilical blood vessels, composed of inflammatory cells, necrotic debris, and calcium deposits. Ultrasound imaging can detect calcification, which aids in suspecting NF when umbilical vascular wall calcification is observed.

- **Case presentation**: Ultrasonography identified calcification of the umbilical venous wall in a 31-year-old expectant woman, gravida 1, para 0. She required an emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress and suspected umbilical cord torsion at 31 weeks' gestation. During the operation, the umbilical cord's root was extremely fragile and broke. Pathological analysis of the placenta revealed histologic chorioamnionitis and NF. Post-delivery, the infant was diagnosed with neonatal sepsis and acidosis; however, following a one-month hospitalization with antibiotic and supportive therapy, the infant was discharged without severe complications.

- **Conclusion**: NF is a rare and severe inflammation of the umbilical cord. Prenatal ultrasonography, which reveals umbilical vascular wall calcification, is diagnostically beneficial.

### Umbilical cord management in newborn resuscitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yDkod]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

**Systematic search and selection**: The systematic search yielded 17,141 articles. After duplicate removal and selection processes, 11 eligible studies were identified, with an additional one found through reference and citation search (Supplementary Fig. 1). A subset of qualified papers included infants for whom resuscitation following birth was uncertain or unnecessary. After contacting corresponding authors for more detailed data, one more study was included in the analysis. In one article, the necessary information was successfully obtained to determine the total sample size for in-hospital mortality. In conclusion, six RCTs were included in the quantitative analysis, while ten RCTs and two observational studies were included in the systematic review. Details and results of the studies included in the systematic review are summarized in Supplementary Table 3.

### Late abdominal pregnancy in a post-conflict context: Case of a mistaken acute abdomen - a case report [^112eW7Z1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Examination of the vulva and vagina were normal. The cervix was long, posterior, and not excitable. The os was closed and no abnormal discharge was noted.

A diagnosis of an acute abdomen in the third trimester of pregnancy was made, and acute peritonitis was suspected. Differential diagnoses included appendicular or other bowel perforation.

The patient was admitted to the hospital. An emergency ultrasound showed a single viable pregnancy at 33 weeks gestation with a low-lying placenta and oligohydramnios. Initial hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dl with a hematocrit of 22.6%.

After intravenous access was obtained, intravenous fluids and initial pain management were started. The patient was counseled and consented to an emergency laparotomy.

She was taken to the operating theatre and was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Both an obstetrician and a general surgeon scrubbed for the case. A sub-umbilical incision was made and then extended above the umbilicus. Upon entering the abdominal cavity, a huge reddish mass was identified. Fetal parts were visible through the membranes delineating the mass. There was minimal meconium-stained amniotic fluid around the baby. Upon digital opening of the mass, a live 2000 g female baby in longitudinal lie with the head in the maternal pelvis was delivered [Fig. 1]. APGAR scores were 8, 6, and 9 at 1, 5, and 10 min respectively. The baby was immediately taken to neonatology for thorough screening by the pediatrics team and was found to be healthy with no congenital abnormalities. Careful exploration of the abdomen revealed a placenta implanted on

### Knots of the umbilical cord: Incidence, diagnosis, and management [^115xzp17]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Low credibility.

Knots of the umbilical cord have received emphasis because clinical assessments and sonographic literature show a crucial role in fetal outcomes. A true umbilical cord knot could occur in a singleton pregnancy or as an entanglement of two umbilical cords in monoamniotic twins. Clinical manifestations are almost silent, which can present clinical challenges. Umbilical cord knots worsen outcomes and can be easily missed during prenatal visits because ultrasonographers often do not focus on the cord during an obstetric ultrasound scan. However, most medical centers now have ultrasound machines that improve fetal assessment. The umbilical cord should be routinely evaluated during a fetal assessment, allowing more frequent diagnosis of umbilical cord knots, although they are often detected incidentally. Clinical outcomes are usually good but depend on the knot's characteristics and whether it is tight or loose. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, theories on formation, main risk factors, ultrasound signs and findings, various management opinions, and features of pregnancy outcomes.

### Persistent omphalomesenteric duct in an infant with trisomy 21 [^114527Ny]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

We present the case of a term newborn with trisomy 21 who arrived at the pediatric emergency department with a periumbilical flare and green-brown discharge from a clamped umbilical cord, initially suspected to be omphalitis. However, it was noticed later that when the infant strained or cried, a thick, bubbling, and offensive green-brown discharge emerged from the clamped umbilical cord along with umbilical flatus. An ultrasound of the abdomen and umbilical cord confirmed the presence of a persistent omphalomesenteric duct (POMD). He was then transferred to the pediatric surgical unit, where he underwent a laparotomy and surgical resection of the POMD, and was discharged home two days later.

### Discharge procedures for healthy newborns [^1116nXEb]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Physicians should use a checklist to facilitate discussions with new parents before discharging their healthy newborn from the hospital. The checklist should include information on breastfeeding, warning signs of illness, and ways to keep the child healthy and safe. Physicians can encourage breastfeeding by giving parents written information on hunger and feeding indicators, stool and urine patterns, and proper breastfeeding techniques. Physicians also should emphasize that infants should never be given honey or bottles of water before they are one year of age.

Parents should be advised of treatments for common infant complaints such as constipation, be aware of signs and symptoms of more serious illnesses such as jaundice and lethargy, and know how to properly care for the umbilical cord and genital areas. Physicians should provide guidance on how to keep the baby safe in the crib (e.g. placing the baby on his or her back) and in the car (e.g. using a car seat that faces the rear of the car). It is also important to schedule a follow-up appointment for the infant.

### Life-threatening complication: The development of necrotising fasciitis in a preterm neonate with omphalitis [^1135qwVB]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Omphalitis is a mild medical condition that can turn severe in exceptional situations, leading to necrotising fasciitis. The most common cause of omphalitis is umbilical vein catheterisation (UVC), where cleanliness measures can be compromised. Treatment options for omphalitis include antibiotics, debridement, and supportive care. Sadly, the fatality rate in such cases is high.

This report concerns a premature female baby who was admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit after her birth at 34 weeks of gestation. UVC was performed, which led to abnormal changes in the skin around her umbilicus. Further tests revealed she had omphalitis and was treated with antibiotics and supportive care. Unfortunately, her condition worsened quickly, and she was diagnosed with necrotising fasciitis, which ultimately resulted in her death. This report provides details about the patient's symptoms, course of illness, and treatment for necrotising fasciitis.

### What to do when babies turn blue: Beyond the basic brief resolved unexplained event [^113MTUp6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The term "brief resolved unexplained event" was created to replace "apparent life-threatening event", narrowing the definition and providing evidence-based guidelines for management. The emphasis is placed on using clinical clues to classify patients as low risk or exclude them from the categorization altogether. Infants who meet low-risk classification can be briefly observed in the emergency department and be discharged home. Infants who demonstrate elements suggestive of a specific etiology should be evaluated and treated accordingly. Patients who demonstrate no specific findings yet who are high risk should be evaluated for the most common etiologies of apneic events and be admitted.

### Early planned removal of umbilical venous catheters to prevent infection in newborn infants [^115j5PKx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Lengthy duration of use may be a risk factor for umbilical venous catheter-associated bloodstream infection in newborn infants. Early planned removal of umbilical venous catheters (UVCs) is recommended to reduce the incidence of infection and associated morbidity and mortality.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effectiveness of early planned removal of UVCs (up to two weeks after insertion) versus an expectant approach or a longer fixed duration in preventing bloodstream infection and other complications in newborn infants. Subgroup analyses were performed by gestational age at birth and prespecified planned duration of UVC placement.

- **Search methods**: The standard Cochrane Neonatal search strategy was used, including electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Maternity & Infant Care Database (until May 2017), as well as conference proceedings and previous reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared effects of early planned removal of UVCs (up to two weeks after insertion) versus an expectant approach or a longer fixed duration in preventing bloodstream infection and other complications in newborn infants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently undertook data extraction. Treatment effects were analyzed and reported using risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.

### Sacrococcygeal teratoma presenting with vaginal discharge and polyp in an infant [^111j28TB]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Sacrococcygeal teratoma is the most common solid tumor in neonates. With improved technology, 50%-70% of cases can be diagnosed antenatally during routine ultrasound screenings. If not diagnosed antenatally, clinical findings at birth are distinct in most cases, including a palpable or visible mass.

- **Case**: We report an unusual case of a 1-year-old girl who presented with persistent vaginal discharge, leading to the diagnosis of a mucosal polypoid lesion of the vagina. This ultimately revealed a hidden sacrococcygeal teratoma.

- **Summary and conclusion**: We suggest a thorough investigation of all infants who present with purulent discharge and a vaginal mass. Sacrococcygeal teratoma should routinely be considered as a differential diagnosis.

### Umbilical cord antiseptics for preventing sepsis and death among newborns [^114oZFge]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The umbilical cord is a structure made of blood vessels and connective tissue that connects the baby and placenta in utero. It is cut after birth, separating the mother and her baby both physically and symbolically. Omphalitis is defined as an infection of the umbilical cord stump. Tracking of bacteria along the umbilical vessels may lead to septicaemia, which can result in neonatal morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of the application of antimicrobials on a newborn's umbilical cord versus routine care for preventing morbidity and mortality in hospital and community settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register as of 1 October 2012. Additionally, we searched LILACS from 1982 to 11 October 2012 and HERDIN NeON in October 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, cluster-randomized, and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing topical cord care with no topical care, as well as comparisons between different forms of care.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, evaluated trial quality, and subsequently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

- **Main results**: The search identified 77 trials, and we included 34 trials in the review, involving 69,338 babies. Five studies are awaiting classification, and there are two ongoing community trials. Included studies were conducted in both developed and developing countries. Among the 34 included trials, three were large, cluster-randomized trials.

### Meloxicam [^111nQ3P2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There are no studies on the effects of meloxicam capsules during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including meloxicam, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

- **Premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus**: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

- **Oligohydramnios/neonatal renal impairment**: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy as being associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.

Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group, limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure, and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing definitive conclusions.

### Amnioinfusion for potential or suspected umbilical cord compression in labour [^114URq32]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Amnioinfusion aims to prevent or relieve umbilical cord compression during labour by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of amnioinfusion for potential or suspected umbilical cord compression on maternal and perinatal outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register as of 31 October 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials comparing amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion in women with babies at risk of umbilical cord compression during labour.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The original review had one author only (Justus Hofmeyr (GJH)). For this update, two authors (GJH and T. Lawrie) assessed 13 additional trial reports for eligibility and quality. We extracted data and checked for accuracy.

- **Main results**: We have included 19 studies, with all but two studies having fewer than 200 participants. Transcervical amnioinfusion for potential or suspected umbilical cord compression was associated with the following reductions: overall caesarean section (13 trials, 1493 participants; average risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.83); fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations (seven trials, 1006 participants; average RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74); Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (12 trials, 1804 participants; average RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72); meconium below the vocal cords (three trials, 674 participants; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92); postpartum endometritis (six trials, 767 participants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.81) and maternal hospital stay.

### Impact of 4.0% chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord on mortality and omphalitis among newborns of Sylhet, Bangladesh: Design of a community-based cluster randomized trial [^113uHRyn]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). High credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends dry cord care for newborns; however, this recommendation may not be optimal in low-resource settings where most births occur in unclean environments, and infections account for up to half of neonatal deaths. A previous trial in Nepal indicated that umbilical cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine could substantially reduce mortality and omphalitis risk, but policy changes await additional community-based data.

- **Methods**: The Projahnmo Chlorhexidine study was a three-year, cluster-randomized, community-based trial aimed at assessing the impact of three cord care regimens on neonatal mortality and omphalitis. Women were recruited mid-pregnancy, received a basic package of maternal and neonatal health promotion messages, and were followed to pregnancy outcome. Newborns were visited at home by local village-based workers, with areas randomized to either 1) single- or 2) 7-day cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine, or 3) promotion of dry cord care as recommended by WHO. All mothers received basic messages about hand-washing, clean cord cutting, and avoiding harmful home-based applications to the cord. Death within 28 days and omphalitis were the primary outcomes, monitored directly through home visits by community health workers on days 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 28 after birth.

- **Discussion**: Due to report in early 2010, the Projahnmo Chlorhexidine Study examines the impact of multiple or single chlorhexidine cleansing of the cord on neonatal mortality and omphalitis among newborns of rural Sylhet District, Bangladesh.

### Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus presenting as an umbilical mass in the newborn: Characteristic prenatal sonographic findings and the diagnostic benefit of postnatal cystography [^113t5qFj]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Bladder prolapse through a patent urachus is rare. We present a newborn with an unusual exophytic, erythematous umbilical mass. Voiding cystography readily demonstrated continuity of the bladder dome with the umbilical mass, confirming bladder prolapse through a patent urachus. The diagnosis of bladder prolapse was rapidly made in a second newborn with similar imaging and clinical findings and confirmed by cystography. We discuss the embryology of this condition, including the association with a vesico-allantoic cyst in utero. Pre- and postnatal images are presented. The use of cystography in diagnosis is emphasized.

### Umbilical cord-care practices in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review [^111SjuDs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Findings from this review suggest that documentation of cord-care practices is not consistent throughout low- and middle-income countries. Given the heterogeneity of practices described in the literature, it is unclear if data from one country in a region also pertains to other surrounding countries and/or nearby ethnic groups. Overall, however, existing literature depicts a firm tradition of umbilical cord care in every culture. The desire to take some action to address the newly cut umbilical cord seems to be a strong human desire.

Participants in several studies noted that adhering to dry cord care was very difficult. For example, in Ghana, there was a belief that applying nothing to the cord would delay separation, cause discomfort, and potentially cause death for the infant by preventing the sore from healing and causing a sickness in the stomach. In Uganda, the practice of dry cord care was noted as difficult to follow as it delays the cord separation and the return of the mother to chores. This desire to actively care for a newborn could be utilized as a trigger for behavior change. For example, as applied in the Health Belief Model, knowledge of effective cord care (i.e. product, application procedure, number of days to use, number of times/day to apply) could function as a "cue to action" to allow caretakers to act positively.

This review has limitations. Reporting is not global in nature, as the review was limited to sources published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Few of the studies conducted have been in-depth, qualitative analyses.

### Impact of umbilical cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine on time to cord separation among newborns in southern Nepal: a cluster-randomized, community-based trial [^116DVzVQ]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Within a community-based, cluster-randomized study investigating the effects of 4.0% chlorhexidine on omphalitis and mortality risk, we aimed to describe the distribution of times to separation and the impact of topical chlorhexidine treatment on cord-separation times.

Between November 2002 and March 2005, 15,123 infants were randomly assigned within communities in southern Nepal to receive one of the following three cord-care regimens: cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine, cleansing with soap and water, or dry cord care. In intervention clusters, field workers cleansed the cord in the home on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after birth. Newborns were monitored throughout the newborn period for signs of omphalitis, and the time to cord separation was noted. Separation times were compared across treatment groups, while the risk of cord infection and a range of infant and household characteristics were assessed for their relationships to separation time.

The mean separation time was shorter in dry cord care (4.24 days) and soap/water (4.25 days) clusters than in chlorhexidine clusters (5.32 days), indicating a mean difference of 1.08 days. Cords of infants who received chlorhexidine were 3.6 times more likely to separate after 7 days. Separation time was not associated with omphalitis. However, home-delivered topical antiseptics, facility-based births, and birth attendant hand-washing were associated with greater likelihoods of cord separation after 7 days of age.

In this setting, the umbilical cord separated more rapidly than observed in hospital-based studies, though the impact of chlorhexidine was significant.

### A case of appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma which presented as painless purulent umbilical discharge [^112y9ZTQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old obese, diabetic woman presented with a one-day history of purulent umbilical discharge. She was vitally stable and afebrile. Abdominal examination revealed a full abdomen with purulent discharge from the umbilicus, along with swelling, erythema, and induration surrounding the umbilicus. Lab tests were normal. The initial impression was an abdominal wall abscess. Ultrasound showed a subcutaneous fluid collection. A non-contrast CT scan revealed the collection and an abdominal wall defect at the umbilicus.

On exploration of the abscess cavity, there were two defects (umbilical and supraumbilical), with the appendix protruding through the umbilical defect and a part of the small bowel and omentum adherent to the other defect. A wash was given, and the bowel and omentum were released, followed by an appendectomy. Histopathology revealed a mucinous cystadenoma with periappendicitis. We would like to highlight the rare occurrence of an appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma in such a clinical presentation.

### Topical umbilical cord care for prevention of infection and neonatal mortality [^115QciGz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical cord care often varies, reflecting community or health worker beliefs. We undertook a review of evidence on topical umbilical cord care. Study quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, and a meta-analysis was conducted for comparable trials. Available moderate- to high-quality evidence indicates that cord cleansing with 4% chlorhexidine may reduce the risk of neonatal mortality and sepsis (omphalitis) in low-resource settings.

### Umbilical cord milking and delayed cord clamping for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NqByG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

- **Receipt of treatment for hypoglycaemia during initial hospital stay**: Delayed cord clamping (DCC) may not reduce the receipt of treatment for hypoglycaemia during the initial hospital stay (RR 0.14, 95% CI: 0.01 to 2.68, p = 0.19). One study of women with gestational diabetes who gave birth to term infants (> 37 weeks gestation) reported that no infants in the DCC group (cord clamping 60 seconds after birth, n = 40) required treatment (defined as glucose infusion) for hypoglycaemia, compared to three infants in the early cord clamping (ECC) group (cord clamped as early as possible, n = 40). This evidence was graded as low certainty.

- **Severity of hypoglycaemia**: The same study reported that 0/40 infants in the DCC group had severe hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 1.4 mmol/l), compared to 2/40 (5%) in the ECC group. This evidence was graded as low certainty. DCC may not reduce the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.01 to 4.04, p = 0.29).

- **Breastfeeding at discharge**: DCC may result in little to no difference in breastfeeding at discharge (5 studies, 1,564 infants, RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.09, p = 0.14, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence).

- **Neurodevelopmental impairment**: Data from two studies involving 1,448 infants suggest that DCC results in little to no difference in neurodevelopmental impairment at 12–24 months follow-up (RR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.04, p = 0.11, I² = 0%).

### Umbilical cord management in newborn resuscitation [^114ZsAR4]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

At birth, blood continues to flow from the mother to the baby through the intact umbilical cord. This continuum of fetal-placental circulation, now taking place between the placenta and the newborn infant, has been termed "placental transfusion". It enables the redistribution of blood between the placenta and the baby. There is usually a net flow into the baby, which appears to play a role in expanding pulmonary blood volume.

Ample clinical evidence has shown that uninterrupted placental transfusion, as supported by the practice of deferred umbilical cord clamping (DCC), reduces death, especially in preterm babies who do not require resuscitation at birth, i.e. those born in "good condition". In an individual patient data meta-analysis (48 trials, 6,367 babies < 37 weeks' gestational age), DCC compared to immediate clamping reduced death before discharge by almost a third (odds ratio [OR] 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.91). Accepted clinical practice, therefore, is to defer cord clamping in stable term and preterm infants whenever possible. International newborn resuscitation guidelines recommend at least 60 seconds of DCC.

Moreover, in a subset of the recent individual patient data meta-analysis (47 trials, 6,094 babies), deferring cord clamping beyond 120 seconds further reduced the odds of death (OR 0.31, CI 0.11–0.80). We speculate these recent insights will be considered in the next edition of the resuscitation guidelines.

### Umbilical endometriosis mistaken for a keloid in a premenopausal woman of Caribbean descent [^117TE7kn]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is defined as endometrial tissue located outside the uterine cavity. Common locations for endometriosis include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum. It is fairly common, affecting as many as 1% to 5% of reproductive-age women. The condition typically presents with a triad of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia, characterized by cyclical pain that fluctuates with the patient's menstrual cycle. Endometriosis is often associated with infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Although the spread of endometrial implants to extrapelvic organs, such as the lung and skin, is less common, it occurs in an estimated 12% to 34% of patients.

Umbilical endometriosis represents a rare subtype of cutaneous endometriosis. The greatest risk factor for developing cutaneous endometriosis is a history of abdominal or pelvic surgery, including cesarean section, laparoscopy, amniocentesis, abortion, and inguinal hernia repairs. In many cases of umbilical endometriosis, the umbilicus had served as a site for trocar placement. Additionally, cases of spontaneous umbilical endometriosis are reported. It is hypothesized that the umbilicus, even in the absence of iatrogenic manipulation, represents a physiologic scar that may support the development of ectopic endometrial tissue. Alternatively, metaplasia of local tissue or activation and differentiation of precursor cells may explain the formation of endometrial tissue. It remains to be elucidated if additional factors in the local tissue environment participate in the development and propagation of endometriosis.

### The crying SIGN: The winking umbilical cord [^113ucoR7]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A preterm baby girl, born at 34 weeks gestation and displaying features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, was noted to have a relatively large umbilical stump. No fetal abnormalities had been detected on an anatomy scan at 28 weeks, with only mild polyhydramnios and macrosomia observed during a 32-week ultrasound scan. Although there was no obvious omphalocele, clinical assessment of the umbilical cord revealed an abdominal wall defect. Bowel protruded into the umbilicus when the infant cried, in keeping with an abdominal wall defect.

- **Elevated α-fetoprotein**: Found to be elevated.
- **Surgical consultation**: Advised conservative management.

Subsequently, detachment of the umbilical cord occurred one week post-discharge, and a large umbilical hernia persists. Genetic analysis confirmed a diagnosis of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

### Umbilical cord milking and delayed cord clamping for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111q9fo2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

- **Secondary outcomes**:

	- **Admission to neonatal intensive care unit**: The evidence suggests that umbilical cord milking (UCM) may result in little to no difference in admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (3 studies, 336 infants, RR = 1.22, CI: 0.37–4.08, p = 0.74, I² = 0%).

	- **Neurodevelopmental impairment**: Evidence from two studies suggests that UCM does not reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment at 18–26 months (196 infants, RR = 2.16, CI: 0.73 to 6.37, p = 0.16, I² = 0%). A further five studies assessed the effect of UCM on neurodevelopmental outcomes at various ages, but meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneous nature of the assessment methods and outcome interpretation. Of the five studies, one reported statistically significantly improved motor outcome after UCM at 18–22 months age. The remaining four studies reported no difference in developmental outcomes between the intervention and control groups at 12 months, 22–26 months, 36 months, and 2 and 3.5 years.

	- **Neonatal mortality**: In the 11 studies that reported neonatal mortality data, 76 out of 1,378 infants died before discharge. The evidence suggests that UCM results in little to no difference in neonatal mortality (RR = 0.79, CI: 0.44 to 1.41, p = 0.42, I² = 27%).

	- **Length of hospital stay**: Evidence from eight studies suggests that UCM may result in little to no difference.

### Recognising serious umbilical cord anomalies [^116ixtY1]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical vessel catheterisation is a common intervention in neonatal care. Many complications are recognised, some of which are life-threatening. We report the case of a term neonate who was compromised at birth following antepartum haemorrhage with evidence of multiorgan ischaemic injury. Following resuscitation and umbilical vessel catheterisation, she developed pneumoperitoneum. At laparotomy, a patent vitellointestinal duct was identified and resected. Intestinal perforation was found in the duct wall, most plausibly explained by the unintentional catheterisation of the duct via the umbilicus. Learning to recognise umbilical cord anomalies, such as a patent vitellointestinal duct, can be simple and could prevent potentially serious complications.

### Necrotizing funisitis and calcification of umbilical vein: Case report and review [^111tgVS6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Necrotizing funisitis (NF) is a rare, chronic stage of funisitis, a severe inflammation of the umbilical cord and an important risk factor for fetal adverse outcomes. NF is characterized by yellow-white bands running parallel to the umbilical blood vessels. These bands consist of inflammatory cells, necrotic debris, and calcium deposits. Calcification is visible in ultrasonography, which makes it possible to suspect NF when umbilical vascular wall calcification is detected by prenatal ultrasonography.

- **Case presentation**: Ultrasonography revealed calcification of the umbilical venous wall in an expectant 31-year-old woman who was gravida 1, para 0. The woman required an emergency cesarean section because of fetal distress and suspected umbilical cord torsion at 31 weeks gestation. The root of the umbilical cord was quite fragile and broke during the operation. The pathological results on the placenta showed histologic chorioamnionitis and NF. The infant was diagnosed with neonatal sepsis and acidosis after delivery but was discharged without severe complications following a one-month hospitalization that included antibiotic and supportive therapy.

- **Conclusion**: NF is a rare and severe inflammation of the umbilical cord. Umbilical vascular wall calcification discovered in prenatal ultrasonography is diagnostically helpful.

### Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping and other strategies to influence placental transfusion at preterm birth on maternal and infant outcomes [^114kBvz5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) have poorer outcomes than infants at term, particularly if born before 32 weeks. Early cord clamping has been standard practice over many years, enabling quick transfer of the infant to neonatal care. Delayed clamping allows blood flow between the placenta, umbilical cord, and baby to continue, which may aid transition. Keeping the baby at the mother's side enables neonatal care with the cord intact, and this, along with delayed clamping, may improve outcomes. Umbilical cord milking (UCM) is proposed for increasing placental transfusion when immediate care for the preterm baby is needed. This Cochrane Review is a further update of a review first published in 2004 and updated in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects on infants born at less than 37 weeks' gestation, and their mothers, of: 1) delayed cord clamping (DCC) compared with early cord clamping (ECC), both with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping; 2) DCC with immediate neonatal care with cord intact compared with ECC with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping; 3) DCC with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping compared with UCM; and 4) UCM compared with ECC with immediate neonatal care after cord clamping.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register.

### Knowledge gaps in optimal umbilical cord management at birth [^111DZdVq]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Low credibility.

In 2014, the World Health Organization recommended providing placental blood to all newborn infants by waiting for at least one minute before clamping the umbilical cord. Mounting evidence supports providing a placental transfusion at the time of birth for all infants. The optimal time before clamping and cutting the umbilical cord is still not yet known, and debate exists around other cord management issues. The newborn's transition phase from intra- to extra-uterine life and the effects of blood volume on the many necessary adaptations are understudied. How best to support these adaptations guides our suggested research questions. Parents' perceptions of enrolling their unborn infant into a study play important roles in the conduct of such trials. This article aims to address these topics and suggest research questions for further studies.

### Risk factors and outcomes associated with a short umbilical cord [^114RtgbV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

To identify risk factors and outcomes associated with a short umbilical cord, we conducted a population-based case-control study using linked Washington State birth certificate-hospital discharge data for singleton live births from 1987 to 1998. The study assessed the association between maternal, pregnancy, delivery, and infant characteristics and short umbilical cord. Cases (n = 3565) were infants diagnosed with a short umbilical cord, while controls (n = 14260) were randomly selected from among births without a diagnosis of short umbilical cord.

- **Results**:
	- **Maternal factors**: Case mothers were less likely to be overweight (body mass index 25 or more, odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 0.8) and more likely to be primiparous (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.3, 1.6).
	- **Infant factors**: Case infants were more likely to be female (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.2, 1.4), have a congenital malformation (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4, 1.8), and be small for their gestational age (risk ratio [RR] 1.6; 95% CI 1.4, 1.9).
	- **Complications**: A short cord was associated with increased risk for maternal labor and delivery complications, including retained placenta (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2, 2.3) and operative vaginal delivery (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.3, 1.5). Adverse fetal and infant outcomes in cases included fetal distress (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.6, 2.1) and death within the first year of life among term infants (RR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2, 4.6).

In conclusion, modifiable risk factors associated with the development of a short cord were not identified. Case mothers and infants are more likely to experience labor and delivery complications. Term case infants had a two-fold increased risk.

### Impact of 4.0% chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord on mortality and omphalitis among newborns of Sylhet, Bangladesh: Design of a community-based cluster randomized trial [^116RkSYB]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization recommends dry cord care for newborns, but this recommendation may not be optimal in low-resource settings where most births take place in an unclean environment and infections account for up to half of neonatal deaths. A previous trial in Nepal indicated that umbilical cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine could substantially reduce mortality and omphalitis risk, but policy changes await additional community-based data.

- **Methods**: The Projahnmo Chlorhexidine study was a three-year, cluster-randomized, community-based trial conducted to assess the impact of three cord care regimens on neonatal mortality and omphalitis. Women were recruited mid-pregnancy, received a basic package of maternal and neonatal health promotion messages, and were followed to pregnancy outcome. Newborns were visited at home by local village-based workers whose areas were randomized to either 1) single- or 2) 7-day cord cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine, or 3) promotion of dry cord care as recommended by WHO. All mothers received basic messages regarding hand-washing, clean cord cutting, and avoidance of harmful home-based applications to the cord. Death within 28 days and omphalitis were the primary outcomes; these were monitored directly through home visits by community health workers on days 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 28 after birth.

- **Discussion**: Due to report in early 2010, the Projahnmo Chlorhexidine Study examines the impact of multiple or single chlorhexidine cleansing of the cord on neonatal mortality and omphalitis among newborns of rural Sylhet District, Bangladesh.

### Belly button piercings: A saving grace? A patent urachus presenting in a 17-year-old girl [^113SK299]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 17-year-old girl who presented to the accident and emergency department with dysuria and foul-smelling, bloody discharge from her umbilicus. The definitive diagnosis was that of a patent urachus, which is a fistulous communication between the bladder and the umbilicus, usually diagnosed in early infancy. The incidence of a patent urachus is approximately 1 in 70,000 in the general population. It is highly likely that the removal of a recent belly button piercing resulted in the acute presentation by completing the fistulous tract to the skin. This case is of clinical relevance as the diagnosis was missed 18 months prior with a milder presentation. The recommended treatment option is surgical excision due to the potential risk of malignant change, with urachal adenocarcinoma accounting for 0.3% of all bladder cancers.

### Nipple discharge: Current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches [^113vy1vy]. Cancer Treatment Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Among other possible causes, nipple discharge can result from prolactinoma, intraductal papilloma, fibrocystic breast changes, ductal carcinoma in situ, hyperprolactinemia, lymphocytic mastitis, suppurative mastitis, breast abscess, Paget's disease of the nipple, breast cancer, duct ectasia of the breast, hypothyroidism, and pregnancy. In addition, nipple discharge can be caused by medications such as norgestimate/ethinylestradiol, venlafaxine, danazol, desogestrel/ethinylestradiol, and norethindrone/ethinylestradiol.

### Infected umbilical urachal sinus in a neonate [^117E9YW7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The urachus is an embryonic tube that connects the upper portion of the bladder to the umbilicus and normally obliterates during embryonic development, forming the median umbilical ligament. Incomplete obliteration of the urachus can result in various anomalies such as congenital patent urachus, umbilical urachal sinus, vesico-urachal diverticulum, and urachal cyst. We report a term neonate who presented with swelling and discharge from the umbilical region, which, through clinical evaluation and radiological investigations, was diagnosed as an infected umbilical urachal sinus.

### A febrile infant with abdominal erythema and irritability [^111F6ikW]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: During operative exploration, the periumbilical subcutaneous tissue and surrounding skin were inflamed and friable. The umbilical stalk was woody and friable, suggesting omphalitis. No umbilical hernia with strangulated viscera was identified; however, an intraperitoneal abscess was found abutting the underside of the anterior abdominal wall at the base of the umbilical stalk. Extensive debridement of all associated fibrinopurulent tissues revealed a perforated Meckel's diverticulum approximately 10 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve abutting the abscess cavity. A small defect at the base of the umbilical stalk, where the abscess had eroded through the anterior abdominal wall, was repaired. The pathology report confirmed a Meckel's diverticulum with gastric heterotopia, transmural inflammation, focal necrosis, and acute serositis.

- **Postoperative care**: For sepsis, the patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, receiving ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg) daily and metronidazole (10 mg/kg) every 8 hours concurrently for 5 days, followed by metronidazole alone for an additional 6 days. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth, and abscess cultures were not obtained. Total parenteral nutrition was required for 7 days, after which enteral feeds were initiated and well tolerated. The patient was discharged in good condition, and one year from surgery, the patient is growing and developing appropriately.

- **Discussion of case and literature**: A ruptured Meckel's diverticulum in infancy is rare, as is omphalitis occurring outside of the usual context.

### Maternal and umbilical cord blood lactate for predicting perinatal death: a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial [^113pfvHp]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

We conducted a prospective cohort study, where women with obstructed labour were consecutively recruited into the clinical trial at the time of diagnosis. This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Preoperatively, half of the patients received an infusion of sodium bicarbonate (intervention arm) and the other half received no sodium bicarbonate (control arm). The mother-baby pairs were followed up to the 7th day postpartum.

This is a secondary analysis of data from a study performed in the labour ward of Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in Eastern Uganda between July 2018 and September 2019. The hospital serves a population of about four million people from 16 districts and one city. Mbale Hospital is the main referral center for four district hospitals and ten health sub-districts in and around the Mount Elgon zone. Annually, 12,000 deliveries are conducted, and about 600 of these are diagnosed with obstructed labour.

Participants were mother-baby pairs that participated in the randomized controlled trial to establish the effect of sodium bicarbonate on maternal and perinatal outcomes among women with obstructed labour at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital.

- **Inclusion criteria**: We included patients with obstructed labour carrying singleton term pregnancies (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) in cephalic presentation, with a live baby at enrolment.

- **Exclusion criteria**: We excluded patients without a fetal heart at the time of enrollment and patients with other obstetric emergencies such as antepartum haemorrhage.

### Umbilical cord bilirubin as a predictor of neonatal jaundice: A retrospective cohort study [^114Ea5us]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia is one of the most common causes of admission to the hospital during the neonatal period among term babies across various settings. The prevention of serious complications relies on effective early treatment, yet clinically significant jaundice may not manifest until one or more days postpartum. The practice of promoting early discharge after delivery may lead to delays in the recognition and initiation of medical therapy. Identifying biomarkers that can be measured within a few hours following birth, and that robustly predict incident jaundice, would be a significant advancement.

Estimation of umbilical cord blood bilirubin (UCB) at delivery is practical, cost-effective, and non-invasive. It could be easily integrated with the trend toward routine umbilical cord blood biochemical evaluation practiced in many centers. Several previous studies have examined the potential utility of UCB estimation in predicting subsequent hyperbilirubinaemia. The results have been inconsistent, and a review by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that it was not a useful index of risk.

In this study, we leveraged the fact that at our institution, UCB estimation is routine. We conducted a retrospective analysis to assess the potential utility of arterial umbilical cord bilirubin (aUCB) in predicting clinically significant hyperbilirubinaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia due to neonatal haemolytic disease.

### Surgical retrieval of transected umbilical vein catheter in an extremely preterm neonate [^1133Ptdh]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Umbilical catheters are used in the care of critically ill neonates for intravenous treatment. It is generally considered a safe procedure, although complications can occur. Of these, catheter breakage and intravenous migration are rare but potentially life-threatening events. Due to the low frequency with which these events occur, obtaining detailed descriptions of removal techniques can pose a challenge. Here, we describe a case of a broken umbilical vein catheter and the surgical retrieval of the retained fragment. We also present a thorough literature search of cases involving broken umbilical catheters and the methods by which they were removed.

### A woman with umbilical inflammation continuing for 9 years after delivery [^114ywxnN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

We report the case of a woman who, after her second pregnancy 9 years ago, experienced malodorous leakage from the umbilicus and abdominal pain despite various treatments. Bacterial culture revealed growth of hemolytic Streptococcus C. The cotton-tipped swab could be introduced 6 cm into the narrow, tender opening. There were no signs of fistula or other abnormalities.

### Impact of 4.0% chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord on mortality and omphalitis among newborns of Sylhet, Bangladesh: Design of a community-based cluster randomized trial [^113PXXit]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Of the annual 3.7 million global neonatal deaths, almost all (99%) occur in developing countries, and one-third to one-half are attributed to infections such as sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, omphalitis, tetanus, and diarrhea. In settings where home delivery is common and attendance by skilled personnel is low, many babies are born in unhygienic conditions, and infections of the umbilical cord stump are common. Exposure of the freshly cut umbilical cord stump to pathogens on the cutting instrument, on the hands of caretakers, or elsewhere in the environment leads to local cord infections (omphalitis) that may progress to systemic infection and death. Alternatively, during the period immediately following birth, while the vessels of the umbilical cord remain patent, direct exposure to the bloodstream via the cord may lead to systemic infection without any visible signs of local cord infection.

### Sonographic features of umbilical catheter-related complications [^114tcLmS]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Umbilical catheters are commonly used in the neonatal period for blood sampling or for administering medication or parenteral nutrition. The position of the catheter is usually confirmed with radiography. However, many complications associated with the use of umbilical catheters, such as liver collections from extravasation or vascular thrombosis, are not apparent on radiographs but can be easily diagnosed with ultrasound. This pictorial review illustrates the sonographic findings of complications that should be excluded in the sick neonate with an indwelling catheter.

### Discharge criteria for the term newborn [^1132pT6C]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The birthing process represents a traumatic eviction from the warm, quiet womb with a constant supply of food to the cold, bright world with nothing to eat. Tremendous physiological strains are suddenly placed on the newborn infant. Within a few days, the neonate must transition successfully to extrauterine life, and the family must be prepared for the care of their newborn at home. This article reviews the physiological and social issues that face the newborn and mother, discusses the specific issues created by early discharge, and provides suggested criteria for the timing of discharge of the well-term neonate.

### Primary actinomycosis mimicking urachal carcinoma [^1133WM6T]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

We report a case of urachal actinomycosis that presented with a progressively enlarging infraumbilical mass associated with umbilical discharge. Computed tomography revealed an extraperitoneal mass involving the dome of the bladder. The possible diagnosis included a malignant urachal neoplasm or chronic inflammatory mass. Partial cystectomy and excision of the mass were performed. The pathologic examination revealed actinomycosis. The patient was treated with a 6-month course of antibiotics. No recurrence was noted 1 year postoperatively.

### Omphalomesenteric duct remnants: Umbilical versus umbilical cord lesions [^113BSdHC]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The omphalomesenteric duct is an embryologic connection between the digestive tract and yolk sac, which typically involutes by the time of birth. Failure of the obliteration process can result in omphalomesenteric duct remnants. We present two cases of children with such remnants: one with an umbilical polyp requiring traditional excisional therapy and one more unusual case of an umbilical cord cyst resolving spontaneously without intervention. The differential diagnosis, which includes urachal remnants and umbilical pyogenic granulomas, is discussed, along with management and special considerations that practitioners should be aware of when treating pediatric umbilical and umbilical cord lesions.

### Prolonged cord separation in a newborn: A rare case of an unusual epithelialised umbilical cord [^113TMcjW]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A female full-term neonate, accompanied by her parents, was referred to the pediatric surgery department the day after birth. She presented with a 9 cm pathological umbilical cord, of which the first 7 cm was red and wet, with areas of ulceration, necrosis, and healing. The patient never experienced a fever. Abdominal palpation showed no umbilical hernia, and an abdominal Doppler ultrasound was normal. After several days of disinfection with a biseptine antiseptic solution, and with monthly follow-ups, most of the umbilical cord eventually fell off, leaving a 4 cm length navel consisting of 2 cm of excessive skin and 2 cm of mucous tissue. The lesion was surgically excised when the patient was 6 months old. She was discharged on postoperative day one. Histology results confirmed the diagnosis of an epithelialised umbilical cord. The 1-month follow-up was uneventful.

### Nonoperative management of a patent urachus [^114hpuEz]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Patent urachus accounts for 10% to 15% of all reported urachal abnormalities in the literature. Treatment in the past has relied on immediate surgery. Conservative therapy with bladder catheter drainage, resulting in spontaneous closure, has not been described. We report a case of patent urachus in a 6-day-old infant who presented with urine drainage from the umbilicus. Radiographic studies confirmed a patent urachus. One week of urethral catheterization resulted in spontaneous closure of the patent urachus. This case suggests that initial treatment should consist of urethral catheterization for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by repeat voiding cystourethrogram. If the patent urachus still persists, one should proceed to surgical correction.

### A review of studies with chlorhexidine applied directly to the umbilical cord [^111JoSpM]. American Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Infection-related neonatal mortality due to omphalitis in developing country home births is an important public health problem. Three cluster randomized trials of 4% chlorhexidine applied to the umbilical cord stump from once to multiple times in the days following a home birth have evaluated this intervention compared with other types of cord care on the development of omphalitis and neonatal mortality. Each of the three studies showed significant reductions in either omphalitis, neonatal mortality, or both, with the 4% chlorhexidine. However, the optimal dosing schedule remains uncertain. Although further studies are needed to clarify this issue, from the three studies, it is now clear that with a minimum of one application of 4% chlorhexidine to the umbilical cord stump following delivery, the incidence of omphalitis and neonatal mortality can be reduced, especially in preterm newborns. This intervention, which is safe, inexpensive, and requires minimal training and skill, should strongly be considered for adoption wherever home births occur.

### Laparoscopic repair of gastric perforation secondary to umbilical trocar insertion [^111arnGG]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

A postmenopausal woman was scheduled to undergo laparoscopic treatment of an 8-cm simple ovarian cyst. During abdominal entry, umbilical trocar insertion caused a gastric perforation that was diagnosed immediately and repaired laparoscopically. Following completion of the procedure, the patient was observed for 24 hours with a nasogastric tube in place and was discharged to home on the second postoperative day without further complications. The possibility of gastric distension and perforation is almost always present during laparoscopic abdominal entry. When perforation occurs, repair can be accomplished safely by laparoscopy.
