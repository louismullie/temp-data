## Question

CVD management in diabetes mellitus type 2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cardiovascular disease management in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk stratification and baseline assessment. Then, I should verify lifestyle interventions and their evidence base. Next, I will review glycemic targets and first-line pharmacotherapy. After that, I need to check the role of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists by comorbidity profile. Then, I will examine lipid, blood pressure, and antiplatelet strategies. I should also consider special populations and implementation barriers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and monitoring plan, making sure each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and outcome data.

> Let me first confirm the risk framework and baseline assessment, because everything downstream depends on it. I need to classify the patient as high or very high cardiovascular risk based on established ASCVD, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease, and I should calculate the 10-year ASCVD risk to guide intensity of therapy; I also need to check for risk enhancers such as family history, inflammatory markers, or subclinical atherosclerosis, and I should screen for CKD with eGFR and albuminuria since it modifies both drug choice and targets [^113Fo82z] [^111KuyA2] [^111w4xtU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about glycemia alone. I need to ensure a comprehensive, patient-centered foundation. Lifestyle therapy remains first-line: at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity, dietary patterns such as Mediterranean or DASH with attention to glycemic load and saturated fat reduction, weight loss to a BMI under 25 kg/m² when feasible, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation; I should double-check that structured diabetes self-management education is embedded because it improves outcomes and adherence, even though Look AHEAD did not show a direct mortality benefit, reinforcing that lifestyle is necessary but insufficient alone in high-risk T2DM [^114Ek7T6] [^1132jRiU] [^1111tfiL].

> Next, I should review glycemic targets and first-line pharmacotherapy. For most nonpregnant adults, an HbA1c target around 7% is reasonable, with tighter targets such as less than 6.5% considered in younger, newly diagnosed patients without cardiovascular disease and less stringent targets, even up to 8%, in older adults with comorbidities or limited life expectancy. Wait, let me verify that this aligns with ADA and ESC guidance, which it does, emphasizing individualization and avoidance of hypoglycemia, especially in the context of heart failure where a U-shaped mortality curve has been described [^113Fo82z] [^116xVkNw]. Metformin remains first-line unless contraindicated, and I should confirm that its cardiovascular neutrality and long-term legacy effect support its continued use early in the disease course [^113Fo82z] [^112ZX1SA].

> I will now examine the role of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, because this is where the paradigm has shifted. For patients with established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, I should initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit regardless of baseline HbA1c, given reductions in MACE, heart failure hospitalization, and renal outcomes; similarly, GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven cardiovascular benefit should be considered to reduce MACE and cardiovascular death, independent of HbA1c, and in many cases these agents can be layered with metformin and even combined when appropriate to maximize additive benefits, though I need to monitor for hypoglycemia if background therapy includes sulfonylureas or insulin [^1144ha62] [^111tL899] [^111qLezy] [^115ovf5a] [^115rHFfo].

> But wait, what if the patient has T2DM without established ASCVD but is at high risk. In that scenario, I should confirm that guidelines support considering SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists when the 10-year ASCVD risk is 10% or higher, as a strategy to reduce future events. I need to ensure shared decision-making here because absolute risk reduction and patient preferences vary, and I should also remember that some expert groups advocate early treat-to-benefit strategies incorporating these agents soon after diagnosis in appropriate candidates [^116hpbxk] [^113FzN5p].

> Let me think about lipid management next, because this is where large absolute risk reductions accrue. For adults aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes and additional ASCVD risk factors, I should initiate high-intensity statin to achieve at least a 50% LDL-C reduction and an LDL-C goal under 70 mg/dL; for those with established ASCVD, I should target LDL-C under 55 mg/dL with high-intensity statin and add ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor if goals are not met, and I should consider statins even in younger adults with diabetes and additional risk factors; I need to check for statin intolerance and consider bempedoic acid as an alternative in such cases [^1149brwY] [^113JnCdA] [^112fvXnr] [^112oTwGE] [^116Uam5r].

> I should confirm blood pressure targets and first-line agents. A reasonable target is under 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred, especially in the presence of albuminuria or CKD, and I need to ensure that therapy is titrated to goal using combination therapy as needed; let me verify that this aligns with ADA and hypertension guidance, which it does, emphasizing the outsized cardiovascular benefit of intensive blood pressure control relative to glycemia alone in T2DM [^113Fo82z] [^116vKU6o] [^115NAHmb].

> Now, antiplatelet therapy requires careful nuance. For secondary prevention, aspirin is indicated, but for primary prevention I should have a balanced discussion of modest ischemic benefit versus increased bleeding risk. ADA suggests considering aspirin 75 to 162 mg daily in patients at increased cardiovascular risk after shared decision-making, and I need to document the conversation and reassess bleeding risk periodically [^113v9gPX].

> Next, I should review special populations and comorbidities. In older adults, I need to avoid overly aggressive glycemic targets and prioritize symptomatic benefit and quality of life. In CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors and metformin are foundational down to eGFR 30, with GLP-1 receptor agonists considered for additional glycemic lowering and cardiovascular benefit. In heart failure, SGLT2 inhibitors are particularly beneficial and should be prioritized. For women, I should double-check for underuse of evidence-based therapies and actively address disparities. And for patients with established CAD, I should coordinate with cardiology on revascularization strategy and antiplatelet regimens, recognizing that CABG may be preferred over PCI in multivessel disease with diabetes [^1111tfiL] [^1117Xx3C] [^113oAaFM] [^112QbKHe].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation barriers and practical steps to close care gaps. Real-world data show persistent underutilization of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists despite robust benefits, so I need to employ team-based care, embed order sets, and use consultative or collaborative models between endocrinology, cardiology, primary care, pharmacy, and nursing; I should also screen for diabetes in cardiology clinics and vice versa, and leverage patient education to improve adherence and outcomes [^116oKr7v] [^115gsGoX] [^1168XTUA].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Start with risk stratification and comprehensive lifestyle therapy plus metformin unless contraindicated. If ASCVD, HF, or CKD are present, add an SGLT2 inhibitor and consider a GLP-1 receptor agonist regardless of HbA1c. If high risk without established ASCVD and 10-year risk is 10% or higher, consider adding an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist. Concurrently implement high-intensity statin therapy, blood pressure control to under 130/80 mmHg with ACE inhibitor or ARB, and individualized antiplatelet therapy. Reassess every 3 to 6 months for efficacy, safety, and adherence, and adjust the regimen to maintain a patient-centered, risk-reduction focus rather than a purely glycemic one [^111qLezy] [^1147EcfP] [^1149brwY] [^113Fo82z].

> Finally, I need to ensure the monitoring plan captures both cardiometabolic and renal outcomes. I should track HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL-C, weight, eGFR, and albuminuria at each visit, screen annually for retinopathy and foot disease, and reinforce lifestyle measures continuously. I should double-check that this cadence matches ADA Standards and that I am prepared to escalate therapy promptly if targets are not met, including adding PCSK9 inhibitors for LDL-C and intensifying antihypertensive regimens as tolerated [^113Fo82z] [^113JnCdA].

Management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) centers on **comprehensive risk reduction** [^113Fo82z] through lifestyle, blood pressure, lipid, and glycemic control, with **SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists** as first-line pharmacotherapies for patients with established ASCVD or high risk [^1147EcfP] [^1144ha62] [^111tL899]. Metformin remains foundational unless contraindicated [^1177bVo8], and **individualized HbA1c targets** are used to balance benefits and hypoglycemia risk [^116xVkNw]. Regular screening for CVD, CKD, and hypertension is essential, and a **multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach** improves outcomes [^115gsGoX].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions are foundational and should be **initiated and reinforced at every visit**:

- **Diet**: Emphasize Mediterranean, DASH, or plant-forward patterns; limit saturated fats, refined carbs, and sodium; use medical nutrition therapy [^1132jRiU] [^115NAHmb].
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise plus resistance training [^114Ek7T6].
- **Weight management**: Aim for 5–10% weight loss; consider bariatric surgery for BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities [^notfound].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^116qZT8W].

---

## Glycemic control

- **HbA1c targets**: Individualize; generally < 7.0%, ≤ 6.5% if early disease and low risk, and < 8.0% if older, frail, or with comorbidities [^116xVkNw].
- **First-line therapy**: Metformin unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or intolerance) [^1177bVo8].
- **Add-on therapy**: Use SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs with proven CV benefit for patients with established ASCVD or high risk, regardless of HbA1c [^1147EcfP] [^1144ha62] [^111tL899].
- **Avoidance**: Limit sulfonylureas and insulin secretagogues due to hypoglycemia and weight gain risks [^112ZX1SA].

---

## Blood pressure management

- **Target**: < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated; < 125/75 mmHg if albuminuria or CKD [^notfound].
- **First-line therapy**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs, especially with albuminuria or CKD [^113oAaFM].
- **Add-on therapy**: Thiazide-like diuretics, calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers as needed [^notfound].

---

## Lipid management

- **Statins**: High-intensity statins for ASCVD or high risk; moderate-intensity for others aged 40–75 years [^1149brwY] [^115o4amj].
- **LDL-C goals**: < 55 mg/dL for very high risk; < 70 mg/dL for high risk [^113JnCdA] [^1149brwY].
- **Add-on therapy**: Ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors if LDL-C goals not met [^113JnCdA].

---

## Antiplatelet therapy

Aspirin (75–162 mg/day) is recommended for **secondary prevention**. For **primary prevention**, consider aspirin only if age ≥ 50 years with additional risk factors and low bleeding risk [^113v9gPX].

---

## Screening and monitoring

Regular screening and monitoring are essential for **early detection and management**:

| **Risk factor** | **Screening frequency** |
|-|-|
| Blood pressure | Every visit |
| Lipid panel | Annually |
| HbA1c | At least twice yearly |
| Kidney function (eGFR, albuminuria) | Annually |
| ECG | Baseline and as indicated |
| Coronary calcium score | Consider in intermediate risk |

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **team-based approach** involving endocrinologists, cardiologists, primary care, dietitians, and pharmacists improves adherence and outcomes [^115gsGoX]. Patient education and shared decision-making are critical to success [^115gsGoX].

---

## Emerging therapies

SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalizations, and renal outcomes [^1117Xx3C]; GLP-1 RAs reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^113Zdmc2]; and PCSK9 inhibitors further reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular events when added to statins [^notfound].

---

Effective CVD management in T2DM requires **comprehensive risk reduction**, with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs as key therapies for high-risk patients, alongside lifestyle, blood pressure, and lipid control.

### Prevention of macrovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus: opportunities for intervention [^112QuGtf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Individuals with diabetes mellitus are at considerably higher risk for coronary artery disease compared with individuals without diabetes. In the United States, diabetes is the most prevalent factor putting patients at risk for coronary events. Intensive control of blood glucose has been demonstrated to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes, but this has yet to be proved in patients with type 2 diabetes. Aggressive management of established cardiovascular risk factors using blood pressure-lowering and lipid-lowering therapies (particularly the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins) has been conclusively shown to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes remain at residual excess risk compared with individuals without diabetes, such that there is still a need for novel therapeutic approaches. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease in diabetes beyond improving blood glucose control. Although the evidence regarding rosiglitazone is yet to mature, completed and ongoing clinical trials with pioglitazone suggest that this TZD may be a novel treatment for managing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. Addition of pioglitazone to existing therapy in high-risk patients with diabetes and atherosclerotic disease improves cardiovascular outcomes, and may be particularly beneficial for patients with previous myocardial infarction or stroke.

### Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes… [^115NAHmb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

There is accumulating evidence that the rigorous treatment of hypertension and other risk factors such as dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia considerably lessens the burden of CVD and renal disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. There is considerable evidence that strategies addressing diet and exercise reduce the development of diabetes and are an important component of treatment in persons who have established diabetes. There are also considerable data suggesting that the treatment strategies that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system have special benefits in patients with diabetes and may prevent the development of clinical diabetes in hypertensive patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Data from a recent study indicate that the control of systolic blood pressure, using a diuretic agent as part of antihypertensive therapy, reduces the risk of stroke and other CVD end points.

There is an increasing body of data from controlled clinical trials indicating that rigorous control of blood pressure to levels below the conventional control levels of less than 140/90 mm Hg markedly reduces CVD and stroke morbidity/mortality as well as development of ESRD in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 25–30 For. Furthermore, the relative benefit on CVD risk reduction was more powerful for intensive blood pressure reduction than for tight glucose control. The Hypertension Optimal Treatment study26 reported that in a diabetic subgroup, major CVD events were reduced by 51% in those randomized to a diastolic blood pressure goal of less than 80 mm Hg compared with a goal of less than 90 mm Hg. These data from the Syst-Eur trial are consistent with that of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program study, 28 in which elderly persons with type 2 diabetes derived more CVD reduction compared with those without diabetes.

In general, patients with diabetes in these clinical trials required more antihypertensive agents to achieve these more aggressive goals. 5, 29. An integral component of management of hypertension in patients with diabetes is the institution of lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes emphasizing diet and exercise have been shown to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in persons with impaired glucose tolerance. 41, 42 In addition to improving glycemic control, a diet that is high in fiber and potassium and lower in saturated refined carbohydrates and salt can improve the lipid profile and significantly lower blood pressure. 43 Thus, to address risk factors for CVD in patients with diabetes, institution of lifestyle intervention strategies for reducing risk in this population is important.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of CVD, glucose-lowering medications, CCS 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate the following options in adult patients with T2DM and either established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD:

- SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, hospitalization for HF or the composite of significant decline in eGFR, progression to end-stage kidney disease or kidney death

- GLP-1 receptor agonists to reduce the risk of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, and nonfatal stroke.

### Glycemia treatment strategies in the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes (ACCORD) trial [^115RCRd4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

There is an independent progressive epidemiologic relation between glycemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events; however, whether lowering glucose levels with currently available therapies can reduce CVD events remains unknown. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial is designed to answer this question in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In ACCORD, 10,251 patients with type 2 diabetes and other CVD risk factors or CVD were randomly allocated to intensive glycemic control, targeting a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level < 6%, or standard glycemic control, targeting an HbA1c level of 7.0%-7.9%. All participants are provided with diabetes education, glucose-monitoring equipment, and antidiabetic medications. All participants in the intensive glycemic control group are started on ≥ 2 classes of agents. Doses are intensified or a new medication class is added every month if HbA1c levels are ≥ 6% or if > 50% of premeal or postmeal capillary glucose readings are > 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or > 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), respectively. All drug combinations are permitted, and drugs are reduced only because of side effects or contraindications. Annual training, menus of approaches for intensification, regular electronic messaging, audits of achieved glycemia, and central feedback to sites support glycemic intensification strategies in intensive participants. In participants in the standard glycemic control group, therapy is intensified whenever HbA1c is ≥ 8%, and antihyperglycemic drugs that promote hypoglycemia (ie, insulin or insulin secretagogues) are reduced if HbA1c persistently decreases to < 7% in the setting of hypoglycemia. ACCORD addresses the hypothesis that aggressive glucose lowering prevents CVD events in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is focused on the levels of glycemia achieved using a variety of strategies, not on the specific therapies used. It will also provide information on how to safely approach near-normal levels of glucose control in clinical practice and evidence to support future clinical guidelines for diabetes management in older adults.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^112JRWZ1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

The recent American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes guideline mentioned glycaemia management in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); however, it did not cover the treatment approaches for patients with T2DM having a high risk of CVD, and treatment and screening approaches for CVDs in patients with concomitant T2DM. This consensus guideline undertakes the data obtained from all the cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) to propose approaches for the T2DM management in presence of CV comorbidities. For patients at high risk of CVD, metformin is the drug of choice to manage the T2DM to achieve a patient specific HbA1c target. In case of established CVD, a combination of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with proven CV benefits is recommended along with metformin, while for chronic kidney disease or heart failure, a sodium-glucose transporter proteins-2 inhibitor with proven benefit is advised. This document also summarises various screening and investigational approaches for the major CV events with their accuracy and specificity along with the treatment guidance to assist the healthcare professionals in selecting the best management strategies for every individual. Since lifestyle modification and management plays an important role in maintaining the effectiveness of the pharmacological therapies, authors of this consensus recommendation have also briefed on the patient-centric non-pharmacological management of T2DM and CVD.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists: impact on mortality in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease [^112QbKHe]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Research insights

What is currently known about this topic?

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease, yet remain underutilized in clinical practice.

What is the key research question?

What are the real-world treatment patterns and associated mortality outcomes among patients with T2D and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)?

What is new?
Using data from the large real-world CARdiovascular and DIABetes (CARDIAB) cohort, we identified a marked underutilization of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists among patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Lower treatment rates were particularly evident among women, older individuals, patients with non-coronary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and those lacking follow-up in specialized cardiology or diabetes clinics.
Both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with a significant survival benefit, with the greatest effect observed in patients treated with combination therapy.

How might this study influence clinical practice?
Our study highlights a pressing need for healthcare systems and policymakers to develop and implement strategies that enhance the adoption of these guideline-directed therapies.
Our findings support the consideration of dual therapy in appropriately selected high-risk patients.

### Cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: progress toward personalized management [^115Bp4Vf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current main targets for the control of glycemia, lipids and blood pressure levels in patients according to the most commonly used guidelines should be included as an individualized strategy to prevent CVD in T2DM (Tables 2, 6 and 7). Although the incidence and mortality rate of T2DM-related CVD have decreased, the prevalence and mortality rate of CVDs in patients with T2DM continues to rise, and most T2DM-related CVDs may be prevented by lifestyle modification and the use of adjunctive drugs. The notion of T2DM-related CVD care has transitioned from comprehensive medical intervention to precision diabetes therapy. For T2DM patients with established CVD, the GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and blood-pressure and lipid-lowering drugs provide an improved precision treatment approach.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: guidelines from KDIGO… [^1111tfiL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes.
- First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m² should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression.
- ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment should be maximized in patients who have diabetes with albuminuria and hypertension unless complicated by symptomatic hypotension, uncontrolled hyperkalemia, or more than a 30% increase in creatinine level. From the AFP Editors. Team-Based Care People with diabetes and CKD have high risks of CKD progression, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, which can be reduced with a comprehensive approach to lifestyle and risk factor management in combination with appropriate pharmacotherapy.

Optimal care includes primary care, cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, psychology, nutrition, and disease management nursing support. Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m² or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. The guidelines recommend treatment with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic goals despite use of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial effect in reducing cardiovascular events.

GLP-1 receptor agonist trials are safe with an eGFR as low as 15 mL per minute per 1.73 m². 1 Conflicts of interest are common in practice guidelines reviewed by AFP. I am pointing out these conflicts of interest because we usually do not accept authors with this level of potential for bias. We are confident that the authors fairly represented the guideline recommendations. The evidence to support the primary use of SGLT2 inhibitors is strong, with reductions in cardiovascular events, progression of CKD, and mortality.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^1143rpCc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and rationale

The global incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has quadrupled since 1980 and still escalating. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)-majorly coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), and stroke are the major cause of death and disability in patients with T2DM. An area where attention in particular is needed is patients with co-existing T2DM and HF. A recent data showed alarming progression in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in patients with heart failure (HF) and T2DM, compared to those with HF without T2DM. Although improved evidence-based treatment has led to improved survival, the 5-year mortality rate in the patients with advanced HF is approximately 50%, and in some regions, the number of deaths from HF has surpassed the number of deaths from myocardial infarction (MI) in T2DM patients.

Due to the clinical burden of CVD complications observed in T2DM patients, the awareness on the joint management of T2DM and CVD has been increased. Though the significance of intensive glycemic control for protection against microvascular complications and CVD in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus is well established, its role for reducing CV risk has not been established as clearly in people with T2DM.

As a result, there is an increasing pressure from regulatory agencies that the anti-hyperglycaemic agents (AHAs) should demonstrate CV safety and benefits in T2DM patients, especially for major CV events such as CV mortality, HF, and non-fatal MI. Following these regulatory requirements, several CV outcomes trials (CVOTs) have been carried out that assessed the CV safety of the AHAs. These CVOTs indicated comparatively lower risk of CVDs associated with certain agents as compared to the others. This has triggered a major paradigm shift beyond glucose control, to a broader strategy of comprehensive CV risk reduction.

### Clinical management of stable coronary artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113fMVor]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Although cardiologists have long treated patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and concomitant type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), T2DM has traditionally been considered just a comorbidity that affected the development and progression of the disease. Over the past decade, a number of factors have shifted that have forced the cardiology community to reconsider the role of T2DM in CAD. First, in addition to being associated with increased cardiovascular risk, T2DM has the potential to affect a number of treatment choices for CAD. In this document, we discuss the role that T2DM has in the selection of testing for CAD, in medical management (both secondary prevention strategies and treatment of stable angina), and in the selection of revascularization strategy. Second, although glycemic control has been recommended as a part of comprehensive risk factor management in patients with CAD, there is mounting evidence that the mechanism by which glucose is managed can have a substantial impact on cardiovascular outcomes. In this document, we discuss the role of glycemic management (both in intensity of control and choice of medications) in cardiovascular outcomes. It is becoming clear that the cardiologist needs both to consider T2DM in cardiovascular treatment decisions and potentially to help guide the selection of glucose-lowering medications. Our statement provides a comprehensive summary of effective, patient-centered management of CAD in patients with T2DM, with emphasis on the emerging evidence. Given the increasing prevalence of T2DM and the accumulating evidence of the need to consider T2DM in treatment decisions, this knowledge will become ever more important to optimize our patients' cardiovascular outcomes.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111qLezy]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) — people should be treated with a cardioprotective SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA as part of the comprehensive approach to cardiovascular and kidney risk reduction, and these agents should be included in the plan of care irrespective of the need for additional glucose lowering and irrespective of metformin use. Adoption of these agents should be reasonably straightforward in people with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular or kidney disease, and close collaboration between primary and specialty care clinicians with the patient is indicated to ensure successful uptake of these therapies.

### Clinical update: cardiovascular disease in diabetes mellitus: atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus-mechanisms, management, and clinical considerations [^1111UMaE]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains the principal cause of death and disability among patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus exacerbates mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and heart failure. Unfortunately, these mechanisms are not adequately modulated by therapeutic strategies focusing solely on optimal glycemic control with currently available drugs or approaches. In the setting of multifactorial risk reduction with statins and other lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensive therapies, and antihyperglycemic treatment strategies, cardiovascular complication rates are falling, yet remain higher for patients with diabetes mellitus than for those without. This review considers the mechanisms, history, controversies, new pharmacological agents, and recent evidence for current guidelines for cardiovascular management in the patient with diabetes mellitus to support evidence-based care in the patient with diabetes mellitus and heart disease outside of the acute care setting.

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^114ALJGY]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In people with Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, as well as controlling glucose, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is a key goal. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials have led to updates for many national and international guidelines. England, Wales and Northern Ireland remain exceptions, with the most recent update to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2015. We reviewed current national and international guidelines and recommendations on the management of people with Type 2 diabetes. This article shares our consensus on clinical recommendations for the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in people with Type 2 diabetes and established or at very high risk of cardiovascular disease in the UK. We also consider cost-effectiveness for these therapies. We recommend considering each person's cardiovascular risk and using diabetes therapies with proven cardiovascular benefits when appropriate to improve long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^112MigqD]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

In majority of patients with concomitant T2DM and CVD, the presence of certain comorbidities (e.g. atherosclerotic CVD, HF, chronic kidney disease, obesity) mandate a specific approach to the choice of glucose-lowering agents. This document, therefore, proposes an approach for the management of glycaemia in patients with T2DM and the above-mentioned comorbidities. It also elaborates on screening as well as management of major CV events in patients with concomitant T2DM, and prevention of these complications by lifestyle modifications in form of patient-centred care. This consensus recommendation helps health professionals to make decisions in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning every patient must be made by the responsible health professionals through a detailed consultation with the patient and the caregiver.

Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular disease — background therapy and decision principles: Most patients with T2D and CV disease will continue metformin together with an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA with proven CV benefit, and decisions to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor (for CV or kidney risk reduction) or a GLP-1RA (for CV risk reduction) should not be contingent on HbA1c levels. If an SGLT2 or GLP-1RA is added to a well-controlled T2D regimen, dose adjustment of background medications may be required to avoid hypoglycemia in the context of insulin, sulfonylurea, or glinide therapy, particularly in patients at or near glycemic goals. Efforts to achieve glycemic and blood pressure targets and to adhere to lipid, antiplatelet, antithrombotic, and smoking cessation guidelines should continue after addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^116hWhS9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

Diabetes is currently considered a cardiovascular disease, given the fact that all complications are vascular (micro and macrovascular complications). Hence, management of diabetes and especially those with a history of CVD in a joint clinic by cardiologist and an endocrinologist would seem a logical approach. The authors, therefore, recommend a new T2DM/CVD clinic or a cardiometabolic clinic that follows a novel algorithm for the management of T2DM in patients with CVDs. The facilities provided at the clinic would be for T2DM patients with a history of HF or ischaemic heart disease, those who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or Coronary artery bypass graft, and T2DM patients with abnormal BNP levels. The healthcare professionals with their expertise would look into managing HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target, blood pressure, body mass index, and elevated BNP levels to oversee the disease burden. Individual specific treatment algorithm designing and patient specific lifestyle modifications with regular follow-ups would be the key factors.

Discussion

Treatment of T2DM has now been expanded from a glucose-centric concept to an event-driven strategy due to the comorbidities. Many AHAs demonstrated effective CV and renal protection. The CVOTs, along with the management of glycaemia, have demonstrated to mitigate the microvascular and macrovascular risk. The SGLT2i and GLP1-RA show great promise in transforming the treatment of diabetes and concomitant CVDs by independently improving CV outcomes, over and above what can be achieved with standard of care management. Moreover, on the basis of researches conducted on the population with concomitant T2DM and CVDs, healthcare professionals have come up with a more reliable and novel screening techniques and therapeutic approaches for the CVDs as discussed in the earlier section. While these drugs seem promising in comorbidities management, their utility and safety in the general population remains an important parameter to be closely followed.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113Fo82z]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease and risk management in diabetes — Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in diabetes is characterized as a history of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction (MI), stable or unstable angina or coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease (PAD) including aortic aneurysm and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. Diabetes itself confers independent ASCVD risk, and among people with diabetes, major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity are clustered and common; numerous studies have shown the efficacy of managing individual cardiovascular risk factors, and large benefits are seen when multiple factors (glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid management) are addressed simultaneously with evidence for long-lasting benefits. Most evidence supporting interventions comes from trials of people with type 2 diabetes, and no randomized trials have been specifically designed to assess cardiovascular risk reduction strategies in people with type 1 diabetes; therefore, recommendations for cardiovascular risk factor modification for people with type 1 diabetes are extrapolated from data in people with type 2 diabetes and are similar to those for type 2 diabetes. Under the current paradigm of comprehensive risk factor modification, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have notably decreased in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and a large cohort study confirmed no or only marginally increased mortality, MI, and stroke risk compared with the general population when all major cardiovascular risk factors are managed to goal levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^114Ek7T6]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — primary prevention cardiovascular care: For all adults with T2DM, a tailored nutrition plan focusing on a heart-healthy dietary pattern is recommended to improve glycemic control, achieve weight loss if needed, and improve other ASCVD risk factors. Adults with T2DM should perform at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity to improve glycemic control, achieve weight loss if needed, and improve other ASCVD risk factors. For adults with T2DM, it is reasonable to initiate metformin as first-line therapy along with lifestyle therapies at the time of diagnosis to improve glycemic control and reduce ASCVD risk. For adults with T2DM and additional ASCVD risk factors who require glucose-lowering therapy despite initial lifestyle modifications and metformin, it may be reasonable to initiate a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist to improve glycemic control and reduce CVD risk.

### Global risk management in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111FRxso]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

It is well established that aggressive risk factor modification results in improved cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Yet, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a much higher baseline risk for cardiovascular events. As type 2 diabetes and hypertension commonly coexist, achieving recommended targets for diabetes, hypertension, and CVD requires aggressive management. Global risk reduction with aggressive low-density lipoprotein reduction and through the additional normalization of glucose levels and blood pressure can help to reduce absolute risk in this very high-risk population.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These high-risk patients benefit from aggressive risk factor management, with blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol treatment, glycemic control, kidney protection, and lifestyle intervention. There are several recommendation and guideline documents across cardiology, endocrinology, nephrology, and general medicine professional societies from the United States and Europe with recommendations for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although there are some noteworthy differences, particularly in risk stratification, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and blood pressure treatment targets, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, overall there is considerable alignment across recommendations from different professional societies.

### Guideline recommendations and the positioning of newer drugs in type 2 diabetes care [^113ayVRd]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce cardiorenal events. In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published updated recommendations for the management of such patients. We are concerned that ongoing discussions focusing on the differences between the endocrinologists' consensus report from the ADA and EASD and cardiologists' guidelines from the ESC are contributing to clinical inertia, thereby effectively denying evidence-based treatments advocated by both groups to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiorenal disease. A subset of members from the writing groups of the ADA-EASD consensus report and the ESC guidelines was convened to emphasise where commonalities exist and to propose an integrated framework that encompasses the views incorporated in management approaches proposed by the ESC and the ADA and EASD. Coordinated action is required to ensure that people with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist. In our opinion, this course should be initiated independent of background therapy, current glycaemic control, or individualised treatment goals.

The potential cardiovascular risks that are associated with drugs for type 2 diabetes have recently raised considerable clinical and regulatory concerns. As some risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are related, identifying agents that target shared underlying pathways and processes is an attractive therapeutic strategy.

### Cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^113oAaFM]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the most prevalent complication of diabetes mellitus. It is estimated that 77% of hospitalizations in the United States for chronic complications of diabetes are attributable to CVD. 1 The outcome of these hospitalizations is more often than not detrimental. This suggests that certain interventions that have been useful in reducing the CVD mortality in the general population have been either less efficacious or sometimes detrimental in diabetic patients. An example of the latter is the finding that, for diabetic patients with multivessel disease, coronary artery bypass grafting is superior to percutaneous coronary angioplasty, while in nondiabetic subjects, the outcome of the 2 procedures is similar. 6–8 It remains to be conclusively shown whether the advent of arterial stents and potent antiplatelet therapy will be equally beneficial in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. 9, 10.

A role for postprandial hyperglycemia as an independent risk factor for CVD is now emerging. 56, 57 However, there are no universally accepted guidelines on how to target postprandial hyperglycemia. The choice of the therapeutic agent depends on multiple variables. In general, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers are recommended as first-line therapy if nephropathy is present. 60, 83–87 The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation study suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have the additional benefit of CVD and diabetes prevention. 80, 88 In those with established CVD, β-blockers are recommended unless the patient has hypoglycemia unawareness. Type 2 diabetes is a state of increased plasma coagulability. 121 The platelet aggregability is increased and fibrinolytic capacity is reduced.

Antiplatelet therapy, notably use of aspirin, has been shown to be effective in reducing CVD-related events. 122 The recommended dose and frequency of administration is somewhat controversial. Although screening for an underlying subclinical CVD is recommended for high-risk diabetic subjects planning to embark on a moderate- to high-intensity exercise program, in most patients the physician should use clinical judgment in recommending exercise or pharmacologic stress tests. 139 Overall, it appears that diabetic subjects would benefit from a more aggressive preventive program that sets more stringent standards. It is likely that achieving these goals is a challenging task. Nevertheless, these measures are bound to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a very high-risk group of people.

### Recommendations… [^1113n6ox]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- For most persons with diabetes, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease.
- An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used to treat hypertension.
- Patients should receive a high-intensity statin if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in persons with diabetes mellitus. In 1999 and again in 2007, the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association joined together to release statements on preventing CVD in persons with diabetes. New data have emerged since the publication of these statements; therefore, an updated guideline has been released. In persons with diabetes 40 to 75 years of age, if the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 70 to 189 mg per dL, they should receive a moderate-intensity statin, and if they have at least a 7.

5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD, they should receive a high-intensity statin. NUTRITION All persons with diabetes should receive nutrition therapy personalized to them. To control blood glucose levels, it is important to monitor how many carbohydrates are consumed, and it should be noted that fruits, legumes, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy products may be substituted for other sources of carbohydrates. A Mediterranean-type diet can also help with controlling blood glucose levels and CVD risk factors. Sodium intake should be limited. ASPIRIN THERAPY There is some debate about the use of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD in persons with diabetes. In the general population, it has been shown to prevent nonfatal myocardial infarction in men and appears to lower stroke risk in women.

Data from studies in patients with diabetes seem to indicate that there is a modest reduced risk of CVD events with its use, with at least a twofold relative risk of bleeding, ultimately demonstrating that aspirin's effects depend on each person's initial bleeding and CVD risks.

### Reducing cardiovascular disease risk in type 2 diabetes: is the focus on glycaemia warranted? [^113pFE3a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This article examines the recent evidence from trials and related meta-analyses on the effects of glycaemic control on cardiovascular disease (and, to a lesser extent, microvascular outcomes) in diabetes, and compares this with evidence accrued from blood pressure and statin trials. On the basis of such evidence, as well as pragmatic considerations, it is clear that clinicians should place stronger emphasis on lipid and blood pressure management to lessen cardiovascular risks. At the same time, cardiovascular disease benefits of glycaemia reduction appear less pronounced, with patient characteristics critically influencing risk to benefit ratio. Recent guidelines now reflect recent observations on glycaemic control (with relaxed targets in specific patient groups), whereas future guidelines should encourage physicians to prioritize lipid-lowering and blood pressure management in patients with diabetes.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of death among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly in low- and middle-income countries. To effectively prevent the development of CVDs in T2DM, considerable effort has been made to explore novel preventive approaches, individualized glycemic control and cardiovascular risk management (strict blood pressure and lipid control), together with recently developed glucose-lowering agents and lipid-lowering drugs. This review mainly addresses the important issues affecting the choice of antidiabetic agents and lipid, blood pressure and antiplatelet treatments considering the cardiovascular status of the patient. Finally, we also discuss the changes in therapy principles underlying CVDs in T2DM.

### Lipid-lowering treatment patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with high cardiovascular disease risk [^112MdaK7]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Among patients with type 2 diabetes with high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, index statin treatment modifications that potentially imply possible statin intolerance and/or ineffectiveness were frequent.
Low use of high-intensity statin found in this study also indicates gaps in the management of hyperlipidemia among patients with type 2 diabetes and possible remaining unaccounted lipid residual risk.
Better management of these patients with diabetes is warranted to reduce their CVD risk.

### The "Early treatment" approach reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes: a consensus from an expert panel using the Delphi technique [^113FzN5p]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is no consensus on the optimal therapeutic approach to adopt in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). The study aimed to gather an expert consensus on the hypoglycemic treatment and CV risk management in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM through the Delphi methodology.

Methods

To address this issue, a list of 30 statements concerning the definition of "early T2DM patient", early treatment, CV risk in T2DM, treat-to-benefit approach, and indications for treatment with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors was developed. Using a two-round Delphi methodology, the survey was distributed to 80 Italian diabetes specialists who rated their level of agreement with each statement on a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was predefined as more than 66% of the panel agreeing/disagreeing with any given statement.

Results

A total of 27/30 statements achieved consensus. A patient was defined as "early" according to pathophysiological or clinical interpretation, and/or the timing of the diagnosis. There was agreement on the importance to reach the lowest possible HbA1c level, since diagnosis, also using combination therapy with hypoglycemic drugs with a proven CV benefit. There was a consensus that a treat-to-benefit approach involves the addition of a glucose-lowering agent with proven CV benefits to metformin since diagnosis. The use of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors was considered a key strategy in this approach and the benefits were recognized also for patients with T2DM without established CVD. GLP-1RAs should be used at an earlier stage than SGLT2 inhibitors to prevent CVD, especially in patients with evidence of subclinical atherosclerotic disease.

Conclusion

This Delphi consensus recognized the importance to adopt a tailored hypoglycemic treatment of patients with T2DM according to their CVD risk and the key role of glucose-lowering agents with proven CV efficacy, GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors, in the context of an early treat-to-benefit approach.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^115UdWXx]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes — In high-risk patients with advanced type 2 diabetes, intensive glucose lowering targeting a glycated hemoglobin level below 6 percent reduced five-year nonfatal myocardial infarctions but increased five-year mortality; therefore, such a strategy cannot be recommended for high-risk patients with advanced type 2 diabetes (Evidence Grade: A). Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are synergistic risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and optimal control of blood pressure and LDL cholesterol can help prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Successful prevention and treatment of CVD risk factors have reduced the burden of coronary heart disease among adults with diabetes in the United States, and significant progress can be achieved when multiple risk factors such as blood pressure control, lipid management, antiplatelet agents, and smoking cessation are addressed globally.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112xRKQX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Unresolved questions for sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) — key uncertainties and cautions include: Several important clinical questions regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs remain unanswered, including what are the benefits and risks of using both classes of medications simultaneously, as current guidelines do suggest the use of both classes of medications in some patient groups, but whether combination therapy leads to further improvements in outcome is unknown. It is also uncertain whether an SGLT2 inhibitor or a GLP-1RA should be the initial therapy in drug-naïve patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and what is the role for these medications in patients who do not have diabetic kidney disease (DKD) or established ASCVD but are at high risk, although we and others recommend their use in patients with a high burden of risk factors for CV disease. Finally, prioritization and sequencing among novel therapies are highlighted, and the writing committee emphasizes the importance of these drugs to CV specialists on the basis of their effects on CV risk reduction rather than a direct effect through glucose lowering; however, increased vigilance to avoid hypoglycemia in patients with HbA1c near or below target levels at SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA initiation is warranted, especially if the patient's existing T2D therapies include sulfonylureas, glinides, or insulin.

Discussions and implication of pathway — type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction states that sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been shown to directly improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, with randomized trials proving reductions in acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CV death in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); SGLT2 inhibitors also have heart failure (HF) and renal benefits that appear independent of HbA1c, even in patients without T2D. CV specialists "now need to incorporate these agents", and this ECDP provides a practical guide for initiation and monitoring that "should be used in concert with established risk factor modification guidelines" (including lipids, blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy) and "applied in the context of guideline-directed diabetes care". The document "should complement, rather than supersede, good clinical judgement", emphasizes that achieving goals "requires a team-based approach", and notes that, if used appropriately, these therapies "should significantly reduce CV morbidity and mortality", while also stating that evidence is still emerging and algorithms may change as new data appear, with the overarching goal of improved CV outcomes remaining consistent.

### Improving outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus [^113Cqneq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

As we continue our efforts to lower the residual cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes mellitus, cardiology‐care providers are well positioned to adopt a more active role in ensuring that all strategies that lower cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes mellitus are appropriately implemented, including these American Diabetes Association recommendations. Implementing new diabetic‐ and cardiovascular disease–lowering medications will require that cardiology‐care providers have increased awareness of evidence from completed and ongoing diabetic cardiovascular outcome trials and have access to specific educational resources describing the risk/benefit profile of these medications that lower cardiovascular risk. Such efforts will require a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to determine the best strategy to manage diabetic treatment. In response to this need, cardiology professional organizations have embarked on multiple efforts to help cardiology‐care providers understand these new medications and develop strategies to incorporate them into clinical practice. For example, a recent Consensus Pathway on Novel Therapies for CV Risk Reduction has been published by the American College of Cardiology. 18 This consensus pathway provides practical information regarding screening for diabetes mellitus and incorporating these diabetic medications with proven cardiovascular benefit into clinical practice. Similarly, the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association recently launched a collaborative intervention, Know Diabetes by Heart, with the goal of reducing cardiovascular deaths, heart attacks, and strokes in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 19 This collaborative effort will engage patients, healthcare providers, and policy makers to increase awareness and understanding of the link between diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, provide educational and management tools to empower patients to manage their diabetes mellitus and associated cardiovascular risk factors, and provide an educational platform for healthcare providers to further learn and increase willingness to manage cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The past several decades have seen much‐welcome progress in reducing the cardiovascular‐associated burden of diabetes mellitus, and recent data from clinical trials provide even greater hope that we can further reduce the residual risk attributed to diabetes mellitus.

### What clinicians need to know about the cardiovascular effects of the most recent classes of drugs used for type 2 diabetes [^113iK9Qm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The treatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes has seen a sea change in recent years with the development of novel antihyperglycemic agents. The impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), two medication classes introduced in the United States in the wake of increased scrutiny by the US Food and Drug Administration on cardiovascular disease and antihyperglycemic agents, highlight this progression. In recent trials, SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated significant reductions in admissions for heart failure in patients with established cardiovascular disease and those at risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events for those with established cardiovascular disease. GLP-1 RAs have exhibited consistent reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events for patients with established cardiovascular disease. These developments have led the 2019 American Diabetes Association guidelines to recommend considering each patient's cardiovascular history when selecting antihyperglycemic agents. The goal of this article is to review recent updates and provide relevant strategies for providers on SGLT2 and GLP-1 RAs in treating cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes.

### Update on prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in light of recent evidence: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American diabetes association [^114fpr6e]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk factor control as primary prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has changed substantially in the past few years. The purpose of this scientific statement is to review the current literature and key clinical trials pertaining to blood pressure and blood glucose control, cholesterol management, aspirin therapy, and lifestyle modification. We present a synthesis of the recent literature, new guidelines, and clinical targets, including screening for kidney and subclinical cardiovascular disease for the contemporary management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) cardiovascular care — priorities and gaps: Cardiovascular (CV) specialists have a key role and are positioned to address screening for T2D in patients with or at high risk of CV disease, aggressive treatment of CV risk factors, and incorporation of newer glucose‑lowering agents with evidence for improving CV outcomes. In contemporary practice, only 13% of outpatients with coronary artery disease cared for primarily by cardiologists are screened for T2D. Comprehensive CV risk factor control reduces events and improves survival in patients with T2D, yet only a minority of patients with diabetes achieve these key benchmarks; encounters with CV specialists are an ideal time to review overall management and consider initiating these novel agents to favorably impact care and outcomes.

### Cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: progress toward personalized management [^112qcm9m]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

To date, limited progress has been made in the prevention of T2DM, and no country or health care system is immune to the threat of T2DM. Although the incidence and mortality rate of CVD have decreased in high-income countries, these countries account for only approximately 10% of the world population, and CVD incidence and mortality trends in T2DM patients in middle- and low-income countries remains unclear. In addition, considering the clinical burden of CVD complications in T2DM patients, attention to the joint management of T2DM and CVD has been increasing. In this review, we focus more thoroughly on the current state of the epidemiology of CVD in T2DM and on preventive measures and then explore measures to reduce the threat from CVD in T2DM patients.

### Cardiovascular risk in diabetes mellitus: epidemiology, assessment and prevention [^111KuyA2]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Secular changes in CVD outcomes have occurred over the past few decades, mainly due to a decline in the incidence of ischaemic heart disease. The onset of T2DM at a young age (< 40 years), leading to a greater number of life-years lost, has also become increasingly common. Researchers are now looking beyond established risk factors in patients with T2DM towards the role of ectopic fat and, potentially, haemodynamic abnormalities in mediating important outcomes (such as heart failure). T2DM confers a wide spectrum of risk and is not necessarily a CVD risk equivalent, indicating the importance of risk assessment strategies (such as global risk scoring, consideration of risk-enhancing factors and assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis) to inform treatment. Data from epidemiological studies and clinical trials demonstrate that successful control of multiple risk factors can reduce the risk of CVD events by ≥ 50%; however, only ≤ 20% of patients achieve targets for risk factor reduction (plasma lipid levels, blood pressure, glycaemic control, body weight and non-smoking status). Improvements in composite risk factor control with lifestyle management (including a greater emphasis on weight loss interventions) and evidence-based generic and novel pharmacological therapies are therefore needed when the risk of CVD is high.

Individualized glycemic management in patients with T2DM and CVD

A meta-analysis of 102 prospective studies showed that fasting blood glucose concentrations ≥ 7 mmol/L conferred an elevated risk of coronary heart disease. Additionally, impaired glucose tolerance and elevated HbA1c (> 5.7%) levels have been associated with an increased risk of CVD. An increased blood glucose concentration in the general population or in patients with atherosclerotic CVD confers an increased risk of all-cause mortality and CVD. Individualized glycemic management may lead to improved prevention of CVD in T2DM. In this section, we focus on current aspects of individualized management of T2DM.

### New perspectives in management of cardiovascular risk among people with diabetes [^113YBquQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the publication of results from multiple landmark cardiovascular outcome trials of antihyperglycemic medications over the past 8 years, there has been a major shift in the focus of care for people with type 2 diabetes, from control of hyperglycemia to managing cardiovascular risk. Multiple international cardiology and diabetes society guidelines and recommendations now endorse sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors and glucagon‐like protein‐1 receptor agonists as first‐line therapies to mitigate cardiovascular risk. The most recent publication is the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guideline on the management of cardiovascular disease in those with type 2 diabetes that, for the first time, recommends use of both classes of medications for the mitigation of cardiovascular risk for those with or at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Here, we review the evidence behind contemporary society guidelines and recommendations for the management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^1175uXvW]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Methodology

The consensus is comprised of three major parts: (1) risk stratification and treatment of T2DM in patients with corresponding risk/history of CVD, (2) risk stratification, screening as well as treatment of CVD in patients with comorbidity of T2DM, (3) discussion on lifestyle management for this special set of population. The literature search of the current evidence was performed using the MEDLINE (by PubMed), Cochrane, and Google scholar databases. The articles included randomized control studies, cohort or case–control studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, prospective and retrospective studies, clinical practice guidelines, and evidence-based consensus recommendations/guidelines. All articles included were in English language. The rationale for prioritizing the treatment approach in case of patients T2DM and CVD was based on the evidence grading system used by the American Diabetes Association and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force. The level of evidences was categorised as follows:
Level 1: evidence from randomized control studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
Level 2: evidence from comparative, case–control and descriptive studies.
Level 3: evidence from non-randomized, prospective or retrospective studies.
Level 4: expert committee reports or clinical opinions of respected authorities.

A multidisciplinary expert panel of specialised endocrinologists and cardiologists, with clinical and research expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of T2DM and CVD, was convened and recommendations were formulated. All the available evidences were comprehensively reviewed, discussed, developed, and final decisions were made by the panel. Based on the above-mentioned level of evidences, recommendations were graded as follows:
Grade A: based on evidence Level 1.
Grade B: based on evidence Level 2 or extrapolated from Level 1.
Grade C: based on evidence Level 3 or extrapolated from Level 1 and 2.
Grade D: based on evidence Level 4 or extrapolated from Levels 1–3.

### Managing cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes: what Do the cardiovascular outcome trials mean for Australian practice? [^112ZX1SA]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Can the Choice of Glucose-Lowering Medication Impact CV Outcome?

Metformin has been established as baseline therapy for type 2 diabetes, based on evidence for a role in the reduction of microvascular complications from the seminal UKPDS study and an emergent macrovascular benefit on long-term analysis. Unlike newer agents, funded CV outcome trails of similar quality do not exist, however, as it has been used for ≥ 60 years in clinical practice, confidence exists that it certainly does not increase CV risk and, based upon on the extended data from UKPDS (in a small cohort of obese patients), is likely to benefit CVD outcomes.

In the case of sulphonylureas, their association with CV risk factors, hypoglycaemia and weight gain is widely recognised. However, controversy exists with respect to their association with CV outcomes and mortality, especially in patients with an elevated risk of CVD or established CVD. While observations of increased CVD events and raised mortality have questioned the use of sulphonylureas either as monotherapy or in combination with metformin vs. other glucose-lowering agents, some meta-analyses and systematic reviews have provided reassurance on the CV safety of this drug class, alongside the ADVANCE study, and the recent announcement of the non-inferiority results of the CAROLINA study. Despite this, with more favourable CV profiles of newer agents emerging, ADA/EASD guidelines have shifted away from recommending the early use of sulphonylureas in patients with established CVD.

The impact of more recent glucose-lowering agents on CVD risk had, until recently, been less well known. There is now increasing evidence from CVOTs that demonstrates CV benefits with certain diabetes medications, in particular the sodium-glucose transport protein-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). In recognition of these findings, there has been a contemporary shift in the recommended strategy for CV risk reduction in managing T2DM that extends beyond glucose control.

A summary of recommendations from Australian as well as several international guidelines is outlined in BOX 1.

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which constitutes the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Intensive CVD risk factor control can ameliorate the elevated CVD associated with T2D.

There has been an explosion of interest in CVD and diabetes mellitus because of the epidemic nature of the diseases and their tight epidemiologic link. Clinical trials over the past decade have built substantial evidence for the role of lipid management, blood pressure control, and antiplatelet therapy in managing risk for CVD in patients who have diabetes mellitus. The many clinical trials underway will not only hone existing recommendations by establishing appropriate targets and techniques for lipid and blood pressure management, but also should demonstrate the role and most appropriate techniques for management of glycemia, flow-limiting coronary lesions, and obesity.

### A review of cardiovascular outcomes in the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes [^112DjsRQ]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common and serious complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often linked to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with T2DM. Monitoring and treating risk factors for CVD are important elements of diabetes management. This review aims to examine CV risk in people with relatively early and mild diabetes who are at substantial risk of CVD; it considers the impact of insulin therapy on this risk by focusing on key studies in patients with diabetes.

Methods

A literature search was carried out using PubMed to identify key publications, between 2008 and 2013, related to insulin and its possible effect on CVD. This review examines CV risk in diabetes and the impact of insulin therapy on this risk.

Results

Studies have shown that treatment with insulin glargine is associated with marked improvement in the lipid profile of people with T2DM. Intensive insulin therapy has been shown to lower mortality rates in people with diabetes following acute myocardial infarction after 1 year. Retrospective data also indicate that insulin reduces the risk of CVD events, regardless of whether people had comorbidities known to increase CV risk. The prospective ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention) trial found that treatment with insulin glargine had a neutral effect with regard to CV outcomes in people with prediabetes or early diabetes, compared with standard care.

Conclusions

Other ongoing, large-scale studies of insulin therapy should provide further insights into whether or not insulin therapy can influence long-term CV outcomes.

Recent updates to diabetes treatment guidelines and recommendations

Since publication of EMPA‐REG 15, CANVAS 12, LEADER 20 and SUSTAIN 6 22, a number of national and international guidelines and recommendations for the management of Type 2 diabetes have been updated to include cardiovascular risk reduction as a key consideration, and specifically the use of anti‐hyperglycaemic agents that have demonstrated cardiovascular protection in those with Type 2 diabetes (Table S1). Indeed, some have explicitly named empagliflozin and liraglutide as appropriate choices for the management of people with Type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.

Recent updates to international guidelines and recommendations

Several major international guidelines and recommendations on the management of Type 2 diabetes specifically cite EMPA‐REG 15, CANVAS 12, LEADER 20 and SUSTAIN 6 22, and recommend a hierarchical approach to drug selection dependent on the strength of this evidence 3, 48, 49, 50. The updated joint American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus statement emphasizes a stratification of people based on the presence of pre‐existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease before considering which additional glucose‐lowering agent to add as dual therapy (following metformin failure) 51. In those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the ADA/EASD recommend the use of a SGLT‐2i (with a preference for empagliflozin) for those with a diagnosis of congestive cardiac failure or chronic kidney disease, or a GLP‐1RA (with a preference for liraglutide or semaglutide) for those with atherosclerotic disease, as these agents have been shown to reduce cardiovascular death and all‐cause mortality (except semaglutide) when added to standard care 51.

### Lipid-lowering treatment patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with high cardiovascular disease risk [^116DGC6m]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity among patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 2 diabetes have a twofold to fourfold higher risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) than patients without diabetes. In addition, type 2 diabetes patients with a history of CVD have an increased risk of recurrent events. Hence, high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes should be treated effectively to better manage cardiovascular risks.

Several studies have shown that lipid-lowering treatments (LLTs) such as statins are effective in reducing the risk of CVEs and total mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a recent meta-analysis conducted by de Vries et al, patients with diabetes with CVD experienced reductions in relative risk with standard-dose and intensive-dose statins by an estimated 15% and 24%, respectively, for major CVEs or cerebrovascular events. According to the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, patients with type 2 diabetes are one of four statin benefit groups. Along with lifestyle recommendations, the 2015 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care position statement for CVD and risk management recommended different statin intensity treatment for patients of different age groups and CVD risk factors.

### Pharmacologic strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: focus on SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists [^115uEx7H]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) present an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) complications. In addition to improvement in glycaemic control, glucose-lowering therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors, have been shown to significantly reduce CV events. In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration mandated that all new glucose-lowering drugs undergo CV outcomes trials (CVOTs) to determine their CV safety. These trials have largely demonstrated no major CV safety concerns. Most notably, the GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors have been found to be not only safe, but also cardioprotective compared to placebo. The SGLT-2 inhibitors have opened a new perspective for clinicians treating patients with T2D and established CV disease in light of their 'pleiotropic' effects, specifically on heart failure, while GLP-1RAs seem to present more favourable effects on atherosclerotic events. In this review, we discuss the role of GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce CV risk in T2D patients and suggest an individualized therapeutic approach in this population based on the presence of metabolic and CV comorbidities.

### Comprehensive management of cardiovascular risk factors for adults with type 2 diabetes: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111FnYym]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes. Cardiovascular disease in diabetes is multifactorial, and control of the cardiovascular risk factors leads to substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. The 2015 American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association scientific statement, "Update on Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Light of Recent Evidence", highlighted the importance of modifying various risk factors responsible for cardiovascular disease in diabetes. At the time, there was limited evidence to suggest that glucose-lowering medications reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. At present, several large randomized controlled trials with newer antihyperglycemic agents have been completed, demonstrating cardiovascular safety and reduction in cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. This AHA scientific statement update focuses on (1) the evidence and clinical utility of newer antihyperglycemic agents in improving glycemic control and reducing cardiovascular events in diabetes; (2) the impact of blood pressure control on cardiovascular events in diabetes; and (3) the role of newer lipid-lowering therapies in comprehensive cardiovascular risk management in adults with diabetes. This scientific statement addresses the continued importance of lifestyle interventions, pharmacological therapy, and surgical interventions to curb the epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome, important precursors of prediabetes, diabetes, and comorbid cardiovascular disease. Last, this scientific statement explores the critical importance of the social determinants of health and health equity in the continuum of care in diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

### A comprehensive cardiovascular-renal-metabolic risk reduction approach to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115uYrzn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite decades of research into risk-reduction strategies, cardiovascular disease and renal disease remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the tight clustering of cardiovascular and renal disease with the metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes mellitus, we can think of these conditions together as cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disease states. A holistic view of cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disease states is critical to provide integrated patient-centered care to individuals with these disease states. Here, we explore the cardiovascular and renal risks associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and highlight the importance of reducing cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disease risk in a comprehensive manner. We advocate a cross-disciplinary, team-based model to manage cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disease risk among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112fVvk3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiometabolic disease in type 2 diabetes — integrated management emphasizes concurrent cardiovascular and kidney risk reduction: There is an increasing appreciation of the common pathophysiology and interrelationship of cardiometabolic risk factors leading to both adverse cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in people with diabetes, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These three comorbidities have been termed cardiometabolic disease or cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health. Reasons to concurrently consider these comorbidities include the major benefit observed across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Therefore, in addition to the management of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs that have demonstrated benefit is considered a foundational element of risk reduction and the pharmacological strategy to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Personalizing glucose-lowering therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^111YPpgw]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Twelve drug categories are marketed in the United States to lower blood glucose concentrations in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). After metformin, there is disagreement about the optimal next choice for combination therapy. Guidelines advise balancing potency, risks, benefits, and costs. For T2DM and cardiovascular disease (CVD), emerging evidence suggests that certain options may have specific advantages. Specific members of the thiazolidinedione, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist classes have been associated with significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, generally in those with established CVD. A personalized approach should consider these evidence-based therapies to optimize clinical outcomes.

### Ongoing clinical trials evaluating the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of therapeutic approaches to diabetes mellitus [^113FDRR3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Research has substantiated that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease. It is well established that aggressive management of metabolic risk factors is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. A number of clinical trials are currently focusing on evaluating the safety and efficacy of therapeutic approaches to diabetes. These trials will provide additional information on the role of aggressive management of glucose in patients with diabetes and CV risk. This article provides a summary of these ongoing trials, and discusses the impact of glycemic control and strategies to promote CV risk reduction in patients with diabetes.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

If the reassessment question "HbA1c ≥ 7.0% after lifestyle therapies and metformin?" is answered no, proceed to "Reinforce the importance of diet and physical activity and continue current management"; if yes, ask "Does the patient have other CVD risk factors?" and, if yes, pursue "Consideration may be given to an SGLT-2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitor or a GLP-1R (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor) agonist to improve glycemic control and reduce CVD risk (Class IIb)", whereas if no, follow "Further management of diabetes per primary care provider or endocrinology".

### Approach to diabetes management in patients with CVD [^1149vid3]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic analyses have established a clear association between diabetes and macrovascular disease. Vascular dysfunction caused by metabolic abnormalities in patients with diabetes is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. Patients with diabetes are at two to four fold higher CV risk as compared to non-diabetic individuals, and CVD remains the leading cause of mortality in patients with this condition. One strategy to reduce CVD burden in patients with diabetes has been to focus on controlling the major metabolic abnormality in this condition, namely hyperglycemia. However, this has not been unequivocally demonstrated to reduced CV events, in contrast to controlling other CVD risk factors linked to hyperglycemia, such as blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and platelet dysfunction. However, In contradistinction, accrued data from a number of large, randomized clinical trials in both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) over the past 3 decades have proven that more intensive glycemic control retards the onset and progression of microvascular disease. In this review, we will summarize the key glucose-lowering CV outcomes trials in diabetes, provide an overview of the different drugs and their impact on the CV system, and describe our approach to management of the frequently encountered patient with T2DM and coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or heart failure (HF).

Glycemic targets

With respect to glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) targets, the AHA, ADA, ESC and ESC/EASD guidelines propose a target of < 7%, and gives further recommendations for less stringent targets in older or more frail adults. A target of ≤ 6.5% for those with an early diagnosis, who are not frail, and who do not have established atherosclerotic CVD. This is consistent with current ESC, ADA and AHA guidelines on DM and CVD (Table 2).

Achieving a glycemic target of an HbA1c level < 7% for patients with T2DM reduces the incidence of the development of microvascular complications and CVD. A more stringent HbA1c goal (< 6.5%) is defined for selected children and adolescents, those with a short duration of DM, lesser degrees of β-cell dysfunction and no evidence of CVD. An HbA1c target of < 6% may be optimal during pregnancy without significant hypoglycemia. Furthermore, a less stringent HbA1c goal (< 8.0% or even slightly higher) may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy, a history of advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, or long-standing T2DM. The association of HF mortality with HbA1c goals in T2DM has a "U" shape, where a modest HbA1c level of 7.1–8.0% is associated with the lowest mortality among patients with HF and T2DM, whereas an HbA1c level < 6.0% or > 8%, and even > 10%, may increase the risk of incident HF or HF-related hospitalization.

Antidiabetic treatment choice

The novel glucose-lowering agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, have been shown to lower atherosclerotic CVD and HF risks independently of baseline HbA1c; this has led to newer treatment approach. A reasonable regimen of glycemic control is associated with both glycemic targets and strategies of glucose-lowering therapy, and the medical provider must prioritize the patient's CV state based on preference and the prescription history.

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^115c1i8i]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is rising rapidly in the UK and across the world, in part due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and the ageing population 1, 2. In people with Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality 3. Once cardiovascular disease is present in a person with Type 2 diabetes, the risk of all‐cause mortality is increased threefold and the risk of cardiovascular death is increased fivefold 4. Thus, in addition to controlling glucose, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is a key goal in the management of people with Type 2 diabetes. Before the establishment of cardiovascular disease, treatment should aim to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease developing; whereas, once it occurs, the goal needs to be limiting its progression and reducing the risk of further adverse cardiovascular events. Attaining good glycaemic control, by whatever means, is important within the first 5 years after diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, and prior to the onset of micro‐ or macrovascular disease, because this decreases the risk of cardiovascular events 5. However, prior to 2008, no individual anti‐hyperglycaemic agent had demonstrated a benefit with regard to cardiovascular events beyond 5 years within a clinical trial setting 5.

### Early and intensive therapy for management of hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes [^1177qVHC]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) results in significant morbidity and mortality. Results of recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated the ability of early and intensive therapy to reduce the risk of microvascular complications. However, controversy surrounds the ability of such therapy to reduce the risk for macrovascular complications.

Objectives

This article reviews results from recent clinical trials in patients with T2DM as well as extended follow-up of earlier trials to determine if early, intensive, and individualized therapy aimed at the underlying pathogenesis of the disease could decrease the risk for long-term complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods

Information was obtained by a search of the PUBMED and EMBASE databases using the search terms type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycosylated hemoglobin, pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, glycemic control, early intervention, multifactorial intervention, cardiovascular disease, β-cell function, and antidiabetes therapy for the period between 1995 and 2010. Articles dealing with outcomes trials, impact of therapy on microvascular and macrovascular complications, effects of therapeutic agents on the pathophysiology of T2DM, and the impact of agents on CV risk factors were then preferentially selected for in-depth review.

Results

Large-scale clinical trials in patients with T2DM, although largely negative at 5 years for macrovascular end points, suggested benefit for patients with a shorter duration of T2DM (ie, < 10 years) and still supported a treatment strategy of early, intensive, and individualized therapy to prevent long-term complications of the disease. In Steno-2, after 13 years of follow-up, early, intensive, multifactorial therapy was associated with a 56% lower risk of all-cause death (P = 0.02) and a 57% lower risk of death from CVD (P = 0.04). In the 10-year follow-up to the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, intensive therapy was associated with a significant 15% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction (P = 0.01) and a significant 13% reduction in the risk of death from any cause (P = 0.007). Therapy should be aimed at correcting underlying pathophysiologic defects, including β-cell failure and insulin resistance, and should also correct underlying risk factors for CVD whenever possible.

Conclusions

Early and intensive antidiabetes treatment was recommended in patients with T2DM, particularly those with a shorter duration of disease and without a history of CVD. The goal was to safely lower glycosylated hemoglobin to < 7%, therefore providing beneficial effects on the risk for complications. Hypoglycemia should be avoided. In addition, less aggressive treatment might be suitable for older patients with longstanding diabetes and a history of CVD events. Clinical trial results also provided support for a second important aspect of individualized treatment for patients with T2DM-multifactorial intervention aimed at controlling CVD risk factors.

Systems factors in caring for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular (CV) disease — practice models and clinician roles highlight that challenges to utilization of and adherence to evidence-based and guideline-recommended therapies remain. One potential approach to optimizing their use would be employing what might be called the "consultative" approach, in which the discussion of these agents is encouraged in conversations or communication with the clinician caring for the patient's diabetes and/or with the patient, while an alternative might be a more comprehensive "team" approach, such as that which has been implemented for patients with other chronic diseases. Members of the care team for patients with diabetes include primary care physicians, endocrinologists, cardiologists, podiatrists, ophthalmologists, pharmacists, nurses, advanced practice providers, and dietitians. With both approaches, the key elements are patient-centered care, shared decision making, and integration across disciplines and patient care roles. Given the data supporting comprehensive CV risk reduction in patients with T2D, CV clinicians should be both champions and change agents as strong advocates for our patients, recognizing unmet needs in healthcare delivery, and extending our comfort zone in implementing the use of new evidence-based therapies that reduce CV event rates.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials: a paradigm shift in the current management of type 2 diabetes [^116V3aqN]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Historical concerns about cardiovascular (CV) risks associated with certain glucose-lowering medications gave rise to the introduction of cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs). Initially implemented to help monitor the CV safety of glucose-lowering drugs in patients with T2D, who either had established CVD or were at high risk of CVD, data that emerged from some of these trials started to show benefits. Alongside the anticipated CV safety of many of these agents, evidence for certain sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have revealed potential cardioprotective effects in patients with T2D who are at high risk of CVD events. Reductions in 3-point major adverse CV events (3P-MACE) and CV death have been noted in some of these CVOTs, with additional benefits including reduced risks of hospitalisation for heart failure, progression of renal disease, and all-cause mortality. These new data are leading to a paradigm shift in the current management of T2D, with international guidelines now prioritising SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs in certain patient populations. However, clinicians are faced with a large volume of CVOT data when seeking to use this evidence base to bring opportunities to improve CV, heart failure and renal outcomes, and even reduce mortality, in their patients with T2D. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth summary of CVOT data-crystallising the key findings, from safety to efficacy-and to offer a practical perspective for physicians. Finally, we discuss the next steps for the post-CVOT era, with ongoing studies that may further transform clinical practice and improve outcomes for people with T2D, heart failure or renal disease.

Lipid management

The presence of diabetic dyslipidemia in patients with T2DM is, at least in part, a cause of CVD. Moreover, diabetic dyslipidemia, including elevated triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is associated with increased CV events, especially in high-risk populations. Accounting for metabolic dyslipidemia in CVD risk stratification is necessary for patients with T2DM.

Lipid targets

The concept of "lower is better" regarding LDL levels has been supported for reducing the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM and CVD. The ADA guidelines recommend that lifestyle interventions be initiated for individuals with abnormal triglyceride levels (> 150 mg/dL) and/or HDL-C levels (< 40 mg/dL for men, 50 mg/dL for women), and an LDL-C target reduction of ≥ 50% or more from baseline is reasonable for patients with diabetes and 10-year ASCVD risk of 20% or higher. The ESC/EASD guidelines recommend an LDL-C target of < 55 mg/dL for those with T2DM and at very high CV risk. The AHA guidelines recommend an LDL-C target reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline for those with diabetes and clinical CVD. The ESC established goals for LDL-C based on level of ASCVD risk. With respect to lipid targets, the AHA/ADA and the ESC/EASD guideline are shown in Table 7.

### Current antihyperglycemic treatment guidelines and algorithms for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113tKjX8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed physical activity remain cornerstones of disease prevention and treatment, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Fortunately, many of these patients are able to achieve desired glycemic targets with the use of currently available antihyperglycemic agents. Both not-for-profit disease-specific organizations and healthcare specialty societies have provided guidance about the appropriate selection of these therapies. Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines and algorithms have been developed, taking into account a combination of evidence-based information and expert opinions, with various groups offering diverse glucose goals and approaches to hyperglycemia management. Virtually all recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, necessitating an integrated yet individualized approach to patient care.

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^1163usA5]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Many people with Type 2 diabetes also have, or are at high risk of, concomitant cardiovascular disease and control of cardiovascular events remains a key goal for managing outcomes. Given highly favourable results of cardiovascular outcome trials, many national and international guidelines and recommendations, including the consensus statement from the ADA and EASD, have been updated to include these results and therefore optimize treatment approaches. Although, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, NICE postponed updating recommendations for SGLT‐2i and GLP‐1RA classes as some trials are still ongoing, the current evidence base of these agents has been evaluated by international guidelines groups recognizing their benefits. We therefore recommend evaluating individual's cardiovascular risk factors before escalating diabetes therapy and considering anti‐hyperglycaemics with proven cardiovascular benefit, to improve long‐term outcomes, and reduce unplanned health resource use additionally. Formularies wishing to reduce the burden of care of diabetes should consider these latest guidelines as soon as possible to enable clinicians to maximize diabetes treatment.

### Cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose-lowering drugs or strategies in type 2 diabetes [^115nr3F6]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Few trials of glucose-lowering drugs or strategies in people with type 2 diabetes have investigated cardiovascular outcomes, even though most patients die from cardiovascular causes despite the beneficial effects of lipid-reducing and blood pressure-lowering treatments. The evidence-based reduction in risk of microvascular disease with glucose lowering has resulted in guidelines worldwide recommending optimisation of glycosylated haemoglobin, but no trial results have shown unequivocal cardiovascular risk reduction with glucose lowering. However, results of the post-trial follow-up of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, and of a meta-analysis of the four glucose-lowering outcome trials completed to date, suggest about a 15% cardiovascular relative risk reduction per 1% decrement in HbA1c. The 2008 US Food and Drug Administration industry guidance for licensing of antidiabetic drugs greatly increased the number of cardiovascular outcome trials in diabetes, but most trials opted for non-inferiority designs aiming primarily to show absence of cardiovascular toxicity in the shortest possible time. This unintended consequence of the new regulations has meant that the potential long-term benefits, and the possible risks of new therapies, are not being assessed effectively. Also, essential head-to-head trials of therapies for this complex progressive disease, to answer issues such as how best to achieve and maintain optimum glycaemia without promoting weight gain or hypoglycaemia, are not being undertaken. In this Series paper, we summarise randomised controlled cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes, provide an overview of ongoing trials and their limitations, and speculate on how future trials could be made more efficient and effective.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^1132jRiU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: we recommend modifying the dietary habits and adapting the novel proven dietary interventions like medical nutritional therapy for the management of T2DM and CVD (Grade A)

The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial was one of the major trials that evaluated benefits of lifestyle intervention. The study proved no direct benefits of intense lifestyle interventions (dietary restrictions, weight loss, etc.) on the CV mortality. The benefits observed with this study were mostly on glycemic control.

For a strict control of T2DM and its subsequent impact on the CV risk, it is important to look into the glycaemic index (GI = blood glucose response 2 h after intake of 100 g of food ÷ blood glucose response on intake of 100 g glucose) and glycaemic load (GL = carbohydrate content of the item × its GI ÷ 100) of an individual food item. Multiple studies have concluded the beneficial effects of diet with low GI (< 55) on the improvement of T2DM and its complications. Diets with low GL (≤ 10) have also shown benefits in managing T2DM and reducing complications in several studies. Patients with CVDs are advised to reduce the saturated fats intake and improve the mono-unsaturated fat intake to prevent or ameliorate further worsening of the condition.

The novel dietary interventions such as medical nutritional therapy (MNT) mainly target management of blood glucose and CV risk factors by reducing the risk for diabetes-related complications and optimal co-ordination of dietary intake with pharmacological therapies to achieve a favourable outcome. Two basic aspects of MNT include dietary quality and energy restriction. Strategies directed at both dimensions can improve glycaemic control.

MNT not only aims to control blood glucose, but also to improve other co-morbidities such as dyslipidaemia, obesity, and hypertension. MNT can be utilised as a primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention measure in T2DM. Primary prevention measures of MNT are by modifying diets in high-risk individuals (such as pre-diabetes, central obesity etc.) to prolong or prevent the onset of T2DM. Secondary prevention measures aim to achieve tight glycaemic control by dietary modification; in turn, reducing diabetic complications in patients with T2DM. Tertiary prevention measures are to manage diabetes-related complications such as CVDs or renal diseases in those with T2DM. Likewise, patients at risk or history of CVD can also prevent further consequences by modifying diet to one of the four diet patterns that have been evidently proven to be effective in such cases: low fat diet, low carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet, and DASH diet (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet).

### Lipid control in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111LmhyU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In an effort to provide internists and other primary care physicians with effective management strategies for diabetes care, the Clinical Efficacy Assessment Subcommittee (CEAS) of the American College of Physicians (ACP) decided to develop guidelines on the management of dyslipidemia, particularly hypercholesterolemia, in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The CEAS commissioned a systematic review of the currently available evidence on the management of lipids in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The evidence review is presented in a background paper in this issue. On the basis of this systematic review, the CEAS developed recommendations that the ACP Board of Regents then approved as policy. The target audience for this guideline is all clinicians who care for patients with type 2 diabetes. The target patient population is all persons with type 2 diabetes, including those who already have some form of microvascular complication and, of particular importance, premenopausal women. The recommendations are as follows. RECOMMENDATION 1: Lipid-lowering therapy should be used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity for all patients (both men and women) with known coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. RECOMMENDATION 2: Statins should be used for primary prevention against macrovascular complications in patients (both men and women) with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors. RECOMMENDATION 3: Once lipid-lowering therapy is initiated, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be taking at least moderate doses of a statin. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking statins, routine monitoring of liver function tests or muscle enzymes is not recommended except in specific circumstances.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of CVD (lipid-lowering therapy), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate high-intensity statin therapy to obtain an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL-C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) in patients with diabetes and ASCVD. Add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor with proven benefit in this population if this goal is not achieved on maximum tolerated statin therapy.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) cardiovascular risk reduction — SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and SGLT2 inhibitors also substantially diminish the risks of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Although the exact mechanisms of cardiovascular and renal benefits remain uncertain and appear to exceed direct glucose-lowering effects, data proving that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs improve outcomes in patients with T2D and cardiovascular disease have triggered a paradigm shift beyond glucose control toward comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.
