## Question

Does hypercoagulable workup need to be sent for 45 year old male with central vein occlusion without known etiology. Please include specific labs which should be sent as part of work up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a hypercoagulable workup is indicated for a 45-year-old man with central retinal vein occlusion and no identified etiology, and if so, which specific laboratory tests should be ordered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is a retinal vein occlusion versus another central venous occlusion. Then, I should verify age-related risk stratification and guideline direction for testing. Next, I will review the evidence base for thrombophilia prevalence and yield in this scenario. After that, I need to check which specific tests have the highest diagnostic yield and how to time them. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline the exact lab panel and follow-up plan, including when not to test and why.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Central vein occlusion in ophthalmology almost always refers to central retinal vein occlusion, which is a venous thrombotic event of the retinal circulation. The question is whether, in a 45-year-old man with otherwise unexplained CRVO, a hypercoagulable workup changes management or prognosis, and which tests are most appropriate if we proceed.

> Next, I should review age-related guidance. Wait, let me verify the threshold. The American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern advises that patients under about 50 years of age with CRVO are reasonable candidates for a hypercoagulable evaluation, whereas older patients with typical vascular risk factors generally do not require thrombophilia testing. At 45, this patient falls into the younger group where testing can be considered, especially when no clear etiology is identified [^115PhaYt].

> I will now examine the evidence for yield. In a large claims-based cohort of patients under 50 with CRVO, 11.5% were diagnosed with a hypercoagulable state within one year, and testing was performed in only 38%, suggesting under-testing but also a meaningful diagnostic yield in this age group. Importantly, the prevalence of thrombophilia was similar in those with and without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, so absence of classic risks does not preclude a clotting disorder in younger patients [^1147aWKy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm which tests actually matter. Observational and case-control data in younger CRVO patients consistently show that antiphospholipid antibodies and elevated homocysteine are the most commonly identified abnormalities, whereas common hereditary thrombophilias like factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A are less frequent and not strong standalone drivers. Thus, if I test, I should prioritize antiphospholipid antibodies and homocysteine, and consider a targeted hereditary panel only if clinical suspicion is higher or results would change management [^111WV9Lz] [^115cMV1E] [^11369CwC].

> Let me think about timing and preanalytical pitfalls. I should double-check that antiphospholipid testing is done at least 12 weeks after the thrombotic event and off anticoagulation when feasible, with repeat confirmation if positive, to avoid false positives from acute-phase effects. Similarly, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin should be interpreted cautiously if drawn during acute thrombosis or while on anticoagulation, and abnormal results should be repeated to confirm persistence before labeling a hereditary deficiency [^1175gGff] [^1121RWrb].

> Now, I should specify the laboratory panel. Given the age and unexplained CRVO, a reasonable, evidence-aligned approach is to order antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, anti–β2-glycoprotein I IgG/IgM) with planned repeat testing if positive, fasting homocysteine, and a targeted hereditary thrombophilia panel including factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and functional assays for antithrombin, protein C, and protein S. I need to ensure that protein S activity is interpreted with awareness of acute-phase and hormonal confounders, and that any low results are confirmed off therapy and in steady state [^113xtdb6] [^112hie2h] [^1139Up4e] [^112igRvH] [^1118nU6a].

> But wait, what if I over-test low-yield markers? I should confirm that I avoid low-value tests. Routine inclusion of MTHFR polymorphisms, factor VIII, factor IX, factor XI, PAI-1, or global assays like thrombin generation is not supported for CRVO workups and should not be ordered in this context, as they do not meaningfully change management or prognosis in retinal vein occlusion [^112hie2h].

> Next, I should review how results would change management. If antiphospholipid syndrome is confirmed, that supports indefinite anticoagulation after a first unprovoked venous event, which would alter duration decisions. If a high-risk thrombophilia such as antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency is found, that also strengthens the case for extended anticoagulation. Conversely, a negative panel does not negate the need for standard-duration anticoagulation in unprovoked CRVO, but it may influence the decision to extend therapy in shared decision-making discussions [^113xtdb6] [^112hie2h].

> I should also consider the broader vascular risk context. Even if thrombophilia testing is negative, patients with CRVO have higher long-term risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, so I need to ensure aggressive modification of traditional risk factors and coordinate with primary care for secondary prevention strategies, independent of any thrombophilia results [^115PhaYt].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is yes, a hypercoagulable workup is reasonable in a 45-year-old man with unexplained CRVO, given his age and the potential to uncover antiphospholipid syndrome or a hereditary thrombophilia that could inform anticoagulation duration. I would order antiphospholipid antibodies with confirmatory testing if positive, fasting homocysteine, and a targeted panel of factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and functional antithrombin, protein C, and protein S, ensuring proper timing off anticoagulation and repeating any abnormal results before making a hereditary diagnosis. I would avoid low-yield tests and counsel that results may not change acute management but could influence duration of anticoagulation and family planning [^115PhaYt] [^1147aWKy] [^113xtdb6] [^112hie2h].

In a 45-year-old male with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and no identifiable etiology, **targeted hypercoagulable testing is reasonable** because age under 50 increases the likelihood of an underlying thrombophilia [^115PhaYt]. The most informative tests are **antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I)** and **homocysteine**, which have the strongest association with CRVO in younger patients [^111WV9Lz] [^115cMV1E]. Consider **factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and protein C, protein S, and antithrombin** if results would change management or if there is a personal/family history of thrombosis [^112hie2h] [^113mUKHq]. Routine broad panels are not recommended; test selection should be individualized and timed off anticoagulation to avoid false results [^112hie2h] [^113xtdb6].

---

## Indications for hypercoagulable testing in CRVO

Hypercoagulable testing is **not universally indicated** for all CRVO patients; it is generally reserved for specific clinical scenarios. In patients under 50 years of age, the likelihood of an underlying thrombophilia is higher, and testing may be considered when no clear etiology is identified [^115PhaYt]. Additional indications include recurrent thrombotic events, a strong family history of thrombosis, or thrombosis at unusual sites [^113K3Ztt].

---

## Specific laboratory tests recommended

When hypercoagulable testing is indicated, the following **laboratory tests** are commonly recommended:

| **Test category** | **Specific tests** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Acquired thrombophilia | - Antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies) <br/> - Homocysteine | - Strongly associated with CRVO in younger patients [^111WV9Lz] [^115cMV1E] <br/> - Homocysteine is a modifiable risk factor |
| Inherited thrombophilia | - Factor V Leiden mutation <br/> - Prothrombin G20210A mutation <br/> - Protein C activity <br/> - Protein S activity <br/> - Antithrombin III activity | - Less common but may be clinically significant <br/> - Testing is individualized based on clinical suspicion and family history [^112hie2h] [^113mUKHq] |
| Additional tests | - Complete blood count (CBC) <br/> - Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) <br/> - Lipid profile <br/> - HbA1c <br/> - Thyroid function tests | - Evaluate for common systemic risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and thyroid dysfunction [^115cMV1E] |

## Clinical evidence supporting hypercoagulable testing in CRVO

Several studies have investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of hypercoagulable states in CRVO patients, particularly in younger individuals. A prospective observational study by Fong et al. (2002) found that **27% of patients under 56 years old with CRVO had at least one positive hypercoagulable test**, with hyperhomocysteinemia and antiphospholipid antibodies being significantly more common than in age-matched controls [^115cMV1E]. Similarly, a retrospective cohort study by Lin et al. (2022) reported that **11.5% of patients under 50 years old with CRVO were diagnosed with a hypercoagulable state within one year**, highlighting the potential value of testing in this population [^1147aWKy].

---

## Limitations and controversies

While hypercoagulable testing may identify underlying thrombophilias, several limitations and controversies exist:

- **Low yield**: Many patients with CRVO have normal hypercoagulable test results, and routine testing may not reveal an underlying abnormality [^111WV9Lz].
- **Cost and resource utilization**: Extensive testing can be costly and may not significantly alter clinical management or outcomes [^113K3Ztt].
- **False positives and negatives**: Laboratory results can be influenced by acute-phase reactions, anticoagulant use, and other factors, necessitating careful interpretation and, in some cases, repeat testing [^112hie2h].

---

## Clinical management implications

Positive hypercoagulable test results may influence clinical management by supporting the use of **anticoagulation therapy**, particularly in patients with recurrent thrombotic events or high-risk thrombophilias [^113xtdb6]. However, the decision to initiate anticoagulation should be individualized, balancing the risks and benefits, and considering patient-specific factors such as bleeding risk, lifestyle, and preferences [^114sSpWA].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Targeted testing**: In a 45-year-old male with CRVO and no identifiable etiology, targeted hypercoagulable testing is reasonable, focusing on antiphospholipid antibodies and homocysteine [^111WV9Lz] [^115cMV1E].
- **Individualized approach**: Testing for inherited thrombophilias (factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III) may be considered if results would change management or if there is a personal or family history of thrombosis [^112hie2h] [^113mUKHq].
- **Avoid routine broad panels**: Routine extensive hypercoagulable testing is not recommended due to low yield, potential false results, and limited impact on management [^113K3Ztt] [^112hie2h].

---

Hypercoagulable testing is **reasonable in a 45-year-old male with CRVO and no identifiable etiology**, with antiphospholipid antibodies and homocysteine as the most informative tests. Individualized testing for inherited thrombophilias may be considered based on clinical suspicion and family history, while avoiding routine broad panels.

### Laboratory evaluation of hypercoagulability with venous or arterial thrombosis [^116u9it3]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide recommendations for hypercoagulation testing for patients with venous, arterial, or neurovascular thrombosis, as reflected in the medical literature and the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field.

Data Sources, Extraction, and Synthesis

The authors extensively examined the literature and current practices, and prepared a draft manuscript with preliminary recommendations. The draft manuscript was circulated to each of the expert participants (n = 30) in the consensus conference prior to the convening of the conference. The manuscript and recommendations were then presented at the conference for discussion. Recommendations were accepted if a consensus of the 28 experts attending the conference was reached. The discussions were also used to revise the manuscript into its final form.

Conclusions

The resulting article provides 17 recommendations for hypercoagulation testing in the setting of venous, arterial, or neurovascular thrombosis. The supporting evidence for test selection is analyzed and cited, and consensus recommendations for test selection are presented. Issues for which a consensus was not reached at the conference are also discussed.

### Hypercoagulable States and central retinal vein occlusion [^111WV9Lz]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Central retinal vein occlusion is a common cause of permanent visual loss. Work up and laboratory evaluation of patients requires the clinician to rule out hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and glaucoma. Patients without an identifiable risk factor are often subject to extensive testing for primary and secondary thrombophilias. The purpose this paper is to review the literature to determine which of these tests is associated with central retinal vein occlusion. Antiphospholipid antibodies and elevated plasma homocysteine levels appear to be the tests associated most commonly in patients with central retinal vein occlusion in most controlled studies. Primary thrombophilias are found rarely when screening patients with central retinal vein occlusion. Extensive testing for thrombophilias is not warranted in the vast majority of patients with central retinal vein occlusion. Older patients with any of the common vascular risk factors do not require thrombophilic screening. By carefully selecting the patients who are evaluated for thrombophilias, the likelihood of finding true-positive tests is increased.

### When to suspect hypercoagulability and how to investigate it [^114H3e3w]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The authors summarize the current knowledge in the area of novel risk factors for venous thrombosis, both genetic and acquired causes of hypercoagulability. Because the list of genetic defects that predispose carriers to develop thrombosis has increased significantly in recent years, along with the available assays to test for them, hypercoagulability has been a subject of much discussion. This review highlights the issues on hypercoagulability that pathologists who are not specialists in coagulation should be familiar with, in order to provide consultation to other physicians. An educated approach to the diagnosis of this newly described group of disorders will ensure more cost-effective and efficient care to patients at risk.

### Retinal vein occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^115PhaYt]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Systemic evaluation in RVO — the extent of the systemic evaluation is dependent on the patient's age and medical history. Discussion with the primary care physician is important, because a patient who has had an RVO is at risk for developing an RVO in the fellow eye and has a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular accidents. Clear guidelines on systemic testing are lacking, and referral to hematology or internal medicine specialists should also be considered in patients under 50 years of age for a possible hypercoagulable workup.

### Thrombophilia: common questions on laboratory assessment and management [^1133SRy8]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombophilia is an inherited or acquired predisposition to thrombosis. This article reviews the clinical manifestations of thrombophilia and addresses common questions on laboratory assessment and management: what are the potential indications for thrombophilia testing, who should be tested, what tests should be requested, when should testing be performed, and how should the test results affect primary prevention, acute therapy, and secondary prophylaxis of thrombosis.

### Thrombophilia testing has limited usefulness in clinical decision-making and should be used selectively [^113K3Ztt]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes evaluation for hypercoagulable state, especially if the VTE occurs in young patients, is recurrent, or is associated with a positive family history. These laboratory tests are costly, and surprisingly, there is little evidence showing that testing leads to improved clinical outcomes. Evidence based on observational prospective studies suggests that optimal duration of anticoagulation should be based on clinical risks resulting in VTE, such as transient, permanent, and idiopathic or unprovoked risks, and less on abnormal thrombophilia values. Thrombophilia screening is important in a subgroup of clinical scenarios, such as when there is clinical suspicion of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, heparin resistance, or warfarin necrosis; with thrombosis occurring in unusual sites (such as mesenteric or cerebral deep venous thrombosis); and for pregnant women or those seeking pregnancy or considering estrogen-based agents. Thrombophilia screening is not likely to be helpful in most cases of first-time unprovoked VTE in the setting of transient risks, active malignant disease, deep venous thrombosis of upper extremity veins or from central lines, two or more VTEs, or arterial thrombosis with pre-existing atherosclerotic risk factors. The desire by both patient and physician for a scientific explanation of the clotting event may alone lead to testing, and if so, it should be with the understanding that an abnormal test result will likely not change management, and normal results do not accurately exclude a thrombophilic defect because there are likely factors yet to be discovered. Such false assumptions may lead to shorter durations of treatment than are optimal.

### Hypercoagulability testing and hypercoagulable disorders in young central retinal vein occlusion patients [^1147aWKy]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine frequency of hypercoagulability testing and hypercoagulable states in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) younger than 50 years.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

Deidentified patients younger than 50 years with newly diagnosed CRVO from a national insurance claims database.

Methods

The de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (Optum) containing medical claims from a commercial and Medicare Advantage insurance database was used. All outpatient medical claims (office visits, associated diagnoses, and laboratory testing) and demographic data for each beneficiary during their enrollment were accessible.

Main Outcome Measures

Prevalence of (1) laboratory hypercoagulable workup within 90 days of CRVO diagnosis, (2) new diagnosis of a hypercoagulable state within 1 year of CRVO diagnosis, and (3) diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hyperlipidemia.

Results

One thousand one hundred eighty-one patients met inclusion criteria. Six hundred seventy-one patients (56.8%) were men, 450 patients (38.1%) had undergone hypercoagulable testing within 90 days, and 136 patients (11.5%) were diagnosed with a hypercoagulable state within 1 year after CRVO diagnosis. This proportion was similar between those patients with DM, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia (10.5% [65/620]) and those without (12.7% [71/561]; P = 0.28). Of the 136 patients diagnosed with a hypercoagulability state, 68.4% (93/136) had undergone testing within 90 days of CRVO diagnosis and 31.6% (43/136) did not. Of those who had not undergone hypercoagulability testing, 5.9% (43/731) were diagnosed with a hypercoagulable state within 1 year compared with 20.7% (93/450) in those who were tested (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The prevalence of a hypercoagulable state within 1 year of CRVO diagnosis in patients younger than 50 years was 11.5%, and the prevalence was similar between patients with atherosclerotic risk factors and those without. Rate of testing was only 38.1%. Future research should examine the usefulness of uniform hypercoagulable testing in young CRVO patients.

### Hypercoagulability: too many tests, too much conflicting data [^111VcMQh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2002). Low credibility.

It is now possible to identify hereditary and acquired risk factors in a substantial percentage of patients presenting with a venous thrombotic event. The clinician is faced with an ever-growing number of laboratory tests that can be ordered in such patients, and there is considerable uncertainty as to how this information should be utilized in patient management. Some have argued that widespread testing of thrombosis patients for prothrombotic abnormalities such as the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has been prematurely adopted into clinical practice as there are few data that their identification leads to improved clinical outcomes. Dr. Rosendaal provides an overview of the epidemiology of venous thrombosis with an emphasis on hereditary and acquired risk factors. The presentation will include information obtained from properly designed case-control studies as well as family studies. While some have suggested treatment strategies for managing patients with hereditary thrombophilia with prior thrombotic events or for managing patients undergoing procedures associated with increased thrombotic risk, clinical decision making is complicated by the need to assess the risk of recurrence and the likely benefit of prolonged anticoagulation versus the associated bleeding risk. Drs. Bauer, Heit, and Rosendaal discuss their approaches to patient management. Case presentations are used to illustrate the impact of laboratory test results on decisions.

### Laboratory tests for antithrombin deficiency [^1139Up4e]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary antithrombin deficiency is a hypercoagulable state associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis. The recommended initial test for antithrombin is an activity (functional) assay. The advantages and disadvantages of the various testing options are presented. The causes of acquired antithrombin deficiency are much more common than hereditary deficiency. Therefore, this article describes the appropriate steps to take when antithrombin activity is low, in order to confirm or exclude a hereditary deficiency. The causes of falsely normal results are also described, including direct thrombin inhibitors. Am. J. Hematol. 85:947–950, 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

### Hypercoagulable disorders… [^112yKCqW]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Thomas1 has proposed in the November 12, 2001, issue of the ARCHIVES a practical review of hypercoagulability syndromes. We would like to comment on several points. Indications of thrombophilia screening remain a matter of debate and we regret that this point was not discussed in the article. Which screening to use and for which patients is a very difficult problem that has been discussed elsewhere and that must not be overlooked. 2 In the summary, Thomas stated that hypercoagulability syndrome can be "correctly diagnosed" in approximately 80% to 90% of patients. This appears to be a rather presumptuous affirmation. If this means that extensive workup will lead to identification of coagulation abnormalities in this percentage of patients, this is probably true, even if perhaps a little optimistic.

But as emphasized by Thomas himself, patients with antithrombin deficiency may have no problem until they undergo surgery or any other risk-associated situation and, in fact, the majority of carriers of antithrombin deficiency will never have thrombosis. We should probably in most cases leave the concept of thrombophilia/hypercoagulability as an explicative factor, to think in terms of risk factor. We do not "explain" a myocardial infarction by hypercholesterolemia; it is "just" an important risk factor. This way of thinking will perhaps facilitate therapeutic decisions.

Thus, in the Figure that summarizes the recommended approach to treatment of hypercoagulability, Thomas suggests that people having more than 1 coagulation abnormality should be candidates for "lifelong" anticoagulation after 1 episode of thrombosis, whereas people with recurrent thrombosis but no defect identified should be treated with "standard" therapy. We think this doesn't really reflect the view of the author but the Figure can be misleading and should be corrected. For instance, a 20-year-old man who has severe pulmonary embolism in the absence of favoring conditions has indeed thrombophilia, whatever the result of hypercoagulability workup, and should receive long-term anticoagulation. Last, the Figure suggests that family studies may be prothrombin promoter gene: this attitude is extremely questionable because of the absence of therapeutic consequences in the family.

### Hypercoagulable syndromes: evaluation and management strategies for acute limb ischemia [^115NHyGg]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Acute limb ischemia secondary to peripheral arterial thrombosis is a relatively uncommon but ominous form of vascular accident. Select inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states appear to contribute to an initial arterial thrombosis and, more importantly, recurrent thrombotic events. Mounting interest in hypercoagulability, the increased availability of hypercoagulable state "profiles", and enhanced ability to identify an abnormality in tested patients have promoted widespread testing. Unfortunately, widespread testing has had a limited beneficial impact on the management of acute limb ischemia. Ideally, costly and specialized testing should be limited to situations in which the results will have a tangible impact on patient care. Clear goals of testing should be determined before testing is performed. This article addresses a practical approach to hypercoagulable state testing in patients with acute limb ischemia with a focus on abnormalities that impact patient management.

### The thrombophilias: well-defined risk factors with uncertain therapeutic implications [^114ojSVz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Discovery of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has greatly increased the percentage of patients in whom venous thrombosis can be attributed to hereditary thrombophilia. The first step in the diagnostic approach to all patients with venous thrombosis consists of a careful history and physical examination combined with routine laboratory testing to characterize the severity of the thrombotic condition and determine the presence of any of the acquired causes of hypercoagulability. The second step is to consider screening for the causes of hereditary and acquired thrombophilia in selected subsets of patients. The selection of patients for testing, the choice of tests to perform, and the timing of the testing are important and challenging issues to consider. Routine testing would be warranted if the identification of abnormalities led to an alteration in the type or duration of initial anticoagulant therapy or the use of long-term prophylactic anticoagulation. The available data, however, do not yet indicate that most patients with defined thrombophilic states should be managed any differently than patients without identifiable abnormalities. On the basis of relative prevalences of the various thrombophilias, patients can be classified as "strongly" or "weakly" thrombophilic depending on their thrombotic histories. Management considerations and guidelines are offered for patients who are found to have one or more defined abnormalities, hereditary or otherwise. The future identification of additional laboratory abnormalities predisposing patients to thrombosis, coupled with prospective clinical trials, should enable us to better identify patients at high risk for recurrence who will benefit from prolonged anticoagulant prophylaxis.

### Laboratory evaluation of hypercoagulable States in patients with central retinal vein occlusion who are less than 56 years of age [^115cMV1E]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate whether hypercoagulability plays a role in thrombus formation in patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) who are less than 56 years of age.

Design

Prospective, observational case series with retrospective comparative controls.

Participants and Controls

Participants included 55 consecutive patients with CRVO less than 56 years of age. The laboratory's age-matched control groups were used to compare results for the same tests.

Methods

Fifty-five patients with CRVO less than 56 years old (mean age, 44 years) underwent laboratory evaluation for homocysteine, activated protein C resistance, protein C activity, protein S activity, antithrombin III activity, antiphospholipid antibodies, and anticardiolipin antibodies. The results were compared with previously drawn age-matched control groups obtained by the same laboratory for statistical significance.

Main Outcome Measures

Patients were considered to have a positive test if their results were outside the laboratory's established range.

Results

Fifteen of 55 patients (27%) had one positive test result suggesting hypercoagulability. Compared with the control groups, these patients less than 56 years old with CRVO had a higher incidence of coagulation abnormalities by laboratory testing. Among the parameters tested, hyperhomocysteinemia and circulating antiphospholipid antibodies were significantly more common in the CRVO patients (P < 0.05) compared with age-matched controls.

Conclusions

Hypercoagulability may play a role in the pathogenesis of CRVO in patients less than 56 years old. The cause of CRVO remains multifactorial, and laboratory tests suggesting hypercoagulable states alone cannot account for the cause in most of these patients less than 56 years of age. The authors recommend examining blood pressure, intraocular pressure, complete blood count, glucose levels, and a lipid panel on all patients with CRVO. When tests for these common risk factors for CRVO are negative, consider ordering selected tests in young patients with CRVO to rule out thrombophilias, especially in patients with bilateral CRVO, a history of previous thrombosis, or family history of thrombosis.

### Hemi-central retinal vein occlusion as a rare manifestation of the hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 [^116ozPid]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

To date, COVID-19 has no definite effective targeted therapy, and management is primarily supportive. Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is frequently caused by systemic risk factors posing hypercoagulable states. In April 2020, a female patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease presented with 2days of loose, watery stools, nasal congestion and severe lethargy. The patient denied dyspnoea or fever. A week after the initial symptoms, the patient reported decreased vision from the left eye. Dilated funduscopy and fluorescein angiography suggested hemi-CRVO. The patient refused intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor agents because of non-severe visual loss. Testing was positive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies; reverse transcription PCR was not available. Vision improved within 3weeks of presentation. We recommend that clinicians keep a high suspicion for acute onset of thrombotic events in patients with COVID-19 and thrombotic predisposing risk factors.

### Central retinal artery occlusion: a stroke of the eye [^115nN3Sk]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with CRAO are at significant risk of future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. They often have undiagnosed risk factors that may be modifiable for secondary vascular prevention. The NASCET study showed that the overall vascular risk (including myocardial ischaemia and cardiovascular death) is as high for patients with a retinal ischaemia as it is for those with a cerebral TIA, emphasising the need for TIA prevention. There are several evidenced based recommended guidelines for workup of these patients for TIA prevention such as the NICE guidelines for TIA and American Academy of Neurology TIA guidelines. A collation of the recommended tests based on the guidelines is included Table 1. Workup should include vascular imaging and bloods for cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g. lipid studies, HbA1c). Neuroimaging should also be given consideration and 30% of acute CRAO and 25% of BRAO patients have associated cerebral ischaemic changes on medical resonance imaging. In patients suspected to have atrial fibrillation, Holter monitoring and echocardiography may also be of benefit. Less commonly, RAOs can occur in individuals under the age of 50 with no vascular risk factors. In these patients, a more extensive investigation panel including a hypercoagulable screen (protein C&S, factor V Leiden, anti-phospholipid antibody), vasculitis screen (ANA, ENA, ANCA, ACE) and blood film (myeloproliferative or sickle cell disease) should also be ordered.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to evaluation of portal vein thrombosis, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not obtain a hypercoagulable workup in patients with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis in the absence of additional thromboemboli, laboratory abnormalities, or family history suggestive of thrombophilia.

### Laboratory evaluation of hypercoagulable States in patients with central retinal vein occlusion who are less than 56 years of age [^115kxg4x]. Retina (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate whether the results of early tests for hypercoagulability are correlated with the development of central retinal vein occlusion risk factors later in life and to evaluate the necessity of these tests in younger patients.

Methods

This was a retrospective, observational case series. From January 1995 to December 2014, 55 patients aged below 56 years with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) were enrolled in the study. Laboratory evaluations for homocysteine, activated protein C resistance, protein C activity, protein S activity, antithrombin III activity, antiphospholipid antibodies, and anticardiolipin antibodies were obtained at the onset of CRVO. After 24 to 205 months, the presence of risk factors for CRVO such as hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, and glaucoma was determined. Bilateral correlation and logistic regression were performed to determine the correlations between the results of the initial laboratory tests and the diagnosis of CRVO risk factors.

Results

The median follow-up was 168.5 months. Five patients completed at least 24 months of follow-up, 9 patients completed at least 5 years, and 36 patients completed at least 10 years. Five patients had no or less than 24 months' follow-up. Fourteen of 50 patients (28%) had at least one positive test result at the onset of CRVO. At the end of follow-up, 11 patients had been diagnosed with obesity (22%), 29 with hypertension (58%), 21 with hyperlipidemia (42%), 24 with diabetes (8%), 5 with sleep apnea (10%), and 8 with glaucoma (16%). Among 36 patients with a minimum 10 years' follow-up, 30 (83%) developed at least one common risk factor, and none experienced any thromboembolic events. There were no correlations between test results and the diagnosis of any risk factors in patients with a minimum of 2, 5, or 10 years' follow-up (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

The results of laboratory tests evaluating hypercoagulability in young patients with CRVO are not correlated with later-developed commonly known risk factors. Many of the common risk factors were present by the end of the study, suggesting that they still remain the core etiology for the disease. The value of the thrombophilic tests is brought into question, as none of the patients demonstrated further clotting or any unusual thrombi with long-term follow-up.

Similar general conclusions as for recommendation 1 are valid for this recommendation. The information with median prevalence and ranges of prevalence provided in Table 3 can be used to estimate the effect in a specific (geographic) population as well as for specific thrombophilia defects.

Should thrombophilia testing be performed for patients with an unspecified type of VTE to guide treatment duration?

Recommendation 6

For patients with an unspecified type of VTE who have completed primary short-term treatment, the ASH guideline panel suggests not performing thrombophilia testing to guide anticoagulant treatment duration (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Remarks:

- Whenever anticoagulant treatment decisions are being made without considering whether the VTE is provoked or unprovoked, it is advisable not to test for thrombophilia, to start treatment, and to refer the patient to an expert for further decision making.
- Thrombosis experts would consider the population "with an unspecified type of VTE" (ie, without reference to provoked or unprovoked) as theoretical because determining if a clot is provoked or unprovoked is a standard way to stratify the risk of VTE recurrence and hence guide treatment decisions. However, in general clinical practice, which is the setting where thrombophilia testing is frequently performed, VTE is often managed regardless of circumstances qualifying the VTE as provoked or unprovoked (an unspecified type of VTE), and for this reason, the panel decided to address this question.
- A strategy with testing for thrombophilia would mean that patients with thrombophilia would receive indefinite anticoagulant treatment, and patients without thrombophilia would stop anticoagulant treatment.
- This recommendation refers to testing for hereditary and acquired types of thrombophilia.

### Clotting problems: diagnosis and management of underlying coagulopathies [^113KrS4Z]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Vessel wall injury, stasis, and blood hypercoagulable state are major predisposing factors of thrombosis. Although, a procoagulable factor is found in half of patients with venous thromboembolism, relatively little is known about coagulopathies that predispose to arterial thromboembolism or unexplained arterial revascularization thrombosis. Those hypercoagulable states can be inherited or acquired and related to either an increase of a procoagulable factor or a decrease of an anticoagulation agent. However, most thrombotic episodes seem to occur with additive combination of acquired and inherited predisposing factors. Therefore, controversy exists as to which patients and family members to test for thrombophilia and which patients to treat with life-long anticoagulation. The aim of this review is to provide a practical overview with guidelines for detecting, and treatment of, the principal underlying coagulopathies that a vascular surgeon should be aware of in his/her practice and for the care of patients with vascular disease.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^115JPF5U]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — diagnostic imaging and thrombophilia workup: The initial diagnosis of PVT in cirrhosis is established on Doppler ultrasound, which has 89%–93% sensitivity and 92%–99% specificity for PVT. Cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI should be performed to assess for concurrent hepatic malignancy, confirm diagnosis of PVT, characterize PVT by extent, degree of occlusion, chronicity, and establish a baseline for longitudinal assessment, and both CT and MRI have excellent sensitivity and specificity for PVT. Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboembolism or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia, and as portal hypertension is the main driver of PVT development in cirrhosis, routine screening for thrombophilic disorders is not warranted in the absence of risk factors such as personal history of additional thrombi, family history of thromboembolic disease, or laboratory evidence of bone marrow disorder.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^113FXjLy]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and research needs for this recommendation

When considering both recommendations (recommendations 11 and 12) to test individuals with a first- or second-degree family history of VTE and known antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency (high-risk thrombophilias), it is most sensible to selectively test for the known familial thrombophilia (recommendation 11) rather than testing for the entire panel (recommendation 12). This is because of the trivial additional number of VTE episodes prevented and major bleeds caused by a strategy of panel testing for all hereditary thrombophilias. This is not obvious when recommendation 12 is read in isolation from recommendation 11.

As general conclusions, the absolute risk estimates of VTE during minor provoking risk factors in individuals with a family history of VTE and thrombophilia in the absence of thromboprophylaxis are based on retrospective cohort studies with their inherent biases, and the panel used the best available evidence.

The guideline panel acknowledges the fact that our recommendations were based on risk increases for a first VTE for the various specific thrombophilia types. The panel realizes that the prevalence of hereditary thrombophilia differs geographically. It is therefore the aim of ASH to provide an online calculator to make calculations for specific thrombophilia defects and allow for the input of localized prevalence values.

The panel determined that it would be valuable to have direct evidence from high-quality studies comparing these interventions, but no such study has been performed.

For individuals with a family history of VTE and unknown thrombophilia status, should thrombophilia testing (using a panel of tests) be performed to guide the use of thromboprophylaxis for a minor provoking risk factor?

TVL and hypercoagulable states

The role of hypercoagulable states as a cause of TVL is unknown. Hypercoagulability can be caused by acquired or inherited coagulation disorders. A list of common inherited disorders is listed in Table 4. Acquired prothrombotic risk factors include immobilization, smoking, and hyperestrogenemia due to pregnancy or exogenous estrogen use. Although anticoagulation for inherited hypercoagulability may prevent vascular occlusions,–a number of recent reviews from the stroke literature have found no correlation between most hypercoagulable states and acute ischemic stroke, and state that there is no indication either for screening or for anticoagulation even if testing is positive.

Indications for thrombophilia testing after TVL should focus on patients with recurrent TVL, or patients with a personal or family history of thrombotic events. Of the inherited thrombophilias, only factor V Leiden was found to have an elevated odds ratio (1.99) for amaurosis fugax and TIA, but only lupus anticoagulant had an increased odds ratio (2.66) for ischemic stroke. Because hyperhomocysteinemia is reversible, testing for serum levels may be beneficial. One study including patients with TVL demonstrated 100% normalization of serum homocysteine levels after a median follow-up of 21 months after treatment with folic acid, vitamin B 6, and vitamin B 12. There is no high-level evidence to guide treatment for thrombophilia in the setting of TVL, however, because antiphospholipid antibodies have the highest risk of stroke, and homocysteine can be treated relatively easily with a folate-B 6 –B 12 combination;, these two tests are probably the most appropriate to order in typical TVL. On the other hand, patients with recurrent cryptogenic TVL and other thrombotic history may need a complete hypercoagulable workup, and could require anticoagulation.

Clinical Implications: Proactive Monitoring: High-risk patients (glaucoma, metabolic disorders) should undergo perioperative blood rheology tests and lipid profiling. Targeted Interventions: Early anti-VEGF therapy and short-term anticoagulation may disrupt thrombotic cascades without delaying surgical recovery. Multidisciplinary Collaboration: Coordinated care among ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, and hematologists is essential for optimizing outcomes. Innovative Perspective: To our knowledge, this is the first report linking retinitis pigmentosa-associated vascular changes to postoperative CRVO pathogenesis, proposing a novel "triple-hit" model. Future studies should validate this model through multicenter registries and explore personalized anticoagulant protocols in similar cohorts.

### Hypercoagulability syndromes… [^1175gGff]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Activated protein C resistance is the most common inherited disorder that causes hypercoagulability. Factor V Leiden is present in 5% of whites but virtually absent in Africans and Asians. However, 1% of African Americans have the mutation, reflecting racial mixing. 10 It results from a point mutation in the factor V gene, which causes the substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 506. 11 Consequently, 1 of 3 activated protein C cleavage sites is lost. The result is an impaired inactivation of factor V by activated protein C. Venous thromboses and fetal wastage may occur. It is not an important risk factor for arterial disease except in the presence of smoking or other known risk factors. 15, 16 Those with factor V Leiden have a 2- to 3-fold risk for venous thrombosis compared with healthy subjects.

) increases 10% and the risk for recurrent DVT increases 24%. 25 Levels of coagulation factor VIII are not elevated because of the acute-phase reaction but appear to be constitutively increased in most patients with thrombosis, since coagulation factor VIII levels are elevated independently of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, and 94% of patients continue to have high levels throughout long-term follow-up. 26, 27 Pregnancy and oral contraceptive use may also raise levels. The optimal time to investigate is at least 10 days after warfarin therapy is stopped, since both warfarin and acute thrombosis decrease protein C levels. Levels below 55% of normal are likely to be genetically deficient; 55% to 65% is borderline. Abnormal results should always be repeated for confirmation and family studies performed.

43 Elevated homocysteine levels are thought to cause thromboses via several mechanisms, including decreased protein C activation, increased factor V activity, induction of endothelial cell tissue factor activity, inhibition of thrombomodulin expression and activation, decreased antithrombin activity, and enhanced affinity of lipoprotein and fibrin. 44–46.

We suggest performing thrombophilia workup for all pediatric patients with RVO or SOVT. In patients with thrombophilia risk factors or patients with additional thrombi, we highly recommend initiating anticoagulation therapy. There is a need for more research in order to determine the optimal management strategy.

### Central retinal vein occlusion resulting from anomalous retinal vascular anatomy in a 24-year-old man [^1155GaJn]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

An otherwise healthy 24-year-old man presented with a painless decrease of vision in the left eye for 2 days. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left eye. Anterior exam was unremarkable and funduscopic exam in the left eye revealed retinal hemorrhages in all four quadrants with venous dilation and tortuosity consistent with central retinal vein occlusion. Fluorescein angiography revealed delayed venous filling with neither leakage nor vasculitis. A comprehensive work-up that included infectious, inflammatory, and hypercoagulability studies was unremarkable, and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits was unrevealing. After 2 months, best-corrected visual acuity returned to 20/20–2 in the left eye. Upon closer review of the vascular anatomy in the left eye, a bifurcation of the central retinal artery at the level of the optic disc was tightly intertwined with an undilated nasal retinal vein in a manner that appeared to compress the underlying central retinal vein, resulting in dilation and tortuosity of the remaining venous branches. The vessel wall damage, turbulent venous flow, and compressive mass effect resulting from the anomalous retinal vasculature relationship is the proposed mechanism of the central retinal vein occlusion. Careful attention to the retinal vascular anatomy is suggested to aid in assessing the risk of retinal vein occlusion in any age group.

For patients with CVT, this thrombophilia guideline has issued 2 separate recommendations, depending on whether the standard of care is to discontinue anticoagulant treatment after 3 to 6 months (suggesting to test) or to continue indefinitely (suggesting not to test). This is in part consistent with guidelines of the European Stroke Organization, which on the one hand suggest not testing for thrombophilia to prevent recurrent venous thrombosis but on the other hand suggest testing patients who have a high probability of carrying severe thrombophilia (ie, a personal and/or family history of venous thrombosis, a young age at CVT, CVT without a transient or permanent risk factor) to prevent recurrent VTE. Likewise, for patients with splanchnic venous thrombosis, the 2 recommendations, dependent on the standard of care, are partially consistent with the implicit guidance statement from the ISTH on the duration of anticoagulant treatment, where patients with high-risk thrombophilia are mentioned to likely benefit from indefinite anticoagulation. Once more, the novelty of our statements is not in the recommendations themselves but in the objective way we have used to examine the role of thrombophilia in light of the best available evidence.

### Central retinal vein occlusion and thrombophilia [^11369CwC]. Eye (2002). Low credibility.

Central retinal vein occlusion is one of the commonest vascular diseases of the eye. The pathogenesis is multifactorial with both local factors and systemic diseases being aetiologically important. Many thrombophilic conditions have recently been identified and studies looking at their potential role in CRVO have been undertaken. The aim of this review is to critically appraise these studies as to date many have given conflicting results, making it far from clear what role thrombophilic conditions play in CRVO. It appears that hyperhomocysteinaemia and antiphospholipid syndrome are causes of CRVO and there is evidence that disorders causing hypofibrinolysis may also be important. The common hereditary thrombophilic conditions however do not appear to be strong risk factors but larger studies are needed for a definitive answer.

### Patients with cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas may benefit from expanded hypercoagulability and cancer screening [^1145tJ8s]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) have been associated with dural sinus occlusion, and previous reports have suggested the association of hypercoagulability with some cases. But the prevalence of a hypercoagulable state has not been systematically analyzed in conjunction with laboratory markers and clinical manifestations, including history of thromboembolism or systemic malignancy. The authors hypothesize that laboratory or clinical evidence of a hypercoagulable state, including cancer, is commonly identifiable in consecutively identified patients with DAVFs, with implications for clinical management.

Methods

The retrospective cohort study included all patients older than 17 years with cranial DAVFs diagnosed at University of Chicago Medicine during a 6-year period, whose medical records and imaging results were reviewed for objective laboratory or clinical evidence of a hypercoagulable state, including malignancy. Each case was analyzed for implications on clinical management. Data were analyzed in relation to a systematic review of the literature on this association.

Results

Fifteen (88%) of 17 cases of DAVFs had laboratory (n = 8) or clinical evidence of a hypercoagulable state (thromboembolism [n = 8] or cancer [n = 6]). This hypercoagulability or cancer impacted clinical care in all 15 cases.

Conclusions

An underlying hypercoagulable state manifested by laboratory testing or clinically, including cancer, is staggeringly common. It is important to recognize this association, along with its impact on the management of the DAVFs and systemic diseases.

Conclusions and research needs for this recommendation

The guideline panel acknowledges the fact that our recommendation is based on calculations with prevalence and RR estimates for VTE for any type of thrombophilia. The ASH panel recommendation is in line with previously published cost-effectiveness analyses (see EtD). It is unlikely that further research will alter the recommendations on this specific question.

For women with a family history of VTE and unknown thrombophilia status, should thrombophilia testing (using a panel of tests) be performed to guide the use of COCs?

Recommendation 17

For women with a family history of VTE and unknown thrombophilia status in the family who are considering using COCs, the ASH guideline panel suggests not testing for hereditary thrombophilia (using a panel of tests) to guide the use of COC (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Remarks:

- Women with a family history of VTE and a known thrombophilia in the family are at higher risk of testing positive for thrombophilia and are therefore at higher risk for VTE. Another recommendation in this guideline addresses thrombophilia testing in this population (recommendation 19).
- A strategy with testing for hereditary thrombophilia (using a panel of tests) would mean that women with thrombophilia would not use COCs, and women without thrombophilia would use COCs.
- A positive family history is defined as having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE.

CRVO typically occurs in patients older than 50 years with risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and open angle glaucoma.CRVO in a young patient merits work-up for underlying compressive, hematologic, or autoimmune etiology.–Primary pulmonary hypertension has also been reported as the hemodynamic basis of CRVO in three patients in whom significant morbidity and mortality followed the vein occlusion.CRVO has been reported to occur in two young patients with anomalous retinal anatomy at the level of the optic nerve, with proposed mechanism for vein occlusion to include a combination of turbulent flow, increased intravascular volume, and pressure from the arteriolar side of the circulation causing a mechanical mass effect on the venous side. These changes, over time, are thought damage the vessel wall of the central retinal vein and lead to thrombosis and occlusion. These cases highlight the importance of careful inspection of the retinal vascular to aid in assessing the risk of retinal vein occlusion in age group. Thorough work-up and co-management with the patient's primary care physician is recommended.

We do acknowledge that conditional recommendations might be less appealing than strong ones to be applied to most patients and that applying conditional recommendations will require the education of patients and physicians to effectively elicit those preferences and appropriately use them for shared decision making. However, risk stratification is necessary to accomplish individualized optimal treatment, which makes our panel stand behind the present deliberations. Second, some of the recommendations may appear counterintuitive: for example, one may feel that it is inappropriate to test young people with COC-related VTE or patients with VTE provoked by transient nonsurgical risk factors, as their risk is generally considered too low for them to be candidates for lifelong treatment if they have thrombophilia. Against this uneasiness, we invite the reader to consider how reluctant one can be to treat a young patient with unprovoked VTE for life. These patients are not the majority of people enrolled in clinical trials, so we have little direct evidence about the need to treat them for life, yet that is the recommended approach. Furthermore, one would realize that cases of VTE related to COCs or nonsurgical risk factors are relatively few compared with the many more exposed to the same risk factors, and it is likely that a fraction of them might have a relevant provoking cofactor represented by thrombophilia. Others might be worried by the cost associated with testing for thrombophilia; for them, we note that irrespective of whether thrombophilia testing results will be used to start or withhold treatment, the cost of testing is negligible compared with the cost of lifelong anticoagulation (which we considered in our process), likely even after including indirect costs stemming from the treatment of additional events in untreated patients (which we did not consider). Finally, someone might be confused by having "divergent" recommendations for the same condition (thrombosis at unusual sites) depending on the standard of care adopted in a specific setting, whereby testing for thrombophilia is recommended to prolong treatment where the standard of care is short-term treatment duration and not recommended when the standard of care is long-term treatment for everyone. Under the perspective of choosing the best management option for patients with thrombophilia, patients with thrombophilia will indeed receive indefinite treatment because of both recommendations (because of testing in 1 case and regardless of testing in the other). Again, this is the result of a robust, pragmatic, and logical process that assessed the value of testing within the context in which the results of testing will be used.

### Type II protein C deficiency in a 16-year-old girl with central retinal vein occlusion [^115KAvBy]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of central retinal vein occlusion in the setting of type II protein C deficiency, and to describe the appropriate tests for detecting this clotting abnormality.

Design

Observational case report.

Methods

Retrospective review of clinical examination and laboratory findings.

Results

A 16-year-old girl was evaluated for progressive monocular vision loss occurring over a period of one month. Dilated fundus examination and fluorescein angiography revealed the presence of a central retinal vein occlusion. Hypercoagulable work-up demonstrated normal protein C antigen levels, but a marked reduction in protein C function, confirming a type II protein C deficiency.

Conclusions

Central retinal vein occlusion may be associated with type II protein C deficiency. Testing for protein C antigen levels and function is necessary for detection of both type I and type II protein C deficiency.

### Central retinal artery occlusion in a young child affected by COVID-19: a first case report [^115RfR2C]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a multitude of presentations including ophthalmic manifestations, as accurately described by several authors. Although the pathogenetic mechanism has not been well established yet, the virus seems to induce a remarkable inflammatory response, with consequent endothelial dysfunction and an overall prothrombotic and hypercoagulable state which predisposes to thrombotic disease in both venous and arterial circulation.

We conducted a detailed review of the literature, and as far as we know, no other cases of CRAO associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been documented in pediatric age. However, some cases have been described in adults, in addition to other ocular vascular occlusions. Kulkarni et al. presented a case of combined central retinal artery and vein occlusion (CRVO) in a 20-year-old boy. For what concerns pediatric population, retinal vasculitis has been described in a child five months after an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

Aims of this guideline and specific objectives

Thrombophilia, either acquired or hereditary, can be identified in many patients presenting with VTE.

The currently most commonly tested hereditary thrombophilias include deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S and the gain-of-function mutations FVL and PGM. Lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti–β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies, which are laboratory features of the acquired thrombophilic APS, are also generally included in a thrombophilia testing panel. These types of thrombophilias are rational components of a thrombophilia testing panel, as these are consistently found to be associated with VTE. This guideline refrains from providing guidance on other tests that in some laboratories are being included in thrombophilia test panels because these have been shown not to be associated with VTE (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms [MTHFRs] 677C→T, 1298A→C), or have not been conclusively associated with VTE (eg, factor VIII, factor IX, and factor XI activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), and the 4G/5G PAI-1 promoter polymorphism). It is important to note that results of thrombophilia tests should be interpreted with knowledge of clinical pitfalls in laboratory testing, most notably the possibility of finding acquired rather than inherited deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S with comorbidities or hormone exposure, as well as intraindividual fluctuations of anticoagulant proteins and the far from perfect diagnostic test characteristics of coagulation tests in general.

Thrombophilia testing is often performed in patients with VTE, particularly if they are young, have recurrent episodes, have thrombosis at unusual sites, or have a positive family history of the disease. Testing patients with VTE or relatives of patients with VTE and thrombophilia has a moderate to high chance of finding a positive test result, suggesting that the incremental value of knowing about the presence or absence of thrombophilia may be low. Thrombophilia testing can lead to overdiagnosis, defined as the labeling of a person with a disease or abnormal condition that would not have caused the person clinical harm if left undiscovered, although they may experience physical, psychological, or financial harm if the condition is discovered. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations about whether thrombophilia testing and tailoring management based on the test result would improve patient-important outcomes.

### Recurrent retinal vein occlusion in a patient with increased plasma levels of histidine-rich glycoprotein [^115iYi6c]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report an association between retinal vein occlusion and increased plasma levels of histidine-rich glycoprotein.

Design

Observational case report.

Methods

A 56-year-old woman presented with sudden and painless decrease of visual acuity of her right eye. Indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed retinal vein occlusion. She had experienced central retinal vein occlusion in this eye 6 years earlier.

Results

The patient's medical history was negative for cardiovascular risk factors. Further investigation into possible causes revealed increased values for histidine-rich glycoprotein.

Conclusions

When ordering laboratory tests in patients with retinal vein occlusion to rule out coagulation disorders, increased plasma levels of histidine-rich glycoprotein should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Selective screening may be helpful in identifying retinal vein occlusion patients with thrombophilic defects, especially in young individuals with recurrent retinal vein occlusion in the absence of recognized cardiovascular risk factors.

Central Retinal Vein Occlusion

Ophthalmic imaging such as fluorescein angiography (AF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) used to visualize the fundus of the eye in the case of central retinal vein occlusion in the course of COVID-19 did not show any differences in the image compared to retinal vein occlusion caused by other factors (Figure 3). Patients with COVID-19, regardless of the severity of the disease, duration, or systemic symptoms, often have hypercoagulability and increased inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, interleukin-6, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen and cytokines. Moreover, the hypoxia-induced coagulation cascade in pneumonia is enhanced by endothelial cell activation and tissue factor secretion as a result of hypoxia. Blood hypercoagulability as a result of COVID-19 disease is one of the main elements of pathology in the eyeballs of patients in the course of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and is independent of standard risk factors for central retinal vein thrombosis, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. It is noted in the literature that the cause of hypercoagulable state is unclear, whether the coagulation cascade is directly activated by the virus or may result from local or systemic inflammation. The mechanism is not fully understood and explained.

Normal results — genetic causes can only be identified in about 25% of White patients without a family history, and negative genetic testing results are unlikely to significantly reduce the recurrence risk derived from clinical and family history; patients' clinical management and implementation of a healthier lifestyle toward preventing recurrent VTE should not be altered because of a negative genetic testing result.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) discontinuation — abrupt cessation has theoretical and observed effects: There is a theoretical concern that abrupt VKA discontinuation may result in a temporary hypercoagulable state due to an imbalance in the rates of normalization of activity of the coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and the natural inhibitors protein C and protein S. Five small controlled trials (total n = 217) have addressed this issue; in four, primary outcomes were laboratory results suggestive of a hypercoagulable state and produced inconsistent results. Elevations tended to persist for 8 to 9 weeks regardless of discontinuation strategy, suggesting an unmasked prothrombotic state rather than a rebound phenomenon, and the thromboembolism event rate appeared similar between groups across the five studies.

The following constitutes key background information on disseminated intravascular coagulation:

- **Definition**: DIC is a clinicopathologic syndrome characterized by systemic activation of widespread coagulation resulting in severe bleeding and organ failure.
- **Pathophysiology**: DIC is mostly caused by hypercoagulation (infection, particularly sepsis) and hyperfibrinolysis (acute promyelocytic leukemia, obstetric diseases, or aortic aneurysms).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of DIC in the US is estimated at 18.6 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include latent and compensated activation of coagulation (no obvious clinical symptoms) and overt DIC (microvascular thrombosis, multi-organ dysfunction, macrovascular thrombi resulting in venous or arterial obstruction and embolization). Sustained thrombin generation results in severe bleeding and an increased risk of death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The in-hospital mortality of DIC in critically ill patients is 45%.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^112aENqz]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 13

For individuals with a family history of VTE and unknown thrombophilia status in the family who have a minor provoking risk factor for VTE (eg, immobility or minor injury, illness, or infection), the ASH guideline panel suggests not testing for all hereditary thrombophilias (using a panel of tests) to guide thromboprophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Remarks:

- Thrombophilia testing may be considered if individuals have multiple family members with VTE, if the family member with VTE was young, with patient preference, and in settings where testing incurs a low cost.
- A positive family history is defined as having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE.
- A strategy with testing for hereditary thrombophilia (using a panel of tests) would mean that individuals with thrombophilia receive thromboprophylaxis for a minor provoking risk factor, and individuals without thrombophilia would receive no thromboprophylaxis.
- These recommendations have not considered the possibility of finding homozygous defects or combinations of thrombophilia types in an individual with a positive family history of VTE and an unknown thrombophilia status.

Summary of the evidence

We did not identify direct studies to answer this question. The effect of thrombophilia testing and a subsequent strategy of providing thromboprophylaxis to individuals with thrombophilia and not to individuals without thrombophilia during risk situations was indirectly calculated using separate observational studies for thrombophilia prevalence in patients with VTE and unknown thrombophilia status (Table 3), and subsequently dividing this prevalence depending on the relationship to the proband (ie, 50% in individuals with a first-degree family history and 25% in individuals with a second-degree family history). We used RRs for a first event in individuals with thrombophilia vs individuals without thrombophilia and RCT evidence for the effect of thromboprophylaxis, as detailed in Table 4.

The risk for a first VTE during minor risk episodes was estimated at 12 per 1000, based on 6 observational studies. We estimated the overall risk of major bleeding at 4 per 1000 based on the estimates from the VTE prophylaxis in medical outpatients with minor provoking risk factors for VTE (eg, immobility, minor injury, illness, infection).

Discussion and conclusions

This is a unique case of the FVL mutation manifesting with sequential bilateral ocular vaso-occlusive disease involving multiple sites documented with multimodal imaging, including CRVO, cilioretinal artery occlusion, BRAO, and AION. In this young female with a history of recurrent pregnancy losses, an initial clinical and laboratory evaluation allowed us to rule out any underlying cardiovascular disease, inflammatory condition, ocular compression, trauma, or thrombophilic disorder other than FVL. Notably, repeated, more comprehensive thrombophilia testing allowed for the detection of an underlying heterozygous FVL mutation, and the patient subsequently received anticoagulant therapy.

FVL heterozygosity is found in 30% of women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss compared with 1–10% of controls. It is also associated with other complications, such as preeclampsia. The FVL mutation is characterized by an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the most common manifestations. Other unusual locations can also occur. There is a lack of clarity regarding when the tests for FVL should be performed. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis data do not support routine thrombophilia screening in the diagnostic workup of all patients presenting with retinal vascular occlusion. FVL is not recommended as a routine initial test. However, testing may be considered in individuals younger than 50 years of age with unexplained arterial thrombosis, in cases following a first-time unprovoked VTE, in patients with a history of recurrent VTE, in women with repeated miscarriages, in patients with a family history of thromboembolism and in patients with atypical or combined ocular vascular occlusion.

The FVL mutation can be diagnosed by a functional resistance to APC-R assay or by genetic testing using DNA-based methods for the detection of the FVL mutation and for the distinction between heterozygotes and homozygotes. Genetic testing methods primarily include PCR amplification of the defect region from genomic material followed by restriction enzyme cleavage. Early diagnosis is of utmost importance for timely initiation of anticoagulant treatment to prevent further potentially sight-threatening or life-threatening thrombotic events. According to standard guidelines, the initial treatment consists of low molecular weight heparin, followed by vitamin K antagonists. A target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 has been proven to provide effective anticoagulation. The duration of oral anticoagulation therapy is, in general, 3 to 6 months, based on the risk of recurrence and bleeding complications.

Remarks:

- A strategy with testing for hereditary thrombophilia (using a panel of tests) would mean that individuals with thrombophilia receive thromboprophylaxis or a minor provoking risk factor, and individuals without thrombophilia would receive no thromboprophylaxis.
- A positive family history is defined as having a first- or second-degree relative with VTE or thrombophilia.
- These recommendations do not address homozygous defects or combinations of thrombophilia types.
- This recommendation does not consider the time it takes to perform the test and is based on the assumption that thrombophilia test results are available at the time the individual is at risk for VTE because of a minor provoking risk factor.
- These recommendations refer to testing for all hereditary thrombophilias using a panel of tests. A separate question in this guideline addressed selective testing only for the known familial thrombophilia type in this population (recommendation 11), and the resulting recommendations are the same.
- It is most sensible to selectively test for the known familial thrombophilia (recommendation 11) rather than test for the entire panel (recommendation 12) because of the trivial additional number of VTE episodes prevented and major bleeds caused by a strategy of panel testing for all hereditary thrombophilias.

### Portal vein thrombosis: an unexpected finding in a 28-year-old male with abdominal pain [^116BFueX]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is a common primary care complaint. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare cause of abdominal pain, typically associated with cirrhosis or thrombophilia. The following describes the presentation of PVT in a young male, the search for risk factors and underlying etiology, and the debate of anticoagulation therapy.

Case

A 28-year-old male presented with periumbilical pain, post-prandial nausea, and sporadic hematemesis for 3 weeks. The diagnosis was confirmed with a triphasic liver computerized tomography after obtaining an abnormal right upper quadrant ultrasound. This unexpected finding prompted investigation for intrinsic hepatic disease and potential hypercoagulable disorders. Laboratory analysis revealed a heterozygous genotype for the prothrombin 20210G/A mutation, an identified risk factor for venous thrombosis.

Discussion

Recommendations concerning anticoagulation for PVT in the absence of cirrhosis are not clearly defined. Current literature describes the following factors as indications for anticoagulation: acute thrombus, lack of cavernous transformation, absence of esophageal varices, and mesenteric venous thrombosis. This patient had clinical indications both for and against anticoagulation. Weighing this individual's clinical circumstances, we concluded the risk of thrombus in the setting of a hypercoagulable disorder outweighed the risk of variceal bleeding. A minimum of 6 months of anticoagulation was initiated.

Conclusion

PVT is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain, and the absence of hepatic disease should raise the index of suspicion for an underlying thrombophilia. Specific recommendations for anticoagulation are not well defined, demonstrating the importance of weighing the individual risks and benefits in treatment with anticoagulation for young persons with thrombophilia.

### Pediatric central retinal vein occlusion secondary to concurrent mechanisms of optic neuritis and antiphospholipid syndrome [^113a8w3Q]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To report a pediatric case of optic neuritis with subsequent development of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Methods: A case and its findings were analyzed. Results: A 16-year-old boy presented with painful vision loss in the left eye, an afferent pupillary defect, and optic disc edema. Magnetic resonance imaging showed optic nerve enhancement and contrast-enhancing cerebral white-matter lesions, consistent with optic neuritis and demyelinating disease. He received intravenous methylprednisolone followed by a prednisone taper. At the 3-week follow-up, the visual acuity (VA) in the left eye had worsened and fundoscopic examination showed a new CRVO. A hypercoagulable workup showed antiphospholipid syndrome, which was treated with warfarin. He received intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor treatment with subsequent improvement in VA and resolution of the macular edema. Conclusions: This case describes an unusual mechanism for CRVO via a combination of optic disc edema from optic neuritis and hypercoagulability from antiphospholipid syndrome. It is important to recognize this complication of optic disc edema and the necessary workup for a pediatric CRVO.

### Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) complicating post-cataract surgery: a case report and multifactorial analysis [^1115RkqH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

CRVO is a vision-threatening condition characterized by thrombosis of the central retinal vein, leading to retinal hemorrhage, edema, and potential neovascular complications. It is typically associated with systemic risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, with an estimated annual incidence of 0.4–0.8% in individuals over 50 years of age. While cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed and generally safe ophthalmic procedures, rare postoperative complications — including endophthalmitis, cystoid macular edema, and retinal detachment — are well-documented. However, CRVO following cataract surgery remains exceedingly uncommon, with only sporadic case reports in the literature. The pathogenesis of CRVO in this context may involve multifactorial mechanisms. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) during phacoemulsification, even transiently, can compress retinal vessels and impair venous return, particularly in patients with preexisting glaucoma. Additionally, surgical trauma and postoperative inflammation may induce a hypercoagulable state through platelet activation and fibrinogen elevation. Metabolic disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia further exacerbate thrombosis risk by altering blood rheology. Despite these theoretical associations, comprehensive studies on the interplay of these factors in postoperative CRVO are lacking, underscoring the need for detailed case analyses to guide clinical management.

### College of American pathologists consensus conference XXXVI: diagnostic issues in thrombophilia [^116rXg9x]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the state of the art relating to laboratory testing for thrombophilia, as reflected by the medical literature and the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field, and to make recommendations regarding laboratory testing (whom to test, when to test, what tests to perform, rationale for testing, and other issues) in the assessment of thrombotic risk in individual patients and their family members.

Data Sources

Review of the medical literature (primarily from the last 10 years) and the experience and opinions of experts in the field were used as data sources.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Participating authors evaluated the medical literature and prepared manuscripts with specific proposed recommendations. Drafts of all of the manuscripts were prepared and circulated to every participant in the College of American Pathologists Conference XXXVI: Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia prior to the conference. Each of the conclusions and associated recommendations was then presented for discussion. Recommendations were accepted if a consensus of 70% or more of the 27 experts attending the conference was reached. The results of the discussion were then used to revise the manuscripts and recommendations into final form.

Conclusions

Consensus was reached on 179 recommendations, all of which are presented in articles in this issue of the Archives. Detailed discussion of the rationale for each of these recommendations is found in the text of the respective articles, along with citations to justify the level of evidence for the recommendations. This is an evolving area of research, and it is certain that further clinical studies will change many of the recommendations, cause some to be deleted, and add others in the future.

### A hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic state is detectable by global methods in patients with retinal vein occlusion [^116ibiVL]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), has not been well understood. Recent data have shown the efficacy of an anticoagulant therapy with LMWHs in the treatment of acute RVO suggesting the presence of a hypercoagulable state in these patients. New global tests for detection of hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis have become available and their application might improve the knowledge of the pathophysiology of RVO and, potentially, its treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate coagulation and fibrinolytic alterations by two global tests in RVO patients: Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) and Clot Lysis Time (CLT), respectively. We studied 81 RVO patients (40 males; median age 61 years) and a control group matched for age and sex. The ETP was measured by functional chromogenic assay and expressed as the time until thrombin burst (LagTime), Time to peak (T(max)), Peak amount of thrombin generation (C(max)) and ETP. CLT was determined by a plasma-based, tissue factor-induced clot lysis assay. C(max), ETP and CLT values were significantly higher in RVO patients than in controls (C(max)p = 0.010; ETP p < 0.001; CLT p < 0.001) and remained significantly associated with the disease at the multivariate analysis adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. Our results indicate that -beyond the assay of different parameters associated with clotting activation and lysis- global methods might allow us to easily detect the presence of hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis in RVO patients. Further studies should assess the possible clinical value of our data in the management of RVO patients.

### Screening coagulation testing using the APTT: which reagent to choose? [^114cDChK]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

APTT testing is integral to hemostasis testing. A prolonged result, however, can be difficult to interpret, depending on the APTT reagent's sensitivity to the lupus anticoagulant. This often generates additional laboratory testing for both factor deficiencies and the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, and in so doing, delays patient management. We have found it useful to provide APTT testing with both a lupus anticoagulant sensitive and insensitive reagent, to facilitate the rapid exclusion of significant factor deficiencies. The following case report illustrates the utility of this approach and provides a backdrop for necessary discussions between laboratories and clinicians regarding which APTT reagent best meets their clinical need for screening hemostasis testing.
