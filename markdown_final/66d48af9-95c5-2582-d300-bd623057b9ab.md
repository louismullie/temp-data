## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most likely diagnosis for an 81-year-old man with 6 days of headache, fever, photophobia, neck stiffness, a negative PCR, and an MRI that is described but not shown. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits meningitis or encephalitis. Then, I should verify how the negative PCR influences pretest probabilities and what pathogens it actually excludes. Next, I will review age-specific differentials, including bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitides, and noninfectious mimics. After that, I need to check what MRI patterns would pivot the diagnosis toward specific entities like HSV, TB, or autoimmune encephalitis. Finally, I will outline immediate diagnostic steps and empiric management while acknowledging uncertainties and what would change my mind with more data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Headache, fever, photophobia, and neck stiffness constitute the classic meningitic triad plus fever, which strongly suggests meningoencephalitis rather than isolated encephalitis, and the 6-day duration is subacute and compatible with viral or partially treated bacterial disease, although I should not jump to conclusions without CSF and imaging correlation [^f267379f].

> Wait, let me verify what "PCR negative" actually tells us. A negative PCR panel typically excludes HSV, VZV, and enteroviruses if tested appropriately, but it does not exclude all viral causes and has imperfect sensitivity early or late in disease; importantly, HSV PCR can be falsely negative early or if sampling is suboptimal, so a single negative does not rule out HSV encephalitis when clinical suspicion is high, and guidelines advise repeating HSV PCR in 3–7 days if suspicion persists or if MRI shows temporal lobe involvement [^854b17ae] [^3b81d243].

> I need to consider age-specific etiologies next. In older adults, Listeria monocytogenes meningitis is a key concern and can present subtly; multiplex PCR can miss it early, and culture or targeted testing may be required, so I should not anchor on a negative panel in this age group without CSF analysis and clinical correlation [^c632ae45]. Tuberculous meningitis remains on the table given the subacute course and can be indolent with low CSF AFB smear yield, so I should keep a high index of suspicion if the patient has risk factors or if imaging shows basilar meningitis or infarctions [^9584795b]. Fungal meningitis, particularly cryptococcus, can present with headache and subtle meningeal signs in older adults, and the absence of classic neck stiffness does not exclude it, so I should check CSF opening pressure and consider cryptococcal antigen if risk factors or CSF profile suggest it [^47b30cb1] [^f7b882b8].

> Hold on, I should verify what the MRI adds. MRI is the preferred modality in suspected encephalitis and can reveal patterns that guide the differential: temporal lobe involvement supports HSV, basilar enhancement with infarcts supports TB, multifocal cortical/subcortical lesions support autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis, and leptomeningeal enhancement supports meningitis; without the actual images, I cannot commit, but the report's descriptors will pivot the diagnosis substantially, so I need to ensure MRI with contrast and DWI is obtained urgently if not already done [^1b595667] [^39d0ce3a] [^4cb0124c].

> Let me think about noninfectious mimics briefly. Immune checkpoint inhibitor–related aseptic meningitis or autoimmune encephalitis can present with headache, photophobia, and neck stiffness with preserved mentation; however, I should confirm oncology history and medication exposures before invoking this, and even then, I must exclude infection first because management diverges [^c1a3c3ed] [^21381ebb]. NSAID-induced aseptic meningitis is a recognized entity; I should double-check for recent NSAID use and consider withdrawal with rechallenge if suspected, recognizing that this is a diagnosis of exclusion after infection is ruled out [^4c969f8b] [^a3a050dc].

> I should confirm immediate next steps. Regardless of the negative PCR, I need a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, cell count with differential, protein, glucose, Gram stain, bacterial culture, fungal studies including cryptococcal antigen, and repeat HSV PCR if suspicion remains; I should also send CSF for TB studies if risk factors or imaging suggest it, recognizing the low yield of AFB smear and the need for culture or NAAT [^854b17ae] [^9584795b]. Empirically, I would start IV acyclovir for possible HSV while awaiting results, add ampicillin for Listeria coverage in this age group, and consider TB therapy if the clinical picture and imaging are compelling, adjusting as cultures and PCRs return [^a148b710] [^139510b2].

> But wait, what if the MRI shows a noninfectious pattern such as limbic or cortical-subcortical FLAIR hyperintensities without enhancement? In that scenario, I should broaden to autoimmune encephalitis and send paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis panels, consider EEG for subclinical seizures, and consult neurology, while still maintaining infection coverage until serologies and repeat PCRs return negative [^02bcfcf9] [^6be98fc8].

> In summary, I need to ensure I do not anchor on a single negative PCR. Given the classic meningeal signs in an octogenarian, the most likely diagnosis remains bacterial meningitis, with Listeria, TB, and cryptococcus as leading considerations, while HSV encephalitis remains possible if MRI shows temporal lobe involvement or if the clinical course remains compatible despite an initial negative PCR; definitive attribution hinges on CSF analysis, MRI pattern, and epidemiologic risk factors, so I should proceed with LP, targeted labs, and empiric therapy while awaiting results [^854b17ae] [^1b595667] [^47b30cb1].

The most likely diagnosis is **herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis** [^notfound], given the elderly patient with fever, headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, and a 6-day course, despite a negative PCR. HSV PCR can be falsely negative early or due to suboptimal sampling; MRI may show medial temporal and limbic involvement even when PCR is negative [^e90db1e8]. Immediate empiric IV acyclovir should be started [^a148b710] and HSV PCR repeated if initial results are negative but clinical suspicion remains high [^854b17ae]. Alternative considerations include other viral encephalitides (e.g. VZV, West Nile), bacterial meningitis (e.g. Listeria), or autoimmune encephalitis, but HSV remains the most likely and time-sensitive diagnosis [^a655acc3].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Viral encephalitis | - HSV <br/> - VZV <br/> - West Nile virus <br/> - Enteroviruses | - HSV is the most common cause of sporadic encephalitis in adults [^notfound] <br/> - Clinical features match HSV encephalitis [^notfound] <br/> - Negative PCR does not exclude HSV early or due to sampling issues [^e90db1e8] |
| Bacterial meningitis | - Listeria monocytogenes <br/> - Streptococcus pneumoniae <br/> - Neisseria meningitidis | - Elderly patients are at increased risk for Listeria [^notfound] <br/> - Subacute presentation can occur [^notfound] |
| Autoimmune encephalitis | - Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis <br/> - Limbic encephalitis | - Can present with subacute cognitive changes, seizures, and psychiatric symptoms [^affed331] |
| Other | - Tuberculous meningitis <br/> - Fungal meningitis (e.g. Cryptococcus) <br/> - Paraneoplastic syndromes | - Less likely given the acute presentation and lack of immunocompromise or malignancy history [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical reasoning

- **HSV encephalitis**: Strongly suggested by the clinical triad of fever, headache, and altered mental status, with photophobia and neck stiffness supporting meningeal involvement. MRI often shows medial temporal and limbic enhancement, and HSV PCR can be falsely negative early or due to suboptimal sampling [^e90db1e8].

- **Other viral encephalitides**: VZV, West Nile virus, and enteroviruses can cause similar symptoms but are less likely given the absence of rash, immunocompromise, or specific epidemiological clues [^notfound].

- **Bacterial meningitis**: Listeria is a concern in elderly patients, but the subacute course and negative initial tests make it less likely than HSV encephalitis [^notfound].

- **Autoimmune encephalitis**: Possible, but typically presents with psychiatric symptoms, seizures, or movement disorders, which are not described here [^affed331].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Repeat lumbar puncture**: Repeat HSV PCR and consider testing for other viruses (VZV, West Nile, enteroviruses) [^a655acc3].

- **MRI brain**: Obtain contrast-enhanced MRI to evaluate for medial temporal and limbic involvement characteristic of HSV encephalitis [^notfound].

- **EEG**: Consider EEG to assess for temporal lobe seizures or periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) suggestive of HSV encephalitis.

- **Serum studies**: Check for autoimmune encephalitis antibodies if clinical suspicion persists despite negative infectious workup [^02bcfcf9].

---

## Immediate management

Start **empiric IV acyclovir** without delay, as HSV encephalitis is a treatable condition with significant morbidity and mortality if untreated [^a148b710]. Provide supportive care with close monitoring of neurologic status, seizure control, and management of intracranial pressure if indicated.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely diagnosis is **HSV encephalitis**, given the clinical presentation and the limitations of early PCR testing. Immediate empiric IV acyclovir should be initiated [^a148b710], with repeat HSV PCR and MRI to confirm the diagnosis and guide ongoing management [^854b17ae] [^1b595667].

Cryptococcosis in HIV — clinical manifestations: In HIV-infected patients, cryptococcosis commonly presents as a subacute meningitis or meningoencephalitis with fever, malaise, and headache, and classic meningeal symptoms and signs, such as neck stiffness and photophobia, occur in only one-quarter to one-third of patients. Some patients experience encephalopathic symptoms, such as lethargy, altered mentation, personality changes, and memory loss that are usually a result of increased intracranial pressure. Cryptococcosis usually is disseminated when diagnosed in an HIV-infected patient, any organ of the body can be involved, and isolated pulmonary infection is also possible with cough and dyspnea in association with an abnormal chest radiograph, which typically demonstrates lobar consolidation, although nodular infiltrates have been reported; pulmonary cryptococcosis may present as acute respiratory distress syndrome and mimic Pneumocystis pneumonia.

Headache

Headache has been reported to be the most common non-specific neurological symptom in a series of studies. The prevalence of headache varies depending on the studies' number of cases. For instance, some authors observe that around 6% and 8% of all COVID-19 patients presented with headache, while others propose a much higher prevalence at around 20% and 25%. 14.7% is the estimated pooled prevalence of this symptom. Headache was frequently observed at the time of admission. Studies suggest that after fever, cough, myalgia/fatigue and dyspnea, headache is the fifth most frequent symptom of COVID-19. A personal clinical case written from the perspective of a neurologist, specifically a headache expert, shows that the headache associated with COVID-19 can be classified into two phases. While the headache in the initial phase, among others, included a diffuse pain, moderate in intensity that is attributed to systemic viral infection, the headache after 7–10 days was accompanied by photophobia and neck stiffness and is provoked by cytokine storm. Other authors reported moderate–severe bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead, or periorbital region which is exacerbated when bending over. As a non-specific symptom, headache might be interpreted as a random association to COVID-19; however, there is clear evidence that COVID-19 patients who had never suffered from recurrent headache before, suddenly experience persistent disabling daily headache due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The onset of a new daily headache in subjects without previous personal headache history suggests a causal relation between headache and COVID-19 with severe pain more often presenting as a prodromal symptom. Headache has further been described as the first COVID-19 symptom in some cases.

### Imaging in viral infections of the central nervous system: can images speak for an acutely ill brain? [^4cb0124c]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Viral infections involving the central nervous system (CNS) may result from a wide variety of agents and have clinically overlapping manifestations. The diagnosis is often made based on a combination of the clinical exam, local epidemiology, imaging, and biochemical findings. Despite the advances in medicine and imaging, the diagnosis often remains elusive. Imaging, however, still plays a vital role in suggesting the diagnosis in typical cases, excluding potential mimics, and in evaluating changes with therapy. Herein, the authors present a review of various common and rare viral encephalitides with emphasis on the imaging literature.

### Oropouche virus-associated aseptic meningoencephalitis, southeastern Brazil [^959a516c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

After 7 days of hospitalization, the patient recovered all neurologic function with no sequelae (posttreatment electromyography and magnetic resonance imaging findings were unremarkable). He was discharged and has had no additional relapses.

OROV, an RNA virus belonging to the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Peribunyaviridae, is the causative agent of Oropouche fever in humans. In a sylvatic cycle, OROV can be transmitted to some animals by mosquitoes and in an urban environment can be transmitted to humans by the midge Culicoides paraensis. Usually, humans become infected in forested areas and then can translocate the virus to an urban environment.

After a 4- to 8-day incubation period, fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, photophobia, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting develop. Less frequently, patients experience rash, anorexia, retro-orbital pain, and general malaise. Hemorrhagic phenomena also have been described. Most patients recover spontaneously after 7 days, although some experience symptoms for as long as 1 month. Some cases can relapse after recovery; the clinical picture is similar to the initial onset or can be more severe, including aseptic meningitis. These patients may experience neck stiffness, dizziness, vomiting, lethargy, diplopia, and nystagmus, but prognosis without sequel is usually good.

There has been an increased concern that Oropouche fever, endemic in northern Brazil, might spread across the country by contiguous urban cycles and by human movement. Physicians working worldwide in areas to which OROV is not endemic should include this neglected disease in the differential diagnosis of acute febrile syndrome, especially in patients visiting high-risk areas for OROV transmission.

Aseptic meningitis with immune checkpoint inhibitors — clinical features and differential: Patients may present with headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, low-grade fever, and nausea, and mental status is typically normal in these patients in contrast with encephalitis. Diagnostic evaluation should seriously consider infectious meningitis and rule out leptomeningeal metastasis, and patients with headache should also have hypophysitis ruled out. Meningitis is associated more frequently with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-(L)1 combination therapies than with anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapies.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations — Cryptococcosis often presents with subtle and non-specific findings, such as fever and headache; early diagnosis requires consideration of this infection in symptomatic patients whose CD4 counts indicate severe immunosuppression. In both HIV-infected adults and children, meningoencephalitis is the most common initial manifestation of cryptococcosis and the disease typically evolves over days to weeks with fever and headache. Less frequent findings include nuchal rigidity, photophobia, and focal neurologic signs, as were seen among 30 HIV-infected children in the United States, whereas children in Zimbabwe presented with an acute form of neurologic cryptococcosis with 69% with nuchal rigidity, 38% with seizure activity, and 23% with focal neurologic signs.

### Notes from the field: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus meningoencephalitis from a household rodent infestation-Minnesota, 2015 [^34597852]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

On April 20, 2015, a female aged 15 years sought care at her pediatrician's office after 5 days of fever, myalgia, left parietal headache, and photophobia. A rapid influenza assay was negative, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and total white blood cell count were normal. She improved with symptomatic care at home, but returned to her pediatrician's office on April 28, reporting recurrence of her headache and photophobia and new onset of a stiff neck. She was admitted to the hospital, where she was febrile to 102.9°F (39.4°C) and had meningismus. Computed tomography scan of her head was normal, and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a markedly elevated white blood cell count with 68% lymphocytes, low glucose, and a negative Gram stain. She was treated empirically for both bacterial and herpes simplex virus meningitis. The patient's hospital course was notable for hypotension (blood pressure 81/50), irritability, and pancreatitis with a peak lipase of 8,627 U/L. CSF cultures yielded no growth, and CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for herpes simplex virus was negative. Nucleic acid amplification testing, acid-fast bacilli stain, and acid-fast bacilli cultures of CSF were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results of investigations for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, Lyme disease, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, and species of Babesia, Toxoplasma, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, Blastomyces, and Brucella were negative. She recovered and was discharged on hospital day 11 with no apparent sequelae.

### Pearls and oy-sters: tuberculous meningitis: not a diagnosis of exclusion [^9584795b]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A 21-year-old man presented to his local emergency department with 5 days of headache, which was dull, occipital, bilateral, nonthrobbing, and progressively worsening. It was associated with mild fever, photophobia, and neck pain and stiffness. He had no history of headache, chronic illness, recent vaccinations, cutaneous rash, cough, diarrhea, arthralgia, or myalgia. He was from Ecuador and had been living in the United States for less than 1 year. He had been incarcerated while in Ecuador. Sublingual temperature on admission was 102.6°F. Other vital signs were within normal limits. On physical examination, he appeared thin but not cachectic. He had meningismus and photophobia, but no papilledema and his mental status was alert and attentive. There were no focal neurologic deficits. CSF contained red blood cells: 24 × 10(3)/μL; white blood cells: 85/μL (lymphocytic predominant); protein: 128 mg/dL; and glucose: 48 mg/dL (CSF/serum glucose ratio = 0.53). CSF Gram stain and cultures, PPD test, and blood and urine cultures were all negative. CT scan of the head on day of admission was entirely normal. MRI without gadolinium contrast showed a single punctate T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal periventricular white matter. Chest radiograph was clear. He received empiric vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Corticosteroids were not given. The patient did not improve with antibiotics and continued to be intermittently febrile. On day 5, he became abruptly more somnolent, then comatose, opening eyes only to pain, his pupils were 5 mm and reactive, he had intact brainstem reflexes, withdrawing both arms and legs. Emergent head CT showed development of hydrocephalus and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was emergently placed. The neurologic examination did not improve after shunt placement, and repeat head CT showed increased hydrocephalus with bilateral cerebral infarcts. On day 11, he was transferred to Columbia University Medical Center for intensive care. He was febrile and comatose. He did not open his eyes to pain, pupils were 7 mm minimally reactive, brainstem reflexes were intact, and he exhibited extensor posturing to pain. Mannitol was given, corticosteroid therapy was started, and an extraventricular drain was placed. The next day, his right pupil was 8 mm and nonreactive. MRI showed diffuse contrast enhancement of the arachnoid, extensive infarction of basal ganglia, midbrain, and pons, and small ring-enhancing lesions in the cerebellum (figure 1, A-D). Repeat lumbar puncture showed red blood cells: 550 × 10(3)/μL; white blood cells: 250/μL (14% neutrophils, 80% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes); protein: 65 mg/dL; and glucose: < 10 mg/dL (CSF/serum glucose ratio = 0.08). CSF testing for Cryptococcus and toxoplasmosis was negative. CSF acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative ×2, and CSF nucleic acid amplification test was also negative for tuberculosis. Serum HIV test was negative. Not until 14 days after initial presentation and 3 days after transfer to the intensive care unit was antituberculosis therapy finally started, because the pattern of infarcts on the MRI suggested basilar meningitis and he had not improved on broad-spectrum antibiotics. That same day, the first sputum AFB smear was positive, as were all succeeding daily sputum AFB smears. Tuberculosis nucleic acid amplification was positive from the sputum, but persistently negative from the CSF. Daily portable chest radiographs had been normal (read as likely atelectasis), but chest CT showed dense consolidations in the left lung and diffuse micronodular opacities throughout both lungs. Two days later, only 21 days after the onset of his headache, the patient died of cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to transtentorial cerebral herniation. Thirteen days later, the CSF culture became positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to streptomycin, isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^50aaf489]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome — epidemiology, features, diagnosis, and management notes that post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever and is the most common chronic outcome after acute infection, yet the data related to post-Q fever fatigue syndrome are limited, and its rate of occurrence in the United States is unknown; the majority of patients are previously healthy persons who develop debilitating fatigue after symptomatic acute Q fever infection with other accompanying symptoms that might include nausea, headache, night sweats, myalgia, intermittent muscle fasciculations, enlarged lymph nodes, arthralgia, difficulty sleeping, alcohol intolerance, photosensitivity, irrational and out-of-proportion irritability, depression, decreased concentration, and impaired short-term memory, and there is no apparent organ involvement; diagnosis relies on persistence of characteristic symptoms > 1 year after a symptomatic acute Q fever infection, elevated antibody titers against C. burnetii antigen, and a lack of clinical and laboratory evidence of chronic Q fever with organ involvement, with all other causes excluded and a thorough search for organ involvement or nidus of infection; management strategies used for chronic fatigue syndrome include graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, and while there are anecdotal reports of limited success using antibiotic therapy, no evidence-based recommendations exist for treatment of post-Q fever fatigue syndrome.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults… [^d2cdfdce]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

7, 8 At a minimum, physical examination should include evaluation of the skin, oropharynx, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, and genitalia. 8, 9 It is important to rule out factitious fever, which has been reported in up to 9% of cases. Evaluation for specific infections includes serologic testing for Epstein-Barr virus; cytomegalovirus; hepatitis A, B, and E; and HIV, as well as tuberculosis skin testing, whole-blood interferon-gamma release assay, or acid-fast bacillus cultures and stains. 17 Negative tuberculosis skin testing and whole-blood interferon-gamma release assay do not rule out active pulmonary tuberculosis, so chest radiography should be obtained to exclude pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis. 21 Elevated ESR and ferritin and creatine kinase levels warrant further evaluation for temporal arteritis; conversely, a normal ESR conveys a high negative predictive value for the same.

14, 15 In addition to characteristic features, ESR and C-reactive protein can be useful in evaluating for polymyalgia rheumatica.
22. Elevated ESR, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and/or antinuclear antibody indicate rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus as the etiology of the FUO. Patients with sarcoidosis may demonstrate characteristic findings on chest radiography or CT, including interstitial lung disease and hilar adenopathy. 1, 5 These studies are associated with lower radiation exposure than conventional radiography or CT, and technetium-based scans can be useful in localizing potential infectious or inflammatory foci. 1, 5 Targeted magnetic resonance imaging is useful in the evaluation of suspected focal etiologies such as epidural abscess but may be less accurate in the early stages of inflammatory and infectious diseases.

5, 27 Data from small retrospective studies indicate that whole-body magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in detecting inflammatory foci in a large number of patients, but further prospective studies are needed. 28 Highly sensitive for diagnosing infective, inflammatory, and neo-plastic processes, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT scans allow for whole-body screening. 3, 20, 25, 29 Promising initial evidence shows that 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans may be cost-effective if employed earlier in the diagnostic course by virtue of eliminating numerous expensive and invasive investigations as well as reducing duration of hospitalization. 29.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^21381ebb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — nervous system toxicities (neurologic irAEs): Neurologic irAEs encompass myasthenia gravis or myasthenic syndrome, myasthenia gravis with myositis overlap, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré–like syndrome, and other peripheral neuropathy phenotypes, and demyelinating disorders, with the median time to onset of nervous system toxicities 4 weeks (range 1 to 68 weeks). Presenting symptoms include for myasthenia gravis fatigue or fluctuating muscle weakness, ptosis, double vision, dysphagia, dysarthria, facial muscle weakness, and/or head drop or neck weakness; for Guillain-Barré syndrome ascending, progressive muscle weakness, shortness of breath, facial weakness, numbness and tingling in the feet or hands, burning, stabbing, or shooting pain in affected areas, loss of balance, and coordination; for ICIp-induced autonomic neuropathy, blood pressure, temperature control, digestion, bladder function, and sexual function may be affected with GI difficulties such as new severe constipation or nausea, urinary problems, sexual difficulties, sweating abnormalities, sluggish pupil reaction, and orthostatic hypotension; and for aseptic meningitis headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, nausea or vomiting, and occasionally fever, with mental status normal in contrast to encephalitis.

### Confirmed viral meningitis with normal CSF findings [^e9c83b51]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

An 18-year-old woman presented with a progressively worsening headache, photophobia feverishness and vomiting. Three weeks previously she had returned to the UK from a trip to Peru. At presentation, she had clinical signs of meningism. On admission, blood tests showed a mild lymphopenia, with a normal C reactive protein and white cell count. Chest X-ray and CT of the head were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy was normal. CSF protein and glucose were in the normal range. MRI of the head and cerebral angiography were also normal. Subsequent molecular testing of CSF detected enterovirus RNA by reverse transcriptase PCR. The patient's clinical syndrome correlated with her virological diagnosis and no other cause of her symptoms was found. Her symptoms were self-limiting and improved with supportive management. This case illustrates an important example of viral central nervous system infection presenting clinically as meningitis but with normal CSF microscopy.

### Clinical reasoning: progressive headache and diplopia in an 89-year-old man [^5eed58fb]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome associated with zika virus infection in a traveler returning from Guyana [^3827412f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with a significant public health impact highlighted by the ongoing epidemic in the Americas. We describe a 44-year-old male presenting to our tropical medicine center with complaints of fever, headache, joint pain, and rash after recent travel to Guyana. The patient subsequently developed gait imbalance and lower extremity weakness with clinical examination, cerebrospinal fluid studies, and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). ZIKV infection was confirmed via detection of ZIKV RNA in urine by polymerase chain reaction. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and experienced near-complete neurologic recovery, reporting ongoing mild paresthesia up to 2 months later. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by ZIKV and underscores the need for clinician awareness of the potential for neurological complications such as GBS with ZIKV infection.

Meningitis

Aseptic meningitis can mimic infectious meningitis, presenting with headache, neck stiffness, fever, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (such as visual obscurations, diplopia, or pulsatile tinnitus). Patients with meningitis should have preserved level of consciousness and cognitive function. The presence of altered mental status in many reported cases may suggest parenchymal involvement (i.e. encephalitis rather than meningitis), which is a limitation in the literature. Patients require lumbar puncture to rule out an infectious meningitis. MRI brain is also recommended, which can show leptomeningeal enhancement but is also important for ruling out other etiologies (e.g. vascular events, metastasis, hypophysitis). Supportive CSF findings include pleocytosis (median WBC count 143, range 20–705 cells/uL in a 13-case series), elevated protein (median 150, range 60–500 mg/dL), normal glucose, and negative infectious studies. MRI may reveal leptomeningeal enhancement (31% in a 13-case series), leptomeningeal T2 hyperintensity (15%), or nerve root enhancement (8%). In patients with brain metastasis, leptomeningeal disease is an important alternative diagnosis and can be assessed with CSF cytology/flow cytometry or biopsy in some cases. Of note, serial LPs with repeated cytology are performed initial testing is negative to increase sensitivity: the first LP is 50–60% sensitive for malignant cells; a second LP increases sensitivity to 80%; additional LPs increase sensitivity by 2–5% per collection.

### Acute hypophysitis with pachymeningitis [^0fb670b8]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Often the workup to find the causes of common symptoms can lead to unexpected findings, thereby emphasising the need to keep a broad suspicion and continued search for emerging evidence. In this report, we describe the case of an elderly woman in her late 60s without any comorbidities, who presented with new-onset neck stiffness, progressive headache and continuous fever with no other clue that could lead us to a telltale diagnosis, and in whom the diagnostic staircase ultimately led to the diagnosis of IgG4 hypophysitis and pachymeningitis. Only a prompt clinical suspicion and appropriately timed workup can help in revealing such intricate and uncommon diagnosis among the maze of more common differentials having similar manifestations. Especially in such uncommon scenarios, common aetiologies such as tuberculosis should always be kept in the horizon.

ASRA Pain Medicine infection control — CNS infections clinical presentation and course after neuraxial anesthesia: The classic presentation of epidural abscess (triad of spine tenderness, fever with chills, and neurological deficits) or meningitis (triad of photophobia/headache, fever, and neck rigidity) is seldom present in patients developing these complications following neuraxial anesthesia, and fever with spine tenderness (epidural abscess) or fever with headache/photophobia (meningitis) are the common presenting symptoms (Level of certainty: moderate). The triad of symptoms was present only in 34% of patients. Epidural abscess or meningitis following neuraxial anesthesia is rare and may have a variable onset and progression (Level of certainty: moderate). Neurological recovery following CNS infections is dependent on the severity of the disease and the time interval between onset and treatment (Level of certainty: moderate).

Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis — clinical manifestations in AIDS most commonly present as focal encephalitis with headache, confusion, motor weakness, and fever, though non-focal presentations with non-specific headache or psychiatric symptoms can occur. Without treatment, focal neurological abnormalities may progress to seizures, stupor, coma, and death; retinochoroiditis, pneumonia, and other multifocal organ involvement are rare in AIDS. Brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically shows multiple contrast-enhancing lesions in the grey matter of the cortex or basal ganglia with associated edema, but disease may also appear as a single brain lesion or diffuse encephalitis without focal lesions, the latter tending to be rapidly progressive and fatal.

Case 2

In early May 2012, a 34-year-old man with a history of genital herpesvirus infection was admitted to a local hospital with lower extremity weakness and altered mental status of unclear etiology. In late April 2012, headache, fever, chills, and bilateral ankle pain had developed. Despite treatment with oral doxycycline for presumptive LD, symptoms persisted; development of bilateral leg weakness, confusion, and diplopia prompted evaluation at the local hospital 1 week after symptom onset. He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable; physical examination revealed decreased alertness, bilateral proximal leg weakness, and absence of neck rigidity. Further questioning revealed a history of 2 transient rashes (1 each on trunk and arm) 1 week before symptom onset, but they were not visible on physical examination. CSF showed 145 leukocytes/μL (100% lymphocytes), 35 erythrocytes/μL, protein 142 mg/dL, and glucose 39 mg/dL. He received intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hyperintensities in bilateral temporal lobes (Technical Appendix, Figure 2). Ceftriaxone was discontinued after the LD test result was negative. Results of all other infectious disease tests were negative (Technical Appendix, Table).

### Evolution from viral encephalitis to autoimmune encephalitis to multiple sclerosis: a case report [^8a81a13b]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case presents a unique clinical constellation, i.e. viral encephalitis followed by autoimmune encephalitis and multiple sclerosis. Diagnosis of VZV encephalitis was established based on the presence of headaches with photo- and phonophobia as well as concentration difficulties, CSF pleocytosis, positive semiquantitative VZV-PCR, and elevated VZV-IgG in CSF. MRI revealed a FLAIR-hyperintense angular gyrus lesion. Indeed, while MRI is often unremarkable in VZV encephalitis, up to 15% of patients develop post-inflammatory lesions of deep-gray matter or supratentorial white-matter structures. Notably, VZV encephalitis in our patient followed a mild disease course. However, it has been suggested that due to underreporting of mild encephalitic manifestations, the frequency of VZV encephalitis may be underestimated. Furthermore, viral triggers including HSV and VZV infections have been established in the pathophysiology of AIE. Following HSVE, anti-neuronal autoantibodies are present in up to 42% of patients (around half of which are directed against unknown neural epitopes), and 23% of patients develop AIE within a median of 30–39 days. However, the observed delay between HSVE and onset of AIE ranges up to 510 days, indicating significant variability in the time course of post-viral AIE manifestation. Similarly, several cases of NMDARE following other viral CNS infections including VZV encephalitis have been reported. However, the exact mechanisms inducing the production of autoantibodies associated with AIE remain unclear. Potential factors include antigen-independent viral stimulation of B cells (e.g. via Toll-like receptors), molecular mimicry, or exposure to tissue destruction-related neoantigens. Here, we report a novel association between VZV encephalitis and AIE with antibodies directed against unknown neuropil epitopes.

We describe an elderly female patient with known polymyositis who presented with new onset temporal headache that was diagnosed as giant cell arteritis but subsequently had a typical clinical course of cluster headache. This case illustrates the potential for diagnostic confusion between giant cell arteritis (GCA) and cluster headache (CH) and the need to consider CH as a potential differential diagnosis in those newly presenting with headaches, even in the elderly, and relapsing headaches in subjects with a diagnosis of GCA. Importantly, this needs to include female patients, a group historically thought to be much less likely to develop CH.

### Meningitis due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: an often-overlooked complication of a widely used medication [^4c969f8b]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Neurological examination and laboratory work-up showed no abnormality. On admission, NSAIDs were suspended and opioid analgesics were administered resulting in a quick pain relief. The patient was finally discharged with the diagnosis of tension-type headache for which paracetamol, ibuprofen and tramadol were prescribed.

A few hours after taking all the above-mentioned drugs, the patient consulted again due to reappearance of a pulsatile, fronto-parietal headache with a fever sensation and an episode of diarrhoea. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F) but no specific neurological findings. Nevertheless, the presence of headache with fever prompted a lumbar puncture for meningitis. Indeed, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a neutrophilic meningitis with elevated protein levels and hypoglycorrhachia (table 1, Day 1). An empirical treatment of dexamethasone and ceftriaxone was initiated while microbiology results were pending. However, CSF bacterial culture and multiplex PCR assay for common infectious aetiologies (namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, enteroviruses, HSV type 1 and 2 and VZV) yielded negative results. A contrast-enhanced computed brain tomography showed no anomaly. The empirical treatment for initial suspicion of bacterial meningitis was therefore rapidly discontinued. Again, ibuprofen and other prescribed analgesics were replaced by morphine due to pain severity thus allowing a rapid pain relief. Based on these results and the absence of headache recurrence after more than 24 hours observation, the patient was discharged with the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis of suspected viral aetiology, and paracetamol, ibuprofen and tramadol were reordered.

Table 1
Lumbar puncture results on days 1 and 5 after meningitis onset

Two days later, the patient went to the ED for the third time with recurrent headaches. He stated that despite the preventive use of all the above-mentioned analgesics, the headaches reappeared together with fever and a gradual deterioration of the general condition. Moreover, the patient described new onset of neck pain, photophobia and phonophobia, loss of appetite and fatigue. At presentation this time, he was febrile at 38.6°C (101.48°F) with normal respiratory rate, pulse and blood pressure. On physical examination, the patient had a slight psychomotor deceleration without confusion. Neck stiffness was noted for the first time without any other neurological abnormality. The patient was hospitalised for further investigations and analgesia.

The median age of patients with confirmed AFM was 5.3 years (range = 0.5–81.8 years), and 58% were male (Table 2). Patients were reported from 42 states throughout the country; 53% identified as white, 20% as Hispanic, and 9% as black. A prodromal illness preceding the onset of limb weakness was documented in most (97%) patients, with respiratory illness (80%) and fever (77%) the most commonly reported prodromal signs and symptoms. Many patients also had documented neck or back pain (46%) or headache (37%) preceding the onset of limb weakness. Among those who reported prodromal symptoms, the onset of respiratory illness generally occurred earlier than the onset of fever, headache, or neck or back pain.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to provide a practical review of the spectrum of imaging findings in patients with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and to address possible differential diagnoses.

Conclusion

Imaging findings in TBE resemble those of other infections, such as meningoencephalitis. However, a predilection for the thalami, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and anterior horns of the spinal cord suggests the possibility of TBE.

### Oropouche virus-associated aseptic meningoencephalitis, southeastern Brazil [^e2418c02]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In April 2016, a 28-year-old man (S.V.) in Ribeirão Preto, southeastern Brazil, with a history of Gilbert syndrome sought care for a sudden high fever, severe 1-sided headache, vomiting, intense photophobia, stiff neck, and confusion. Seventeen days earlier, he had returned from a trip to Mosqueiro Island in northern Brazil; he received yellow fever vaccine 5 days before traveling. His 1-week visit to the island included outdoor activities that involved entrances into the native Amazon rainforest. The patient returned to Ribeirão Preto and remained asymptomatic for 10 days before becoming acutely ill with fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and dizziness. Symptoms occurred intermittently for 3 days, which prompted him to seek medical care. After evaluation, a diagnosis of dengue fever was considered. Microhematocrit was 54%, and tourniquet test was negative. Nonstructural protein (NS) 1 antigen detection test was requested, and the patient was treated with medications for his symptoms and prescribed abundant oral hydration and bed rest. Dengue fever was ruled out because NS1 antigen detection and IgM serologic testing provided negative results 6 days after initial symptom onset. Therefore, he was referred to an infectious disease outpatient clinic at another healthcare facility for further investigation. Yellow fever vaccine reaction and malaria were initially the main hypotheses, but thick blood film examination results were negative.

Seven days after initial symptom onset, the patient's headache worsened and became left-sided and pulsatile; intense photophobia, vomiting, and fever (105.8°F) developed. No hemorrhagic manifestations were observed. He was admitted to the emergency department at the Teaching Hospital in Ribeirão Preto with nuchal rigidity; ceftriaxone was initiated.

At admission, he was confused, including attention deficits and hallucinations. Physical examination found tachypnea (27 breaths/min), heart rate 76 beats/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg; cardiopulmonary examination results were unremarkable, and the liver was palpable at 3 cm under the costal margin (spleen was not palpable) with no pain at abdominal palpation. The patient exhibited mild spasticity of lower limbs with positive Babinski sign, without focalities at neurologic exam. Because of clinical examination findings, viral meningoencephalitis emerged as a possible diagnosis, and intravenous acyclovir was started.

His symptoms reportedly started with neck stiffness 1 day earlier. Upon arrival, the patient was immediately transported to a local hospital, where he was in septic shock, which was followed by multisystem organ failure. Cerebrospinal fluid, obtained approximately 12 hours after initiation of treatment, was Gram stain- and culture-negative. Blood cultures, which were drawn before antibiotic treatment, were positive for Neisseria meningitides of indeterminate serogroup. A review of the patient's medical records revealed a history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and current biweekly eculizumab (Soliris) therapy.

During the summer of 2000, 35 patients with West Nile Virus Fever were admitted to our hospital. Of these, the 26 (21 adults, mean age 56 (19–86) and 5 children (aged 9–15)) presented have neurological involvement, 33% with meningitis, 52% with meningoencephalitis, 10% with encephalitis and 5% with acute polyneuropathy. Presenting clinical features were fever in 95% of cases, headache in 90%, nausea/vomiting in 52%, confusion in 48%, somnolence in 38%, neck stiffness in 33%, a skin rash in 19%, diarrhea in 14%, cervical pain in 14%, seizure in 9%, photophobia in 9% and limb weakness in 4%. Leucopenia was not found. Two patients diagnosed with meningoencephalitis died. Three patients had signs of an acute polyneuropathy, this being the only complaint of one patient. The EEG was abnormal in all cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis, except in three cases. Outbreaks of West Nile Virus Fever are emerging as a worldwide disease with high rates of neurological involvement and death. It should be considered in cases presenting with aseptic meningoencephalitis, meningitis and acute polyneuropathy, especially during the summer months and in areas along bird migration pathways.

Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) diagnosis — serology and diagnostic definitions state that people with HIV and concomitant TE are usually seropositive for anti-Toxoplasma immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the absence of IgG antibody makes a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis unlikely but not impossible; anti-Toxoplasma immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies are usually absent and should not be requested unless primary infection is suspected, and quantitative antibody titers are not useful for diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of TE requires a compatible clinical syndrome, identification of one or more mass lesions by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and detection of the organism in a clinical sample, whereas a presumptive diagnosis is based on a consistent clinical and radiographic presentation, presence of anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies, and response to anti-Toxoplasma therapy, but without detection of the organism; most diagnoses are made either presumptively or based on a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Toxoplasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

### Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus for clinicians-epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and prevention [^bf9b58d8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The prehemorrhagic phase frequently lasts 1–5 days and is usually characterized by nonspecific symptoms. Those symptoms include sudden onset of fever, which lasts for an average of 4–5 days, and nonspecific signs and symptoms such as diarrhea, dizziness, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Headache occurs in almost 70% of patients and tends to be severe. Two thirds of patients describe the pain as mimicking a migraine crisis, including throbbing and being accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia; half of patients describe the headache as worsening with activity. Characteristically, those patients might also develop upper body (face, neck, and chest) hyperemia, conjunctivitis, and congested sclera. Because of the lack of specificity in clinical manifestations, a high index of suspicion on the basis of a thorough exposure and travel history is essential for recognition.

The hemorrhagic illness phase typically begins 3–5 days after symptom onset and is usually short, lasting 1–3 days. This phase begins with a petechial rash of the skin and mucous membranes and might progress to more severe hemorrhagic features at multiple sites, including ecchymoses; cerebral hemorrhage; bleeding from the nasopharynx, gastrointestinal tract (hematemesis and melena), and genitourinary (hematuria) tract; menometrorrhagia; and hemoptysis. Epistaxis is present in < 50% of patients in the hemorrhagic phase, hematemesis in < 35% of patients, hematuria, melena and hematochezia in 10%–20% of patients, and intraabdominal or intracerebral bleeding in 1%–2% of cases. Large ecchymoses are present in 30%–45% of patients, and although they are not pathognomonic, their presence should suggest CCHF over other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Hepatosplenomegaly is common and described in up to one third of patients. Severe disease during this phase is often characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, evidence of coagulation abnormalities (prolonged prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), are typically elevated. Renal insufficiency and hypotension are common in severe cases.

Infectious Considerations

While most bacterial or viral infectious causes were less likely given the subacute time course of our patient's symptoms and clinical appearance, we considered syphilis, fungal meningitis, and Tb meningitis as causative agents of her presentation. Syphilis was least likely, given her negative venereal disease research laboratory testing and preserved posterior column examination findings. Fungal meningitis, which usually affects the immunocompromised population, tends to present with subacute-to-chronic clinical symptoms including headaches; CSF analysis shows normal-to-elevated opening pressure, moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and low glucose, with specific fungal cultures often rendering results. Tb meningitis is rare in Western countries and in HIV-negative patients but can present with worsening fever and headaches over 2–3 weeks; other frequently observed clinical features include lethargy, seizures, and cranial nerve palsies. While routine serologic studies are less helpful (and T-spot can be nonspecific), CSF analysis can show elevated protein, low glucose, and lymphocytic pleocytosis, similar to those CSF findings in fungal meningitis. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears of CSF are positive in less than 25% of patients, so ultimately mycobacteria culture remains the gold standard for detection and diagnosis. MRI usually shows basilar leptomeningitis rather than a smooth pachymeningitis, as seen in our patient. Although our patient had a positive T-spot test, the CSF profile and imaging characteristics were not consistent with a diagnosis of Tb meningitis.

Malignant Infiltration

Finally, in an elderly patient with new-onset headaches, it is important to consider malignant processes, whether primary malignancy or metastatic disease. In our patient, there were undifferentiated masses noted in the lung apices on CT chest, with PET scan showing intensely FDG-avid lung opacities, which raised the suspicion of a malignant process. While there was no primary malignancy noted on her MRI brain, CNS lymphoma is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with progressive encephalopathy or focal neurologic deficits, although it is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients. However, it can be seen in immunocompetent patients, although imaging tends to show uniformly solitary enhancing mass lesions bordering the subarachnoid space without necrosis, rather than pachymeningeal disease.

### Rapid detection ofrhombencephalitis in an immunocompetent patient by multiplexed PCR [^c632ae45]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 46-year-old previously healthy man presented with 1week of headache, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. He was found to have cranial nerve deficits, his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis and brain MRI suggested rhombencephalitis. Although Gram stains and cultures of his CSF did not identify a pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes DNA was detected by the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel within 2hours of performing a lumbar puncture. He was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin and had a near-complete recovery. This case highlights the importance of recognising L. monocytogenes infection as a cause of acute cranial nerve impairment with MRI findings suggestive of brainstem encephalitis. It also highlights the frequently atypical CSF profile and low yield of culture in L. monocytogenes rhombencephalitis and the value of multiplex PCR testing of CSF to rapidly identify this pathogen and permit targeted therapy.

Case report

A 58-year-old previously healthy Hispanic man was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (including fever, diaphoresis, and chills), which did not require hospitalization, and which spontaneously improved with symptomatic treatment over several days. Following this initial improvement, he began to develop fatigue, myalgias, and generalized muscle weakness, which was most severe in the proximal parts of his lower extremities. These symptoms gradually worsened over a period of 1 month and were accompanied by an unintentional 30-pound weight loss and progressive shortness of breath, which prompted his presentation at our emergency department. He denied trauma or use of new medications or substances preceding or during these symptoms.

Dermatology was consulted for the simultaneous development of an asymptomatic erythematous eruption beginning on his scalp, then spreading to the face and posterior part of the neck, which began during the time of his COVID-19 diagnosis 1 month previously. On presentation, erythematous papules coalescing into plaques were noted on the scalp, neck, forehead, eyelids, cheeks, nose (Fig 1, A), and posterior part of the neck (Fig 1, B), as well as violaceous patches over the dorsal aspects of the hands (Fig 2). Musculoskeletal examination was significant for mild upper extremity flexor weakness, and the patient was unable to raise his hands above his head. Normal strength and mobility were noted on the lower extremities, and patient denied paresthesia. Otolaryngology was consulted for worsening odynophagia; however, no anatomic abnormalities were visualized by fiberoptic scope.

Clinical presentation and disease course

A characteristic feature of PMR is a new and relatively acute onset of proximal muscle pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, upper arms, hips and thighs. Patients often suffer from a pronounced morning stiffness with difficulty turning in or getting out of bed in the morning with some spontaneous relief of symptoms later in the day. The stiffness affects even other physical activities in the morning, including getting dressed or taking care of other daily activities. The symptoms are usually fully developed within a few days to a couple of weeks. Occasionally, the onset is more insidious and may lead to nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, arthralgia, loss of appetite, weight loss or fever. It is not unusual that some patients undergo investigations for suspicion of malignant disease before the diagnosis can be made with PMR.

The nonspecific clinical presentation and the absence of specific laboratory findings or serologic features often leads to some diagnostic delay. PMR imposes a major burden on the daily life of elderly people. The psychological impact is significant, including anxiety related to active disease and side effects of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment.

Case

On March 20th, a 68 years old man developed dry cough, headache, fatigue, myalgia and fever up to 39°C followed by anosmia and ageusia. He was tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA 10 days after symptom onset, which revealed a negative result and was treated by the primary care physician at home. Premedical history was uneventful and the patient did not take regular medication. On April 1 st, oral methylprednisolone 10 mg/day was started for suspected rheumatoid arthritis due to persistent pelvic girdle and muscle pain of the proximal lower extremities, a C‐reactive protein of 8.5 mg/dl (normal: 0.0–0.5 mg/dl), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (63 mm/1 h). On April 3rd (14 days after onset of pulmonary disease) the patient had recovered from respiratory symptoms, but still complained of severe fatigue and developed symmetric distal tingling in both feet followed by ascending dysesthesias up to the knees and proximal weakness. The next day he presented at the neurological emergency room with inability to walk. On examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented, afebrile with normal vital signs (oxygen saturation 98% on room air, blood pressure 143/90 mmHg, heat rate 85 bpm). Laboratory examination revealed slightly elevated C‐reactive protein (2.3 mg/dl, normal: 0.0–0.5 mg/dl), fibrinogen level 650 mg/dl (normal: 210–400 mg/dl), white blood cell count 8.1 G/l (normal: 4.0–10.0 G/l), lactate dehydrogenase 276 U/L (normal: 100–250 U/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 55 mm/1 h. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to touch and pinprick in the lower extremities, absent ankle jerk, atactic stance and inability to walk without assistance. Additional truncal dysesthesia prompted spinal cord MRI with unremarkable findings. Lumbar CSF on day 2 after onset of neurological symptoms showed normal cell counts (2/mm [) and protein level (64 mg/dl) and a serum/CSF glucose ratio of 0.83. Due to the history of pulmonary symptoms a chest‐computed tomography was performed and revealed residual ground‐glass opacities in both lower lungs suggestive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Based on the neurological presentation GBS was diagnosed, the patient was admitted to the COVID‐19 isolation ward and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG, 30 g) was initiated. His respiratory condition worsened, and the patient required oxygen supplementation (3 l/min) followed by pressure support non‐invasive ventilation after 36 h. Nerve conduction studies performed on the following day showed F‐wave abnormalities in all nerves, delayed distal motor latency in one nerve, reduced distal amplitudes in two and a sural‐sparing pattern supporting acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype of the GBS (Table 1). Simultaneously, the neurologic presentation worsened with progressive weakness (Medical Research Council grading 1–5) in both arms (2/5) and hands (4/5) and both legs (2/5) and feet (4/5) and generalized areflexia. PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was repeatedly negative in oropharyngeal swabs (three times) as well as in CSF and the patient was transferred to the neurological intensive care unit. At the same time, Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐ antibodies were highly positive in serum and CSF with an optical density (OD) ratio relative to the calibrator OD (normal < 0.8) of 9.6 in serum (diluted 1:100) and 9.1 in CSF (diluted 1:2) determined by commercially available CE‐marked ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany;) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Due to the non‐linearity of the read‐out the intrathecal fraction (i.e. antibody specific index) could not be quantified and it is not possible to differentiate intrathecal synthesis of antibodies or passive transfer across the blood‐CSF barrier. As yet, we detected no false positives or negatives using this ELISA. Anti‐ganglioside antibodies, PCR for Cytomegalovirus, Epstein‐Barr virus, Influenza virus A/B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and IgM antibodies for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative in this patient. Due to muscle weakness accompanied by respiratory failure the patient underwent elective intubation in a fully conscious state and the initial intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, which was initiated on April 6th (total dose 30 g) was switched to plasma exchange on April 7th, which was 3 days after symptom onset. In total four cycles of plasma exchange were performed. Again, SARS‐CoV‐2 on PCR assay from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was negative. The patient improved gradually and was transferred to a neuro‐rehabilitation facility 4 weeks after symptom onset, where he regained mobility without significant help another 4 weeks later.

### Rapidly progressive dementia and ataxia in an elderly man [^affed331]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Among paraneoplastic causes, we should consider anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. This characteristic syndrome develops in three stages. The first features a prodromal illness of fever, headache, nausea, gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms. This is followed by psychiatric symptoms, short-term memory and speech problems. In the third phase, patients develop decreased responsiveness, abnormal movements (typically orolingual facial dyskinesias) and autonomic symptoms. MRI is abnormal in half of all cases, with T2 or FLAIR signal hyperintensity in the hippocampi, cerebellar or cerebral cortex, frontobasal and insular regions, basal ganglia, brainstem and rarely spinal cord. The CSF is abnormal in 80%; including a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and normal or with mildly increased protein. There are CSF-specific oligoclonal bands in 60%. This patient's age is against anti-NMDAR encephalitis, having a mean age of onset of 19 years. However, some cases are aged > 70 years. Testing for NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antibodies would help to exclude this diagnosis.

In the setting of a possible paraneoplastic disorder, one should consider other possible causes of confusion, such as hyponatraemia (from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) and hypercalcaemia. Hence, we would need to see his serum electrolytes, osmolality and serum calcium, corrected for serum albumin levels.

If we assume that the peripheral neuropathy is chronic and diabetic and unrelated to his presentation, what then could cause just the subacute dementia and ataxia? The differential diagnosis becomes much broader. However, we should first consider the possibility that the dementia and ataxia are, in fact, due to the hydrocephalus, as suggested on MRI.

The Study

A 48-year-old woman had muscle pain and an elevated body temperature 2 weeks after a tick bite on her right hip. She tested negative for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and her general practitioner prescribed antimicrobial drugs. A few days later, the patient was hospitalized with asthenia, tremor, drowsiness, and fever. A neurologist determined signs of peripheral facial palsy with brachial weakness and nuchal rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed an elevated leukocyte count (37 cells/µL; reference range 0–5 cells/µL). Borrelia serology and PCR results were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed demyelinating lesions and encephalopathy and electroencephalography showed diffuse slow activity. Serum collected on day 5 after illness onset tested positive for TBEV IgM and IgG by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) performed at the NRC. Several months later, the patient still had weakness of her right arm, loss of cognitive function, inability to concentrate, fatigue, and tremor.

A 59-year-old man was admitted to the neurology department of a hospital in Belgium with paraparesis and meningitis. Influenza-like symptoms, including fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache, had occurred a few days earlier. CSF showed an elevated leukocyte count (371 cells/µL; reference range 0–5 cells/µL). Positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI showed no signs of underlying malignancies or encephalopathy. Infectious diseases screening did not reveal the etiology. The patient recalled a tick bite after a walk in a forest in his neighborhood 2 weeks before symptom onset. Borrelia and TBEV serology were added to the differential diagnosis, and TBEV antibodies were detected by IFA performed on serum collected on day 20 after illness onset. The patient went through a severe motor polyradiculitis and was using a wheelchair at discharge. At his last clinical evaluation, 9 months after hospitalization, the patient's motor skills had clearly improved.

Anesthesiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of infectious complications associated with neuraxial techniques — periodic clinical checks — notes that early signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, backache, headache, erythema, tenderness at the insertion site) may be associated with the onset of infectious complications, and additional symptoms (e.g., stiff neck, photophobia, radiating pain, loss of motor function, confusion) may indicate further development. The Task Force notes that signs or symptoms may either manifest within a few hours or may not be apparent for weeks after neuraxial analgesia or anesthesia. Both consultants and ASA members strongly agree that periodic evaluation is essential; they agree that signs and symptoms should be assessed once per day and strongly agree that signs and symptoms should be promptly attended. Finally, they strongly agree that, if an infection is suspected, an in situ catheter should be immediately removed.

### Toscana virus meningo-encephalitis: an important differential diagnosis for elderly travellers returning from mediterranean countries [^33b35043]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Toscana virus is a Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), transmitted via sandfly (Phelobotomus spp) bites, and is endemic to countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea (Portugal, Spain, France, Greece, Croatia, Cyprus, Turkey), where there is a high seropositivity rate. Infection rates are highest in summer when the sandfly is most active, making this virus among the top three causes of meningitis in this region during this season.

The incubation period is up to 2 weeks, with typical symptoms of meningo-encephalitis: headache, fever, neck rigidity, positive Kernig's sign, tremors, reduced Glasgow Coma Scale score, paresis and nystagmus. Hyperaesthesia has been described and was seen in our patient. Symptoms usually resolve over 7 days with no long term sequelae, though changes in personality after Toscana encephalitis have been reported. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine.

Diagnosis can be made by demonstrating a rise in Toscana virus IgG on serum, though there is cross-reactivity with other phleboviruses. Toscana virus can be identified using real-time PCR on CSF and serum only during acute infection, as the viraemia is short-lived. Only a few cases of Toscana infection are diagnosed each year in the UK and it is not a routine consideration in the differential diagnosis of viral meningo-encephalitis. Although a recent case has been reported in a traveller returning to the UK from Italy, this appears to be the first published case of Toscana virus in a traveller returning to the UK from Spain.

The purpose of this case report is to increase the awareness of Toscana virus infection, and the need to consider imported infection in the differential diagnosis of febrile elderly patients with confusion, particularly in elderly travellers who may travel to exotic warmer locations during their retirement. Making a diagnosis of Toscana virus meningitis/encephalitis (where no other pathogen is detected) can have a useful clinical impact by reducing or preventing unnecessary use of antibiotics, as well as reassuring the patient and family that generally, this illness is self-limiting with a full recovery expected within a few weeks, as in the case reported here.

### Meningitis due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: an often-overlooked complication of a widely used medication [^a3a050dc]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

As defined above, the patient developed an aseptic meningitis (CSF pleocytosis of lymphocytic predominance with negative cultures and PCR for common aetiologies of acute purulent meningitis). CSF pleocytosis evolved from polymorphonuclear to lymphocytic predominance, which is described in cases where lumbar puncture is performed within the first 48 hours of disease progression. Thus, we believe that the meningitis process started shortly before the first lumbar puncture and that the first days of headache were linked to another condition (possibly tension-type headache as initially retained). In the workup, the patient had a negative two-tiered testing for B. burgdorferi as well as a negative CSF PCR. Although these tests have a low sensitivities for detecting early neuroborreliosis, we considered them sufficient to exclude this diagnosis in the absence of obvious recent tick exposure. Although the CSF constellation together with the epidemiological context and the presence of a positive TB-spot rose up concern about possible meningeal tuberculosis, we stopped considering this diagnosis given the resolution of symptoms on NSAID interruption and without antituberculous treatment. Leptospirosis can occur as a biphasic illness and aseptic meningitis is a common finding. Diagnostic suspicion should be high in case of exposure to possible contaminated environmental sources, presence of haemorrhage, myalgia, bilateral enlarged kidneys, sterile pyuria, hypokalemia or thrombocytopenia. None of the above was present in our case except a potential professional exposure to rodent's excrements. We did not formally exclude this infection, but we performed an eubacterial PCR (detection of bacterial ribosomal 16S DNA) in the CSF that would have detected leptospirosis if present. Research on enteroviruses, HSV type 1 and 2 and VZV by PCR in the CSF has also been negative. Aseptic meningitis can be directly caused by HIV-1 during acute infection and p24 antigen should be detected in the blood. Thus, in absence of other signs for an acute HIV infection with negative p24 research, we did not retain this diagnosis. A second HIV test was performed 3 months later with negative results. Mumps can also cause an aseptic meningitis before parotid involvementand because of an unknown vaccine history, we performed a serological test that reflected seropositivity with protective immunity. Concerning tick-borne encephalitis, we concluded that a cross-reaction with previous yellow fever vaccination explained the positive IgG results. We also looked for LCMV infection but serology was negative. Our patient did not have any classical risk factors for invasive fungal infection, namely haematological malignancy, solid organ transplantation or intensive care unit stay. Regarding endemic mycoses in Colombia, histoplasmosis, paracoccidiomycosis and coccidiomycosis can sometimes present as meningitis in immunocompetent patients. Due to the clinical improvement of our patient without any specific treatment and thus a low suspicion for this type of infections, we only performed a panfungal PCR (detection of fungal ribosomal DNA) that was negative.

### Cerebrospinal fluid findings in an adult with human metapneumovirus-associated encephalitis [^f049aa1b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Acute encephalitis/encephalopathy associated with human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been documented in children. Recently, Fok et al. described an encephalitis case in an adult but were unable to test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for HMPV. Following authors' recommendations, we performed diagnostic testing on the CSF of an adult with HMPV-associated encephalitis.

A previously healthy 61-year-old man came to our institution with headache and seizures 5 days after onset of an influenza-like illness. A lumbar puncture on admission revealed pleocytosis (36 cells/µL) and a mononuclear predominance of 98%. Results of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the head and chest radiography on admission were inconclusive. The patient was treated in the intensive care unit for possible viral and bacterial meningoencephalitis. Although results of routine CSF-workup for infectious causes were unremarkable, total CSF protein level was elevated at 1.39 g/L (reference range 0.2–0.4 g/L). A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for HMPV (cycle threshold 28.6) using duplex reverse transcription PCR (r-gene; Biomérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).

Blood biological tests revealed CRP elevation (165 mg/L) without leukocytosis (4,100/mm 3) or thrombocytopenia (198 G/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples revealed the following features: the white blood cell count was 400/mm 3 (70% neutrophils and 30% lymphocytes), blood cell count was 2/mm, protein concentration was 1.52 g/L, and glucose concentration was 3.20 mmol/L (concomitant blood glucose was 5.6 mmol/L). Regarding the search for etiology, only anti-TONV IgM was positive in CSF, and TONV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could not be performed. Direct examination and culture for acid/alcohol–fast bacilli, Streptococcus pneumoniae soluble antigen, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Toxoplasma gondii PCR were negative in CSF. All other infectious investigations were negative (thick and thin blood smear for malaria, cultures on blood, urine and stool, chikungunya PCR, serodiagnosis for M. pneumoniae, hepatitis B and C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, HHV6, VZV, EBV, toxoplasmosis, chikungunya, dengue, and MAYV).

The clinical evolution was favorable in 3 days without any neurological sequelae. Cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities disappeared on the lumbar puncture performed 6 days after the first one.

### Pseudotumor cerebri as the presentation of Lyme disease in a non-endemic area [^3253e697]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Intracranial hypertension is a rare entity in prepubertal children, and its differential diagnosis includes a number of systemic diseases, drugs, vitamin deficiencies and excesses, and hereditary conditions. Infectious aetiology is rare. The case of a 9-year-old boy with intracranial hypertension secondary to acute neuroborreliosis is described. He presented with daily pulsatile frontotemporal headache, pallor, photophobia and phonophobia. His neurological examination revealed papilledema with no nuchal rigidity. The lumbar puncture showed increased pressure (50cm H 2 O) and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were positive. This kind of infection is rare in Portugal but a trip to an endemic area was identified. A careful history, considering the exposure to rural areas together with the intracranial hypertension and inflammatory CSF, are important clues to the diagnosis, allowing the institution to select appropriate treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^7b93c9fe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Presumed infectious lymphadenopathy in adults — empiric antibiotics and follow-up: While some sources acknowledge that resolution of inflammatory lymphadenopathy may take 6 to 12 weeks, most sources recommend observation limited to 2 weeks and do not advise delaying further evaluation beyond the initial 2-week period; it is reasonable to prescribe a single course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic for a neck mass that appears infectious provided the patient is followed, and a patient treated with antibiotics should be reassessed within 2 weeks; if the mass has not completely resolved, further workup for possible malignancy is recommended and partial resolution requires additional evaluation; if infectious lymphadenopathy resolves, the patient should be reassessed once more in 2 to 4 weeks to monitor for recurrence; in the absence of signs and symptoms suggesting infection, empiric antibiotics should be avoided and the mass should undergo further workup.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^26271591]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Nervous system toxicities — encephalitis (immune checkpoint inhibitor [ICPi]–related) management is graded by severity: For G1, hold ICPi and discuss resumption only after weighing risks and benefits, and as above for aseptic meningitis suggest concurrent IV acyclovir until PCR results obtained and negative. For G2, a trial of methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d and neurology consultation are advised; if severe or progressing symptoms or oligoclonal bands are present, consider pulse corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3–5 days) plus IVIG 2 g/kg over 5 days (0.4 g/kg/d) or plasmapheresis, and taper steroids following acute management over at least 4–6 weeks; if positive for autoimmune encephalopathy or paraneoplastic antibody or with limited or no improvement, consider rituximab in consultation. Admit patient for G3-4.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^4e0ca2cf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck mass in adults — suspicious history criteria: Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy when the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥ 2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration; Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. Supporting details state that in the setting of a neck mass without recent infection, the clinician should establish the duration, that a noninfectious neck mass present ≥ 2 weeks without signs of improvement is concerning for malignancy, that unknown duration should be considered a persistent mass at increased risk for malignancy, and that the mere presence of a neck mass present ≥ 2 weeks without signs of improvement is suspicious even without other risk factors.

### An unusual presentation of herpes simplex encephalitis with negative PCR [^e90db1e8]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 74-year-old man presented with acute right-sided hemiparesis and epilepsia partialis continua in association with fever and confusion. Initial workup revealed possible cerebritis in the left medial frontal lobe without involvement of the temporal lobes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed minimal lymphocytic pleocytosis but negative real-time herpes simplex virus (HSV) PCR. Acyclovir was discontinued on day 5 due to a negative infectious workup and clinical improvement. On day 9 his condition deteriorated and he was transferred to a higher level of acuity for advanced supportive care. Worsening encephalopathy and refractory status epilepticus ensued despite medical care. Repeat CSF analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis with negative real-time HSV PCR. Brain MRI revealed progression of cortical enhancement. Immunosuppressive therapy and plasma exchange were attempted without clinical response. On day 24, another lumbar puncture showed only mild lymphocytic pleocytosis. Brain MRI showed involvement of the right medial temporal lobe. Subsequently, acyclovir was resumed. The HSV-1 PCR result was positive on day 30. Unfortunately, the patient expired.

### Encephalitis [^42f87aa0]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is a serious and potentially treatable infection of the central nervous system. A pathogen is identified in less than 50% of cases. The differential diagnosis includes acute infection, immune-mediated causes, and other central nervous system processes. Emergent investigations include blood work, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and neuroimaging. Empiric acyclovir and antibiotics should be started immediately to maximize the child's chance of neurologic recovery.

### Neuroimaging features of immune-related adverse events due to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^64a63c26]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Neurologic irAEs are rare and varied. The diagnosis may be challenging, as the clinical and imaging features often overlap with other differentials such as metastatic deposits, including leptomeningeal metastatic disease or infection. Diagnosing, or at least considering, a neurologic irAE is important for instigating the appropriate management and optimising patient outcomes.

### Tick-borne encephalitis related uveitis: a case report [^84f2c29c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an infectious disease of the central nervous system caused by the TBE virus (TBEV), which is usually transmitted by a tick-bite, with increasing incidence in northeastern Europe and eastern Asia during the past decade. Ocular involvement has not been described in the literature to date.

Case Presentation

A 58-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with occipital headaches and poor balance for 5 days. He reported a tick-bite 6 weeks before without erythema migrans followed by a flu-like syndrome. Serological testing was negative for Borreliosis and TBEV. At presentation, he was febrile with neck stiffness and signs of ataxia. Three days later, he presented unilateral visual loss in his right eye. Examination revealed non granulomatous anterior uveitis, vitreous inflammation, and retinal haemorrhages at the posterior pole without macular oedema or papillitis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the cerebrospinal fluid returned negative for all Herpes family viruses. No clinical evidence of other infection nor malignancy was identified. A seroconversion of the TBEV- immunoglobulin titres was observed 2 weeks later while the serum antibodies for Borrelia were still not detected. Magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable. We concluded to the diagnosis of TBE-related uveitis. Under supportive treatment, there was complete resolution of the neurological symptoms and the intraocular inflammation without sequelae within the following weeks.

Conclusions

We describe a new association of TBEV with uveitis. In view of the growing number of TBE cases and the potential severity of the disease we aim at heightening awareness to achieve prompt recognition, prevention, and treatment.

### Diagnostic approach to encephalitis and meningoencephalitis in adult returning travellers [^24282915]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Encephalitis and meningoencephalitis are severe, sometime life-threatening infections of the central nervous system. Travellers may be exposed to a variety of neurotropic pathogens.

Aims

We propose to review known infectious causes of encephalitis in adults acquired outside Europe, and how to identify them.

Sources

We used Pubmed and Embase, to search the most relevant publications over the last years.

Content

Microbiologic tests and radiological tools to best identify the causative pathogen in travellers presenting with encephalitis and ME are presented in this narrative review, as well as a diagnostic approach tailored to the visited area and types of exposures.

Implications

This review highlights the diagnostic difficulties inherent to exotic causes of central nervous system infections, and attempts to guide clinicians with respect to which microbiological tests to consider, in addition to brain MRI, when approaching a returning traveller presenting with encephalitis.
