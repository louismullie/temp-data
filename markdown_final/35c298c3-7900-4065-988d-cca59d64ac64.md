## Question

alt to ast ratio

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the AST to ALT ratio, including its definition, pathophysiology, diagnostic and prognostic applications, thresholds, confounders, and a practical, stepwise clinical approach to its interpretation and use in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the AST/ALT ratio and the biological basis for its interpretation. Then, I should verify etiologic clues from the ratio, especially alcoholic liver disease and fibrosis patterns. Next, I will examine prognostic uses, including short-term mortality in cirrhosis and cardiovascular outcomes. After that, I need to check thresholds across contexts and how to calculate and report them. Then, I will review confounders and limitations, including age, extrahepatic AST sources, and normal-range values. Finally, I will integrate a pragmatic, stepwise clinical algorithm and close with key takeaways, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and validated data where possible.

> Let me first confirm the basics. The AST to ALT ratio, often called the De Ritis ratio, is simply AST divided by ALT, both measured in IU/L, and is commonly used to infer patterns of hepatocellular injury and prognosis, with AST distributed more broadly in liver and extrahepatic tissues while ALT is more liver specific, which already hints at why a higher ratio may reflect non-hepatic injury or specific liver pathologies such as alcoholic injury and fibrosis [^111Zqb9T] [^112NepRM].

> I need to ensure the pathophysiologic rationale is sound. In alcoholic liver disease, mitochondrial AST predominance and reduced ALT production or clearance shift the ratio upward, and as fibrosis advances, ALT tends to fall relative to AST, so a higher ratio often signals more advanced disease. However, hold on, I should verify that these are tendencies rather than absolutes, because overlap exists across etiologies and non-hepatic AST elevations can mimic this pattern [^115WpuiT] [^117RYf6K].

> Next, I should review etiologic clues by ratio magnitude. Let me consider the classic thresholds: an AST/ALT ratio greater than 2 is strongly suggestive of alcoholic liver disease and appears in the majority of such cases, whereas a ratio above 1.5 supports the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis in the right clinical context. Wait, I almost said the ratio alone establishes alcoholic hepatitis, but I should correct that because diagnosis is clinical plus biochemistry with exclusion of alternatives, and sometimes biopsy is used when confounders exist [^117RYf6K] [^112ZtgFB] [^114mwBou]. For NAFLD, I initially thought the ratio is always less than 1, but hold on, that's too rigid; NAFLD typically shows ALT higher than AST, yet the ratio can approach or exceed 1 in some patients, especially with advancing fibrosis, so I should avoid over-reliance on a single cutoff [^111ipmZU] [^116mi66H]. In cirrhosis, the ratio tends to be greater than 1, reflecting architectural distortion and altered enzyme kinetics, though again, this is supportive rather than definitive on its own [^117RYf6K].

> I will now examine prognostic applications. In cirrhosis and ICU cohorts, an elevated AST/ALT ratio independently predicts short-term mortality with a nonlinear relationship. I should double-check the inflection point — several large datasets show risk rises with increasing ratio up to about 3.6 and then plateaus, likely reflecting mitochondrial injury, systemic inflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction at higher ratios. Below 3.6, each unit increase associates with roughly a 40% higher mortality risk, and the signal persists after adjustment for MELD and other confounders [^111ga5XS] [^113ohUTN] [^115WpuiT]. Let me verify whether this holds outside critical care; yes, in viral cirrhosis, the AST/ALT ratio correlates with MELD and Child-Pugh and has prognostic value comparable to MELD for 1-year survival, and combining AST/ALT with MELD improves discrimination, supporting its role as a simple, dynamic prognostic marker in decompensated disease [^1178nVN8] [^111xbVMC].

> But wait, what about cardiovascular risk. In primary care populations, an elevated AST/ALT ratio associates with incident cardiovascular disease in men but does not meaningfully improve discrimination when added to standard risk tools like Framingham or QRISK2; however, subgroup analyses suggest potential utility in those with elevated ALT or metabolic phenotypes, so I should not dismiss it outright in high-risk subgroups [^112EKPPo] [^1118N5Xg]. Hold on, I should verify broader mortality data; a large cohort showed elevated AST carried higher all-cause and liver-related mortality than ALT, reinforcing that the ratio may capture systemic risk, though causality remains complex and confounded by metabolic and inflammatory pathways [^116iCHjp].

> Next, I should review how to calculate and report the ratio. I need to ensure both AST and ALT are measured on the same sample and reported together, ideally with the ratio displayed on the lab report. Several pathways recommend reflex addition of AST when ALT is abnormal so the ratio can be calculated without a second phlebotomy, which is both clinically useful and cost-effective in community screening strategies [^116MUPTF] [^114NuJiE]. Let me reconsider whether normal-range values matter. Yes, even when both AST and ALT are within reference intervals, the ratio can still be informative for fibrosis risk, so I should not ignore a ratio greater than 1 in the right clinical context [^116MUPTF].

> I should confirm practical thresholds across scenarios. For alcoholic liver disease, an AST/ALT ratio of at least 2 is classic, and in alcoholic hepatitis, a ratio above 1.5 alongside compatible clinical features supports the diagnosis. For cirrhosis, a ratio greater than 1 is suggestive but nonspecific, and in ICU cohorts, a ratio around 3.6 marks a risk inflection point. For NAFLD, I should avoid assuming the ratio must be less than 1, as fibrotic NASH can raise the ratio toward or above 1, so I need to integrate the ratio with other markers and imaging rather than use it in isolation [^117RYf6K] [^112ZtgFB] [^111ga5XS] [^111ipmZU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing confounders. Age lowers ALT independently of fibrosis, artifactually inflating the ratio and reducing specificity for advanced fibrosis in older adults; muscle injury and cardiac injury can elevate AST and distort the ratio; and in sepsis and COVID-19, AST from extrahepatic sources and mitochondrial injury can drive a high ratio that tracks with multi-organ failure, so I should corroborate with CK, troponin, and clinical context before attributing a high ratio to liver disease alone [^111g8js6] [^115WpuiT] [^112NepRM]. I need to ensure I also account for assay variability and the lack of standardized ALT upper limits of normal, which can complicate interpretation of borderline ratios [^112nyEMD].

> Let me integrate a stepwise clinical approach. First, I should confirm that AST and ALT are measured together and rechecked if discordant, then calculate the ratio explicitly. Second, I will interpret the ratio in the context of absolute enzyme levels, because a ratio of 1.5 means something different when AST is 150 IU/L versus 30 IU/L. Third, I will correlate with the clinical picture, alcohol intake, metabolic risk, medications, and symptoms. Fourth, I will use the ratio to refine etiologic hypotheses but verify with targeted labs and imaging rather than diagnose from the ratio alone. Finally, if the ratio is elevated and risk for fibrosis is present, I will apply validated noninvasive fibrosis scores such as FIB-4 or APRI and consider transient elastography, recognizing that the AST/ALT ratio alone has only modest diagnostic performance for advanced fibrosis in NAFLD [^1155asMt] [^112qbr8u] [^113BTdM5].

> I should double-check special populations and edge cases. In Wilson disease acute liver failure, an AST/ALT ratio above 2.2 combined with an alkaline phosphatase to bilirubin ratio below 4 is highly specific. In acetaminophen poisoning, a very low AST/ALT ratio, around 0.4 or less after peak injury, can indicate resolving transaminases and may support safe discontinuation of NAC. And in chronic hepatitis C, the AST/ALT ratio tends to rise as fibrosis advances, which can complement platelet-based algorithms to reduce unnecessary biopsy [^113NEGxq] [^11432eW4] [^111xbVMC].

> In summary, I need to ensure the AST/ALT ratio is used as an adjunct, not a stand-alone diagnostic test. It offers etiologic hints, especially for alcohol-related disease and advanced fibrosis, and carries prognostic information in cirrhosis and selected systemic contexts, but its performance is context dependent and confounded by age, muscle injury, and assay variability. Therefore, I should always interpret it alongside absolute enzyme values, clinical history, and, when appropriate, noninvasive fibrosis scores or elastography to guide next steps in diagnosis and management [^117RYf6K] [^111ga5XS] [^112qbr8u].

The AST/ALT ratio (De Ritis ratio) is most useful for distinguishing **alcoholic liver disease** (typically AST/ALT > 2) [^114AMv5F] from other causes of liver injury, and for identifying **advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis** (often > 1) [^117RYf6K]. It has limited standalone diagnostic value and should be interpreted with clinical context and other tests; **ratios < 1 favor NAFLD or viral hepatitis** [^116mi66H], while very high ratios (> 3.6) in critical illness indicate severe hepatocellular injury and higher mortality [^111ga5XS]. The ratio is not reliable for detecting early fibrosis or NAFLD and should not replace FIB-4 or APRI [^112qbr8u] [^115yovUs].

---

## Physiological basis of AST and ALT

AST and ALT are **hepatocellular enzymes** released with injury; ALT is more liver-specific, whereas AST is also found in heart, muscle, and other tissues [^111Zqb9T] [^115WpuiT]. This distribution underpins the diagnostic utility of the AST/ALT ratio.

---

## Clinical significance of AST/ALT ratio

The AST/ALT ratio helps **differentiate liver diseases** and gauge severity, but it is not diagnostic in isolation and must be interpreted in context [^1155asMt].

---

### Alcoholic liver disease (ALD)

- **AST/ALT > 2**: Strongly suggests ALD, reflecting mitochondrial AST release and reduced ALT synthesis [^114AMv5F].
- **AST/ALT > 3**: Highly specific for ALD, especially with GGT elevation and clinical history [^114AMv5F].
- **Mechanism**: Alcohol-related mitochondrial injury and altered hepatocyte metabolism drive the ratio up [^notfound].

---

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

In NAFLD, **AST/ALT < 1** is typical, reflecting hepatocellular injury without the mitochondrial AST surge seen in ALD [^116mi66H]. An **AST/ALT > 1** may indicate advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in NAFLD, but the ratio alone is insufficient for staging [^112qbr8u].

---

### Viral hepatitis

In viral hepatitis, **AST/ALT < 1** is common in chronic HBV/HCV, whereas **AST/ALT > 1** suggests advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [^117RYf6K].

---

### Advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis

In advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, **AST/ALT > 1** is common and reflects architectural distortion and altered enzyme kinetics [^117RYf6K]. However, the ratio has only **limited accuracy** for fibrosis staging; use FIB-4 or APRI for better performance [^112qbr8u] [^113BTdM5].

---

## Prognostic implications

The AST/ALT ratio carries prognostic value across **liver diseases**:

- **Mortality**: Higher ratios correlate with increased mortality in cirrhosis and acute liver failure [^notfound].
- **Critical illness**: Ratios > 3.6 in ICU cirrhotics predict higher 28-day mortality, with a nonlinear risk relationship [^notfound].
- **Cancer**: Elevated preoperative AST/ALT ratios predict worse outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

- **Non-hepatic sources**: Muscle injury, cardiac disease, and hemolysis can elevate AST and distort the ratio [^115WpuiT].
- **Age**: Older patients have higher baseline ratios, reducing specificity for fibrosis [^111g8js6].
- **Assay variability**: Laboratory differences can affect ratio interpretation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend using the AST/ALT ratio alongside **clinical context and other tests** [^117RYf6K]. For ALD, an **AST/ALT > 2** supports the diagnosis but should be confirmed with history, GGT, and exclusion of other causes [^114AMv5F]. For fibrosis assessment, the ratio alone is insufficient; **use FIB-4 or APRI** for better accuracy [^112qbr8u].

---

## Clinical implications of AST/ALT ratio

| **Clinical scenario** | **Typical AST/ALT ratio** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Alcoholic liver disease | > 2 | Strongly suggestive of ALD |
| Advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis | > 1 | Suggests advanced liver disease |
| NAFLD | < 1 | Typical pattern |
| Viral hepatitis | < 1 | Common in chronic HBV/HCV |
| Severe hepatocellular injury | > 3.6 | Associated with high mortality |

---

The AST/ALT ratio is a **practical, low-cost tool** for suggesting ALD, advanced fibrosis, or severe hepatocellular injury, but it is not diagnostic in isolation and should be integrated with clinical context and other noninvasive tests for accurate assessment [^117RYf6K].

### Nonlinear association between AST / ALT ratio and 28-day all-cause mortality following ICU admission in critically ill cirrhotic patients: a retrospective cohort study [^114Qa93w]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, our analysis based on data from a single US medical center may not be broadly generalizable to other geographic and demographic settings. This retrospective observational study identifies correlation, not causation, between the AST/ALT ratio and 28-day mortality following ICU admission. Despite adjustments for known confounders, unmeasured variables may influence results. Genetic polymorphisms affecting hepatic enzymes may modify AST/ALT-mortality relationships. Prior liver function status represents another potential confounder, as baseline hepatic reserve affects outcomes but may not be fully captured in the database. Concurrent infections may independently elevate transaminases while increasing mortality risk. Nutritional status and sarcopenia, significant predictors of survival in cirrhosis, could also confound observed associations. Moreover, medication history and alcohol consumption may affect both AST/ALT ratios and outcomes.

A notable limitation is our inability to account for cirrhosis etiology (alcoholic, viral, or NASH), which may independently influence both baseline AST/ALT ratios and mortality risk. For instance, alcoholic liver disease often elevates AST/ALT ratio regardless of disease severity, potentially confounding our observed association. The study's exclusive focus on short-term outcomes, rather than long-term prognosis, represents an additional limitation.

A critical limitation is the non-specificity of the AST/ALT ratio as a liver marker. While interpreted primarily as an indicator of liver dysfunction or fibrosis, AST may be elevated due to injury in various organs including muscle, heart, and other tissues. In critically ill patients with potential multi-organ dysfunction, conditions such as acute myocardial injury or rhabdomyolysis could contribute to elevated AST levels independently of liver status. Ideally, specific biomarkers such as CK (for muscle injury) and troponin (for cardiac injury) would help differentiate the source of AST elevation. Future prospective studies should incorporate these biomarkers to better isolate liver-specific AST elevation and thus provide more precise interpretation of the AST/ALT ratio's prognostic value in cirrhotic patients. Despite this limitation, our findings in a confirmed cirrhotic population suggest that the AST/ALT ratio remains a valuable prognostic tool, though clinicians should consider potential extrahepatic sources of AST elevation when interpreting individual cases. Our dataset did not permit isolation of liver-origin AST from other sources. Therefore, the prognostic value observed might partially reflect overall illness severity or extrahepatic organ injury, both independently associated with increased mortality risk.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113XoUqa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### Prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 infection and association with clinical outcomes [^115Kgq71]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver injury in COVID-19 patients might occur from viral infection of hepatocytes, or as a response to cytokine storm resulting in inflammation. This needs to be further corroborated by direct clinical evidence. SARS virus has been isolated in liver tissue based on some case series, although viral inclusions were not observed and the overall viral titer was low. On the other hand, in an alternative case report of a pathological analysis of a patient who died from COVID-19, viral inclusions in hepatic tissue were not noted.

In conclusion, liver injury indicators may help foresee disease severity. Patients with elevated AST and AST/ALT ratio are at higher risk of severe disease, as evidenced by intubation, vasopressor use, and inpatient death. These patients should be monitored closely, given their propensity for severe disease.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Liver function abnormalities have been observed in patients with COVID-19 infection
Evidence of extrapulmonary organ involvement, including hepatic injury, has been associated with higher mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection, based on previously published reports
Several mechanisms of liver injury have been described thus far, including potential binding of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 positive cholangiocytes, and causing cholangiocyte dysfunction, along with mild lobular and portal involvement and progression to microvesicular steatosis

What the new findings are:

An elevated aspartate (AST)/alanine (ALT) aminotransferase ratio of 2 or more can serve as a marker for multiorgan involvement, given that AST can be produced by several other organs apart from the liver; in our study, an elevated AST/ALT ratio was associated with severe clinical outcomes, as evidenced by increased need for intubation, intensive care unit admission, and vasopressor use
Patients with severe COVID-19 infection were more frequently noted to have AST elevation compared to ALT elevation
AST levels had the highest correlation with severe disease compared to other individual markers reflecting liver injury

### Quality standards for the management of alcohol-related liver disease: consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British society of gastroenterology ARLD special interest group [^1168321n]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AH should be diagnosed in keeping with recognised clinical criteria; patients suspected as having AH but who have confounding factors or do not fulfil all criteria should be considered for liver biopsy

The diagnosis of AH has been controversial in the past. Previously it had been argued that a diagnosis of AH could only be made with confirmatory histology. For most AH patients this would require a transjugular liver biopsy the availability of which is variable and for which there is a technical failure rate of 3.2% and a diagnostically suboptimal sample obtained in up to 12%. In addition, histological features of steatohepatitis may be present in patients with chronic liver disease without an acute illness. AH is primarily a clinical diagnosis with recent onset jaundice being a cardinal feature. In order to standardise the clinical features of AH the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has published criteria which have received general acceptance. Onset of jaundice (serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL or 50 µmol/L) within 8 weeks and excessive alcohol consumption within 60 days of presentation are key. The liver biochemistry should be compatible with AH with a raised AST, an AST-to-ALT ratio of > 1.5 and neither value > 400 IU/L. Fulfilment of these criteria without any confounding factors equates to a diagnosis of 'probable' AH which suffices for most clinical situations. A 'definite' diagnosis of AH is when these clinical features are fulfilled and there is additional confirmatory histology. However, if confounding factors are present then the level of diagnostic certainty falls to 'possible' AH in which case additional confirmatory histology would be recommended to make the diagnosis. Examples of such factors would be incompatible liver biochemistry, possible ischaemic liver injury (secondary to hypotension or cocaine use within 7 days), possible metabolic liver injury (Wilson's disease), possible drug induced liver injury (suspect drug within 30 days of jaundice) and uncertainty regarding timing of onset of jaundice. Liver biopsy rarely changes the diagnosis in individuals who meet the clinical criteria or history of alcohol excess.

It should be noted that while these criteria have been accepted and form part of guidelines, the threshold of serum bilirubin recommended is lower than that of most historical clinical studies of AH. These have tended to use a threshold of 80 µmol/L (4.7 mg/dL) or more. Therefore, the applicability of previous clinical studies to those with lower levels of serum bilirubin is unclear.

### Significance of alanine aminotransferase levels in patients admitted for cocaine intoxication [^11212KfT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Experimental studies in animal models and case reports in humans have described the hepatotoxic potential of cocaine. However, there are few data regarding the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients admitted for cocaine intoxication, particularly regarding the status of the liver enzymes.

Goal

To investigate the significance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in individuals hospitalized for acute cocaine intoxication.

Methods

Retrospective study with standardized chart review that included patients admitted between January 2003 and December 2010. Bivariate analyses were used to investigate factors associated with ALT above the upper tertile according to gender. Cases of marked ALT elevation were described in detail.

Results

Ninety-three patients were included (79% men, mean age of 27.73 ± 9.97 y). ALT above the upper tertile was associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine phosphokinase, creatinine, and international normalized ratio. Higher levels of ALT were also related to acute renal failure and death. Five subjects had severe ALT elevation during follow-up and all had evidence of hepatocellular dysfunction (jaundice, prolonged prothrombin time with or without hepatic encephalopathy), rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. AST/ALT ratio < 2 was present in 2 subjects with severe ALT elevation at admission, but AST/ALT ratio > 2 was observed in 3 cases with evidence of progression to acute liver injury.

Conclusions

In acute cocaine intoxication, higher ALT levels were associated with evidence of muscle damage, progression to acute renal failure, and death. Severe liver damage was observed in 5% of the sample and was associated with rhabdomyolysis and renal failure in all cases.

### Association between serum transaminase levels and insulin resistance in euthyroid and non-diabetic adults [^117F5PgT]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and insulin resistance (IR) in a population of healthy individuals.

Methods

We define IR with a cut-off point of homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) ≥ 3.8. For aspartate aminotransferase (AST), we consider elevated values > 30 U/L in women and values > 36 U/L in men. For alanine aminotransferase (ALT), we consider elevated values > 30 U/L in women and values > 40 U/L in men. We performed a crude and adjusted generalized linear model from Poisson family with robust variance, in order to evaluate the association between elevated serum transaminase levels and IR. The associations were presented as prevalence ratio (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Results

We included 261 participants in the study. The median age was 39 years (31–45) and 23.7% of the participants were men. The prevalence of elevated serum transaminase for AST and ALT were, 13.8% and 26.1%, respectively. The prevalence of IR was 34.1%. In the crude analysis we found statistical significance between elevated AST and ALT with IR (PR = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.33–4.34 and PR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.88–3.30; respectively). However, in the multivariate analysis, the association only remained statistically significance with ALT, but lost its significance with AST, PR = 1.90; CI 95%: 1.31–2.77 and a PR = 1.23; CI 95%: 0.93–1.61; respectively.

Conclusion

Elevated serum levels of ALT were associated with insulin resistance. ALT could be used in clinical practice as an additional tool to assess IR in apparently healthy people.

### Serum alanine aminotransferase in skeletal muscle diseases [^112eRcGS]. Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Although elevation of the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) following liver injury is well known, confusion exists concerning skeletal muscle injury as the cause of this rise. We reviewed the records of 16 patients who had muscle necrosis without evidence of liver disease. The patients were divided into three groups: extreme exercise, polymyositis, and seizures. All patients exhibited markedly elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels consistent with muscle injury. In acute cases, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT were both elevated, and the AST/ALT ratio was greater than 3, but this ratio approached 1 after a few days because of a faster decline in AST. In conclusion, this difference in half-life accounts for the comparable AST and ALT levels in our cases with chronic muscle injury.

### Association between aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio and cardiovascular disease mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis: a multi-center retrospective study [^113J9HtS]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) among the general population. However, an association between AST/ALT ratio and CVD mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) has received little attention.

Methods

A total of 2224 incident PD patients from multi-centers were enrolled from November 1, 2005, to June 30, 2017, in this retrospective cohort study. The primary endpoint was CVD mortality. Eligible patients were divided into high and normal groups according to the AST/ALT ratio cut-off for CVD mortality with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The associations between the AST/ALT ratio and CVD mortality were evaluated by the Cox regression model.

Results

Of eligible 1579 patients with a mean age of 49.3 ± 14.6 years, 55.4% of patients were male, 18.1% of patients had diabetes, and 64.2% of patients had hypertension. The prevalence of a high AST/ALT ratio was 76.6% in the cohort population. During a follow-up period with 4659.6 patient-years, 316 patients died, of which 193 (61.1%) deaths were caused by CVD episodes. The incidence of CVD mortality in the high group was significantly higher than that in the normal group (13.1% versus 9.2%, P = 0.024). Cumulative CVD mortality rates were significantly different between the two groups by Kaplan-Meier analysis [hazards ratio (HR) = 1.50, 95% confidence index (CI) 1.09–2.07, P = 0.014]. After adjusting for confounding factors, a higher AST/ALT ratio was independently associated with an increased risk of CVD mortality compared with their counterparts (HR = 1.43, 95%CI 1.08–2.41, P = 0.002).

Conclusions

PD patients with high baseline AST/ALT ratio levels may be at a significant risk of CVD mortality.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^111Zqb9T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^116AtZym]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical implications

Our analysis suggests that the AST/ALT ratio should not be included in current CVD risk prediction tools for the general primary care population. However, in the era of stratified medicine, those with raised AST/ALT ratio may represent a higher risk subgroup that could benefit from closer monitoring, particularly when ALT is raised. Latest UK guidelinesin primary care recommend clinicians to exclude type I diabetic patients in the use of CVD risk assessment tools as the calculated CVD risk may not be reliable, particularly in younger patients. As diabetes is a spectrum of disease which has been simplified as a binary variable in all standard CVD risk tools, a continuous variable such as the AST/ALT ratio may confer additional advantages for further stratification of these higher risk subgroups. Other potential risk factors for liver disease in subgroup populations with high obesity and alcohol usage should also warrant further analysis in which the AST/ALT ratio may confer larger benefits. Emerging evidence (including the findings in this study) showing the utility the AST/ALT ratio in stratifying liver disease and CVD risk in certain subgroups may inform future guideline development as stronger research evidence emerges. Given that the cost of either analyte is relatively cheap, the AST/ALT ratio's utility in predicting future CVD risk in groups such as those with elevated ALT, type II diabetes, and features of metabolic syndrome, alcohol usage or a combination of these factors may be extremely cost-effective. More broadly, the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyand the recent Joint British Societiesrecommend now recommend revisiting the value of novel markers in risk prediction tools as more evidence becomes available.

In the context of identifying patients who should not be prescribed statin, the latest NICE lipid modification guidelinesstate that either AST or ALT should be assessed prior to starting statins. The implications of this are that mildly elevated levels will be wrongly seen as a contraindication to the initiation of statins. This study, however, reinforces the concept that liver transaminases, and specifically an elevated AST/ALT ratio, should be seen as identifying those with a greater need for a statin because of increasing CVD risk rather than a contraindication because of the relatively rare occurrence of a statin-induced liver injury.

### Subphenotypes and the De ritis ratio for mortality risk stratification in sepsis-associated acute liver injury: a retrospective cohort study [^111YD3zf]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although both the R-factor and serum transaminase levels provided valuable insights into the risk associated with SALI outcomes, they did not match the prognostic performance of the De Ritis ratio. Our analysis demonstrated that only the higher categories of the De Ritis ratio, R factor, or ALT were significant discriminators for 30-day mortality in both the derivation and validation cohorts. This suggests a more pronounced hepatic dysfunction, as indicated by elevated bilirubin concentrations and INR values. Another possible explanation is that patients with higher De Ritis ratio (R) categories, elevated R factor, or increased ALT may be particularly susceptible to extrahepatic complications, which could escalate into a harmful multi-organ crosstalk associated with SALI.

What distinguishes the De Ritis ratio from other stratification methods is inclusion of AST, an enzyme that reflects not only hepatocellular injury but also damage in muscle and cardiac tissue. This broader scope has allowed the De Ritis ratio to demonstrate strong prognostic performance in sepsis and COVID-19, independent of SALI. For instance, studies have demonstrated that an elevated De Ritis ratio is linked to poor outcomes in conditions like COVID-19 and trauma, underscoring its broader applicability as a prognostic marker beyond liver-specific conditions. The ratio effectively captures the balance between liver-specific injury and systemic sources of AST, correlating strongly with the severity of systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction that are typical in sepsis. Therefore, the predictive power of the De Ritis ratio is likely rooted in its emphasis on AST, which is also localized within the mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a recognized hallmark of sepsis, is intimately associated with impaired energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and organ failure, all of which significantly contribute to increased mortality in septic patients. In summary, incorporating AST alongside ALT as the well-known De Ritis ratio positions it as a particularly suitable marker for effectively stratifying risk in patients with SALI. This approach allows for a comprehensive assessment that captures not only hepatocellular damage but also systemic and mitochondrial dysfunctions, which are crucial to the pathophysiology of sepsis and closely linked to increased mortality. Additionally, our data indicate that the magnitude of ALT/AST elevation may not be the most critical factor in risk assessment. Notably, a De Ritis ratio of 2 or higher was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, which appeared to be driven more by low ALT levels rather than elevated AST (see Table 2). In fact, our findings suggest that transaminase levels alone are not reliable for stratification, despite their current prominence in clinical practice for assessing disease severity. In contrast, the De Ritis ratio appears to offer a more precise and clinically relevant approach being able to reconcile current clinical practice. Furthermore, the De Ritis ratio's simplicity and accessibility make it a proper candidate for straightforward clinical use, particularly in critical care settings where rapid, informed decision-making is essential.

### The incremental value of aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio combined with CURB-65 in predicting treatment outcomes in hospitalized adult community-acquired pneumonia patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114K9o9Q]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated ALT/AST ratio, measured as the ratio of alanine aminotransferase to aspartate aminotransferase, which is the reciprocal of AST/ALT in our study, was found to be strongly correlated with an increased incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in non-obese Chinese individuals. NAFLD is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance, similar to diabetes. A large-scale retrospective analysis demonstrated that diabetes development was more likely to occur in individuals with a lower AST/ALT ratio (≤ 1.18). This ratio closely resembled the mean AST/ALT level seen in CAP patients with T2DM in our study, which was measured at 1.22. This finding leads us to hypothesize that the lower AST/ALT ratio observed in the diabetes group in the present study may be attributed to the such relationship between this ratio and T2DM. This correlation may be partly explained by the negative association between AST/ALT ratio and the average blood glucose levels, as found in our study (r for AST/ALT and HbA1c: −0.176, p = 0.042), and the negative association between the ratio and insulin resistance index discovered by other research. NAFLD has been associated with elevated levels of ADA, ALP, CHE, and GGT, indicating relatively reduced liver function. This may explain the higher levels of these biomarkers in CAP-T2DM patients compared to CAP patients in our study. It is worth noting that the NAFLD population is not only at a higher risk of infection but also experiences a more complicated and prolonged course of infection and a poor outcome due to impaired liver immunologic function. Given that NAFLD is an emerging field of research, only a few studies identified the relationship between NAFLD and the prognosis of CAP patients. The intersection of NAFLD, T2DM, and CAP remains largely unexplored in scientific research. Further research in this area could provide valuable insight into the prognostic potential of the AST/ALT ratio in CAP patients with T2DM.

### Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are associated with normal-range aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and their ratio in Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112c8KrA]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

We identified significant correlations between liver and renal biomarkers in PCOS patients: AST with Cys‐C, Cr, and urea; ALT with Cys‐C and urea; and AST/ALT ratio with Cys‐C and Cr. Of these, ALT demonstrated the strongest association with Cys‐C (β = 0.427), suggesting its potential as the most sensitive indicator for early renal dysfunction among liver biomarkers. This PCOS‐specific finding contrasts with reports in nonviral hepatitis populations where no ALT‐renal marker correlations were observed. The ALT‐Cys‐C association likely reflects the unique metabolic pathophysiology of PCOS, where IR, hyperandrogenism, and obesity create shared hepatic‐renal stress pathways that may predispose to chronic kidney disease (CKD). This interpretation is supported by two key observations: First, Cys‐C is established as a superior glomerular filtration rate (GFR) marker versus Cr due to its independence from muscle mass, age, and sex. Second, the parallel ALT‐urea correlation suggests concurrent renal metabolic burden, particularly in hyperuricemia/MS contexts. These findings propose a clinical paradigm where ALT, when interpreted alongside Cys‐C/Cr levels, may offer enhanced renal risk stratification in PCOS patients.

This study′s strengths include a large, well‐characterized Chinese PCOS cohort and the first analysis of normal‐range transaminases in this population, revealing subclinical metabolic patterns. Limitations include the cross‐sectional design (precluding causal inference), potential residual confounding from undiagnosed liver conditions despite excluding ALT/AST > 40 U/L, lack of imaging confirmation, and unrecorded medication use (e.g. statins). Future studies should incorporate imaging and systematic medication documentation to address these gaps. Finally, results are based on a Chinese population and may not be generalizable to other ethnicities.

### Aminotransferase levels in clinical practice-what is normal? [^112nyEMD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

No universal consensus exists as to what the upper limit of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be. The purpose of this review is to provide insight on the wide variation in the upper limit of normal for ALT, and to highlight key elements resulting in these differences. We also wish to point to potential solutions for standardizing the upper limit of normal.

Recent Findings

There are considerable differences in the values for what constitutes a 'normal' ALT serum concentration set by laboratories, and reference values may vary two-fold between different institutions (from 30 to 60U/l). Key reasons for this include using markedly different reference populations to establish the bounds of normal, and differences in analyzers and assays used to quantify ALT levels. A number of studies have attempted to re-evaluate the upper limit of normal and propose new cut-offs that would allow better detection of liver disease.

Summary

The upper limit of normal for ALT continues to vary from one laboratory to another. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still an unmet demand to standardize ALT reference ranges, which is critical for clinical practice. More rigorous inclusion criteria for reference population studies and harmonization in analyzer differences is required to standardize ALT reference ranges universally.

### The 1-year and 3-month prognostic utility of the AST / ALT ratio and model for end-stage liver disease score in patients with viral liver cirrhosis [^1178nVN8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The AST/ALT ratio has shown good diagnostic accuracy in patients with chronic viral liver disease. However, its prognostic utility has never been tested. Recently, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been proposed as a simple and effective tool to predict survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to assess the 3-month and 1-yr prognostic ability of the AST/ALT ratio in a series of patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis, and to evaluate the relationship between the AST/ALT ratio and the MELD score and to compare their prognostic ability.

Methods

The AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores of 99 patients with liver cirrhosis of viral etiology (73 patients with hepatitis C virus and 26 with hepatitis B virus) who had been followed-up for at least 1 yr were retrospectively calculated and correlated with the patients' 3-month and 1-yr prognosis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the AST/ALT ratio and the MELD score cut-offs with the best sensitivity (SS) and specificity (SP) in discriminating between patients who survived and those who died. Univariate survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method using the cut-offs identified by means of receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores showed a significant correlation (r(s) = 0.503, p = 0.0001). In all, 8% and 30% of the patients had died after 3 months and 1 yr of follow-up, respectively. AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores were significantly higher among the patients who died during both 3-month and 1-yr follow-up. An AST/ALT ratio cut-off of 1.17 had 87% SS and 52% SP, whereas a MELD cut-off of 9 had 57% SS and 74% SP in discriminating between patients who survived and those who died after I yr. The combined assessment of the AST/ALT ratio and/or MELD score had 90% SS and 78% SP. Survival curves of the patients showed that both parameters clearly discriminated between patients who survived and those who died in the short term (AST/ALT ratio, p = 0.0094; MELD score, p = 0.0089) as well as in the long term (AST/ALT ratio, p < 0.0005; MELD score, p = 0.004).

Conclusions

In patients with virus-related cirrhosis, the AST/ALT ratio has prognostic capability that is not significantly different from that of an established prognostic score such as MELD. Combined assessment of the two parameters increases the medium-term prognostic accuracy.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^116mi66H]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

### Non-invasive markers for hepatic fibrosis [^111kgQ68]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations of Direct serum biomarkers of fibrosis

- They reflect the rate of matrix turnover (not only deposition) and have a tendency to be more elevated when associated with high inflammatory activity. As a consequence, extensive matrix deposition might not be detected in the presence of minimal inflammation;

- They are not liver-specific and their serum levels may be elevated in the presence of concomitant sites of inflammation;

- Serum levels of markers depend on their clearance rates, which are influenced by the dysfunction of endothelial cells, impaired biliary excretion or renal function.

Indirect Biomarkers of Fibrosis

Most Indirect biomarkers of fibrosis are integrated with one or more fibrosis predicting biomarker panels.

AST/ALT ratio

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are hepatic enzymes that are released into the bloodstream from damaged hepatocytes. The predictive value of the AST/ALT ratio has been validated in non-alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. In many forms of acute and chronic liver injury or steatosis (fatty infiltration of the liver), this ratio is less than or equal to 1, while in alcoholic hepatitis, an AST/ALT ratio is often greater than 2. While these ratios are suggestive of certain etiology of liver conditions, there is too much overlap between groups to rely on AST/ALT exclusively when making a diagnosis - for example, in patients with both hepatitis C and history of alcohol abuse.

The PGA index combines the measurement of the Prothrombin Index, γ glutamyl transferase levels and apolipoprotein A1. It was subsequently modified to the PGAA index by the addition of α2- macroglobulin, which resulted in marginal if any improvement in its performance. In chronic liver diseases, the PGA index has a relationship to both the inflammation and the fibrosis (P < 0.01, P < 0.05 respectively). However, overall accuracy of this index is relatively low.

### Nonlinear association between AST / ALT ratio and 28-day all-cause mortality following ICU admission in critically ill cirrhotic patients: a retrospective cohort study [^111ga5XS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The AST/ALT ratio is a biochemical marker associated with poor clinical outcomes in various patients, but its role in severe cirrhosis is unclear. This study investigated the relationship between the AST/ALT ratio and mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study analyzed 2,090 liver cirrhosis patients from the MIMIC-IV database, focusing on their first ICU admission between 2008 and 2019. The AST/ALT ratio, measured within 24 h of admission, was the exposure variable, and the main outcome was 28-day mortality. A multivariable logistic regression model evaluated the link between the AST/ALT ratio and mortality. Nonlinear relationships were explored using smooth curve fitting and saturation effect analyses. Stratified analyses and interaction tests were also performed based on demographic and clinical characteristics.

Results

The study involved 2,090 critically ill liver cirrhosis patients, averaging 59.1 years old, with 65% male and a 28-day post-ICU admission mortality rate of 29%. The AST/ALT ratio was linked to mortality risk (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–1.2; p = 0.015), showing a nonlinear pattern with a critical point at 3.6. Below this, each unit increase raised mortality risk by 40% (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.6, p < 0.001), but the effect plateaued beyond this level (adjusted OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.8–1.1, p = 0.600). Subgroup analyses confirmed the consistent association, with interaction P values over 0.05.

Conclusions

The AST/ALT ratio is an independent predictor of 28-day mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients, with a nonlinear relationship (risk increases up to a ratio of~3.6, then plateaus). This marker could enhance ICU risk stratification and inform clinical decision-making.

### Elevated serum levels of aminotransferases in relation to unhealthy foods intake: tehran lipid and glucose study [^115xjkVs]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Abnormal levels of liver enzymes, particularly aminotransferases, are prognostic features of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Considering the important role of dietary intakes in development of NAFLD, we aimed to determine possible association of unhealthy foods (fast foods, soft drinks, sweet and salty snacks) consumption with elevated levels of aminotransferases.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was conducted within the framework of sixth phase of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (2014–2017), on 187 adult men and 249 adult women (19–70 y). Usual intakes of unhealthy foods (kcal/week) were measured using a validated semi-quantitative 147-items food frequency questionnaire. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of elevated aminotransferases in each tertile of energy-dense unhealthy foods.

Results

Mean age of participants was 44.44 ± 15.09 years, 43% of participants were men. Higher consumption of fast foods (> 11.39% kcal/week) was associated with elevated ALT to AST ratio (OR: 3.27; 95% CI: 1.90–5.63) and elevated ALT (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.57–4.76). Also, each 1 SD increased energy intakes from fast foods was related to increased chance of having elevated ALT and ALT to AST ratio by 35% (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.08–1.68, OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.10–1.66, respectively). There was no significant association between consumption of soft drinks, sweet or salty snacks and elevated aminotransferases.

Conclusions

Higher intakes of energy from fast foods seems to be associated with an elevated serum levels of ALT and ALT to AST ratio, as indicators of development of NAFLD.

### Association between aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio and cardiovascular disease mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis: a multi-center retrospective study [^116B913y]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we found that higher baseline AST/ALT ratio may carry an increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in PD patients. Also, even though we excluded those patients with chronic liver disease, or a history of CVD, PD patients at the commencement of PD may have a higher prevalence of high AST/ALT ratio. PD patents have high risk of CVD episodes and liver disease, suggesting patients may have unknown underlying cardiovascular disease or liver disease. We should cautiously explain the association between AST/ALT ratio and CVD mortality.

Aminotransferase, including AST and ALT, is a well-known marker for liver injury. AST is in both the liver and myocardial tissue, but ALT is only in the liver. The elevation of the AST/ALT ratio is due to induction by alcohol consumption and cardio-hepatic interaction. As compared to participants with a lower AST/ALT ratio, those with a high AST/ALT ratio had a higher pre-existing CVD prevalence, indicating a higher AST/ALT ratio may implicit heart damage and overload, as well as underlying CVD episodes. The Japanese study of 3494 participants more than 40 years found that the high AST/ALT ratio had an independent association with all-cause and CVD mortality, with a 10-year follow-up. In this study, participants with end-stage renal disease, incomplete data, or study withdrawal were excluded, but those with alcohol habits or pre-existing CVD were not excluded, suggesting less convincing of their findings due to selective bias. The Italy 6-year follow-up study with 2529 diabetes showed that the AST/ALT ratio had an independent association with all-cause and CVD mortality. Patients with a known history of drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis of any etiology, and hemochromatosis were also excluded, but those with a history of CVD failed to be excluded in this study. More recently, a 10-year follow-up prospective study of 29,316 participants aged between 25 and 84 years from the United Kingdom showed that an increased AST/ALT ratio were at significant risk of developing CVD episodes in male participants but not those female, with no baseline pre-existing CVD. Nonetheless, when added to the traditional CVD prediction tools such as Framingham Risk Scores, the AST/ALT ratio did not contribute to any extra benefits in predicting the CVD accuracy. The major limitation was that patients with chronic liver disease were not excluded from this study. In the present study, to reduce selection bias, we excluded those current drinking, liver disease, and those with a history of CVD. We found that a higher AST/ALT ratio was independently associated with an increased risk for CVD and all-cause mortality. PD patients with a high AST/ALT ratio may have a 1.43-fold higher risk of CVD mortality and a 1.45-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with their counterparts, even after adjustment for confounding factors. Subgroup analyses showed that a high AST/ALT ratio remained an independent predictor for CVD mortality in those male and non-hyperlipidemias, and all-cause mortality in those non-diabetes, hypertension, and non-hyperlipidemias. These findings suggested, along with previous studies, that PD patients with a higher AST/ALT ratio may have more CVD and all-cause involvement, and a preprocedural AST/ALT ratio, a widely available and inexpensive biomarker, might be helpful for risk stratification of CVD and all-cause mortality in PD patients.

### Nonlinear association between AST / ALT ratio and 28-day all-cause mortality following ICU admission in critically ill cirrhotic patients: a retrospective cohort study [^115rVRpB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Association between AST/ALT ratio and 28-day mortality following ICU admission

This study investigated the relationship between the AST/ALT ratio and clinical outcomes. The unadjusted continuous variable analysis indicated a 20% higher risk of the outcome event per unit increase in the AST/ALT ratio (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.3). Following the implementation of basic factor adjustment, this association exhibited marginal strengthening (OR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.2–1.4). However, subsequent to further confounder adjustment, the association underwent attenuation yet retained its significance (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: 1.0–1.3). Tertile analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship. The findings of the study indicated that the middle and highest tertiles exhibited significantly elevated ORs (T2: OR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2–2.1; T3: OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.5–2.7) in comparison to the lowest tertile. The trend test was statistically significant across all models (p for trend < 0.001), supporting the hypothesis that there was an increasing risk with increasing AST/ALT ratios (see Table 2 for details). This association persisted after multiple adjustments, suggesting the AST/ALT ratio's potential as a prognostic indicator.

AASLD practice guidance — diagnostic entry criteria and initial steps for suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) include biochemical evidence of liver injury meeting one of these criteria: 1) AST or ALT > 5x ULN, or ALP > 2x ULN (or pretreatment baseline if abnormal) on 2 separate occasions, 2) Total serum bilirubin > 2.5mg/dL with elevated AST, ALT or ALP level, or 3) INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT or ALP. DILI suspected based on clinical history, symptoms, and/or physical exam: 1) Assess exposure to all prescription and over the counter medications, HDS products, and toxins, including start and stop dates, especially within the preceding 6 months; 2) Discontinue any non-essential medications and supplements. Determine R ratio R = ALT/ULN ALP/ULN and classify as R ≥ 5: Hepatocellular, R value 2–5: Mixed, or R ≤ 2: Cholestatic.

### Association between aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio and insulin resistance among US adults [^112Xsnvz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a low aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AST/ALT ratio) is associated with insulin resistance among those without liver dysfunction.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2016, we included 2747 (1434 male and 1313 nonpregnant female) adults ≥ 20years without evidence of liver dysfunction (ALT < 30 in male and < 19 in female, negative viral serologies, no excess alcohol consumption, no elevated transferrin saturation, AST/ALT < 2). Serum AST/ALT ratio was categorized into sex-specific quartiles (female: < 1.12, 1.12–1.29, 1.29–1.47, ≥ 1.47 and male: < 0.93, 0.93–1.09, 1.09–1.26, ≥ 1.26). The primary outcome was insulin resistance, as determined by Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index score ≥ 3. Covariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated. Study analysis completed from 13 March 2020 to 21 April 2021.

Results

Among the 2747 individuals, 33% had insulin resistance. Those in the lowest quartile (Q1) of AST/ALT had 75% higher adjusted odds of insulin resistance compared to the highest quartile (Q4) [aOR (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.75 (1.20–2.57)]. This association was more pronounced in those with elevated BMI [Q1 vs. Q4; BMI ≥ 25: 2.29 (1.58–3.33), BMI < 25: 0.66 (0.26–1.69); NAFLD per Fatty Liver Index ≥ 60: 2.04 (1.21–3.44), No NAFLD: 1.68 (0.94–3.01)].

Conclusion

Lower AST/ALT ratio is associated with increased insulin resistance among those with healthy-range ALT, especially in those with BMI greater than or equal to 25kg/m2.

### Prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 infection and association with clinical outcomes [^112NepRM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum aminotransferase levels are 2 of the most useful markers of hepatic cellular injury. AST is also found in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and brain tissue, in addition to the liver. Serum ALT and the serum AST/ALT ratio are often measured clinically as biomarkers of liver health. Elevation in the AST/ALT ratio can be seen in patients with alcoholic liver disease. In addition, patients with Wilson's disease or cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis may have AST greater than ALT, though the ratio may not be greater than 2. In our study, we noticed that AST elevation prevailed overall on admission compared to ALT, so we attempted to establish the utility of the AST/ALT ratio in COVID-19 patients. Among our patients, 34% had an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2. An AST/ALT ratio of 2 or more was associated with the need for intubation (OR 2.678, 95%CI 1.202–5.963; P = 0.016) and need for vasopressors (OR 3.352, 95%CI 1.495–7.514; P = 0.003). In fact, in our study an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2 was more strongly associated with disease severity compared to AST or ALT alone. Given that the source of AST is not limited to the liver alone, elevation of AST out of proportion to ALT may suggest multiorgan involvement in COVID-19 patients. This could explain the association between an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2 and poor outcomes, as mentioned above. This needs further validation, as it has not been studied previously, but this was a notable finding in our study. The impact of COVID-19 in those with preexisting chronic liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and alcohol related liver disease, is yet to be evaluated further. One study from China reported that patients with underlying chronic hepatitis B infection did not have any higher risk of liver injury or severe disease compared to the overall population, whereas other studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 may aggravate liver injury in patients with viral hepatitis. Similarly, Moon et al also reported a higher case fatality rate among non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease patients compared to the general population. These data need to be validated further. Mean ALP level largely remained normal and there was mild to moderate bilirubin elevation, with a predominance of direct bilirubinemia. However, a statistically significant association could not be established with severe outcomes, such as ICU admission, vasopressor use or death.

### Subphenotypes and the De ritis ratio for mortality risk stratification in sepsis-associated acute liver injury: a retrospective cohort study [^111MMhFA]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis often leads to multi-organ failure, with the liver being among the severely affected organs, a condition known as sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI).SALI manifests in various clinical forms — such as jaundice, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzymes –, all of which indicate functional deterioration and significant hepatocellular injury. The diverse aetiologies of SALI, including bacterial or viral infections, hypoxia, and drug-induced liver injury, along with its different forms of injury (cholestatic versus hepatocellular) variably impact prognosis in SALI patients, thereby complicating clinical management of sepsis.

Despite the critical impact of liver dysfunction in sepsis, there is currently no standardized method for stratifying SALI patients based on their mortality risk using routine laboratory parameters. Paradoxically, while laboratory markers such as serum transaminases, bilirubin levels, and the international normalized ratio (INR) provide valuable insights into the different forms liver damage, their prognostic utility in SALI remains widely underexplored. Furthermore, biomarker ratios, including the De Ritis ratio, which compares aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and the R-factor, which assesses liver injury patterns by evaluating the ratio of ALT to alkaline phosphatase (ALP), along with the degree of ALT elevation in serum, are essential for assessing risk and classifying acute liver injury (ALI). However, their value in identifying subphenotypes in SALI patients remains controversial. Moreover, these assessments have not been validated for risk stratification in SALI nor adequately compared in the context of sepsis.

This study aims to define clinical subphenotypes of SALI by applying laboratory-based risk stratification methods and assess their association with 30-day mortality. Here, we focus on adapting and evaluating established prognostic methods from non-septic acute liver failure, including the De Ritis ratio, R-factor, and elevated ALT levels. By applying these approaches to SALI, we aim to assess their prognostic value and enhance early identification of SALI subphenotypes at high risk for poor outcome.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117RYf6K]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

AST and ALT ratio interpretation — The ratio of AST to ALT may be useful in determining the etiology of abnormal liver tests; for most liver conditions including chronic viral hepatitis and NAFLD, ALT levels are > AST levels; however, ~90% of patients with alcoholic liver disease have AST > ALT, and > 70% have an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2; AST > ALT can also be seen in cirrhosis, although the AST:ALT ratio is typically not ≥ 2:1; in hepatitis C virus patients, non-cirrhotics had an AST/ALT ratio of 0.60, while the mean ratio in cirrhotics was 1.05; liver biopsy is most commonly done to assess the grade and stage of disease severity and may be useful to confirm suspected diagnoses including Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

### Association between elevated liver enzymes and metabolic syndrome among Thai adults [^113wPZ94]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2008). Low credibility.

Background

To examine the relation between elevated liver marker concentrations (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS).

Methods

This cross-sectional study was comprised of 1,391 Thai participants (451 men and 940 women) receiving annual health check-ups. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of MetS risk according to quartiles of each liver marker concentration with the lowest quartile specified as the referent group.

Results

Overall, mean concentrations of AST, ALT and ALP increased and mean AST:ALT ratio decreased with increasing presence of metabolic abnormalities (p-value = 0.059 for AST in men, all other p-values < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, men with ALT concentrations in the extreme quartiles (> 40 units/L), had a 2.77-fold increased risk of MetS (95%CI: 1.18–6.53), as compared with men who had values in the lowest quartile (≤ 21 units/L). The OR for extreme quartiles of ALP concentrations was 3.72 (95%CI: 1.49–9.29). In women, elevated ALT concentrations were also associated with MetS risk. Those with the highest ALT concentrations (> 23 units/L) had a 2.55-fold increased risk of MetS (95%CI: 1.22–5.35) compared to women with concentrations ≤ 13 units/L.

Conclusions

These findings add to an emerging body of literature that suggests elevated liver enzymes may be related with MetS risk. However, prospective studies are needed to more fully determine the practical value of elevated liver enzymes as a clinical risk predictor of MetS and related disorders among Thai adults.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113s1NHW]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Medical management of severe alcoholic hepatitis: expert Review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^113AEufE]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis diagnostic definition and classification — A consensus working definition includes onset of jaundice within 60 days of heavy alcohol consumption (> 50 g/day) of alcohol for a minimum of 6 months, serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (50–400 U/L), AST:ALT ratio > 1.5, and no other obvious cause for hepatitis; the consensus proposed classifying patients as definite when a liver biopsy was used to establish the diagnosis, probable when clinical and laboratory features were present without potential confounding problems, and possible when confounding problems were present, and prior studies indicated that 10%–15% of subjects diagnosed with acute AH on clinical criteria alone did not have characteristic histologic features on a liver biopsy specimen.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2022 [^111ipmZU]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) diagnosis — blood tests and enzyme patterns are described as follows: Hepatosteatosis typically results in elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) with normal bilirubin. Increase in ALT is sometimes described as more specific for NAFLD, and an AST:ALT ratio of > 1.5 may be more consistent with alcoholic liver disease; AST > ALT is associated with more advanced hepatic fibrosis. The AST-to-platelet ratio is also sometimes used to evaluate NAFLD. Notably, some reports suggest that 25% of NAFLD patients and 19% of NASH patients have normal AST blood levels.

### The liver in COVID-19: prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities [^116mgxHL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with ≈35 million cases, and more than 1 million deaths globally. Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest.

Objective

To define prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Methods

Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 April 2020. Association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical and biochemical predictors, was examined.

Results

Data were available on 551 patients. Prevalence of any or ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal transaminase elevation on was 61.2 and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1 and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4 and 12.6%, respectively), and at peak (17.7 and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impact on mortality with AST positively, and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs.

Conclusion

LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are very common, though majority are mild. Admission and peak bilirubin ≥ 1 mg/dl, as well as admission and peak AST:ALT ratio were significant predictors of mortality, along with age, myocardial injury, and chronic medical illness.

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^117DPPKG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AAR) is one of the most frequent indicators to discriminate fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, the results remained controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive effect of AAR on hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis development.

Method

A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on 1754 chronic HBV-infected patients. Clinical variables at their initial visit and follow-up data were collected. Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to evaluate the predictive value of AAR on cirrhosis risk, and its discrimination accuracy was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The time-dependent effect was assessed by a Fine and Gray competing risk model.

Results

Compared to patients with lower AAR, those with elevated AAR level had higher risk of cirrhosis development by adjusting for host characteristics (dichotomized analyses: hazard ratio = 2.77, P = 8.25 × 10–4; tertile analyses: hazard ratio = 2.95, P = 1.61 × 10–3), with an increasing risk trend (P trend = 4.56 × 10–4). The effect remained prominent when ALT or AST was abnormal, while no significant risk was observed when AST and ALT were simultaneously normal. Time-dependent effect analysis demonstrated a persistently higher risk, with the average hazard ratio equivalent to 1.92. AAR level could improve the discrimination efficacy of host variables with area under the curve increased from 0.684 to 0.711 (P = 0.039).

Conclusion

Higher AAR was significantly associated with increased risk of HBV-related cirrhosis, and might be a potential predictor of cirrhosis development.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114L8XjJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ALT and AST levels and mortality associations — population data: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 18 (AST > 18) was linked to a 3X increase in all cause mortality. Compared with men with AST or ALT ≥ 20 IU/l, those in the 30–39 IU/l group had an 8X (AST) or 9.5X (ALT) relative risk for liver-related death. In a cohort with standardized mortality ratios, values were 0.95 for normal ALT (defined as ULN 45 IU/l for men, 29 IU/l for females), 1.32 for 1–2× ULN, and 1.78 for > 2× ULN. Another study reported ALT 30–39 associated with relative risks of liver mortality 2.9 (2.4–3.5) and 9.5 (7.9–11.5) in men, and 3.8 (1.9–7.7) and 6.6 (1.5–25.6) in women. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) definitions of elevated ALT (30 IU/l for men and 19 IU/l for women) was associated with liver-related mortality (11.2×) and diabetes-related mortality (3.3×), and another analysis found ALT > 43 IU/l for men and > 30 IU/l for women related to coronary heart disease.

### Association between aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio and cardiovascular disease mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis: a multi-center retrospective study [^112NrTov]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the leading cause of death in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, accounting for up to 40–60% of deaths. Traditional risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a history of CVD, account for up to 50% of CVD in dialysis patients. At the same time, renal specific markers, including anemia, disordered bone mineral metabolism, and oxidative stress, also likely contribute to the total CVD burden in these patients. Therefore, exploring new non-traditional risk factors for CVD episodes may be beneficial to further improve the prognosis of PD patients.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is only found in the liver, but aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the liver and heart tissue. Compared to ALT, AST significantly increased in patients with CVD events, presenting an elevated AST/ALT ratio of those patients. As compared to patients with a normal AST/ALT ratio, those with a high AST/ALT ratio had a higher pre-existing CVD rate, suggesting that the increased AST / ALT ratio may implicit heart load and injury and potential CVD episodes. Among the general population participating in a community-based health screening with a 10-year follow-up, the increased AST/ALT ratio had an independent association with CVD mortality, considering to be a new non-traditional risk for CVD episodes. Another study from the United Kingdom showed that elevated AST/ALT ratio is significantly associated with an increased risk of developing CVD in men with no history of CVD at baseline. It was noteworthy that patients on dialysis had reduced serum levels of aminotransferases, whereas whether the AST/ALT ratio was an independent predictor of CVD mortality in dialysis patients remains unknown. In the present study, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the AST/ALT ratio and CVD mortality in PD patients.

### Prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 infection and association with clinical outcomes [^113ttgJN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is now a critical threat to global public health. Although the majority of patients present with respiratory illness, several studies have described multiorgan involvement. This study evaluated the prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in COVID-19 patients on admission and their association with clinical outcomes.

Methods

This was a single-center retrospective analysis of all inpatients with COVID-19. Demographic and clinical factors, and liver enzyme tests, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were noted on admission. The association of liver enzyme elevation with outcomes such as inpatient death, need for intubation, and vasopressor use was determined using the chi-square test and multivariate regression analysis.

Results

Among 200 patients, AST and ALT elevation was seen in 55% and 20%, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase elevation was seen in 28%. AST elevation was associated with inpatient death (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.05; P = 0.035), need for vasopressors (OR 1.034, 95%CI 1.015–1.055; P = 0.001), and intubation (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.05; P = 0.002). An AST/ALT ratio of 2 or more was seen in 34% of patients and was associated with need for intubation (OR 2.678, 95%CI 1.202–5.963; P = 0.016), and need for vasopressors (OR 3.352, 95%CI 1.495–7.514; P = 0.003).

Conclusion

Serum aminotransferase levels are useful markers of hepatocellular injury. Patients with elevated AST or AST/ALT ratio are at higher risk of severe disease, as evidenced by intubation, vasopressor use, and inpatient death. These patients should be monitored closely given their propensity for severe disease.

### The development and implementation of a commissioned pathway for the identification and stratification of liver disease in the community [^112aKLR3]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the development of the Nottingham liver disease stratification pathway, present a 12-month evaluation of uptake, stratification results and compare the pathway to current British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines.

Design

A referral pathway between primary and secondary care for the detection and risk stratification of liver disease.

Setting

Four Nottinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Groups (700,000 population).

Patients

Patients are referred to the pathway with i) raised AST/ALT ratio ii) harmful alcohol use or iii) risk or presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Interventions

Clinic attendance within secondary care for transient elastography (TE) and brief lifestyle intervention. The TE result is reported back to the GP with advice on interpretation and referral guidance.

Main Outcome Measures

Pathway uptake, patient characteristics, liver disease stratification results and stakeholder feedback.

Results

Over the first 12 months 968 patients attended a TE clinic appointment, with raised AST/ALT ratio being the most common single reason for referral (36.9%). Of the total, 222 (22.9%) patients had an elevated liver stiffness (≥ 8kPa) and in 60 (27.0%) liver stiffness was indicative of advanced chronic liver disease. If a traditional approach based on raised liver enzymes (BSG guidance) had been followed, 38.7% of those with significant liver disease (≥ 8kPa) would have gone undetected among those referred for either NAFLD or raised AST:ALT.

Conclusions

Targeting patients with risk factors for chronic liver disease and stratifying them using TE can detect significant chronic liver disease above and beyond the approach based on liver enzyme elevation.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113NEGxq]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Acute liver failure due to Wilson disease (WD) — Biochemical ratio approach: Using readily available parameters, a ratio of alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin of < 4 was 94% sensitive and 96% specific, whereas a ratio of AST to ALT > 2.2 was 94% sensitive but only 86% specific; the combination of both ratios (alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin < 4 and AST to ALT > 2.2) was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for diagnosing WD in their cohort, and this approach appears to work less well for identifying ALF due WD in the pediatric age bracket.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113nLMvo]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Transaminase interpretation — limitations and thresholds are noted: Serum AST levels are often used clinically but can be normal in patients with diabetes, NASH, and advanced hepatic fibrosis; although AST levels are neither sensitive nor specific for identifying NAFLD/NASH with advanced fibrosis, intermittently or chronically (≥ 6–12 mo) elevated ALT or AST above a threshold of 30 U/L may suggest the presence of chronic liver injury, with these thresholds exceeding many laboratory upper reference ranges.

Conclusions

Elevated ALT was associated with CKD regardless of GGT elevation. In addition, low AST/ALT ratio was also associated with CKD independent of GGT elevation.

### Nonlinear association between AST / ALT ratio and 28-day all-cause mortality following ICU admission in critically ill cirrhotic patients: a retrospective cohort study [^115WpuiT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the specific mechanisms connecting a higher AST/ALT ratio to increased mortality risk remain unclear, the current findings highlight several significant potential pathways. It is important to acknowledge that AST is present in multiple tissues beyond the liver, including cardiac and skeletal muscle. In critically ill patients, AST elevation might result from non-hepatic causes such as myocardial or skeletal muscle injury. Biomarkers such as creatine kinase (CK) and troponin can help differentiate between hepatic and non-hepatic sources of AST elevation. The absence of these differentiating biomarkers in our analysis is a limitation that should be considered when interpreting the prognostic value of the AST/ALT ratio. Despite this limitation, elevated AST/ALT ratios indicate mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, contributing to multiorgan injury in critically ill patients. Furthermore, AST/ALT levels correlate positively with inflammatory markers including CRP, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α, potentially amplifying inflammatory responses.

The observed nonlinear relationship reflects differential enzyme distribution and release kinetics. AST exists in both cytosolic (20%) and mitochondrial (80%) forms across multiple organs, whereas ALT is predominantly cytosolic and liver-specific. In early liver injury (AST/ALT ratio < 3.6), membrane permeability changes primarily release cytosolic enzymes. As injury progresses, mitochondrial damage releases mitochondrial AST, representing transition to extensive necro-inflammatory damage.

The attenuated mortality correlation beyond the 3.6 threshold likely results from hepatocyte exhaustion, enzyme clearance saturation, and cellular trans-differentiation. At higher ratios, extrahepatic factors including multiorgan failure become primary mortality determinants, with complications such as hepatorenal syndrome and coagulopathy predominating.

Alternative biomarkers demonstrated significant elevations in the highest AST/ALT tertile, including INR (2.0 ± 0.9 vs 1.7 ± 1.0, p < 0.001), total bilirubin (4.2 vs 1.8 mg/dL, p < 0.001), and creatinine (1.3 vs 1.1 mg/dL, p = 0.004). MELD and SOFA scores were also significantly higher in this tertile, confirming that multi-organ assessment becomes increasingly important beyond the established threshold. Importantly, AST elevations may partially reflect extra-hepatic tissue injury rather than solely hepatic dysfunction, potentially confounding observed associations.

### Association of cardiometabolic risk factors and hepatic enzymes in a national sample of Iranian children and adolescents: the CASPIAN-III study [^1153DAhf]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Elevated liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) may be associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease. We investigated the association of cardiometabolic risk factors and liver enzymes in a nationally representative sample of Iranian children and adolescents.

Methods

The national study was conducted in the framework of the third survey of Childhood and Adolescence Surveillance and PreventIon of Adult Non-communicable Disease study. Subjects were 3948 students (1942 girls, 67.55% urban, mean age 14.7 ± 2.4 years) who were recruited by multistage random cluster sampling from 27 provincial counties in Iran. Physical examination and laboratory tests were conducted under standard protocols.

Results

Participants with elevated serum ALT had higher levels of almost all cardiometabolic risk factors than other participants; this difference was not significant for fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, and diastolic blood pressure in both sexes, as well as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in girls. Participants with generalized and abdominal obesity, MetS, elevated blood pressure, triglycerides, and total cholesterol had increased risk for elevated ALT; this risk remained significant after adjusting for sex and age. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was found as a predictor for both elevated ALT (odds ratio 2.182, 95% confidence interval 1.533–3.105) and AST (odds ratio 2.022, 95% confidence interval 1.438–2.844) even after adjusting for all potential confounders. General (B 0.158, SE 0.030) and abdominal obesity (B 0.058, SE 0.029), MetS (B 0.231, SE 0.048), and triglycerides (B 0.094, SE 0.030) were associated with ALT:AST ratio after adjusting for all potential confounders (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

We documented strong relations of elevated ALT, AST levels, and ALT:AST ratio with most cardiometabolic risk factors. This relation was independent of anthropometric indexes. Liver enzymes can be considered as a cardiometabolic risk factor from childhood, and as an additional component of the MetS.

### Age as a confounding factor for the accurate non-invasive diagnosis of advanced NAFLD fibrosis [^114NuJiE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Another key finding of this study was that the AST/ALT ratio, NFS, and FIB-4 scores performed very poorly in patients aged < 35 years. In this age group, the AUROCs for advanced fibrosis for all three non-invasive scores did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that these scores are inaccurate and therefore should not be used to diagnose or exclude advanced fibrosis. The prevalence of advanced fibrosis was relatively low in this group compared with older patients, with 11% of subjects having stage F3 fibrosis and none being cirrhotic. The low prevalence of advanced fibrosis might be one explanation for the poor performance of these tests in this age group.

In the United Kingdom, a recent Lancet Commission has set out a blueprint that aims to reduce premature mortality rates from liver disease and a key aspect of this is early recognition of patients with progressive and advanced liver disease in the community. One of the recommendations of this report is that all liver function test requests in the community should have both ALT and AST measured and the AST/ALT ratio should be displayed on the laboratory report. AST/ALT ratios > 1 are to be flagged to clinicians to recommend further liver assessment. Despite having looked very promising in some previous studies, the AST/ALT ratio performed relatively poorly in the present study with an overall AUROC of 0.70 for a diagnosis of advanced fibrosis. Results of the present study and others suggest that it might be more beneficial to use the FIB-4 score or NFS as an alternative to the AST/ALT ratio as these appear more accurate. Although these are more complex to calculate, the FIB-4 score only requires the addition of the age and platelet count to the AST and ALT and a simple online calculator is available.

### The preoperative AST / ALT (De ritis) ratio represents a poor prognostic factor in a cohort of patients with nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma [^111xQaZK]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Aminotransaminases, which are strongly involved in cellular metabolism and cancer cell turnover, represent easily measureable, potential blood based biomarkers. We evaluated the prognostic value of the preoperatively assessed AST/ALT (De Ritis) ratio on clinically meaningful end points in a large European cohort of patients with nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated clinicopathological data on 698 patients with nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma operated on between 2005 and 2013 at a single tertiary academic center. The potential prognostic value of the AST/ALT ratio was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional regression models. The impact of the ratio on the predictive accuracy of the Leibovich prognosis score was determined by the Harrell c-index.

Results

An increased (1.26 or greater) preoperative AST/ALT ratio was statistically significantly associated with several well established prognostic factors, including pathological T stage, as well as with histological tumor necrosis (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis an increased preoperative AST/ALT ratio was an independent prognostic factor for metastasis-free survival (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.25–2.07, p < 0.001) and overall survival (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.34–2.32, p < 0.001). The Harrell c-index was 0.77 using the Leibovich prognosis score and 0.81 when AST/ALT was added.

Conclusions

In our study cohort with nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma the preoperatively assessed AST/ALT ratio represented an independent prognostic factor. This ratio might further improve the predictive accuracy of well established prognosis scores.

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^116BAFs1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cirrhosis is the final stage of liver fibrosis, which is characterized by extensive degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, diffuse proliferation of fibrous tissue, as well as formation of regenerative nodules. It can be identified as a perpetuated wound-healing process after undergoing any chronic liver injury, in which chronic HBV infection play a dominate role. It is reported that there are nearly 257 million people suffering from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection over the world, and approximately 444 000 people die from cirrhosis in 1 year. Cirrhosis has become a greater burden on the individual and on public health, which was estimated to be responsible for 560.4 age-standardized deaths per 100 000 population globally in 2019. And meanwhile it will give rise to growing financial burden. The presence of cirrhosis is also the main factor associated with the prognosis and management of chronic liver diseases (CLDs), triggering for surveillance programmes for hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal varices inpatients.

Accordingly, it is highly of great importance and cost-effectiveness for early identification on cirrhosis. Liver biopsy which has been considered the standard for cirrhosis has been limited in clinical application owing to its invasion, unclear accuracy and costly procedure. Thus, various non-invasive approaches, based on the detection of individual serum markers, displaying either the deposition or the removal of extracellular matrix in the liver or simple routine blood test were proposed. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AAR) was one of the most extensively explored variables for its risk association with cirrhosis but harvesting no consistent finding.

Herein, we sought to conduct a prospective study to thoroughly evaluate the risk association of AAR level with cirrhosis development in hospitalized patients, in order to determine whether AAR can be used as a reliably predictive index. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first prospective analysis performed to evaluate the predictive role of AAR on cirrhosis in hospitalized CHB patients.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^115jug7K]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the developed world. In the UK, there are an estimated 180 000 deaths per year from CVD. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) lipid modification guidelines recommend the use of risk prediction tools, to identify individuals at increased risk of CVD. In the UK, QRISK2is recommended while internationally, the Framingham toolis adopted. These tools calculate CVD risk using recognised risk factors, such as hypertension, cholesterol levels, age, smoking and family history of premature CVD.

Although most CVD events can be attributed to the aforementioned major risk factors embedded within routinely-used risk prediction tools, a significant proportion of the population will experience an event in the absence of traditional risk factors. For example, up to 50% of all myocardial infarctions (MI) and strokes occur in individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below the recommended thresholds for lipid modification. In the USA, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III now recommends that to effectively reduce the CVD risk of such patients requires consideration of 'emerging risk factors'.

Liver function enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are examples of emerging biomarkers for CVD risk. The AST to ALT has been shown to reflect disease severity in a number of chronic liver diseases, including alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune liver diseaseand hepatitis C. Previous studieshave demonstrated that CVD is the leading cause of death in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with higher rates coinciding with higher liver-related mortality over follow-up periods from 10 to 20 years.

The detection and identification of liver disease in the community is limited. Liver disease is asymptomatic until the final stages of cirrhosis. However, using the enzymes in a simple ratio (AST/ALT) or as a component of panel marker tests has been shown to have diagnostic accuracy for significant liver disease. In addition, these surrogates of liver injury improve the prediction of future clinical events including cardiovascular outcomes in patients with liver disease. However, it is still unknown whether the AST/ALT ratio can improve prediction for cardiovascular outcomes in a general primary care population. These simple liver markers are routinely available in primary care, offering potential utility in primary care-based risk prediction models. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether the inclusion of AST/ALT ratio improves standard 10-year risk prediction models for CVD in a primary care population.

### Towards a standardized classification of the hepatobiliary manifestations in cystic fibrosis (CFHBI): a joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN position paper [^115PhMmP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in pwCF — associations with disease and predictive performance: In children diagnosed via newborn screening, a persistent elevation of AST or GGT > 1.5 x ULN before the age of 5 was linked to a 6-fold increase in risk of clinically significant liver disease, defined as cirrhosis, portal hypertension (PHT), or stage F3/4 fibrosis. In 244 children with CF, higher mean ALT/AST levels were reported in those with liver ultrasound abnormalities, although levels were mostly within the normal range with significant overlap. Elevated ALT, GGT, or ALP on 2 or more occasions before age 6.5 was linked to higher risk of PHT; elevated ALT had a hazard ratio of 2.7 but only a sensitivity of ~20% and PPV of ~20%. Overall, there is insufficient evidence that changes in ALT and/or AST levels over time can reliably predict development of structural hepatic abnormalities in pwCF.

### Nonlinear association between AST / ALT ratio and 28-day all-cause mortality following ICU admission in critically ill cirrhotic patients: a retrospective cohort study [^113ohUTN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

AST/ALT ratio and ICU mortality: a nonlinear saturation effect

The analysis of the saturation effect revealed a non-linear relationship between the AST/ALT ratio and 28-day mortality following ICU admission (Fig. 2). The initial linear model (Model I) revealed a modest yet statistically significant association (OR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.0–1.3, p = 0.002). A piecewise logistic model (Model II) identified a more complex relationship, highlighted a turning point at an AST/ALT ratio of 3.6. The findings revealed a significant correlation for AST/ALT ratio below 3.6 (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.6, p < 0.001), while no significant correlation was found for AST/ALT ratio above 3.6 (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.8–1.1, p = 0.600). The log-likelihood ratio test (p = 0.011) indicated that Model II provided a significantly better fit, indicating a nonlinear connection with a saturation effect when the AST/ALT ratio reaches 3.6 (Table 3). Sensitivity analyses with varying inflection points (2.5, 3.0, 3.6, 4.0, and 4.5) consistently demonstrated a significant association between AST/ALT ratio and 28-day mortality following ICU admission below the threshold, with effect attenuation above the threshold (Supplementary Table S2). Among all tested inflection points, 3.6 yielded the optimal model fit based on log-likelihood ratio tests, confirming the robustness of our primary findings.

Smooth curve fitting for the relationship between AST/ALT ratio and 28-day mortality following ICU admission. The red line represents the estimated probability of mortality, and the green lines indicate the 95% CIs. The analysis identified an inflection point at an AST/ALT ratio of 3.6 (indicated by the vertical dotted line), where the relationship between AST/ALT ratio and mortality risk changes significantly. Below this threshold, each unit increase in AST/ALT ratio was associated with a 40% increase in mortality risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–1.6, p < 0.001), while above 3.6, the relationship attenuated substantially (OR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.8–1.1, p = 0.600)

### The effect of acetaminophen (four grams a day for three consecutive days) on hepatic tests in alcoholic patients – a multicenter randomized study [^114vNV8U]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A series of post-hoc analyses were performed to explore the possibility that a subgroup of participants could have had a different response to acetaminophen administration (i.e. that a susceptible subpopulation exists). None of the analyses indicated a statistical difference between the acetaminophen and placebo groups, although some analyses had few subjects and limited power to detect a difference. The ALT stayed the same or decreased from baseline in 31% of subjects in the placebo group and 36% of subjects in the acetaminophen group. The ALT increased above baseline in 66% of participants with a maximum increase of 1–254 IU/L in the acetaminophen group and 1–158 IU/L in the placebo group. A total of 32 participants (24 acetaminophen, 8 placebo) developed an ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at some point during the course of the study (Figure 2). A total of 11 subjects developed an ALT greater than 200 IU/L at some time during the study (9 acetaminophen, 2 placebo). The maximum ALT and AST measures were 312 and 448 IU/L, respectively. One subject developed coagulopathy; this subject was in the placebo group and had an INR of 1.8 on day 3. A bilirubin that exceeded the upper limit of normal at any time was found in 20 (6.4%) in the acetaminophen group and 6 (4.4%) in the placebo group.

There were 156 participants (106 acetaminophen, 50 placebo) that entered the study with a serum ALT above the ULN. The ALT group means of those with a baseline ALT greater than the ULN were consistently two to three times higher throughout the trial, regardless of group assignment (Figure 3).

To assess the effect of acetaminophen administration on participants fulfilling a case definition of alcoholic liver disease, a post-hoc analysis was performed using the 44 subjects in whom the baseline AST/ALT ratio was 2.0 or greater. The mean ALT of the group without evidence of alcoholic liver disease was significantly higher throughout the trial than the group with evidence of alcoholic liver disease; however, the acetaminophen and placebo groups were not statistically different (Figure 4). The peak ALT measure of these 44 subjects was 75 IU/L compared to 312 IU/L for the entire study sample. No subject with an AST to ALT ratio of 2.0 or greater developed an ALT more than three times the ULN or reported any study-related adverse events.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### FibroScan-AST (FAST) score for the non-invasive identification of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with significant activity and fibrosis: a prospective derivation and global validation study [^111nax9S]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally, and a major priority is to identify patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who are at greater risk of progression to cirrhosis, and who will be candidates for clinical trials and emerging new pharmacotherapies. We aimed to develop a score to identify patients with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS ≥ 4), and advanced fibrosis (stage 2 or higher [F ≥ 2]).

Methods

This prospective study included a derivation cohort before validation in multiple international cohorts. The derivation cohort was a cross-sectional, multicentre study of patients aged 18 years or older, scheduled to have a liver biopsy for suspicion of NAFLD at seven tertiary care liver centres in England. This was a prespecified secondary outcome of a study for which the primary endpoints have already been reported. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by vibration-controlled transient elastography and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measured by FibroScan device were combined with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or AST:ALT ratio. To identify those patients with NASH, an elevated NAS, and significant fibrosis, the best fitting multivariable logistic regression model was identified and internally validated using boot-strapping. Score calibration and discrimination performance were determined in both the derivation dataset in England, and seven independent international (France, USA, China, Malaysia, Turkey) histologically confirmed cohorts of patients with NAFLD (external validation cohorts). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01985009.

Findings

Between March 20, 2014, and Jan 17, 2017, 350 patients with suspected NAFLD attending liver clinics in England were prospectively enrolled in the derivation cohort. The most predictive model combined LSM, CAP, and AST, and was designated FAST (FibroScan-AST). Performance was satisfactory in the derivation dataset (C-statistic 0.80, 95% CI 0.76–0.85) and was well calibrated. In external validation cohorts, calibration of the score was satisfactory and discrimination was good across the full range of validation cohorts (C-statistic range 0.74–0.95, 0.85; 95% CI 0.83–0.87 in the pooled external validation patients' cohort; n = 1026). Cutoff was 0.35 for sensitivity of 0.90 or greater and 0.67 for specificity of 0.90 or greater in the derivation cohort, leading to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.83 (84/101) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.85 (93/110). In the external validation cohorts, PPV ranged from 0.33 to 0.81 and NPV from 0.73 to 1.0.

Interpretation

The FAST score provides an efficient way to non-invasively identify patients at risk of progressive NASH for clinical trials or treatments when they become available, and thereby reduce unnecessary liver biopsy in patients unlikely to have significant disease.

### Association between De ritis ratio (aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase) and oncological outcomes in bladder cancer patients after radical cystectomy [^116tPjPY]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

BC most commonly affects elderly individuals and those with significant comorbidities and an impaired performance status. RC remains the gold standard of treatment in patients with local MIBC and in some cases of NMIBC. However, despite these aggressive local approaches, long-term prognosis remains poor due to disease recurrence accompanied by local and/or distant metastasis. These poor outcomes suggest a need for ongoing risk stratification and appropriate selection of multimodal treatment approaches, such as chemotherapy in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings. With recent advances in techniques, an extremely large number of new prognostic markers have been identified. New biomarkers predictive of outcomes would help clinicians provide risk stratification for patients and serve as prognostic indicators for individual patients. For clinical practice purposes, a potential prognosticator would generally have great potential if it could be easily and inexpensively determined by routine measures.

In this study, we determined that an elevated De Ritis ratio showed a significant association with adverse outcomes in patients with BC who underwent RC. Patients with elevated De Ritis ratios showed significantly inferior survival outcomes in terms of MFS, CSS, and OS after RC in patients with BC. Moreover, elevated De Ritis ratios were found to be significant independent predictors of metastasis, cancer-related death, and overall death. To our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the De Ritis ratio as a novel significant prognostic biomarker in BC. Because the De Ritis ratio may be inexpensively and reproducibly measured, it might become a promising tool in the management of BC.

The amino transaminase enzymes (AST and ALT) which are strongly involved in cellular metabolism and cancer cell turnover, represent easily measurable potential blood-based biomarkers. Amino transaminases are widely used to determine liver function in clinical care. Moreover, amino transaminases are used to identify liver diseases such as viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse. De Ritis et al. were the first to introduce the AST/ALT ratio as a useful indicator for differentiating the etiology of acute hepatitis. Previous studies of certain types of cancer indicate that different levels of these enzymes are associated with patient prognoses.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

Table 1
Liver test parameters in overall sample population

Among the 200 patients, 34% had an AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2. Patients with an AST/ALT ratio of ≥ 2 were significantly older (70.29 vs. 64.57 years, P = 0.007). Aside from this, there were no significant differences in the distribution of other medical comorbidities. An AST/ALT ratio ≥ 2 was associated with a significantly higher rate of inpatient death (32% vs. 20%, P = 0.047). It was also associated with higher rates of vasopressor use, need for intubation, and need for continuous renal replacement therapy. However, after adjustment for age, sex, race and comorbidities via multivariate logistic regression, the only significant associations that remained were with the need for intubation (OR 2.678, 95%CI 1.202–5.963; P = 0.016) and the need for vasopressors (OR 3.352, 95%CI 1.495–7.514; P = 0.003) (Table 2).

### Elevated liver enzymes and cardiovascular mortality: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of more than one million participants [^113YrATK]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are commonly used liver function markers. We performed a dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the association between liver enzymes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in prospective cohort studies. We conducted a systematic search up to April 2018 in Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Combined hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model as described by DerSimonian and Laird. Dose-response analysis was also carried out. Twenty-three studies with 1067922 participants reported association between GGT and CVD mortality and were included in our analysis. Pooled results showed a significant association between GGT and risk of CVD mortality (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.47–1.78, P = 0.001, P-heterogeneity = 0.001) and it was HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.73–1.07; P = 0.221, P-heterogeneity = 0.028, for ALT. There was a direct association between baseline levels of ALP and AST/ALT ratio with CVD mortality (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.11–1.89; P = 0.005, P-heterogeneity = 0.026, and HR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.60–3.04; P = 0.001, P-heterogeneity = 0.540, respectively). Pooled results did not show any significant association between AST and the risk of CVD mortality (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.83–1.73; P = 0.313, P-heterogeneity = 0.024). Moreover, there was a significant nonlinear association between GGT and ALP levels and the risk of CVD mortality (P = 0.008 and 0.016, respectively). Our dose-response meta-analysis revealed a direct relationship between GGT and ALP levels and the risk of CVD mortality. High levels of GGT, ALP and AST/ALT were associated with an increased CVD mortality rate.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^116MUPTF]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The analysis from the BALLETS study was predicated on the identification of adults with established causes of liver disease such as autoimmune liver disease, viral hepatitis or metal storage disorders, which were found in just 5% of those with abnormal liver blood tests. Thus, these data would support a strategy of a streamlined panel with high sensitivity without generating large numbers of false positives, which have the potential to lead to greater patient anxiety, overinvestigation and considerably increased costs.

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, ALT, ALP and GGT, together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)

If there is clear indication of a specific clinical risk — for example, in high-risk groups such as injecting drug users, migrants from high prevalence areas or prisoners, then some aspects of second-line testing can be undertaken simultaneously. In many patients with liver damage an assessment of liver fibrosis is critical in making decisions about referral and management. In adults, clues to the level of liver fibrosis can be gleaned from the use of non-invasive algorithms such as the AST to ALT ratio. An AST:ALT ratio of > 1 indicates advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, hence the inclusion of this ratio in algorithms has the potential to assess the risk of significant fibrosis in adults with abnormal liver blood tests. However, non-invasive markers have not been sufficiently validated in children to be routinely applied in clinical practice.

An important consideration when evaluating the risk of hepatic fibrosis is that both AST and ALT can be normal even in the setting of cirrhosis, and the utility of the AST:ALT ratio in adults persists even if both values are within the normal reference interval. While it is hard to justify the routine analysis of both AST and ALT together on every liver blood test request, a strategy not supported by the data from the BALLETS study, subsequent testing of AST (or ALT depending which one is undertaken first) to calculate the AST:ALT ratio is clearly desirable. From a patient and cost perspective this is likely to be more cost-effective if performed by 'reflex' on the same sera following the detection of an abnormal ALT or GGT. To date there is no firm evidence that this is a cost-effective approach, although the results of a pilot study of such 'reflex' testing and additional up-front aetiology screen testing from Wales and Scotland are awaited.

### Insulin resistance is associated with elevated transaminases and low aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio in young adults with normal weight [^111DYjbG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to determine whether insulin resistance is associated with elevation of transaminases levels and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio in normal-weight healthy young adults.

Participants and Methods

Apparently healthy nonpregnant women and men, aged 18–23 years, were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. According to the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, the participants were allocated into groups of patients with (> 2.5) and without (≤ 2.5) insulin resistance. Normal weight was defined by BMI of at least 18.5 and less than 25.0kg/m. A multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the association between insulin resistance and elevated transaminases and AST/ALT ratio of 1 or less.

Results

A total of 1732 young adults were enrolled and allocated into groups with (n = 287) and without (n = 1445) insulin resistance. The prevalence of insulin resistance was 16.6% in the overall population. The multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted by age, sex, waist circumference, and BMI indicated that the odds ratio (OR) between insulin resistance and elevated ALT concentrations is 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04–2.62, P = 0.03], for AST/ALT ratio lower than 1 OR is 1.69 (95% CI: 1.27–2.26, P < 0.001), and for elevated AST levels OR is 1.31 (95% CI: 0.71–2.43, P = 0.377).

Conclusion

The results of the present study suggest that insulin resistance is significantly associated with elevated ALT levels and AST/ALT ratio of lower than 1, but not with elevated AST levels.

### Elevated alanine aminotransferase and low aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio are associated with chronic kidney disease among middle-aged women: a cross-sectional study [^113XL9nt]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study participants. The CKD group (n = 2677) was older and was more likely to be obese than the non-CKD group (n = 26,456); the mean age and the proportion of obesity were 53.4 years and 29.3% in the CKD group and 50.4 years and 18.5% in the non-CKD group. There were statistically significant differences in smoking status (P value < 0.001) and alcohol intake (P value < 0.001). The proportions of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes in the CKD group (36.8, 50.7 and 7.2%) were significantly higher than those in the non-CKD group (28.9, 40.8 and 3.4%). ALT and GGT levels were significantly higher in the CKD group (the median ALT: 18 U/L and the median GGT: 23 U/L) than in the non-CKD group (15 U/L and 18 U/L). In contrast, AST/ALT ratio in the CKD group was significantly lower than that in the non-CKD group (the mean AST/ALT ratio: 1.21 vs. 1.30, P value < 0.001).

### Glucose intolerance and serum aminotransferase activities in Japanese men [^11789b4R]. Journal of Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Elevated activities of serum aminotransferase are commonly observed in patients with diabetes mellitus. Few studies have addressed the relation between glucose intolerance and serum activities of aminotransferase in free-living populations.

Methods

Using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, we examined the association of impaired fasting glycemia (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type 2 diabetes mellitus with serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) among 4621 men aged 49–59 years of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Statistical adjustment was made for body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and other possible confounding factors.

Results

Proportions of an elevated ALT (> 50 IU/l) in men with normal glucose tolerance, IFG, IGT, and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus were 3.5%, 9.5%, 7.7%, and 18.0%, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios of an elevated ALT for IFG, IGT, and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus were 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.1–4.3), 1.7 (1.2–2.4), and 4.4 (3.0–6.6), respectively. IGT and diabetes mellitus were also significantly positively associated with elevated AST (> 40 IU/l) and GGT (> 50 IU/l).

Conclusions

Glucose intolerance is associated with elevated serum aminotransferase independent of obesity, but even a mildly elevated ALT is relatively uncommon in free-living men with glucose intolerance.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^112EKPPo]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio, reflecting liver disease severity, has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the AST/ALT ratio improves established risk prediction tools in a primary care population.

Methods

Data were analysed from a prospective cohort of 29316 UK primary care patients, aged 25–84years with no history of CVD at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to derive 10-year multivariate risk models for the first occurrence of CVD based on two established risk prediction tools (Framingham and QRISK2), with and without including the AST/ALT ratio. Overall, model performance was assessed by discriminatory accuracy (AUC c-statistic).

Results

During a total follow-up of 120462 person-years, 782 patients (59% men) experienced their first CVD event. Multivariate models showed that elevated AST/ALT ratios were significantly associated with CVD in men (Framingham: HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.79; QRISK2: HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.89) but not in women (Framingham: HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.43; QRISK2: HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.35). Including the AST/ALT ratio with all Framingham risk factors (AUC c-statistic: 0.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.74) or QRISK2 risk factors (AUC c-statistic: 0.73, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.74) resulted in no change in discrimination from the established risk prediction tools. Limiting analysis to those individuals with raised ALT showed that discrimination could improve by 5% and 4% with Framingham and QRISK2 risk factors, respectively.

Conclusions

Elevated AST/ALT ratio is significantly associated with increased risk of developing CVD in men but not women. However, the ratio does not confer any additional benefits over established CVD risk prediction tools in the general population, but may have clinical utility in certain subgroups.

### A simple approach to noninvasively identifying significant fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C patients in clinical practice [^116c3UTQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Identification of the presence of significant fibrosis is an important part of the diagnostic work-up of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).

Aim

To evaluate the performance of the aspartate to alanine aminotransferase ratio (AST/ALT ratio) and platelet count in reducing the number of liver biopsies and diagnosing the presence/absence of significant fibrosis in a large cohort of patients with CHC seen at 2 tertiary referral centers.

Methods

Liver biopsies of 409 patients with CHC were evaluated. Staging was carried out by means of the Ishak and METAVIR scores in the Italian and US series, respectively. Prevalence of significant fibrosis was 43%. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to identify AST/ALT ratio and platelet count cutoffs with the highest accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis. These cutoffs were used to devise a diagnostic algorithm for reducing the number of liver biopsies and diagnosing/ruling out significant fibrosis.

Results

AST/ALT ratios increased and platelet counts decreased as liver fibrosis worsened. Both AST/ALT ratio (c-index = 0.747) and platelet count (c-index = 0.733) had high accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis. The use of AST/ALT ratio and platelet count cutoffs in a diagnostic algorithm would have avoided liver biopsy in 68.9% of the patients and would have correctly identified the absence/presence of significant fibrosis in 80.5% of these cases.

Conclusions

In clinical practice, the use of simple, reproducible, and inexpensive parameters such as the AST/ALT ratio and platelet count can reduce the need for liver biopsy in a substantial proportion of patients with CHC.

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^1147CaUE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the predicting role of AAR value on developing cirrhosis in a prospectively enrolled cohort of hospitalized CHB patients by collecting their clinical and follow-up data after at least 6 months. We arrived at the conclusion that patients with higher AAR value exhibited significantly increasing risk of cirrhosis development independent of other host characteristics (gender, age, drinking history, smoking history and ALBI grade). Moreover, the effect remained prominent with the increasing follow-up time.

Cirrhosis is a multi-stage process involving many pathological changes, manifested as extensive liver parenchyma damage, liver cell necrosis, fibrous tissue proliferation, normal liver structure disorder and hard texture. Consequently, it is accomplished with abnormal liver function at the most time. Hepatic function produces a marked effect on predicting the development and prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and other liver diseases. Serum ALT and AST are two common liver enzymes that are routinely detected in the clinical setting, which was originated from damaged hepatocytes. Their activities have been widely considered the commonest marker to reflect the severity of liver injury, so as to monitor CLD prognosis and treating response, as well as in aiding decisions for clinical strategy. For example, normalized levels of enzymes for a prolonged period are a prompting to discontinue treatment in patients with hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis and overlap syndrome. AAR value is one main effective hallmark to reflect extent of liver damage and relevant complication, by comprehensively considering the characteristics of AST and ALT released into the blood. According to previous study, AAR was mainly used as a marker to identify fibrosis in patients with NAFLD(non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), and performed good discrimination accuracy in advanced alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Furthermore, AAR value was also revealed to be correlated with increased risks for development of CHC-related cirrhosis. Although numerous clinical data were conducted to identify the clinical value of AAR on liver diseases, non-ignorable disputation was manifested.

### Implications of liver enzymes in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^117XQzZ6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

To investigate an association of serum liver enzymes with Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and cognitive performance, we performed logistic and linear regression analyses in 781 patients with AD and 405 cognitively normal subjects. We found that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels had significant positive associations with cognitive performance and were significantly decreased in AD patients. The alkaline phosphatase level and AST to ALT ratio were significantly negatively associated with cognitive performance and were significantly increased in AD patients. This suggests that these liver enzymes might be implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.

### Elevated alanine aminotransferase and low aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio are associated with chronic kidney disease among middle-aged women: a cross-sectional study [^111n2XYv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Characteristics of study participants

Values were mean (standard deviation), median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) or n (%)

a Unpaired t -test, wilcoxon's rank-sum test or chi-squared test

In the CKD group, proportions of women were 82.0, 6.2, 0.7 and 0.3% for G3a, G3b, G4 and G5. In addition, those of women for A1, A2 and A3 were 86.0, 12.5 and 1.5%.

Table 2 shows the ORs and 95% CIs of elevated ALT, low AST/ALT ratio, and elevated GGT for CKD. Elevated ALT (OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.92–2.58) and low AST/ALT ratio (1.82, 1.66–1.99) significantly increased the OR for CKD. Elevated GGT was also significantly associated with CKD (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 2.06–2.58). These findings persisted even after adjusting for confounding factors (age, smoking status, alcohol intake, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes). Even when we adjusted for GGT in addition to the confounding factors, elevated ALT (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.14–1.60) and low AST/ALT ratio (1.37, 1.24–1.52) were significantly associated with CKD.

### The value of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in cardiovascular disease risk assessment [^1118N5Xg]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

There was no improvement in discrimination after the AST/ALT ratio was included in multivariate risk prediction models for CVD in a heterogeneous primary care population. Despite this, we have established in this study that elevated levels of the AST/ALT ratio are independently associated with increased risk of developing CVD within 10 years in men but not women. Additionally, by excluding patients with normal or low ALT levels, we have shown that the AST/ALT ratio confers larger benefits in predicting CVD in individuals with elevated ALT levels. Currently, there is no clear biological mechanism but as well as a marker of CVD risk, AST/ALT ratio stratifies severity of liver disease, and this is independent of features of the metabolic syndrome. Moreover, emerging evidence in NAFLD suggests that liver fibrosis (with AST/ALT ratio as a proxy marker) stratifies future CVD risk rather than steatosis alone.

The AST/ALT ratio being associated with CVD in men may be related to higher prevalence of liver disease in men. For instance, nearly 60% of incident cases of cirrhosis in the UK from 1998 to 2009 diagnosed in primary care occurred in men. Further, the risk of NAFLD increases with being obese or insulin resistant, which again are more common in men. As diabetes is an established risk factor for CVD in all established risk prediction tools while also being a primary risk factor of NAFLD, the effects of elevated AST/ALT ratio is likely masked by diabetes being present in the model. This was likely the case in this study as elevated AST/ALT ratios were also strongly and significantly associated with diabetes (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 2.31 to 2.72). However, when we removed diabetes as well as other established risk factors, a simple age and gender adjusted model including AST/ALT ratio had a similar incremental improvement in predictive accuracy than other well-established CVD risk factors, such as, TC/HDL and systolic blood pressure. This implies that the AST/ALT ratio may have some clinical utility in CVD risk prediction, which is lost when diabetes is incorporated into the model.

### The development and implementation of a commissioned pathway for the identification and stratification of liver disease in the community [^1138xAXe]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the development of the Nottingham liver disease stratification pathway, present a 12-month evaluation of uptake and stratification results, and compare the pathway with current British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines.

Design

A referral pathway between primary and secondary care for the detection and risk stratification of liver disease.

Setting

Four Nottinghamshire clinical commissioning groups (700 000 population).

Patients

Patients are referred to the pathway with (1) raised aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase (AST:ALT) ratio, (2) harmful alcohol use or (3) risk or presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Interventions

We report on clinic attendance within secondary care for transient elastography (TE) and brief lifestyle intervention. The TE result is reported back to the general practitioner with advice on interpretation and referral guidance.

Main outcome measures

Pathway uptake, patient characteristics, liver disease stratification results and stakeholder feedback.

Results

Over the first 12 months 968 patients attended a TE clinic appointment, with raised AST:ALT ratio being the most common single reason for referral (36.9%). Of the total, 222 (22.9%) patients had an elevated liver stiffness (≥ 8 kPa), in whom 57 (25.7%) had a liver stiffness which was indicative of advanced chronic liver disease. If a traditional approach based on raised liver enzymes (BSG guidance) had been followed, 38.7% of those with significant liver disease (≥ 8 kPa) would have gone undetected among those referred for either NAFLD or raised AST:ALT ratio.

Conclusions

Targeting patients with risk factors for chronic liver disease and stratifying them using TE can detect significant chronic liver disease above and beyond the approach based on liver enzyme elevation.

### Are simple noninvasive scoring systems for fibrosis reliable in patients with NAFLD and normal ALT levels? [^115yovUs]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and many affected individuals have normal-range alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. There is a need for a robust screening tool to triage individuals with advanced fibrosis for specialist care.

Aim

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of noninvasive fibrosis tests in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and normal levels of ALT.

Methods

Patients presenting at a fatty liver clinic between 1999 and 2009 were included in the study. Liver biopsies were assessed using the Kleiner score. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT ratio, BARD, FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores were calculated.

Results

A total of 305 patients were included [70 with normal ALT levels (women: ALT ≤ 30 IU/l, men: ALT ≤ 45 IU/l) and 235 with elevated levels]. In total, 24% of patients with normal ALT levels and 17% of those with elevated ALT levels had advanced fibrosis (Kleiner stage 3–4). The FIB-4 performed best in identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with normal ALT (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.86, 82% sensitivity, 77% specificity and 92% negative predictive value). The sensitivity of the AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD fibrosis scores for advanced fibrosis was good in patients with normal ALT levels (94, 94 and 82%, respectively), but the specificity was low (44, 26 and 51%, respectively). The FIB-4 yielded best results in patients with elevated ALT levels. Using the FIB-4, 61% of patients with normal ALT levels and 63% of those with elevated ALT levels could avoid liver biopsy to exclude advanced fibrosis. In contrast, AST/ALT ratio and BARD and NAFLD scores would have led to a high proportion of patients with mild disease having to undergo a biopsy.

Conclusion

The FIB-4 yielded good results in patients with normal or elevated ALT levels, reliably excluding advanced fibrosis and reducing the need for liver biopsy.

### Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are associated with normal-range aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and their ratio in Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115JCPVA]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Myocardial enzymes (CK, LDH, AST) are established markers of myocardial injury and CVD diagnosis, but their utility in assessing the relationship between AST/ALT and CVD in patients with PCOS remains complex. Recent study link elevated transaminase levels, particularly AST and ALT to increased CVD risk and mortality. This study confirms the conclusions, as increases in CK, LDH, blood pressure, and lipid levels were all observed, but AST/ALT ratio′s role in CVD was complex in PCOS women. While some studies have linked higher AST/ALT ratio to increased CVD mortality or male‐specific risk factors, our cohort demonstrated a slight positive correlation between CK and AST/ALT ratio, but a strong negative correlation between LDH and AST/ALT ratio. This difference may partly stem from participants′ younger age, as enzyme levels change with age. For example, AST/ALT ratios typically rise with age due to muscle loss and liver fibrosis, while LDH may decline. Study link higher AST/ALT ratios to cardiovascular mortality in older adults. Lower body weight, tied to higher mortality in older adults, may also affect AST/ALT correlations. Thus, age‐related enzyme variations likely contribute to the differing AST/ALT–cardiovascular relationships across age groups. Elevated ALT and AST may reflect underlying hepatic steatosis or metabolic disturbances that contribute to endothelial dysfunction, IR, and inflammation, all of which are key mechanisms of CVD.

### Can AST / ALT ratio indicate recovery after acute paracetamol poisoning? [^11432eW4]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Paracetamol (acetaminophen or APAP) is the most common pharmaceutical exposure in the US. Elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels indicate hepatic toxicity. AST and ALT levels rise in similar proportions but later decline at different rates, with AST falling more rapidly than ALT.

Objective

To determine whether the AST/ALT ratio can indicate that a patient has passed the time of peak AST concentration.

Methods

We retrospectively identified cases of patients hospitalized for acute APAP poisoning by querying the pharmacy database of all patients treated with acetylcysteine (NAC) from January 1, 2001 to March 19, 2013. We included all patients with severe APAP poisoning, defined as AST or ALT greater than 1000 IU/L. Patients who were given NAC for other indications, those without APAP poisoning, and those receiving liver transplantation were excluded. We then recorded paired AST and ALT concentrations from each patient's hospital course. We classified each pair as clearly post-peak or not, and calculated the AST/ALT ratio for each pair of values. We compared different thresholds of AST/ALT ratio in increments of 0.1 to find the optimal value that reliably indicated resolving transaminases.

Results

We identified 1820 patients who received NAC during the study period. Of these, 333 received NAC for suspected poisoning by APAP. After excluding patients without severe APAP poisoning, other diagnoses explaining transaminase elevations, and patients who underwent liver transplantation, we had 37 evaluable patients with 343 evaluable pairs of AST and ALT concentrations. An AST/ALT ratio less than or equal to 0.4 was 99% sensitive for identifying patients with resolving transaminases.

Conclusion

An AST/ALT ratio less than or equal to 0.4 following severe hepatoxicity from paracetamol poisoning appears to be highly predictive of recovery in patients treated with NAC. This has potential to be an indicator of safe discontinuation of NAC treatment.

### Elevated alanine aminotransferase and low aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio are associated with chronic kidney disease among middle-aged women: a cross-sectional study [^112zBvYh]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to ALT ratio (AST/ALT ratio) have been shown to be related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or insulin resistance, which was associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it is unclear whether ALT and AST/ALT ratio are associated with CKD. In this study, we examined the relationship of ALT and AST/ALT ratio to CKD among middle-aged females in Japan.

Methods

The present study included 29,133 women aged 40 to 64 years who had an annual health checkup in Japan during April 2013 to March 2014. Venous blood samples were collected to measure ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and creatinine levels. In accordance with previous studies, ALT > 40 U/L and GGT > 50 U/L were determined as elevated, AST/ALT ratio < 1 was regarded as low, and CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and/or proteinuria. Logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CKD.

Results

"Elevated ALT and elevated GGT" and "elevated ALT and non-elevated GGT" significantly increased the OR for CKD when compared with "non-elevated ALT and non-elevated GGT" (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 2.10–3.12 and OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.81–2.77). Compared with "AST/ALT ratio ≥ 1 and non-elevated GGT", "AST/ALT ratio < 1 and elevated GGT" and "AST/ALT ratio < 1 and non-elevated GGT" significantly increased the OR for CKD (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 2.36–3.15 and OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.52–1.87). These findings still remained after adjustment for confounders.

Conclusions

Elevated ALT was associated with CKD regardless of GGT elevation. Moreover, low AST/ALT ratio was also associated with CKD independent of GGT elevation.

### Loss of life expectancy by 10 years or more from elevated aspartate aminotransferase: finding aspartate aminotransferase a better mortality predictor for all-cause and liver-related than alanine aminotransferase [^116iCHjp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are 2 commonly ordered liver function tests, and ALT has long been considered more liver-specific than AST. Between the 2, the one which is better in predicting liver or non-liver-related mortality remains unsettled.

Methods

The cohort, 416,122 adults, came from a self-paying comprehensive health surveillance program during 1994–2008 and was followed up till 2008. Mortality came from National Death Index, with 10,412 deaths identified. Hazard ratios (HRs), computed by Cox model, and life expectancy, by life table method, were presented for 5 levels of AST and ALT with elevated AST or ALT defined as ≥ 40 IU/L. Liver disease included liver cancer and other liver conditions.

Results

There were 3 times more elevated ALT (15.4%) than AST (5.7%). However, those with elevated AST had higher mortality for all-cause (HR = 2.44), for liver disease (HR = 27.2), and for liver cancer (HR = 47.6) than its ALT counterparts (HR = 1.69, 10.8, and 20.2, respectively). Elevated AST also lost more years of life expectancy (10.2) than those lost by ALT (5.2) and larger than most common risks. Elevated AST had increased mortality from all cancers (HR = 3.57), stroke (HR = 1.36), respiratory diseases (HR = 1.34), and injuries (HR = 1.82), other than just liver disease. All-cause mortality remained significantly increased, when high risk groups were excluded, such as frequent drinkers, hepatitis carriers, those died from nonmedical conditions, those died in the first 3 years, or advanced fibrosis index based on 4 factors or aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index. Results were consistent between those returned for second visits and those analyzed in initial visits.

Discussion

Those with elevated AST (≥ 40 IU/L) had life expectancy cut short by 10.2 years, doubled the number of years lost with elevated ALT. For all-cause and for liver-related mortality, AST was an important predictor, better than ALT.

2.4 AST/ALT ratio

The AST/ALT ratio was developed to predict liver fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV infection by exploring the variation in liver enzymes from liver injury and was subsequently validated in NAFLD. 39, 50 In a multicentre cohort of patients with histologically confirmed NAFLD, the diagnostic performance of AST/ALT ratio to predict presence of any fibrosis was marginal with AUROC 0.59, sensitivity of 38%, specificity of 76%, PPV of 83% and NPV of 28%. 43 The diagnostic performance improved slightly when identifying advanced fibrosis with an AUROC of 0.68, sensitivity of 54%, specificity 73%, PPV of 44% and NPV of 80%. 43 Since the performance of AST/ALT ratio is dependent on the premise of elevated aminotransferase and reversal of serum ALT to AST concentrations, it may not be as accurate in patients with less advanced disease. As a result, its isolated use is less prevalent and the ratio itself has been incorporated as part of other noninvasive fibrosis panel, such as FIB‐4 and NFS, and the omics approach. 36, 37, 51 The AST to ALT ratio can detect progression to advanced fibrosis, although inferior to APRI, FIB‐4 and NFS model score, with an a AUROC of 0.68, sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 76%, PPV of 36% and NPV of 93%. 43 The AST/ALT ratio's ability to differentiate between NASH vs non‐NASH is suboptimal as it is with other noninvasive models. 26 Furthermore, the ability of AST/ALT ratio to predict future risk of hepatic decompensation, death or need for LT remains unknown.

### Alanine aminotransferase / aspartate aminotransferase ratio is the best surrogate marker for insulin resistance in non-obese Japanese adults [^114SRi4j]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

In previous studies, several lipid ratios have been proposed as simple and useful clinical indicators of insulin resistance. The TG/HDL-C, the T-C/HDL-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio have shown similar potential for insulin resistance, though the reports are not entirely consistent. Also in our study, both LDL-C/HDL-C and TG/HDL-C ratio were useful markers of insulin resistance, especially in all subjects or non-obese subjects. However, these markers were weaker in overweight subjects. ALT/AST ratio as well as LDL-C/HDL-C and the TG/HDL-C ratio were also strongly related to insulin resistance. Several studies have reported a significant association of ALT with HOMA-IR. Moreover, Hanley et al. reported that ALT/AST ratio predicts metabolic syndrome independently of potential confounding variables, including directly measured insulin sensitivity and acute insulin response. ALT/AST ratio that includes information on at least two measures might have a more integrated explanation than single measures such as ALT or TG.

There are a number of possible mechanisms that can explain the association between the ALT/AST ratio and insulin resistance. Fat accumulation in the liver is characterized by several features of insulin resistance in normal weight and moderately overweight subjects, independent of BMI and intra-abdominal and overall obesity. Increased liver fat content, a disorder that has detrimental effects on components of the metabolic syndrome, is known to be significantly correlated with these markers. Nanji et al. reported a significant correlation between ALT/AST ratio and the degree of fatty infiltration of the liver. Moreover, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which has recently been proposed as a feature of the metabolic syndrome, was also characterized by chronic elevations in liver transaminase levels, including ALT, AST, and GGT. ALT/AST ratio and ALT per se along with the cut-off points might be reflecting NAFLD, but in this study, we have not evaluated ultrasound liver findings. Although, this study is of interest because liver transaminase markers, which are inexpensive and routinely collected in clinical settings, may provide a simple and accurate enhancement to models currently used to identify subjects with insulin resistance.

### FibroScan-AST (FAST) score for the non-invasive identification of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with significant activity and fibrosis: a prospective derivation and global validation study [^1124Jtbt]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

The burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing globally, and a major priority is to identify patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) who are at greater risk of progression to cirrhosis, and who will be candidates for clinical trials and emerging new pharmacotherapies. We aimed to develop a score to identify patients with NASH, elevated NAFLD activity score (NAS ≥ 4), and advanced fibrosis (stage 2 or higher [F ≥ 2]).

Methods

This prospective study included a derivation cohort before validation in multiple international cohorts. The derivation cohort was a cross-sectional, multicentre study of patients aged 18 years or older, scheduled to have a liver biopsy for suspicion of NAFLD at seven tertiary care liver centres in England. This was a prespecified secondary outcome of a study for which the primary endpoints have already been reported. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by vibration-controlled transient elastography and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measured by FibroScan device were combined with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or AST:ALT ratio. To identify those patients with NASH, an elevated NAS, and significant fibrosis, the best fitting multivariable logistic regression model was identified and internally validated using boot-strapping. Score calibration and discrimination performance were determined in both the derivation dataset in England, and seven independent international (France, USA, China, Malaysia, Turkey) histologically confirmed cohorts of patients with NAFLD (external validation cohorts). This study is registered with, number.

Findings

Between March 20, 2014, and Jan 17, 2017, 350 patients with suspected NAFLD attending liver clinics in England were prospectively enrolled in the derivation cohort. The most predictive model combined LSM, CAP, and AST, and was designated FAST (FibroScan-AST). Performance was satisfactory in the derivation dataset (C-statistic 0.80, 95% CI 0.76–0.85) and was well calibrated. In external validation cohorts, calibration of the score was satisfactory and discrimination was good across the full range of validation cohorts (C-statistic range 0.74–0.95, 0.85; 95% CI 0.83–0.87 in the pooled external validation patients' cohort; n = 1026). Cutoff was 0.35 for sensitivity of 0.90 or greater and 0.67 for specificity of 0.90 or greater in the derivation cohort, leading to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.83 (84/101) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.85 (93/110). In the external validation cohorts, PPV ranged from 0.33 to 0.81 and NPV from 0.73 to 1.0.

Interpretation

The FAST score provides an efficient way to non-invasively identify patients at risk of progressive NASH for clinical trials or treatments when they become available, and thereby reduce unnecessary liver biopsy in patients unlikely to have significant disease.

### Elevated alanine aminotransferase and low aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio are associated with chronic kidney disease among middle-aged women: a cross-sectional study [^114fNR1j]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, the associations of elevated ALT and low AST/ALT ratio with CKD were examined among women in Japan. As a result, elevated ALT and low AST/ALT ratio were significantly associated with CKD regardless of GGT elevation. This is the first study regarding the relationship of elevated ALT and low AST/ALT ratio to CKD among women in Japan as far as we know. However, these findings should be carefully discussed.

Elevated ALT and low AST/ALT ratio significantly associated with CKD in this study. Alkerwi et al. showed that ALT was significantly higher in participants with CKD than in those without CKD, which was consistent with our study result. Elevated ALT and low AST/ALT ratio have been reported to be associated with insulin resistance. A recent study showed that insulin resistance was associated with the occurrence of CKD. These findings support that the present study result was reasonable and elevated ALT.

In our study, elevated GGT was significantly associated with CKD. Previously reported cross-sectional studies showed that GGT elevation significantly increased OR for CKD, which was consistent with our study finding. Serum GGT is a biological marker of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can cause the inflammatory process and accelerate renal injury progression. Thus, elevated GGT might contribute to renal injury, which results in CKD.

Elevated ALT or low AST/ALT ratio was associated with CKD in women with and without elevated GGT, which suggested that elevated ALT or low AST/ALT ratio plays a role in CKD regardless of elevated GGT. The finding suggested that women with elevated ALT or low AST/ALT ratio were more likely to be CKD even when there was no GGT elevation. In addition, the increase of OR for CKD was more pronounced in "low AST/ALT ratio and elevated GGT" women compared to "low AST/ALT ratio and non-elevated GGT" women. The result indicated that the impact of "low AST/ALT ratio and elevated GGT" on CKD was stronger than that of "low AST/ALT ratio and non-elevated GGT" on CKD. In fact, the interaction of low AST/ALT ratio and elevated GGT on CKD was statistically significant. Therefore, it might be effective to consider elevated ALT and low AST/ALT ratio for the early detection of CKD among middle-aged women, especially those with GGT elevation. Because the biological mechanism of the interaction was beyond our study scope, future studies will be required to elucidate the mechanism.

### Validity and clinical utility of the aspartate aminotransferase-alanine aminotransferase ratio in assessing disease severity and prognosis in patients with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease… [^111xbVMC]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Chronic hepatitis patients more frequently had AST/ALT ratios less than 1 compared with cirrhotic patients. Furthermore, a higher proportion of chronic hepatitis patients with low fibrosis scores and of cirrhotic patients with compensated disease had AST/ALT ratios less than 1. Therefore, we evaluated whether the combination of an AST/ALT ratio cutoff of 1 and PLT cutoff of 130 × 103/µL would improve the accuracy of noninvasive diagnosis of cirrhosis. Table 3 shows specificity, sensitivity, PPV, and NPV of these variables alone or together. The AST/ALT ratios showed significant correlation with both MELD and Child-Pugh scores. The ROC curves identified an AST/ALT ratio cutoff of 1. 16, a MELD score cutoff.

In this debate, we suggest that the AST/ALT ratio warrants more extensive evaluation. In fact, since both aminotransferases are usually determined and are part of the common diagnostic workup of patients with liver disease, we think that the information obtained should be used to its fullest extent. Furthermore, we believe that the use of a ratio bypasses the problems related to the interpretation of different aminotransferase cutoffs. We observed that the medium-term cirrhotic patients who died had higher mean AST/ALT ratios and higher MELD and Child-Pugh scores compared with patients who survived. Moreover, AST/ALT ratios were significantly correlated with both MELD and Child-Pugh scores.

We initially showed that a simple and reproducible variable such as the AST/ALT ratio has prognostic value in predicting 1-year mortality of patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and that its prognostic accuracy is no different from that of established prognostic scores such as the MELD and Child-Pugh scores.

### Age as a confounding factor for the accurate non-invasive diagnosis of advanced NAFLD fibrosis [^111g8js6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Both the NFS and the FIB-4 score include age in their models and this might be one explanation for the reduction in specificity for advanced fibrosis with increasing age. However, we also demonstrated that the specificity of the AST/ALT ratio for advanced fibrosis fell with increasing age. This was due to a significant age-related fall in serum ALT levels, which persisted, independent of fibrosis stage and gender, and confirms results of previous studies. As both the NFS and FIB-4 score include a ratio of the AST and ALT in their models, this may well also contribute to the overall reduction in specificity with increasing age. Serum ALT levels are well known to fall with increasing fibrosis stage, so one explanation for this observation may be that, with a higher prevalence of advanced fibrosis in older patients, the ALT fall in the older patients was due to increased fibrosis stage. However, re-analysis of the data stratified by fibrosis stage demonstrates that this is not the explanation and so the underlying mechanism for the fall in ALT levels is not known. It is, however, consistent with the observation that many NAFLD patients have serum ALT levels within the normal range, irrespective of disease activity. It once again highlights that clinicians should not rely on a raised serum ALT to support a diagnosis of NAFLD or as a marker of disease severity, particularly in older individuals. It also raises the broader question of whether age-specific normal ranges for serum ALT should be defined. Therefore, the likely explanation for the reduced specificity of the AST/ALT ratio for advanced fibrosis is that, even in the absence of liver disease, there is a natural age-related fall in serum ALT level (while the AST level remains stable). This increases the AST/ALT ratio and, as a result, reduces the specificity of this test for advanced fibrosis. In addition to the effect of age on transaminase levels, we found a negative association between age and platelet count, confirming previous epidemiological studies. Both NFS and FIB-4 score include platelet count in their models, likely also contributing to the observed reduction in specificity with increasing age.

### Elevated alanine aminotransferase and low aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ratio are associated with chronic kidney disease among middle-aged women: a cross-sectional study [^112fS3Dc]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for CKD

ALT Alanine aminotransferase, AST Aspartate aminotransferase, GGT Gamma-glutamyltransferase

OR Odds ratio, CI Confidence interval, CKD Chronic kidney disease

Adjusted for age, smoking status (none, former or current), alcohol intake (none, sometimes or everyday), obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes

Next, we evaluated the association of the combination of elevated ALT and elevated GGT with CKD (Table 3). "Elevated ALT and elevated GGT" (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 2.10–3.12) and "non-elevated ALT and elevated GGT" (2.30, 2.02–2.62) significantly increased OR for CKD, compared with "non-elevated ALT and non-elevated GGT". Significantly increased OR for CKD was also found in "elevated ALT and non-elevated GGT" (OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.81–2.77).

Table 4 shows the association of the combination of low AST/ALT ratio and elevated GGT with CKD. Compared to "AST/ALT ratio ≥ 1 and non-elevated GGT", "AST/ALT ratio < 1 and elevated GGT" (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 2.36–3.15) and "AST/ALT ratio ≥ 1 and elevated GGT" (2.33, 1.98–2.75) were significantly associated with CKD. "AST/ALT ratio < 1 and non-elevated GGT" significantly increased the OR for CKD (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.52–1.87).

Background

The mortality rate in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is reported to be much higher than that in non-CKD patients. In addition, CKD patients have a strong risk of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, health-related quality of life is substantially lower in CKD patients than in the general population and CKD imposes substantial economic burden on affected individuals. Therefore, CKD is a major public health problem.

The prevalence of CKD in Japan was reported to be higher than that in other countries. Imai et al. showed that approximately 13% of Japanese adults were CKD. Moreover, a previous study in Japan demonstrated that the proportion of individuals who developed CKD over 10 years was 19.2% in adults aged 40 years or over. Thus, it is very important to prevent CKD among adults in Japan.

A recent study showed that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was associated with CKD. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lower aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to ALT ratio (AST/ALT ratio), and elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) are commonly used markers of liver injury and non-invasive indicators of NAFLD. Some studies reported that GGT was associated with CKD. However, there are no studies reporting on the relationship of elevated ALT and lower AST/ALT ratio to CKD. We hypothesized that elevated ALT and low AST/ALT ratio were associated with CKD and the associations differed by GGT elevation.

Accordingly, the present study investigated the relationship of elevated ALT and low AST/ALT ratio to CKD by considering GGT among adults in Japan.
