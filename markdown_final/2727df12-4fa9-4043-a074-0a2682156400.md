## Question

A patient with hypothyroidism attributed to lithium and carbamazepine now has a TSH of 6.38 — how should this be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a TSH of 6.38 mIU/L in a patient with hypothyroidism attributed to lithium and carbamazepine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and classifying the thyroid dysfunction. Then, I should assess clinical risk factors and context. Next, I will interpret a TSH of 6.38 mIU/L using guideline thresholds. After that, I need to evaluate the specific contributions of lithium and carbamazepine. Then, I will construct a decision matrix for monitoring versus levothyroxine treatment and address psychiatric medication management. Finally, I should plan monitoring and special scenarios such as central hypothyroidism and deliver a concise recommendation.

> Let me first confirm and characterize the thyroid dysfunction; I need to recheck TSH and obtain a free T4 to distinguish subclinical from overt hypothyroidism, and I should avoid relying on total T4 or T3, since T3 measurement is not recommended for diagnosing hypothyroidism and total T4 can mislead in this context, while considering anti-TPO antibodies to refine progression risk and comparing to baseline values to establish trajectory [^112tC9LZ] [^116R5pZ2] [^1147cuNh].

> Wait, let me verify the definitions before proceeding; if free T4 is normal with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, this fits subclinical hypothyroidism, whereas low free T4 with elevated TSH indicates overt hypothyroidism, and if free T4 is low with inappropriately normal or low TSH I should consider central hypothyroidism where free T4, not TSH, guides diagnosis and treatment decisions [^111CspHm] [^112SDVCZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the clinical context carefully, screening for symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, depressive or cognitive changes, cardiovascular disease or risk factors, pregnancy status or plans, and the patient's psychiatric stability on current mood stabilizers, since these factors shift the threshold for treatment and monitoring strategy according to AACE/ATA guidance and pregnancy-specific thresholds [^1147cuNh] [^116fQeE3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "higher treatment threshold if female over 50", but that's not quite right; I should correct myself because older age and female sex increase risk of hypothyroidism and progression rather than raising the threshold, so in practice these factors often lower the bar for therapy in symptomatic or higher risk patients, while still individualizing decisions in the TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L range per AACE/ATA [^1147cuNh] [^111CspHm].

> Next, I should interpret a TSH of 6.38 mIU/L against evidence-based thresholds; AACE/ATA recommend treatment when TSH is greater than 10 mIU/L due to cardiovascular risk, whereas TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L is individualized based on symptoms, positive anti-TPO, cardiovascular disease or risk factors, and patient preference, and I should also weigh the BMJ 2019 guideline, which issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in most adults with subclinical hypothyroidism due to lack of symptomatic benefit, with exceptions for pregnancy and very high TSH [^111CspHm] [^1147cuNh] [^114LBMH9].

> I will now examine drug-specific mechanisms; lithium is a well-established cause of subclinical and overt hypothyroidism via inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis and release, with increased risk in women and with cumulative exposure, and standard practice is regular thyroid monitoring rather than discontinuation, as reflected in regulatory and guideline sources and large cohort observations that show modestly higher risk under lithium compared to several alternatives [^117LHP6y] [^1153N8Y2] [^1144GRtd] [^114dxSH9].

> Let me think about carbamazepine next; carbamazepine can reduce total and free T4 and sometimes simulate biochemical central hypothyroidism with low free T4 and non-elevated TSH, typically with patients remaining clinically euthyroid and with reversibility after drug cessation, so I need to ensure I interpret a low free T4 in this setting cautiously and anchor diagnosis to the overall clinical picture and repeat testing off confounders if feasible [^112e16yd] [^111caVyo] [^115jueAj] [^116T4vze].

> I should confirm combination risk; concomitant mood stabilizers can add risk, with observational data suggesting increased odds of hypothyroidism with combinations such as lithium plus carbamazepine compared with monotherapy, which reinforces the need for structured monitoring rather than reflexively stopping effective psychiatric regimens [^1133QP7N] [^115dLJ5C].

> Now, I need to decide monitor versus treat for TSH 6.38; if the patient is asymptomatic, has a normal free T4, lacks cardiovascular disease or major risk factors, is not pregnant or planning pregnancy, and is psychiatrically stable, monitoring without immediate levothyroxine is reasonable, with repeat TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks to confirm persistence and then 6‑monthly thereafter per NICE, while remaining alert to symptom emergence, progression, or a rise toward or above 10 mIU/L that would favor treatment [^1147cuNh] [^114LBMH9] [^1144GRtd].

> But wait, what if treatment criteria are met; in the presence of symptoms attributable to hypothyroidism, low free T4, positive anti-TPO antibodies, cardiovascular disease or significant risk factors, pregnancy or plans to conceive, or a progressive rise in TSH toward or above 10, I should initiate levothyroxine monotherapy, typically at 25–50 mcg daily in otherwise healthy adults with dose adjustments every 6–8 weeks to target a normal TSH in primary hypothyroidism, and I should avoid starting thyroid hormone solely for nonspecific symptoms without biochemical confirmation, ensuring administration apart from interfering agents and recognizing that T3 testing is not used to diagnose primary hypothyroidism [^113yCqyy] [^111CspHm] [^111HXJkK] [^116R5pZ2].

> Hold on, I should verify the psychiatric medication strategy; hypothyroidism alone is ordinarily not an indication to stop lithium in a patient with good response, and the preferred approach is to continue lithium and add thyroid supplementation if indicated, with evidence that lithium-associated hypothyroidism often reverses after lithium discontinuation, though changing an effective regimen risks mood destabilization and should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons and a coordinated psychiatric plan [^1143To3o] [^116mDdEz].

> Next, I should review special scenarios; if low free T4 coexists with inappropriately normal or low TSH and clinical features suggest central hypothyroidism, I need to confirm with repeat assays and consider pituitary evaluation, but I must also remember that enzyme‑inducing antiepileptics and other psychotropics can produce an isolated biochemical pattern without structural pituitary disease, and recent observational data suggest that many cases labeled isolated central hypothyroidism on labs do not require extensive workup absent other pituitary signs [^112SDVCZ] [^115GhaAE] [^111HqCWM] [^111caVyo].

> I should double-check the monitoring framework; endocrine follow‑up should include periodic TFTs with at least 6‑monthly checks in patients on lithium, psychiatric coordination is essential to maintain mood stability and anticipate dose interactions, and primary care can consolidate intervals and patient education regarding symptom vigilance and adherence to both psychotropic and thyroid therapies when used [^1144GRtd] [^1153N8Y2].

> Finally, let me synthesize a recommendation; for a TSH of 6.38 mIU/L, the most likely management is to monitor without immediate levothyroxine if the patient is asymptomatic with normal free T4 and stable psychiatric status, rechecking TFTs in 6–8 weeks and then every 6 months, escalating to treatment if symptoms develop, free T4 falls, anti‑TPO is positive with progression, cardiovascular risk is significant, pregnancy is relevant, or TSH rises above 10 mIU/L, prioritizing psychiatric stability and leveraging supplementation rather than altering effective mood stabilizers when thyroid dysfunction is manageable [^1147cuNh] [^114LBMH9] [^1143To3o].

For lithium- or carbamazepine-induced hypothyroidism with TSH 6.38 mIU/L, **initiate levothyroxine if symptomatic, pregnant, or TSH > 10** [^1147cuNh]; otherwise, monitor TSH and free T4 every 3–6 months and treat if TSH rises or symptoms develop. Continue lithium if effective [^1143To3o] and add **levothyroxine** as needed; consider switching carbamazepine to a non–enzyme-inducing alternative if thyroid dysfunction persists or worsens [^115jueAj]. Reassess thyroid function after any medication changes [^117S8BsX], and monitor TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months long term [^1144GRtd].

---

## Clinical significance of TSH 6.38 mIU/L

A TSH of 6.38 mIU/L with normal free T4 indicates **subclinical hypothyroidism** [^114LBMH9] and may progress to overt hypothyroidism [^113vf5DZ], particularly with ongoing lithium or carbamazepine exposure [^1133QP7N]. Progression risk is higher with **elevated TSH**, **positive thyroid antibodies**, female sex, and older age [^1147cuNh] [^113vf5DZ].

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Repeat TSH and free T4 to confirm persistent elevation and exclude transient causes [^112tC9LZ] [^111HXJkK].
- **Assess symptoms**: Evaluate for fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and cognitive changes [^1147cuNh].
- **Monitor regularly**: Check TSH and free T4 every 3–6 months initially, then every 6–12 months once stable [^1144GRtd].

---

### Lithium-induced hypothyroidism

Lithium **increases hypothyroidism risk** [^117LHP6y] by inhibiting thyroid hormone synthesis and through autoimmune thyroiditis. Management includes:

- **Continue lithium**: Maintain if effective; add levothyroxine [^113yCqyy] as needed [^1143To3o].
- **Levothyroxine therapy**: Start if symptomatic, pregnant, or TSH > 10 mIU/L [^1147cuNh] [^111CspHm]; titrate to normalize TSH [^113yCqyy].
- **Monitor thyroid function**: Check TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months [^1144GRtd].

---

### Carbamazepine-induced hypothyroidism

Carbamazepine lowers thyroid hormones through hepatic enzyme induction [^116T4vze], typically causing **subclinical hypothyroidism**. Management includes:

- **Monitor thyroid function**: Regular TSH and free T4 checks [^1147cuNh].
- **Levothyroxine therapy**: Start if symptomatic, pregnant, or TSH > 10 mIU/L [^1147cuNh] [^116fQeE3].
- **Consider alternative medications**: Switch to non–enzyme-inducing agents (e.g. lamotrigine) if dysfunction persists or worsens [^115jueAj] [^116nxyfV].

---

## Specific management for TSH 6.38 mIU/L

For TSH 6.38 mIU/L, **management depends on symptoms, pregnancy status, and risk factors** [^1147cuNh]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic or pregnant | Initiate levothyroxine therapy [^116fQeE3] [^111CspHm] |
| - Asymptomatic <br/> - Non-pregnant | - Monitor TSH and free T4 every 3–6 months [^1144GRtd] <br/> - Initiate therapy if TSH rises or symptoms develop |
| Persistent elevation despite medication adjustment | Initiate levothyroxine therapy [^1147cuNh] |

---

## Reversibility of hypothyroidism

Lithium-induced hypothyroidism **often reverses** after discontinuation [^116mDdEz], though many patients require ongoing levothyroxine [^116fhAwE]. Carbamazepine-induced hypothyroidism typically resolves after stopping the drug [^116T4vze] [^111caVyo].

---

## Long-term monitoring and follow-up

Long-term monitoring should include **regular thyroid function tests** (TSH and free T4) every 6–12 months [^1144GRtd] [^117S8BsX]. Continue to assess symptoms and medication adherence, and **titrate levothyroxine to maintain a normal TSH** [^113yCqyy].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patient education should cover the risk of hypothyroidism with lithium [^1153N8Y2] and carbamazepine [^116T4vze] and emphasize adherence to medications and scheduled monitoring. Patients should also be taught to **recognize hypothyroid symptoms** and when to seek care [^1147cuNh].

---

Lithium- and carbamazepine-induced hypothyroidism with TSH 6.38 mIU/L is managed by confirming the diagnosis, assessing symptoms, and monitoring thyroid function [^1147cuNh]. Initiate **levothyroxine** if symptomatic, pregnant, or TSH > 10 mIU/L; otherwise, monitor and treat if TSH rises or symptoms develop.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, more specifically with respect to levothyroxine therapy (indications, abnormal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of levothyroxine in patients with serum TSH levels greater than 10 mIU/L, as these patients are at increased risk for heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular mortality.

- **Endocrine effects**: There is a strong link between lithium maintenance treatment and hypothyroidism, which is associated with an increased risk of affective episodes, rapid cycling, and more severe depression. Routine screening of thyroid function is recommended for all patients on lithium treatment. Since lithium can also cause hyperparathyroidism, routine monitoring for serum calcium is recommended, and if elevated, further investigations should be performed to evaluate for hyperparathyroidism. Hypothyroidism is ordinarily not an indication for lithium cessation in a patient with a good response; rather, thyroid supplementation is recommended.

	- New onset oligomenorrhea or hyperandrogenism is more common in divalproex users. While there are reports of an increased incidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in divalproex treatment, a recent meta-analysis did not support this. In those who develop PCOS on divalproex, there is evidence from a small sample that discontinuing divalproex results in remission of some of the aspects of PCOS.

	- Hyperprolactinaemia is common with some antipsychotics and can have short-term and long-term adverse effects. Risperidone, amisulpride, and paliperidone are more likely than other compounds to cause it. Hyperprolactinaemia can induce amenorrhea, sexual dysfunction, and galactorrhea, among other effects. In the long term, it can cause gynecomastia and osteoporosis. When such effects are seen, it may be advisable to reduce the dose or switch to a different medication.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, specifically concerning levothyroxine therapy, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering treatment initiation based on individual factors. This applies to patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L, particularly if they exhibit symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, test positive for anti-TPO antibodies, or show evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.

### Bipolar disorder: Assessment and management [^1144GRtd]. NICE (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of lithium toxicity, more specifically with respect to the laboratory monitoring of patients taking lithium, the NICE 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining urea and electrolytes, including calcium, eGFR, and thyroid function every six months. Monitoring should be more frequent if there is evidence of renal or thyroid impairment, raised calcium levels, or an increase in mood symptoms that might be related to impaired thyroid function.

### Optimizing therapy of seizures in patients with endocrine disorders [^115jueAj]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Endocrinologic disorders, such as thyroid dysfunction or diabetes, may be comorbidities in patients with epilepsy. The choice of medication should address such comorbidities wherever possible. Enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, barbiturates, and, among the new AEDs, oxcarbazepine, may reduce the levels of free and total thyroxin. However, clinically relevant thyroid dysfunction owing to AED treatment is rare.

Nevertheless, there are now better alternative AEDs with similar efficacy to the classic first-line drugs but without their enzyme-inducing properties. Such drugs should be considered in cases of thyroid dysfunction to reduce the likelihood of iatrogenic adverse effects. Sufficient data on some of the new AEDs to support this hypothesis are, however, still lacking and urgently needed.

Several reports have pointed out the possible negative impact of valproate on glucose and insulin metabolism and particularly on body weight. The increased risk for the development of polycystic ovarian syndrome remains a matter of debate but is certainly another argument for the development of alternative agents.

The group of new AEDs offers some potential candidates. Topiramate is the AED that is most likely to lead to weight loss, which may be perceived as a positive side effect in some patients. This review summarizes the data on the possible impact of AEDs in endocrinological disorders, concentrating on thyroid dysfunction, insulin/glucose metabolism, and body weight.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^115mkjvi]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism occurred in 7.5% of the sample (n = 1,850), and without bias correction, lithium appeared to have a higher risk for hypothyroidism than other therapies (Fig. 2A). The bias-uncorrected difference between lithium and other treatment alternatives was significant in all three tests (p < 0.05) for all therapies except quetiapine and carbamazepine (Supplementary Table 1).

The competing risk of ending monotherapy occurred in the majority of cases (73.1%, n = 17,954). Censored data were present in 19.4% of the sample, including 38 deaths (n = 4,770). Not all drugs had the same risk of ending monotherapy: olanzapine had the highest risk, whereas lamotrigine had the lowest.

Biases also existed in the number of thyroid tests administered per treatment group. Based on the moving average of the number of tests from the commencement of monotherapy by drug (Supplementary Fig. 1A), along with a linear fit calculating the slope (Supplementary Fig. 1B), it was estimated that patients on lithium were administered thyroid tests 2.26–3.05 times as often as patients on the other drugs. Lithium also had the highest pretreatment thyroid testing frequency, with patients on lithium being tested 2.2 times as often as those on the least tested therapy, lamotrigine (Supplementary Fig. 1A caption). A regression framework was employed to address these potential biases, along with pretreatment characteristics (Table 1).

### Carbamazepine drug effect simulating biochemical central hypothyroidism in a patient with Bardet-Biedl syndrome [^111caVyo]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a medication commonly used in epilepsy. It has been reported to cause decreases in free T4 levels, simulating central hypothyroidism, although the clinical significance remains unclear. We present a 24-year-old man with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) who was found to have isolated biochemical central hypothyroidism. BBS is a ciliopathy occasionally associated with anterior pituitary dysfunction. While taking CBZ for epilepsy, his TSH was 1.73 mIU/L (reference range: 0.20–4.00 mIU/L) with a low free T4 of 6.6 pmol/L (reference range: 10.0–26.0 pmol/L). A pituitary MRI was normal. Although he was initially treated with levothyroxine, his apparent biochemical central hypothyroidism was later recognized as secondary to the CBZ drug effect. This was confirmed with a normal free T4 of 12.2 pmol/L while he was off CBZ and levothyroxine. Despite the association between CBZ and biochemical central hypothyroidism, nearly all patients remain clinically euthyroid. This effect is reversible, and recognition could lead to reductions in unnecessary thyroid replacement therapy if CBZ is discontinued.

### Association between mood stabilizers and hypothyroidism in patients with bipolar disorders: a nested, matched case-control study [^1133QP7N]. Bipolar Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

This study investigated whether lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate increased the risk for hypothyroidism using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Dataset.

The sample included 557 bipolar disorder patients with incident hypothyroidism first diagnosed between 1998 and 2004, and 2,228 sex-, age-, and index date-matched bipolar disorder patients without hypothyroidism from 1996–2004. We compared the use of lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate before the onset of hypothyroidism between the two groups using a conditional logistical regression model.

Compared with patients who had never used any of the three mood stabilizers, patients were more likely to have hypothyroidism if they only used carbamazepine [odds ratio (OR) = 1.68; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07–2.65]; or comedication of lithium and valproate (OR = 2.40; 95% CI: 1.70–3.40), lithium and carbamazepine (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.10–2.08), and three mood stabilizers (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.68–3.25). There was a dose-response relationship between the number of mood stabilizers and risk for hypothyroidism (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.21–1.49) and a significant interaction between lithium and valproate on the risk for hypothyroidism (p = 0.020).

Our findings indicate that lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate may increase the risk for hypothyroidism, particularly if combined, and suggest regular monitoring of thyroid function and monotherapy of mood stabilizers for treating patients with bipolar disorders.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, specifically in relation to levothyroxine therapy (indications, normal TSH), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend initiating L-thyroxine in female patients of childbearing age who are planning a pregnancy in the immediate future (including assisted reproduction). It is also recommended for pregnant patients with serum TSH levels greater than 2.5 mIU/L, particularly when there are present or past positive levels of serum anti-TPO antibodies.

### Lithium [^1153P6vU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Dosage and administration**: Advise patients that lithium is a mood stabilizer and should only be taken as directed. Emphasize the importance of compliance with the prescribed treatment and not adjusting the dose of lithium without first consulting their healthcare provider. Inform patients that they will need to have regular blood draws to determine if their dose of lithium is appropriate. Instruct patients not to double the dose if a dose is missed due to the complexity of individualized dosing and the potential for lithium toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Lithium toxicity**: Inform patients of adverse reactions related to lithium toxicity that require medical attention. Advise patients to discontinue lithium treatment and contact their healthcare provider if clinical signs of lithium toxicity, such as diarrhea, vomiting, tremor, lack of muscle coordination, drowsiness, abnormal heart rhythm, or muscular weakness occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Lithium-induced polyuria**: Counsel patients on the adverse reactions related to lithium-induced polyuria, when to seek medical attention, and the importance of maintaining a normal diet with salt and staying hydrated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^116nxyfV]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism from competing risks regression was analyzed for timeframes of > 0, > 90, and > 182 days after commencing monotherapy. We present the cumulative incidence function of hypothyroidism from the average value of the covariates for a cohort of 24,574 bipolar disorder patients. In the analysis:

- **Initial cohort**: Includes all 24,574 patients.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Patients who experienced hypothyroidism, ended monotherapy, or were censored were subsequently excluded.

	- **0 days of monotherapy**: Estimated by resampling 10,000 times the competing risks regression predictions at the average values of the covariates. Model coefficients are set to random normal values defined by the regression model coefficient means and standard errors.

The mean four-year risks are detailed as follows:

- **Lithium**: 8.78%
- **Quetiapine**: 8.26%
- **Lamotrigine**: 7.06%
- **Valproate**: 7.02%
- **Aripiprazole**: 6.99%
- **Carbamazepine**: 6.73%
- **Risperidone**: 6.46%
- **Olanzapine**: 6.43%
- **Oxcarbazepine**: 6.32%

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^116mDdEz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The association between lithium and thyroid dysfunction has long been known, but it remains unknown if lithium-associated hypothyroidism is reversible once lithium treatment has been stopped.

- **Aims**: To determine whether lithium-associated hypothyroidism was reversible in patients who subsequently discontinued lithium.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Swedish region of Norrbotten to investigate the effects and side effects of lithium treatment and other drugs for relapse prevention (Lithium - Study into Effects and Side Effects). For this particular study, medical records from 1997 to 2015 of patients with lithium-associated hypothyroidism who had discontinued lithium were reviewed.

- **Results**: Of 1,340 patients screened, 90 were included. Of these, 27% had overt hypothyroidism at the start of thyroid replacement therapy. The mean delay from starting lithium to starting thyroid replacement therapy was 2.3 years (SD 4.7). In total, 50% of patients received thyroid replacement therapy within 10 months of starting lithium. Of 85 patients available for follow-up, 41% stopped thyroid replacement therapy after lithium discontinuation. Only six patients reinstated thyroid replacement therapy subsequently. Of these, only one had overt hypothyroidism.

- **Conclusions**: Lithium-associated hypothyroidism seems reversible in most patients once lithium has been discontinued. In such cases, discontinuation of thyroid replacement therapy could be attempted much more often than currently done. Based on the limited evidence of our study, we can expect hypothyroidism to recur ear…

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^117A1pfd]. Bipolar disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Although the analyses presented here diligently employed statistical methodologies to account for treatment biases and potential confounding factors, such studies face certain challenges. For example, the use of administrative claims data entails a retrospective study design in which patients were neither randomized to treatment nor examined directly during a defined observational period. Consequently, hypothyroidism could be underestimated if patient symptoms went unreported, or their provider did not perform thyroid testing.

Because the reported risk estimates are calculated at the average value of the covariates, including thyroid testing, which is low in our population, our risk estimates may be low. While every attempt was made to correct for thyroid testing observation bias with our CRR model, we recognize that we could not disentangle increased thyroid testing due to treatment guidelines from that due to symptoms of hypothyroidism. Nevertheless, even when we exclude the thyroid testing rank covariate, the lithium hypothyroidism risk estimate increases only modestly to 1.54 times the lowest risk therapy compared to a 1.39-fold range in the model that corrects for tests.

Nevertheless, our corroboration of not only lithium but also age and sex as known risk factors for hypothyroidism in patients with BD demonstrates that our population is representative of earlier studies of hypothyroidism in BD. Results presented here demonstrate a modest (statistically significant) effect of lithium on hypothyroidism in BD compared to alternate therapies.

### Abnormal thyroid function tests in psychiatric patients: a red herring [^113GukDR]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Thyroid abnormalities can induce mood, anxiety, psychotic, and cognitive disorders. Therefore, thyroid function tests are routinely checked in psychiatric patients. However, up to one-third of these patients may demonstrate abnormalities in their thyroid function tests that do not reflect true thyroid disease. Instead, these are often manifestations of secondary effects on one or more levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Originally termed the euthyroid sick syndrome, this phenomenon is now more commonly referred to as "non-thyroidal illness".

In psychiatric patients with non-thyroidal illness, patterns of thyroid function test abnormalities may vary considerably. Factors such as the underlying psychiatric disorder, the presence of substance abuse, or the use of certain psychiatric medications can influence these patterns. Therefore, any abnormal thyroid function tests in psychiatric patients should be viewed with skepticism. Given that the abnormalities seen in non-thyroidal illness usually resolve spontaneously, treatment is generally unnecessary and may even be potentially harmful.

### What should be done when thyroid function tests do not make sense [^111sz82J]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation of thyroid function tests (TFTs) is generally straightforward. However, in a minority of contexts, the results of thyroid hormone and thyrotropin measurements either conflict with the clinical picture or form an unusual pattern. In many such cases, reassessment of the clinical context provides an explanation for the discrepant TFTs. In other instances, interference in one or other laboratory assays can be shown to account for divergent results. Uncommonly, genetic defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are associated with anomalous TFTs. Failure to recognize these potential 'pitfalls' can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management.

Here, focusing particularly on the combination of hyperthyroxinaemia with nonsuppressed thyrotropin, we show how a structured approach to investigation can help make sense of atypical TFTs.

The medical management of hypothyroidism, particularly regarding levothyroxine therapy, encompasses indications and normal TSH levels. According to AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines, thyroid hormones should not be used for the treatment of obesity in euthyroid patients.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112tC9LZ]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypothyroidism, specifically in relation to thyroid hormone tests, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend measuring serum free T4. This can be done using the free T4 index or free T4 estimate, and through a direct immunoassay of free T4 without physical separation, utilizing anti-T4 antibodies, instead of measuring total T4 in the evaluation of hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid hormones in epileptic children receiving carbamazepine and valproic acid [^112e16yd]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Carbamazepine and valproic acid are effective antiepileptic drugs for treating many types of epilepsy. Although they are well tolerated, many effects on endocrine function have been reported. Changes in serum thyroid hormone levels in 37 children with epilepsy during carbamazepine and valproic acid therapy were analyzed, and the thyroid hormone concentration after the thyrotropin-releasing hormone test was evaluated. Serum thyroxine and free thyroxine levels were significantly lower in patients treated with carbamazepine and carbamazepine plus valproic acid than in the control subjects; serum thyroxine and free thyroxine concentrations were unaffected by valproic acid monotherapy. Serum triiodothyronine and free triiodothyronine concentrations were similar in the three groups of patients studied. Thyroid-stimulating hormone serum levels were normal in all patients, and the thyrotropin responses to the thyrotropin-releasing hormone were similar to the control group. Our data suggest that children treated with carbamazepine may have subclinical signs of hypothyroidism, and these changes are more evident if carbamazepine is given in association with valproic acid, while no alteration in thyroid hormones can be found with valproic acid monotherapy. Thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone levels do not seem to be affected by these drugs, suggesting that hypothalamic function is not affected in these children.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^113vf5DZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

In the general non-lithium-exposed population, the annual rate of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism lies between 2–6%. The risk of progression is higher in women and individuals with higher TSH concentrations; however, subclinical hypothyroidism can also revert to normal. In one-third of affected individuals, this occurs within 1 year, and in two-thirds, within 2 years. It is not known whether spontaneous recovery of thyroid function is slower in lithium-treated patients.

Although thyroid status and mood disorders have been associated, the relationship remains poorly understood and controversial. A large cohort study followed 7,323 middle-aged adults in South Korea without depression at the starting point and failed to find a significant association between subclinical hypothyroidism and incident depressive symptoms. Another study found that higher TSH concentrations increased the risk of manic relapse in patients with BPAD 1 disorder, whereas fT4 or fT3 concentrations did not increase that risk. Even if an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and mood disorders was confirmed, thyroid replacement therapy (TRT) might not necessarily improve affective symptoms. Meta-analytic evidence does not support the use of TRT in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and depressive symptoms, though TRT has been suggested to have some role as an augmentation treatment for resistant depression. The evidence, however, remains inconclusive.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^113qUVzT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Concomitant treatment with other drugs for relapse prevention or other psychotropic drugs could also affect the reversibility of hypothyroidism after lithium discontinuation. A large cohort of about 25,000 US patients with BPAD treated with mood stabilizers in monotherapy examined the cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism over a 4-year period. Hypothyroidism occurred in 7.5% of the sample. The 4-year cumulative risk was highest for lithium (8.8%) and quetiapine (8.3%). Some thyroid-inhibiting action has also been suggested for valproate, carbamazepine, drugs for depression, and phenothiazine-derived drugs.

In the six patients who subsequently reinstated TRT in our study, only one developed overt hypothyroidism. At the time of TRT reinstatement, this patient was only treated with zuclopenthixol, a drug not usually associated with hypothyroidism. In another patient, TRT was restarted much later postpartum. For the other four patients, thyroid status was normal, subclinical, or not available at the time of TRT reinstatement. In these four patients, other concomitantly given drugs for relapse prevention did not seem to affect thyroid function substantially. Yet, although lithium-associated hypothyroidism seems reversible in the majority of patients who discontinue lithium, concomitant medication with other drugs for relapse prevention or other psychotropic drugs may still affect thyroid function. Currently, our knowledge regarding such interactions remains limited.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, specifically concerning thyroid replacement therapy, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend initiating levothyroxine therapy in congenital and severe forms of central hypothyroidism (such as TSHβ mutations) as soon as possible. Optimally, this should occur within two weeks after birth at doses typically used for primary congenital hypothyroidism to quickly restore serum free T4 levels to the normal range and ensure optimal treatment as swiftly as possible.

### Isolated central hypothyroidism: Underlying pathophysiology and relation to antidepressant and antipsychotic medications-a multi-centre South Wales study [^111HqCWM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Low credibility.

Isolated biochemical central hypothyroidism is a presentation we are experiencing more frequently as endocrinologists, with variation in levels of investigation between physicians. We conducted research to investigate the final diagnosis and clinical outcome of patients across multiple hospitals in South Wales with biochemical isolated central hypothyroidism; namely, to establish whether this isolated biochemical picture was clinically significant. We also analyzed whether there is an association between this biochemical picture and treatment with antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, and how common this is.

- **Design**: We performed a retrospective observational study of patients across nine different hospitals in South Wales. We analyzed patients referred to endocrinology at each site over a 6-year period with unexplained isolated biochemical central hypothyroidism.

- **Materials and methodology**: 1022 individual patients' thyroid function test results were identified from our biochemical database using our inclusion criteria. After exclusion criteria were applied, 71 patients' results were analyzed as to the final pathophysiology of their central hypothyroidism.

- **Result**: Of the 71 patients included in the study, none were found to have any clinically significant pathology on pituitary imaging. On reviewing their medications, 46/71 (65%) were found to be taking psychotropic medications.

- **Conclusions**: Our study strongly suggests isolated central hypothyroidism, in the absence of other pituitary hormone dysfunction or visual field defect, does not require further investigation.

### Lithium therapy: an unusual cause of elevated and diffuse radioactive iodine uptake [^112jejYe]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Lithium carbonate, a widely used treatment for bipolar disorders, is associated with goiter, hypothyroidism, and thyrotoxicosis. However, the effect of lithium to increase radioactive iodine uptake has received little attention, thus making lithium a confounding factor in the interpretation of thyroid radionuclide studies. We herein report a case of misinterpreted high radioactive iodine uptake in a euthyroid, lithium-treated goitrous patient. We conclude that lithium therapy should be considered in the etiologic diagnoses of patients with goiter and homogeneously elevated radioiodine uptake. It is pertinent to recognize this phenomenon in order to prevent unwarranted treatment with radioactive iodine or thionamides.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^116fhAwE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The decision of whether to stop TRT after discontinuing lithium remains clinically challenging. If TRT was continued but lithium-associated hypothyroidism was reversible, patients would receive unnecessary treatment. If TRT was stopped but lithium-associated hypothyroidism was not reversible, patients might run the risk of hypothyroidism and a deterioration of mental health.

- **Reversibility of lithium-associated hypothyroidism**: Our study suggests lithium-associated hypothyroidism is reversible in the majority of patients who discontinue lithium. In our study, 41% of 85 patients available for follow-up stopped TRT after discontinuing lithium treatment. Only 17% subsequently restarted TRT. Just one patient had overt hypothyroidism at the time of TRT reinstatement. In this patient, TRT had been stopped two days after lithium discontinuation and reinstated 11 days later. Most likely, this was too short a time interval for the thyroid gland to recover. One patient restarted TRT postpartum. In this patient, the time between stopping TRT and reinstatement exceeded 4 years; TRT reinstatement may have been more likely due to postpartum thyroiditis than permanent lithium-associated damage to the thyroid gland. In the other four patients, judging on TFT alone, it remains unclear whether TRT reinstatement was really necessary.

In 1972, Brandrup published the case of a woman who developed a goitre and difficulties swallowing within half a month of starting lithium. Her serum T4 concentration was 11 nmol/L (normal range 66–139 nmol/L). Her protein-bound iodine (PBI)…

### Prevalence and risk factors of subclinical hypothyroidism in young and middle-aged patients with first-episode drug-naïve major depressive disorder [^116XhSei]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Low credibility.

Furthermore, clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular risk and the ability to perform activities of daily living were associated with thyroid dysfunction in younger age groups. These associations were not replicated in older adults. Although the increased prevalence of hypothyroidism in older adults is accompanied by higher rates of physical and cognitive impairment, depression, and cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism may have a protective effect on the health of older adults. The overall impact of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) on older adults varies, and individualized treatment and long-term monitoring are appropriate strategies.

Although several cohort studies have evaluated the association between SCH and depression, most of these studies have focused on the elderly population, with little evidence of an association between SCH and depression in middle-aged and younger adults. In addition, older adults have complex somatic disorders that may include multiple somatic ailments and perhaps too many confounding factors. Despite the well-characterized age-related changes in thyroid function, normal TSH reference limits derived for specific age groups are not routinely used to identify thyroid dysfunction in older adults. Hence, this study included younger and middle-aged adults for comparative studies.

Early and routine screening for depression is vital in preventing morbidity and mortality. Studies have shown that growth inhibitors and serotonin affect the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis, which links hypothyroidism to depression. SCH has a negative effect on this association.

### Commentary on a recent review of lithium toxicity: what are its implications for clinical practice [^114zpfHe]? BMC medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Below, we discuss several specific issues that need to be considered critically.

1. Practicing clinicians are primarily interested in the potential AEs experienced by properly treated patients, that is, patients who are correctly selected for long-term lithium treatment, are maintained on a minimum effective dosage, and are regularly monitored and managed. In this context, lithium treatment generates AEs in a relatively small proportion of patients. However, the reports included in the meta-analysis unavoidably included numerous patients with bipolar spectrum disorders for whom lithium treatment was not the optimal treatment choice, and who were treated by physicians with insufficient experience in lithium treatment. Hence, an important aspect of future work would be to compare the rates of side-effects in specialized programs as opposed to general psychiatric practice.

2. Sufficient information about dosage and serum levels of lithium could not be taken into account although the authors made efforts to exclude patients with pre-existing lithium intoxication. Many side-effects, including endocrine and metabolic effects are dose-dependent, and therefore can often be controlled by proper dose titration. Details on patient compliance and the time intervals between lithium plasma levels and AEs would have been important background information, and their absence raises questions about the validity of the data and the statistical processing. This criticism was also raised by Malhi and Berk in the same issue of the journal. As clinicians, we often come across referred patients w

### Evaluation of thyroid function monitoring in people treated with lithium: Advice based on real-world data [^1164uikN]. Bipolar disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Blood test monitoring is essential for the management of lithium treatment and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance recommends 6-monthly serum testing of thyroid function. We examined conformity to these guidelines and the impact of monitoring outside these intervals.

Methods

We extracted serum lithium and thyroid hormone results at one centre between January 2009 and December 2020. We identified 266 patients who started lithium during this period with no history of thyroid abnormality within the previous 2years and were at risk of developing thyroid abnormalities. We examined the interval between tests, time between onset of lithium testing and first thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) outside the laboratory reference range and assessed impact of testing outside recommended 6-monthly intervals.

Results

The most common testing frequency was 3 months (± 1 month), accounting for 17.3% of test intervals. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that most thyroid dysfunction manifests within 3years (proportion with abnormal TSH at 3years = 91.4%, 19.9% of total patients). In the first 3months after commencing lithium therapy, eight patients developed subclinical hypothyroidism and had clinical follow-up data available. Of these, half spontaneously normalized without clinical intervention. In the remaining patients, thyroxine replacement was only initiated after multiple occasions of subclinical hypothyroidism (median = 2years after initiating lithium, range: 6 months to 3years).

Conclusion

The peak interval at 3 months suggests that thyroid function i

### Are we restoring thyroid hormone signaling in levothyroxine-treated patients with residual symptoms of hypothyroidism [^111jJi9V]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) at doses that maintain serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels within the normal range constitutes the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism. After a few months, this eliminates the signs and symptoms of overt hypothyroidism in the majority of patients, owing to the endogenous activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, the biologically active thyroid hormone. Still, a small percentage of patients (10%-20%) exhibit residual symptoms, despite having normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These symptoms include cognitive, mood, and metabolic deficits, with a significant impairment in psychological well-being and quality of life.

- **Objective**: To provide a summary of progress in the approach of patients with hypothyroidism that exhibit residual symptoms despite treatment.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature and focused on the mechanisms leading to a deficiency of T3 in some LT4-treated patients, the role of residual thyroid tissue, and the rationale for combination therapy with LT4 + liothyronine (LT3).

- **Results**: A score of clinical trials comparing therapy with LT4 versus LT4 + LT3 concluded that both are safe and equally effective (neither is superior); however, these trials failed to recruit a sufficiently large number of patients with residual symptoms. New clinical trials that considered LT4-treated symptomatic patients revealed that such patients benefit from and prefer therapy containing LT4 + LT3; desiccated thyroid extract has also been used with similar results. A practical approach to.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^115dLJ5C]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The inclusion criteria were two or more diagnoses of bipolar disorder (BD) at any time in the patient history, age at the start of treatment ≥ 18 years, a minimum of one year without prior drug treatment for BD and no hypothyroid diagnosis or treatment. Patients were followed by monotherapy for BD and had at least one thyroid test during monotherapy. Results are contrasted with cohort subsets on 3+ (n = 15,430) and 6+ (n = 10,594) months of monotherapy to account for patients with pre-existing cases of hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly after treatment.

- **Exposure**: Nine monotherapeutic exposures were considered: lithium carbonate (RxNorm ingredient: 42351), aripiprazole (89013), carbamazepine (2002), lamotrigine (28439), olanzapine (61381), oxcarbazepine (32624), quetiapine (51272), risperidone (35636), and valproate (40254). We required that drug exposures had no gaps of 30 days or longer to increase the likelihood that prescriptions were not only filled, but also continuously taken by the patients [36, 37].

- **Time of follow-up**: The duration of observation ranged from 1 day to 3,255 days (8.9 years), with a mean of 269 days and a median of 142 days. We report results up to four years from the start of monotherapy due to the paucity of longer-term observations.

- **Main outcome measures**: The outcome was the cumulative incidence of clinically relevant hypothyroidism, as indicated by diagnosis codes (SNOMED: 40930008 and descendants) and filled hypothyroidism prescriptions: thyroxine (RxNorm: 10582 and descendants), desiccated thyroid (10572), triiodothyronine (10814), and thyroglobulin (10565).

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^113CQiSD]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Thyroid abnormalities occur frequently in patients with bipolar disorder regardless of treatment. Therefore, patients should be regularly tested for clinical or subclinical thyroid abnormalities across all therapies and treated accordingly to prevent adverse effects of hormone imbalances on mood. Since hypothyroidism occurs under all treatments, more emphasis should be placed on understanding the role of thyroid disorders in bipolar disorder. Future research should investigate the risk of hypothyroidism in untreated patients and those receiving polypharmacy.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^114dxSH9]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The study examines covariate selection and regression results in the context of hypothyroidism risk. Being male (p = 3.93e‐7) and having a thyroid test in the 14 days preceding monotherapy (p = 2.69e‐7) were associated with fewer diagnoses of hypothyroidism. Conversely, the risk of hypothyroidism diagnoses increased with age at exposure (p = 6.91e‐10), the frequency of thyroid testing during monotherapy (p = 2.79e‐87), and the presence of pretreatment thyroid disorders other than hypothyroidism (p = 6.37e‐6). Except for pretreatment thyroid disorders, these variables remained significant in subcohorts with more than 90 and 182 days of monotherapy.

All other covariates were not significant after multiple testing adjustment (p > 1.67E‐3) when included in the model. Using a Wald test, the combined significance of non-lithium treatment was p = 3.86e‐3, p = 6.22e‐3, and p = 3.61e‐3 at more than 0, 90, and 182 days, respectively. Adjusted for covariates, lithium exhibited the highest risk for more than 0 days of monotherapy, closely followed by quetiapine. When the patient population was restricted to more than 90 days of exposure, lithium showed non-significant improvement over quetiapine (p = 0.506).

The resampled four-year cumulative risk of hypothyroidism ranged from 8.8% for lithium down to 6.3% for oxcarbazepine, and the 95% confidence limits for the lithium cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) overlapped with those of all other drugs. Adjusted for covariates, the competing risk of ending monotherapy remained biased. Notably, lamotrigine had a significantly lower risk of ending monotherapy (p = 1.89e‐55) than alternative therapies, likely due to the longer time of re-exposure.

### Female vulnerability for thyroid function abnormality in bipolar disorder: role of lithium treatment [^113aFZFC]. Bipolar Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Previous studies have provided evidence of subtle thyroid hormone metabolism abnormalities in patients with mood disorders. Although these studies are informative, the precise role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in bipolar disorder, especially in women, remains unclear. We sought to further corroborate thyroid function in patients with bipolar disorder in comparison to patients with other psychiatric, as well as non-psychiatric, diagnoses.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective, cross-sectional, naturalistic study, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in a total sample of 3,204 patients were compared. The study sample included patients with bipolar disorder (n = 469), unipolar depression (n = 615), other psychiatric diagnoses (n = 999), patients from endocrinology clinics (n = 645), and patients from dermatology clinics (n = 476). Analyses were completed using two different normal ranges for TSH: a high normal range (0.4–5.0 μIU/mL) and a low normal range (0.3–3.0 μIU/mL).

- **Results**: Patients with bipolar disorder showed significantly higher serum TSH levels compared to all other groups. In women, the rate of above normal range TSH was highest in patients with bipolar disorder for both high (5.0 μIU/mL; 12.1%) and low (3.0 μIU/mL; 30.4%) upper normal limits. In patients with bipolar disorder, serum TSH levels did not differ significantly between different mood states. In the lithium-treated patients (n = 240), a significantly lower percentage of women (55.9%) compared to men (71.2%) fell within the 0.3–3.0 μIU/mL normal TSH window (p = 0.016).

### A cross-sectional and a prospective study of thyroid disorders in lithium-treated patients [^113vACo4]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The effects of lithium treatment on the thyroid gland have been demonstrated in a number of studies. Most of this research is based on cross-sectional studies, and prospective studies are required to confirm these observations.

- **Method**: During our genetic association studies, we recruited 115 males and 159 females suffering from affective disorders who had received lithium treatment. We observed longitudinally 57 of these patients, who attended our clinic for between 1 and 7 years and had no thyroid abnormalities at baseline. We performed regular checks of thyroid antibodies, thyroid function tests, and lithium levels.

- **Results**: Hypo- and hyperthyroidism, including cases that developed prior to lithium treatment, were more common in women (25.8%) than in men (8.7%) and increased with age. By the age of 65, the risk in women increased to 50%. Hypothyroidism was induced by lithium in 17% of women. In the prospective study, 4 out of 33 women developed hypothyroidism, an incidence of 27.4 cases per 1000 years. One woman developed thyrotoxicosis.

- **Conclusions**: The risk for hypothyroidism induced by lithium is especially increased in women over the age of 50. Women should be warned of the risks involved when offered lithium treatment. The frequency of lithium-induced thyrotoxicosis is very low.

### Elevated thyrotropin in bipolar youths prescribed both lithium and divalproex sodium [^1138TXZZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

To examine the effect of combined lithium and divalproex sodium on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in children and adolescents with bipolar disorders, and to identify risk factors for lithium-induced hypothyroidism, a study was conducted.

Bipolar youths aged 5 to 17 years participated in an open-label clinical trial receiving treatment with lithium and divalproex sodium for up to 20 weeks. TSH levels were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Subjects were divided into two groups for analysis: group 1 had TSH levels of less than 10.0 mU/L at the end of the study, and group 2 had TSH levels of 10.0 mU/L or more at the end of the study.

Twenty out of the 82 subjects (24.4%) showed TSH elevations of at least 10 mU/L within an average exposure of less than 3 months. The mean baseline TSH level for group 2 was significantly higher than for group 1 (2.97 [SD = 1.48] vs. 2.05 [SD = 0.89], p < 0.05). Mean lithium levels at the end of the study were 1.00 mEq/L for group 2 compared to 0.76 mEq/L for group 1 (t = -2.41, p = .019).

Lithium is associated with significant rates of thyrotropin elevation in bipolar youths. Factors associated with elevation in TSH in lithium-treated subjects include a higher baseline TSH level and a higher lithium level. Close monitoring of thyroid function in children and adolescents taking lithium is recommended.

### 2018 European thyroid association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^115GhaAE]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for central hypothyroidism, specifically with respect to thyroid function tests, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend considering supporting the diagnosis of mild central hypothyroidism (CeH), characterized by borderline low free T4 with inappropriately low TSH, through a combination of several other findings, such as:

- **Evidence of CeH in first-degree relatives**: This suggests a familial pattern that can be crucial for diagnosis.

- **Delayed growth, macroorchidism, hearing loss, and other signs of hypothyroidism**: These clinical features may indicate CeH.

- **Causative mutations in CeH candidate genes**: Genetic testing may reveal mutations that support the diagnosis.

- **Insufficiency of other pituitary hormone secretion**: This can point to a broader pituitary dysfunction, which is consistent with CeH.

- **Blunted (< 4 mU/L) or delayed (peak after 60 minutes) TSH responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (200 mcg IV)**: These test results can validate the diagnosis.

- **Blunted nocturnal TSH surge**: This abnormal rhythm in TSH secretion can be indicative.

- **Low TSH index**: A lower-than-expected index supports the CeH diagnosis.

- **Otherwise unexplained alterations in variables of thyroid hormone action**: Such as high cholesterol, bradycardia, low body temperature, and specific echocardiographic findings. These metabolic and functional changes can be significant indicators of underlying CeH.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^111NWY7S]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Role of anti-thyroid antibodies**: Conducted a comprehensive literature review and report of 14 cases. Mood disorders and circulating thyroid antibodies were 'very prevalent' in the general population; however, they might have concurred by chance. Yet, based on the evidence, the authors proposed thyroid antibodies were of relevance in bipolar spectrum disorders. Antibodies were not systematically available in our study; thus, we could not assess thyroid antibodies as a predictor of the reversibility of thyroid status. In one prospective study, the occurrence of thyroid antibodies in lithium-treated patients predicted the subsequent need for TRT. In another prospective study, there was no association between lithium treatment and thyroid autoimmunity. The presence of antibodies is unlikely to affect the decision of whether to start lithium. Hypothyroidism is an adverse effect that can easily be managed clinically. BPAD, in contrast, is a severe psychiatric condition that requires maintenance treatment to prevent suicide and relapse. As the thyroid function is monitored anyway, the incremental costs of routine thyroid antibodies testing may outweigh the gains.

- **Time between lithium and TRT start**: In our study, 50% started TRT within 10 months, 75% within 2.5 years, and 90% within 5.5 years. We found the time interval between lithium and TRT start was significantly longer in older patients. Our results are comparable to the findings of another study exploring the time interval between lithium start and diagnosis of hypothyroidism. This study compared thyroid status in 79 lithium an

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: A clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was prompted by a recent systematic review of randomized controlled trials, which could alter current practice.

- **Guidelines**: Tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against using thyroid hormones in adults with SCH, characterized by elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels. This does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L, and may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

- **How this guideline was created**: A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

- **The evidence**: The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index, representing moderate to high-quality evidence. Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality, with evidence of lower quality, but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^115JJufc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

A randomized crossover study investigated the impact of lithium discontinuation in 14 euthyroid patients with TSH and fT4 in the reference interval. The patients with BPAD had been on lithium for an average of 9.8 years. After stopping lithium, TSH decreased and fT4 increased significantly during the 4-week study period.

Possibly, the BPAD itself could also constitute a risk factor for hypothyroidism, which could increase the risk of recurrence of hypothyroidism after stopping TRT. In our study, patients acted as their own controls, before and after lithium discontinuation, making it unlikely that the underlying BPAD affected the reversibility of hypothyroidism after lithium discontinuation. The emergence of lithium-induced hypothyroidism during the initial period of lithium therapy may point towards a genetic susceptibility. This could increase the risk of recurrence of hypothyroidism in patients stopping TRT after stopping lithium.

- **Genetic factors**: Genes have been identified that modify thyroid function directly, the TSH receptor, or immune regulation. However, they may only account for a small proportion of hypothyroidism. At present, our understanding of genetic factors remains limited.

- **Family history**: Family history of thyroid dysfunction in patients treated with lithium is rarely explored in scientific studies. One cross-sectional study found a positive association between family history and clinical hypothyroidism. In our study, information on family history of thyroid dysfunction was mostly absent in the medical records. Clinicians should be encouraged to record a family history of thyroid dysfunction.

### Thyroid echogenicity in manic-depressive patients receiving lithium therapy [^117S8jCJ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Lithium is known to induce subclinical or overt hypothyroidism and changes in thyroid volume in manic-depressive patients. However, little is known about alterations in thyroid echogenicity due to drug-induced dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Twenty manic-depressive patients receiving lithium therapy for at least six months, and 20 euthyroid volunteers without any antidepressant medication as a control group, matched in age and gender, were investigated. Laboratory measurements and thyroid ultrasonography, including standardized grey scale analyses in representative regions of interest (ROI), were conducted.

- **Results**: Thyroid function was normal in all patients (mean FT4 1.1 ± 0.2 ng/dl, mean TSH 1.6 ± 0.9 micro U/ml) and controls (mean FT4 1.5 ± 0.4 ng/dl, TSH 1.1 ± 0.3 micro U/ml). Except for two patients, no thyroid autoantibody levels could be detected. Thyroid volumetry revealed significantly higher mean values for the lithium-treated patients (16.9 ± 11.9 ml) compared to the controls (11.4 ± 4.5 ml, P < 0.05) with a considerable number of goiters (six patients vs. one control). Thyroid echogenicities in both groups were similar (patients 23.9 ± 3.7 grey scales, Grauwerteinheiten = GWE, controls 24.2 ± 1.3 GWE) and did not depend on the size of the organs.

- **Conclusion**: Lithium treatment contributes to increased thyroid volumes, probably due to inhibition of thyroid function and TSH upregulation, but not to changes in thyroid echo levels in patients with still euthyroid function. Further echogenicity studies on patients with lithium-induced overt hypothyroidism and autoimmune activity will be of importance.

### Lithium [^117S8BsX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concurrent medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**: Dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years) should be consulted. Obtain a serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose, and continue regular assessments until the patient is stabilized. During initial therapy for the acute manic phase, fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur and persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. Each 5 mL of lithium oral solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), which is equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate.

- **Serum lithium monitoring**: Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone.

### Thyrotoxicosis after complete or partial lithium withdrawal in two patients with bipolar affective disorder [^116UPbie]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To highlight and discuss thyrotoxicosis after lithium withdrawal as a potential complication of lithium therapy for bipolar disorder.

- **Case reports**: Both patients developed thyrotoxicosis, with the first patient experiencing it after stopping lithium completely and the second patient following a reduction in the lithium dose.

- **Conclusions**: Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of thyrotoxicosis emerging when lithium is being completely or partially withdrawn. Such withdrawal could unmask a latent hyperthyroidism.

### Lithium carbonate [^115zwJ5V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concomitant medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**: Dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years) should be followed. After 3 days, obtain a serum lithium concentration assay, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose and regularly until the patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. Each 5 mL of lithium oral solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), which is equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate.

### Liothyronine sodium [^1138xhzv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

- **Adults**: In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond, or if the patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

- **Pediatrics**: In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients.

### Central hypothyroidism with oxcarbazepine therapy [^116U8tYa]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in thyroid function with the use of several antiepileptic medications are thought to result from increased metabolism of thyroid hormone and interference with the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Oxcarbazepine was developed to attempt to reduce the side effects typically observed with antiepileptic drugs that induce the hepatic enzyme system. Increased metabolism of thyroid hormone should not occur in patients on oxcarbazepine, as the hepatic enzyme system has minimal involvement in the metabolism of this medication. This report describes three patients who developed central hypothyroidism associated with oxcarbazepine treatment, suggesting that oxcarbazepine interferes with the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^113vCjEn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

The date of the electronic prescription when lithium was started or discontinued was manually validated in the medical records for all patients. This way, we established the total time of lithium exposure. At this point, the psychiatric diagnosis at initiation of lithium treatment was excerpted. Equally, we validated the accuracy of the start and stop date of TRT in the medical records. If no specific date for discontinuation could be established, for example, if a patient stopped treatment without notifying health care personnel, we estimated the stop date from the doctors' notes.

- **Chart review and analysis**: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all eligible patients from 1997 to 31 December 2015. We additionally checked for lithium, TRT, and TFT in medical records dating back to 1965 to ensure we had not missed any previous treatment periods. We followed the clinical course of lithium-associated hypothyroidism and its treatment according to a predefined process flow chart (Figure 1).

- **Outcome parameters**: We mapped the clinical course with the following parameters, which we then stratified further by age and sex: (a) time from lithium start to TRT start, (b) TSH and fT4 levels at which TRT was initiated, (c) proportion of patients who had discontinued TRT having stopped lithium, (d) time from stopping lithium to stopping TRT, and (e) proportion of patients requiring reinstatement of TRT.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^111DKEeK]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Consistent with our findings, among atypical antipsychotics, evidence of increased hypothyroidism risk has also accumulated for quetiapine. However, not all studies agreed. In some studies, only changes in T4 were noticed, and not in TSH, and in other studies the hormone changes were transient, returning to normal after only 6 weeks of treatment without discontinuation of quetiapine. A large, longitudinal, double-blind clinical trial showed that a combination therapy of quetiapine plus lithium or divalproex had significantly increased hypothyroidism (p = 6.96e‐4) over placebo plus lithium or divalproex. Two cases of hypothyroidism with combination quetiapine and valproate were also reported in a Korean study. In 2013, FDA product labeling added a recommendation for thyroid hormone testing at baseline and at follow-up for quetiapine.

For olanzapine, we could find little information about thyroid effects, and for risperidone and aripiprazole, studies concluded that thyroid abnormalities did not occur with treatment, despite some case reports. FDA labeling also makes no mention of thyroid issues for these three drugs.

Our study suggests that the relative perception of risk for lithium is overestimated by observation bias: lithium-treated patients received thyroid tests more than twice as frequently as those on other therapies. Moreover, despite the link between hypothyroidism and BD, only 40% of patients received a thyroid test in the year before or during monotherapy. According to our study, hypothyroidism.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^115YGgG2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Of the 35 patients who stopped TRT, we identified six who reinstated TRT within the available follow-up period. The mean time to reinstatement was 1.8 years (SD 1.8), with a range from 11 days to 4.5 years. All six patients were female. One female patient, with subclinical hypothyroidism, developed overt hypothyroidism within 11 days after TRT was stopped. This patient was treated with lithium alone before it was discontinued and then with zuclopenthixol. In another case, TRT was restarted for a woman after childbirth based on elevated TSH, which was still below 10 IU/mL. For the remaining four patients, thyroid status was normal, subclinical, or not recorded at the time of TRT reinstatement. Of these, two patients had concomitant treatment with quetiapine, and one patient had concomitant treatment with valproate, both at the point of lithium discontinuation and at the point of TRT reinstatement.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^113MwV5d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

This study uniquely investigates the potential reversibility of hypothyroidism after lithium discontinuation. It is observational, reflecting real-life clinical practice, and due to its retrospective nature, did not influence treatment decisions for the studied subjects. An in-depth analysis of clinical data over a 19-year period was conducted on a large sample of patients exposed to lithium, with a participation rate of 75%. Psychiatric diagnoses were validated for all included patients. Access to both prescription and laboratory data enabled verification of prescription adherence, while cross-specialty laboratory data permitted thyroid function follow-up. Furthermore, access to original medical records allowed us to determine whether thyroid replacement therapy (TRT) was causally related to lithium exposure or merely associated, eliminating association bias inherent in register studies or studies limited to laboratory and prescription data alone.

In 60% of patients, TRT continued despite the discontinuation of lithium. It is possible that in many cases, thyroid function could have recovered without continuing TRT, although this possibility was not assessable in this study. Consequently, the study may underestimate the likelihood of reversibility. Bias can occur when participants systematically differ from non-participants, but such selection bias was controlled for in the entire LiSIE study. However, the starting dates for TRT were not always clearly documented, nor were the reasons for initiating or restarting therapy.

### Lithium-associated hypothyroidism and potential for reversibility after lithium discontinuation: Findings from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study [^114PA8E6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Lithium remains a first-line maintenance treatment for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). Several large cohort studies have suggested that lithium is most effective for the prevention of suicide, self-harm, and acute affective episodes. Lithium may even reduce the need for hospital admissions.

Lithium has also been proposed as a possible augmentation treatment for refractory depression. Yet, despite its therapeutic utility, lithium is not without adverse effects. Concerning endocrine adverse effects, the association between lithium and thyroid dysfunction has long been known. Historically, the first two cases of lithium-associated hypothyroidism were reported. An even earlier report pertained to lithium-associated euthyroid goitre, which was reversible once lithium was discontinued. A later study, however, did not show any correlation between goitre and thyroid function in lithium-treated patients with BPAD. Further cases of thyroid dysfunction associated with lithium were published, leading to speculations that myxoedema was a possible side effect of lithium treatment. In the following decades, more evidence emerged, firmly establishing an association of lithium treatment with both subclinical and overt hypothyroidism. Prevalence estimates of lithium-associated thyroid dysfunction range from 14–17% for overt and from 19–35% for subclinical hypothyroidism. One study in patients aged ⩾65 years reported a prevalence of 24% for overt hyperthyroidism. Currently, it remains unknown if lithium-associated hypothyroidism is reversible.

### Lithium-associated thyroiditis [^117V8xEm]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

To report an unusual case of thyrotoxicosis caused by "silent thyroiditis" in a lithium-treated patient and to summarize all prior case reports of lithium-associated thyroiditis, we compared them with our case.

- **Methods**: In addition to reporting our case, we undertook a MEDLINE search of all case reports of lithium-associated thyroiditis from 1978 until the present. All reported cases of lithium-associated thyroiditis must have had documented low thyroid radioiodine uptake to be included.

- **Results**: A 52-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder, who had been treated with lithium carbonate for 15 years, was admitted because of delusional mania. Although he had discontinued his lithium therapy 3 months before admission, he had noted symptoms of hyperthyroidism at least 1 month before admission. He was diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis due to silent thyroiditis, based on a high free thyroxine level, suppressed thyrotropin level, and low thyroid radioiodine uptake. We found only 10 other case reports of lithium-associated thyrotoxicosis due to silent thyroiditis.

- **Conclusion**: Thyrotoxicosis caused by silent thyroiditis may be associated with lithium therapy and is likely to be underreported. The pathogenic mechanism for such cases of thyroiditis is still unclear.

### Hypothyroidism risk compared among nine common bipolar disorder therapies in a large US cohort [^112kwiXT]. Bipolar Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The study examined several covariates for their effect on the cumulative incidence function (CIF):

- **Treatment**: Using lithium as the reference, binary dummy variables were created for the non-lithium treatments.

- **Age at treatment**: This accounts for the higher risk of hypothyroidism among older patients.

- **Sex**: This accounts for the higher risk of hypothyroidism among female patients.

- **Patient visit days in the year preceding monotherapy**: This serves as a proxy for engagement with the health care system before monotherapy.

- **Thyroid testing within 14 days preceding monotherapy**: This accounts for observation bias. Patients who tested positive for hypothyroidism were excluded, as patients receiving lithium are more likely to be tested pretreatment than those receiving other therapies.

- **Nonparametric thyroid testing rank during monotherapy**: This is used to adjust for observation bias. Hypothyroidism should not be diagnosed without a thyroid test, and not all treatments have comparable thyroid testing. The following SNOMED-CT procedure concepts and their descendants were used to count thyroid tests: thyroid-stimulating hormone measurement (61167004), thyroid hormone measurement (390780008), thyrotropin-releasing hormone test (252219000), thyroid panel (35650009), and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins measurement (104972000).

To account for different observation times, covariates were calculated by finding the competition rank of a patient's number of thyroid tests among the smallest time interval centered around the patient's treatment time that included at least 50 patients, then normalizing it accordingly.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^114PyJnP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Measurement of circulating free thyroid hormones (THs) (thyroxine, T4; triiodothyronine, T3) and thyrotropin (TSH) using immunoassays is an essential step when assessing thyroid status. This produces characteristic patterns of thyroid function tests (TFTs) that correlate with classical thyrotoxicosis (raised THs, suppressed TSH) and hypothyroidism (raised TSH, subnormal THs), or deviate to generate anomalous or discordant TFTs due to different underlying causes.

- **Investigation approach**: Here, we describe our approach to the investigation of patients with different patterns of biochemical hyperthyroidism: isolated, elevated free T4 (FT4) [hyperthyroxinemia]; isolated, raised free T3 (FT3) [hypertriiodothyroninemia]; combined elevation of FT4 and FT3 with nonsuppressed TSH.

- **Assay interference**: We review different categories of assay interference (e.g. due to abnormal TH binding proteins, hormone displacement from binding proteins, antihormone (iodothyronines, TSH) or anti-assay reagent antibodies, biotin) causing spuriously abnormal hormone measurements.

- **Physiological, pathological, and drug treatment contexts**: We consider some physiological (e.g. T4 replacement), pathological (e.g. nonthyroidal or acute psychiatric illness), and drug treatment (e.g. amiodarone) contexts that are associated with this biochemical pattern, with other entities, outside the scope of this review, being discussed elsewhere.

- **Genetic or acquired conditions**: We outline genetic or acquired conditions that are associated with genuine hyperthyroxinemia (e.g. genetic or functional deficiency of deiodinase enzymes), hypertriiodothyroninemia (dyshormonogenesis, resistance to thyroid hormone α, monocarboxylate transporter 8 [MCT8] deficiency).

### Thyroid hormone levels in patients with bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113gvTRn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

The study characteristics and quality assessment involved a detailed characterization of the study population. Among the 21 studies reviewed, all but one prospective cohort study and five case-control studies were cross-sectional. Study sites included India, France, Egypt, Poland, Canada, America, and China, with 17 articles in English and 4 in Chinese. The sample sizes ranged from 16 to 828, with a total of 3,696 participants across all studies. Out of the 2,942 bipolar disorder (BD) patients, 1,583 were in depressive episodes, 1,359 in manic episodes, and 754 were healthy controls (HC).

After excluding 3 studies that did not indicate the sex ratio of enrolled patients, the remaining participants included 47% females. During depressive episodes, the female proportion was 46%, and during manic episodes, it was 48%. Apart from 2 studies not mentioning it, the mean age of subjects ranged from 17.3 to 53.3 years. Notably, BD patients in depressive episodes (BD-D) and HC were not age-matched in 2 studies, and BD-D and manic episodes (BD-M) were not age-matched in 1 study. The diagnostic criteria for BD utilized various editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-V), the International Classification of Diseases Diagnostic Criteria, Edition 10 (ICD-10), the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders, Edition 3 (CCMD-3), and the Research Diagnostic Criteria for a Selected Group of Functional Psychoses, Edition 3 (RDC-III). The primary method for measuring thyroid hormone (TH) levels was electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA).

### Lithium: A review of its metabolic adverse effects [^117LHP6y]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment with lithium has long been recognized to be associated with metabolic adverse effects, notably hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, weight gain, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. It is important that clinicians prescribing lithium are aware of these adverse effects and have a strategy for their detection and management. We review aspects of these actions of lithium, including their prevalence, risk factors, biochemical changes involved, and management, and discuss some advances that have been made in their understanding in recent years.

### Effects of carbamazepine on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis [^116T4vze]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effects of treatment with carbamazepine on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and thyroid hormone concentrations in patients with epilepsy, we conducted a prospective study involving seven subjects diagnosed with epilepsy. Each participant began a regimen of carbamazepine (200 mg three times a day). Comprehensive assessments were conducted, including 24-hour 123 I thyroid uptake studies, basal thyrotropin concentration evaluation, and thyrotropin response analysis following intravenous administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Thyroid metrics such as thyroxine (T(4)), free T(4) index, triiodothyronine (T(3)), free T(3) index, reverse T(3), and T(3) resin uptake were measured before the initiation and after 3 to 4 months of carbamazepine therapy.

The results indicated a significant decrease in serum T(4), T(3), and free T(4) index (P < 0.05) post-therapy with carbamazepine. No significant changes were observed in T(3) resin uptake, free T(3) index, and reverse T(3) concentrations. A notable increase was found in basal serum thyrotropin levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, increases in peak thyrotropin concentration, absolute change from basal thyrotropin level, and integrated thyrotropin response, expressed as cumulative response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation, were seen after carbamazepine therapy compared to pre-therapy values (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Lastly, there was a slight increase in 24-hour 123 I uptake by the thyroid gland following carbamazepine therapy.
