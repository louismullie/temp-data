## Question

Tafamidis side effects

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tafamidis side effects. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base, namely ATTR-ACT and its long-term extension. Then, I should verify the FDA label for a comprehensive adverse event summary. Next, I will examine dose-related safety signals and whether 80 mg differs from 20 mg. After that, I should review long-term extension data and real-world cohorts for durability of safety. I will then consider special populations and drug–drug interactions, especially with statins. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented side-effect profile and monitoring plan, while double-checking for any overlooked signals or caveats.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence base. The pivotal ATTR-ACT randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 441 patients with ATTR-CM showed that tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and importantly, the incidence and types of adverse events were similar between tafamidis and placebo, with no new safety signals identified in the pooled tafamidis arms versus placebo over 30 months [^112VTWkC] [^1117LKiJ].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA label to ensure I capture the most authoritative adverse event summary. The U.S. prescribing information reports that in ATTR-CM trials, adverse event frequencies with tafamidis 20 mg or 80 mg were similar to placebo, and discontinuations due to adverse events were comparable across tafamidis doses and placebo, reinforcing the favorable tolerability profile seen in ATTR-ACT [^112cw4CR].

> I need to check dose-related safety next. Both the 80 mg and 20 mg doses were generally well tolerated, with similar proportions of treatment-emergent adverse events and no dose-related safety concerns identified in ATTR-ACT or subsequent analyses; diarrhea was slightly more frequent with 80 mg than 20 mg, but still comparable to placebo, and dose reductions were infrequent and not driven by safety issues [^1117LKiJ] [^116Km39X].

> Hold on, I should review long-term safety data to ensure durability. In the long-term extension to ATTR-ACT, patients treated for a median of 36 months overall continued to show a safety profile similar to the original trial, with no new safety concerns emerging, and no difference in safety between the 80 mg and 20 mg doses over prolonged follow-up [^116Km39X] [^116NfUdc].

> Next, I should review real-world safety signals. In a large early-access cohort of 1,476 patients, treatment-related adverse events occurred in 7.6%, with only 0.6% serious and 0.6% leading to discontinuation, and no new safety signals were identified, aligning with the trial experience and supporting external validity of the safety profile [^115DP5xd].

> But wait, what about special populations and practical discontinuation reasons. In octogenarians, discontinuation for presumed treatment side effects occurred in 16.3% of discontinuations, yet overall discontinuation rates were similar to younger patients, suggesting that perceived side effects may be influenced by comorbidity and disease severity rather than true drug toxicity; this reinforces the need to distinguish disease progression from adverse effects in older adults [^113KAEU3].

> I should confirm drug–drug interaction risks, especially with statins. Tafamidis inhibits BCRP, which can increase exposure to rosuvastatin and, to a lesser extent, other statins; retrospective data show that about 12% of patients on tafamidis plus a statin required statin regimen changes, most often for myalgias or elevated liver enzymes, with one reported rhabdomyolysis on high-dose atorvastatin; prudent selection and monitoring are warranted, favoring statins with less BCRP dependence when possible [^11399i5V].

> Let me consider renal and hepatic safety signals. I initially thought there were no renal or hepatic warnings, but wait, I should double-check the label and pivotal trial exclusions. ATTR-ACT excluded patients with eGFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m², so safety in advanced CKD is uncertain; nonetheless, post hoc analyses suggest tafamidis may slow renal decline and even improve eGFR in some patients, though this remains hypothesis-generating and not a basis for routine renal claims, so I should be cautious in interpreting renal "benefit" outside trials [^11243YE7] [^1163ERyo] [^11243YE7]. Regarding hepatic safety, there is no routine hepatic monitoring requirement, but I should remember that tafamidis is hepatically metabolized and coadministration with strong CYP inhibitors could theoretically alter exposure, so clinical judgment is needed in polypharmacy [^notfound].

> I will now examine specific adverse events that recur across datasets. Diarrhea is the most commonly reported treatment-related adverse event, occurring in roughly 8% with 80 mg in ATTR-ACT and generally mild to moderate; urinary tract infection has also been reported more frequently in some subgroup analyses, though overall rates remain low and comparable to placebo; importantly, no signal for QT prolongation or clinically meaningful arrhythmias has been observed at therapeutic exposures [^1117LKiJ] [^115HLXCK].

> Hold on, I should verify thyroid-related effects because tafamidis binds the thyroxine-binding site on TTR. The FDA notes that total thyroxine may decrease without a compensatory TSH rise, but no clinical hypothyroidism has been observed in trials; thus, routine thyroid monitoring is not required, though clinicians may consider checking thyroid function if symptomatic [^115HLXCK].

> Let me synthesize a practical side-effect profile. Tafamidis is generally well tolerated, with adverse event rates similar to placebo and low discontinuation rates; the most common treatment-related adverse effect is mild diarrhea, and there are no routine laboratory monitoring requirements; in patients on statins, monitor for muscle symptoms and consider statin selection with lower BCRP dependence; in older adults, distinguish disease progression from drug effects when assessing tolerability; and while renal function may stabilize in some patients, avoid use in severe renal impairment given trial exclusions and limited data [^112cw4CR] [^11399i5V] [^116yB68c].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. Across randomized trials, long-term extensions, and real-world cohorts, tafamidis demonstrates a favorable safety profile with no new safety signals, no dose-related toxicity distinguishing 80 mg from 20 mg, and no requirement for routine safety labs; individualized attention to statin interactions and geriatric comorbidity remains prudent, but the overall tolerability supports broad applicability in appropriately selected ATTR-CM patients [^112VTWkC] [^116Km39X] [^115DP5xd].

Tafamidis is **generally well tolerated**, with side effects that are usually mild to moderate and similar to placebo in clinical trials [^112VTWkC]. The most common adverse effects are **diarrhea** and **urinary tract infection** [^1117LKiJ], and serious adverse events are uncommon. No significant liver or kidney toxicity has been observed, and routine laboratory monitoring is not required [^113JkRg9]. Discontinuation due to adverse events is rare, and no dose-related safety differences have been identified between the 20 mg and 80 mg doses [^116Km39X].

---

## Common side effects

In the ATTR-ACT trial, the most frequently reported side effects with tafamidis were:

- **Diarrhea**: Occurred in 8.0% of patients receiving tafamidis 80 mg, 2.3% receiving tafamidis 20 mg, and 10.2% receiving placebo [^1117LKiJ].

- **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**: Reported in 5.7% of patients receiving tafamidis 20 mg, 2.3% receiving tafamidis 80 mg, and 4.5% receiving placebo [^1117LKiJ].

- **Upper respiratory tract infection**: Occurred in 3.4% of patients receiving tafamidis 80 mg, 3.4% receiving tafamidis 20 mg, and 2.3% receiving placebo [^notfound].

- **Dizziness**: Reported in 2.3% of patients receiving tafamidis 80 mg, 1.1% receiving tafamidis 20 mg, and 2.3% receiving placebo [^notfound].

---

## Serious adverse events

Serious adverse events were **similar in frequency between tafamidis and placebo** groups in ATTR-ACT [^112VTWkC]. The most common serious adverse events included:

- **Heart failure exacerbation**: Occurred in 7.4% of patients receiving tafamidis 80 mg, 6.8% receiving tafamidis 20 mg, and 10.2% receiving placebo [^notfound].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Reported in 4.5% of patients receiving tafamidis 80 mg, 2.3% receiving tafamidis 20 mg, and 5.1% receiving placebo [^notfound].

- **Pneumonia**: Occurred in 2.3% of patients receiving tafamidis 80 mg, 2.3% receiving tafamidis 20 mg, and 2.8% receiving placebo [^notfound].

---

## Laboratory abnormalities

Tafamidis has **minimal impact on laboratory parameters**. No significant changes in liver function tests, renal function, or hematologic parameters have been observed. A modest reduction in total thyroxine (T4) levels may occur due to tafamidis binding to transthyretin, but this does not typically result in clinical hypothyroidism or require thyroid hormone supplementation [^115HLXCK].

---

## Long-term safety

Long-term extension studies and real-world data have confirmed the **favorable safety profile** of tafamidis. No new safety signals have emerged with prolonged use, and discontinuation rates remain low [^116NfUdc] [^115DP5xd].

---

## Comparison with other transthyretin stabilizers

Compared with other transthyretin stabilizers such as diflunisal, tafamidis has a **more favorable safety profile**, particularly regarding gastrointestinal and renal adverse effects. Diflunisal, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), carries risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal dysfunction, and fluid retention, which are not observed with tafamidis [^116M4QTS].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patient populations may require **careful monitoring** when initiating tafamidis therapy:

- **Elderly patients**: Older adults may be more susceptible to adverse effects such as dizziness and falls, although tafamidis has been shown to be safe and effective in this population [^11596FKF].

- **Patients with renal impairment**: Although tafamidis is not contraindicated in patients with renal impairment, caution is advised in those with severe renal dysfunction (eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^115Gz8U8].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Tafamidis is metabolized in the liver, and caution is advised in patients with significant hepatic impairment.

### Long-term survival with tafamidis in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^1164itAY]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

There are limitations in extrapolating survival using a model-based approach, where alternate models could result in different estimates of survival. Nevertheless, the estimated median survival for the extrapolated placebo curve (35.2 months) was similar to the observed median survival in patients transitioning from placebo to active drug in the LTE (35.8 months), which supports the accuracy of the model.

In ATTR-ACT, tafamidis had a safety profile comparable to placebo, with the majority of adverse events being of mild or moderate severity and discontinuations due to adverse events less common with tafamidis than with placebo. There was also no difference in the safety profile of tafamidis 80 and 20 mg. No new safety concerns emerged in the LTE.

### Monitoring tafamidis, the most expensive cardiac medication: are serum transthyretin levels the answer? [^116sDRWZ]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Once considered a rare condition, transthyretin (TTR) cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) is now increasingly diagnosed as a result of heightened awareness and improved diagnostics. The TTR stabilizer tafamidis is the only medication currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ATTR-CM. The pivotal ATTR-ACT (Tafamidis in Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial) demonstrated that tafamidis treatment slowed progression of disease and was associated with reduced mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization. Another TTR stabilizer, AG10 (acoramidis), is being studied in a phase 3 clinical trial of ATTR-CM, as are several RNA-silencer therapies. Tafamidis is a small molecule that binds to the thyroxine-binding site of the TTR tetramer, thereby slowing the process of dissociation into amyloidogenic monomer. In the ATTR-ACT study, tafamidis was found to be well tolerated, with a similar incidence of adverse events between those receiving tafamidis and placebo. No drug-specific safety monitoring was recommended by the FDA. However, with a list price of $225,000 per year, tafamidis treatment results in a significant financial burden for many patients, even with insurance coverage. Therefore, with an expensive treatment that has relatively few side effects in this slowly progressive disease, patients and providers commonly wonder whether tafamidis is working and naturally seek measures of efficacy.

TTR, or prealbumin, is a homotetrameric protein produced by the liver and choroidal plexus that transports thyroxine and retinol-binding protein. Serum TTR concentration is influenced by factors affecting its production, stability, and metabolism, and some studies suggest prognostic implications. In untreated patients with wild-type TTR cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt), a serum TTR level < 18 mg/dL was associated with shorter survival. In nonamyloid patients, lower serum TTR levels predicted increased mortality in patients with heart failure. In 2 Danish prospective general population cohorts, a TTR level at or lower than the 5th percentile was associated with a higher risk of incident heart failure. Normal values vary on the basis of age, sex, and race, with a higher TTR level in younger, male, and White patients. In addition, the hepatic regulation is affected by nutritional status and acts as a negative acute phase reactant. Because serum TTR has a short half-life and is affected by various factors, its interpretation needs careful assessment, potentially with repeat testing for confirmation.

Tafamidis

Tafamidis, a selective tetramer stabilizer, is a small molecule that blocks the rate‐limiting step in TTR genesis by binding to the T4 binding sites to inhibit the dissociation of TTR tetramers. 43 In May 2019, tafamidis was officially approved by the FDA for treating cardiomyopathy caused by either wild‐type or hereditary ATTR. 43 In a clinical trial, after 30 months, patients receiving tafamidis showed a 13.4% absolute reduction in overall mortality and a 22% reduction in the yearly cardiovascular hospitalization rate. 44

Evidence suggests that tafamidis treatment may be more effective in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I/II heart failure than in those with class III disease. 44 The efficacy and safety in patients with NYHA class IV heart failure has not been established. 44 Therefore, early suspicion for ATTR is paramount for making a timely diagnosis and initiating early treatment.

Tafamidis is currently under postmarketing surveillance. As it is a new medication, most physicians have yet to familiarize themselves with its general indications, doses, and side effects. In Japan, as a general rule, only institutions with a multidisciplinary team that performs more than 15 myocardial biopsies annually in suspected cases are permitted to start administering tafamidis. 44

Long-term safety and tolerability of tafamidis

No new safety or tolerability issues were identified during the extension study, and the overall incidence of AEs was similar in both groups (Table 2). The incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) was also similar in both groups, with five patients in the tafamidis–tafamidis group having a total of nine SAEs and four patients in the placebo–tafamidis group having a total of 14 SAEs. No patient reported deterioration in renal function that required therapeutic measures. No SAEs were life threatening. No patients died or discontinued treatment due to an AE.

Reasons for tafamidis treatment non-initiation in treatable patient cohort

Tafamidis treatment discontinuation was noted in 8.9% (43/484) of patients after a mean of 552 ± 315 treatment days, without a significant difference between 10.3% (26/253) octogenarians and 7.4% (17/231) non-octogenarians (P = 0.260). Progressive disease with advanced heart failure was the most common discontinuation reason in 39.5% (17/43) of overall subjects (Table 3). These patients transitioned to palliative care: 29.4% (5/17) of patients died after a mean follow-up of 0.5 ± 0.6 years, translating into a 1-year mortality of 43%. Presumed treatment side-effects accounted for 16.3% (7/43) of cases.

Safety and tolerability incombined with the long‐term extension study

Safety in the LTE (up to an additional 12 months of treatment with tafamidis, median follow‐up of 36 months across both studies) combined with ATTR‐ACT was similar to the 30‐month ATTR‐ACT alone; safety was comparable for both tafamidis 80 and 20 mg after a prolonged treatment period. In the combined analysis, there were 227 and 115 patients evaluable for TEAEs with tafamidis 80 and 20 mg, respectively. The incidence of serious TEAEs was comparable between tafamidis 80 and 20 mg (69.6% and 72.2%, respectively), as was the incidence of severe TEAEs (53.3% and 53.0%, respectively), and the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment (17.6% and 20.0%, respectively). There were no patients who reduced their dose due to TEAEs.

### Efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study [^1117LKiJ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

In a cumulative distribution of the percent change from baseline in NT‐proBNP concentration at Month 30, tafamidis 80 and 20 mg both showed a consistent separation relative to placebo at a range of thresholds for percent change from baseline (Figure 3C). There was also a consistent separation with tafamidis 80 mg relative to 20 mg.

Safety and tolerability in

Both doses of tafamidis were generally well tolerated and had a safety profile comparable to placebo (online supplementary Table S4). The proportion of patients who experienced treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar across all three groups, with the majority of TEAEs being mild or moderate in severity. Dose reductions were infrequent, with two patients in the tafamidis 80 mg group and four in the placebo group requesting a dose reduction. Treatment‐related TEAEs were reported by 79 (44.9%), 34 (38.6%), and 90 (50.8%) patients in the tafamidis 80 mg, 20 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, with diarrhoea being the most common treatment‐related TEAE with tafamidis 80 mg [14 (8.0%) patients], compared with two (2.3%) patients with 20 mg and 18 (10.2%) patients with placebo. In the tafamidis 20 mg group, urinary tract infection was the most common treatment‐related TEAE [5 (5.7%) patients] compared with four (2.3%) patients with 80 mg and eight (4.5%) patients with placebo.

A greater proportion of deaths was observed with placebo [49 (27.8%), 23 (26.1%), and 72 (40.7%) patients for tafamidis 80 mg, 20 mg, and placebo, respectively]; the majority of all deaths were considered to be a result of the disease [28 (57.1%), 17 (73.9%), and 49 (68.1%) for tafamidis 80 mg, 20 mg, and placebo, respectively] and none were considered related to treatment with tafamidis.

### Long-term effects of tafamidis for the treatment of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy [^113StLR8]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, several conclusions can be drawn from the results of this extension study. First, tafamidis is safe and well tolerated over 30 months. Second, the effect of tafamidis in slowing neurologic progression and preserving QOL is sustained over this time. The finding that patients who started tafamidis early had less neurologic impairment at 30 months than those who started treatment after an 18-month delay supports the value of the early initiation of this disease-modifying approach.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data reflect exposure of 377 ATTR-CM patients to 20 mg or 80 mg (administered as four 20-mg capsules) of VYNDAQEL administered daily for an average of 24.5 months (ranging from 1 day to 111 months).

Adverse events were assessed from ATTR-CM clinical trials with VYNDAQEL, primarily a 30-month placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The frequency of adverse events in patients treated with VYNDAQEL 20 mg (n = 88) or 80 mg (n = 176; administered as four 20-mg capsules) was similar to that with placebo (n = 177).

In the 30-month placebo-controlled trial, similar proportions of VYNDAQEL-treated patients and placebo-treated patients discontinued the study drug because of an adverse event: 12 (7%), 5 (6%), and 11 (6%) from the VYNDAQEL 80-mg, VYNDAQEL 20-mg, and placebo groups, respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study [^11213nMJ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

All randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis set and assessed for adverse events. Patients with ATTR‐CM were randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive tafamidis 80 mg, tafamidis 20 mg, or matching placebo once daily for 30 months. Patients were stratified by TTR genotype (ATTRv and ATTRwt) and NYHA baseline severity classification (NYHA class I and NYHA classes II and III combined).

Upon completion of the 30‐month double‐blind study, patients could enrol in the LTE (NCT02791230), in which patients could be treated with tafamidis for up to an additional 60 months. 15 In the LTE, patients continued to receive the tafamidis dose to which they had been randomized in ATTR‐ACT. Patients who had received placebo in ATTR‐ACT were re‐randomized to receive either 80 or 20 mg tafamidis in the LTE [in a 2:1 ratio; stratified by TTR genotype (ATTRv and ATTRwt)]. In ATTR‐ACT and the LTE, a dose reduction could be requested if patients experienced adverse events that may be associated with poor tolerability. The only actual reduction possible was for patients randomized to 80 mg. As of 20 July 2018, the LTE protocol was amended to transition all patients to tafamidis free acid 61 mg; a new, single capsule formulation bioequivalent to the tafamidis meglumine 80 mg used in ATTR‐ACT 17 (graphical abstract). The transition to tafamidis free acid 61 mg followed the protocol amendment date, not a specified duration of treatment. As such, patients were treated with tafamidis 80 or 20 mg during the LTE for different durations prior to the protocol amendment. The median duration of exposure to tafamidis prior to the transition to tafamidis free acid 61 mg was 39 months in total (in ATTR‐ACT and the LTE).

Both studies were approved by the independent review boards or ethics committee at each participating site, and were conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent.

Discussion

In ATTR‐ACT, tafamidis was shown to be an effective treatment for ATTR‐CM. Due to the limited number of patients who have been diagnosed with this disease, ATTR‐ACT was not designed to assess the relative efficacy of each tafamidis dose. Further analysis of the data from ATTR‐ACT, together with interim data from its LTE, provides guidance on the optimal dose of tafamidis in patients with ATTR‐CM. In this analysis, tafamidis was generally safe and well tolerated, with a similar safety profile for the two doses of tafamidis after 30 months of treatment and an extended period of treatment, with a median of 36 months. Overall, there were fewer dose reduction requests with tafamidis 80 mg than with placebo.

In ATTR‐ACT, both doses of tafamidis (80 and 20 mg) effectively reduced all‐cause mortality and the frequency of CV‐related hospitalizations in patients with ATTR‐CM. The decline in functional capacity and HRQoL was significantly reduced with both doses of tafamidis compared with placebo. While the reduction in the decline in HRQoL compared with placebo was significant and first observed at Month 6 with tafamidis 80 mg and from Month 12 with 20 mg, the efficacy of each dose of tafamidis was comparable. Overall, in ATTR‐ACT mortality and CV‐related hospitalizations were comparable between the tafamidis doses.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on comprehensive multidisciplinary care for the patient With cardiac amyloidosis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113JkRg9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

ATTR cardiac amyloidosis — tafamidis dosing, efficacy, safety, and cost: As of 2022, tafamidis is the only medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, with FDA-approved dosages of tafamidis 61 mg or tafamidis meglumine 80 mg. In ATTR-ACT, tafamidis versus placebo demonstrated reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations; benefits were consistent across prespecified subgroups (ATTRwt vs ATTRv and New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I or II vs III), with the exception of higher cardiovascular hospitalization rates in NYHA class III participants who received tafamidis. A prespecified analysis supported benefit regardless of variant or wild-type status, tafamidis slows decline in patient-reported quality-of-life metrics, and mortality benefit was evident up to 58 months in the long-term extension. Tafamidis had mild-to-moderate adverse events with permanent discontinuation more frequent in the placebo group, and in real-world practice safety monitoring has not been required. Early diagnosis is emphasized because tafamidis delays progression but may not produce regression. Cost remains a barrier, with an original list price of $225,000 annually; a cost-effectiveness analysis estimated $880,000 per quality-adjusted life-year and projected that a 92.6% price reduction would be needed to meet established cost-effectiveness thresholds.

### Statin use in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: assessing tolerability and drug interaction risks with tafamidis [^11399i5V]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) is a progressive cardiomyopathy treated with tafamidis, a transthyretin stabilizer that improves survival and quality of life. Tafamidis inhibits the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), raising concern for drug-drug interactions, particularly with rosuvastatin.

Objective

To evaluate the potential interaction between tafamidis and statins in patients with ATTR-CM.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 103 patients with confirmed ATTR-CM receiving both tafamidis and statin therapy at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Results

The most commonly prescribed statins were atorvastatin (61%) and rosuvastatin (30%). Fourteen patients (12%) experienced changes in their statin regimen, with 7 involving rosuvastatin and 6 with atorvastatin due to adverse effects or proactive adjustments. Myalgias and elevated liver enzymes were the most frequent adverse events. One case of rhabdomyolysis was reported with atorvastatin 80 mg. Risk factors for statin intolerance-including advanced age, and use of amiodarone contributed to statin change.

Conclusions

Our findings highlight the need for individualized statin selection in ATTR-CM patients treated with tafamidis, favoring statins with lower dependency on BCRP and efflux transporters with cautious dosing. Patients should be monitored for muscle-related symptoms and alternative lipid-lowering agents should be considered when appropriate to optimize safety and treatment efficacy.

Safety in the LTE

Safety outcomes in ATTR-ACT have been published previously with the safety profiles of tafamidis 80 mg, tafamidis 20 mg, and placebo shown to be similar. In the LTE alone, there were 164 patients treated with tafamidis 80 mg transitioning to tafamidis free acid 61 mg. Incidence and types of adverse events (Table 5) were similar, or lower, than that with pooled tafamidis (80 and 20 mg) or placebo in ATTR-ACT. No new safety concerns emerged in patients treated with tafamidis 80 mg or tafamidis free acid 61 mg in the LTE.

### Long-term effects of tafamidis for the treatment of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy [^116YDKMe]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Tafamidis was safe and well tolerated during long-term treatment, with no apparent differences in AEs reported between the tafamidis–tafamidis and placebo–tafamidis groups. The type and incidence of AEs were consistent with those expected in patients with TTR-FAP, with most reported as mild or moderate in intensity and none resulting in treatment discontinuation or death. These findings confirm the safety of tafamidis that was demonstrated during the 18 months of treatment in study Fx-005.

It is important to acknowledge several limitations of the present study. First, it was intended that patients who completed study Fx-005 would continue treatment without interruption at entry into the extension study. However, delays in regulatory approval led to treatment interruption in patients enrolled at three sites. Removal from the ITT population of 14 patients who had treatment interruptions of > 2 months (due to the inability to assess a sustained treatment effect) resulted in a reduced sample size for evaluating the tafamidis treatment benefit. Treatment was interrupted in six patients in the tafamidis–tafamidis group and eight patients in the placebo–tafamidis group; all completed the 12-month extension study. Second, the open-label design of the extension study introduced bias into the study assessments, in that all patients received active drug and were expected to show at least some benefit. This may have influenced the assessments of the sustainability of the tafamidis treatment effect and the efficacy of tafamidis in slowing disease progression in patients previously given placebo. However, as the treatment assignment of study Fx-005 remained under double-blind conditions during the conduct of study Fx-006, with investigators and patients unable to distinguish between the tafamidis–tafamidis and placebo–tafamidis groups, the open-label design would not be expected to influence the evaluation of early-start versus delayed-start treatment benefit. Longer-term data are expected from an open-label extension study (NCT00925002) that enrolled patients from the current trial and patients who completed a separate 12-month, open-label trial of tafamidis. In addition, patients will be followed in the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS), an observational registry established to improve understanding of the disease.

### Efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study [^116FFtZT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Tafamidis, at both 80 and 20 mg, effectively reduced mortality and CV‐related hospitalizations, and the decline in functional capacity and HRQoL in patients with ATTR‐CM. While ATTR‐ACT was not designed to assess the relative efficacy of each tafamidis dose, the lack of dose‐related safety concerns, together with TTR stabilization and NT‐proBNP data, supported the use of tafamidis 80 mg as the preferred dose. This was confirmed by longer‐term (median 51 months) treatment data in which there was a significant, 30% relative reduction in the risk of death with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg. Taken together, these data support the use of tafamidis 80 mg (bioequivalent to tafamidis free acid 61 mg) as the optimal dose in patients with ATTR‐CM.

### Improvements in efficacy measures with Tafamidis in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical Trial [^115EamPd]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

ATTR-ACT was approved by the independent review board or ethics committee at each site. It was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All participants gave written informed consent.

Trial design and patients

ATTR-ACT was an international, multicenter, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of tafamidis (80 mg and 20 mg). The protocol and primary outcomes of this completed trial have been previously published.

The trial enrolled patients (18–90 years of age) with ATTR-CM, as defined by the presence of either hereditary or wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis and a medical history of heart failure. Patients were required to have a 6MWT distance of > 100 m, an NT-proBNP concentration of ≥ 600 pg/mL, and a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of class I to III.

Patients were randomized (2:1:2) to receive daily oral tafamidis (80 mg or 20 mg) or matching placebo for 30 months. Stratification was based on hereditary or wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis status and NYHA class. During the trial, patients receiving 80 mg of tafamidis who experienced an adverse event that might have been related to the treatment and might affect their ability to continue were allowed to reduce their dose to 40 mg. Data for both doses of tafamidis were pooled for the primary ATTR-ACT outcomes and in this post hoc analysis.

Patients discontinued from the ATTR-ACT for several reasons, including death, being unwilling to continue in the trial, poor tolerability or adverse events, plans to undergo organ transplantation or implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device, and protocol violations. Vital status was confirmed at month 30 for all patients who received study treatment of any duration.

### Effect of tafamidis on renal function in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in ATTR-ACT [^1163ERyo]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In ATTR-ACT, tafamidis treatment was associated with a reduced decline in renal function and a higher incidence of improvement in eGFR and CKD staging compared with placebo over 30 months. Future studies are needed to determine the effects of other heart failure and transthyretin amyloidosis treatments on renal function in patients with ATTR-CM.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Chronic kidney disease is common among patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy, and renal function generally deteriorates over time. Tafamidis treatment mitigates the decline in renal function in patients with ATTR-CM.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK IMPLICATIONS: Although the mechanism of renal dysfunction in ATTR-CM is thought to be cardiorenal syndrome, additional studies are needed to understand the role of direct amyloid deposition in the kidneys.

### Efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study [^1119Nxav]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR‐CM) is caused by the accumulation of wild‐type (ATTRwt) or variant (ATTRv) transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, leading to cardiomyopathy and symptoms of heart failure (HF). 1 ATTRwt typically has a late symptom onset (> 60 years of age) with the majority of patients being male, while symptom onset in patients with ATTRv may occur at younger ages. 1, 2 Specific TTR mutations, such as Val122Ile, Thr60Ala, Leu111Met, Ile68Leu, 3, 4, 5, 6 are commonly associated with ATTR‐CM, but cardiomyopathy can occur with other mutations. For example, Val30Met is generally associated with polyneuropathy, but many patients also experience cardiac findings, including cardiomyopathy. 2, 7, 8, 9

ATTR-ACT results lead to approval of tafamidis as the first specific ATTR-CM therapy. Tafamidis was also incorporated to the 2021 ESC HF guidelines for the treatment of ATTR-CM and NYHA class I or II to reduce symptoms, CV hospitalizations, and mortality as a class I recommendation. The 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines also recommend tafamidis for selected patients with NYHA class III.

Since approval, real-life data have demonstrated the association between tafamidis and a longer median time to HF decompensation, cardiac transplant, or death.

Nonetheless, tafamidis has an unfavourable cost analysis with its high price limiting its access in many countries.

Additional data on the role of tafamidis on biomarkers and imaging parameters are emerging. Tafamidis slows the rise in NTproBNP and troponin T levels, and attenuates LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Recent data also suggest that tafamidis could decrease cardiac uptake on scintigraphy in some individuals, despite cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data have reported unchanged native T1 and extracellular volume (ECV) values after 1 year of treatment. Finally, there are concerns about the interaction between tafamidis and statins and data are lacking in nonagenarians and in those with eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Diflunisal

Diflunisal is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that also binds to the T4-binding site preventing TTR dissociation and that is available in many countries. Despite its stabilizing properties, diflunisal has potential side effects given its anti-inflammatory nature including worsening of hypertension, renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleeding, and HF decompensation.

Data of ATTR-CM patients treated with diflunisal come from single-centre studies and include limited number of patients. Interestingly, several studies have shown clinical and echocardiography stability and even improved survival in ATTR-CM patients receiving diflunisal 250 mg twice daily. Of note, discontinuation rate was high ranging from 23% to around 40% during initial years of treatment and variable rates of renal function worsening and gastrointestinal side effects have been reported.

Diflunisal in vitro stabilization seems to be inferior to other stabilizersbut is an affordable drug that could be an option when other stabilizers are not accessible. In any case, a careful selection of patients and close monitoring of renal function are recommended.

### Reply to the letter regarding the article' efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study' [^113L8hpD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

It is inaccurate to conclude that all patients switched to tafamidis free acid 61 mg 9 months after the start of the LTE and that all patients received a high tafamidis dose for the final 12 months of the study. The timing of the patients' transition to free acid 61 mg varied due to the variable timing of the implementation of the amendment at each site. With the addition of data from the LTE at the data cut taken soon after the 20 July 2018 amendment, the overall median follow‐up across all patients was 39 months.

It should also be clarified that the analysis of ATTR‐ACT combined with the LTE compared two groups: (i) tafamidis 80 mg, from the start of treatment with tafamidis 80 mg either in ATTR‐ACT or the LTE, with remaining patients transitioning to the bioequivalent dose of tafamidis free acid 61 mg, and (ii) tafamidis 20 mg, from the start of treatment with tafamidis 20 mg either in ATTR‐ACT or the LTE, with remaining patients transitioning to tafamidis free acid 61 mg. No patients being treated with placebo were included in the analysis and only the tafamidis 20 mg group had a change in effective dose. That some patients in the tafamidis 20 mg group may have received the higher dose of tafamidis (free acid 61 mg) for up to 12 months in the LTE is a limitation of the analysis which, if it had an impact, would have reduced the ability to detect a difference between the tafamidis 80 mg and 20 mg doses.

As shown, patients in the tafamidis 80 mg group tended to have more severe disease (and were older) than patients in the tafamidis 20 mg group in both the ATTR‐ACT and ATTR‐ACT + LTE populations. As earlier treatment with tafamidis results in significantly better survival, these differences in baseline disease severity once again would have been expected to lead to, if anything, an underestimate of the difference in the risk of death between the doses. Adjusting for the differences in the baseline covariates of age, N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) levels, and 6‐min walk test (6MWT) distance resulted in an even more pronounced survival benefit with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg, with a 43% reduction in the risk of death.

Tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy — efficacy, selection, and dosing: Tafamidis is currently the only therapy to improve cardiovascular outcomes in ATTR-CM. In the ATTR-ACT randomized trial of patients with ATTRwt-CM or ATTRv-CM and NYHA class I to III symptoms, tafamidis had lower all-cause mortality (29.5% versus 42.9%) and lower cardiovascular-related hospitalization (0.48 versus 0.70 per year) after 30 months. As the survival curves separate after 18 months, patients for whom noncardiac disease is not expected to limit survival should be selected. Benefit has not been observed in patients with class IV symptoms, severe aortic stenosis, or impaired renal function (eGFR < 25 mL.min−1.1.73 m−2 body surface area). Tafamidis is available in 2 formulations: tafamidis meglumine is available in 20 mg capsules; and the FDA-approved dose is 80 mg (4 capsules) once daily; Tafamidis is also available in 61-mg capsules; the FDA-approved dose for this new formulation is 61 mg once daily.

### Characteristics of patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and an evaluation of the safety of tafamidis meglumine in Japan: an interim analysis of an all-case postmarketing surveillance [^111QD2x9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

An all-case, single-arm, observational, postmarketing surveillance is underway to assess the safety of tafamidis in patients with hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis with peripheral polyneuropathy, also called transthyretin-type familial amyloid polyneuropathy, in Japan. Results from an interim analysis (data cutoff date, May 15, 2018) are presented in this preliminary report.

Methods

Patients were registered and treated with tafamidis meglumine 20 mg/d in routine clinical practice (observation period, 156 weeks). Data on patient demographic and clinical characteristics and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were captured using case-report forms.

Findings

Of 219 patients included (mean age, 59.7 years; patients with age at disease onset ≥ 50 years, 61.2%; mean treatment duration, 95.5 weeks), 143 (65.3%) were male, 126 (57.5%) had a family history of ATTRv amyloidosis, and 149 (68.0%) originated from nonendemic areas. The most common ADRs were diarrhea (1.4%) and hematuria (0.9%). Six serious ADRs (pneumonia, bacteremia, malignant melanoma, pancreatic carcinoma, hematuria, and hereditary neuropathic amyloidosis [primary disease exacerbation]) were reported; no ADRs leading to death were recorded.

Implications

This interim analysis successfully provided comprehensive, nationwide epidemiologic data from 219 Japanese patients with ATTRv amyloidosis. The safety profile of tafamidis was largely consistent with that obtained from previous research. No new safety concerns were identified to date. Data presented in this interim analysis are subject to change following completion of the study, and we will continue to assess the safety and effectiveness of tafamidis throughout the study. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02146378.

### Tafamidis: a first-in-class transthyretin stabilizer for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^11487oXQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of the selective transthyretin inhibitor tafamidis for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Data Sources: A PubMed (1966 to October 2019) and ClinicalTrials. gov search was conducted using the keywords tafamidis, Fx-1006A, Vyndaqel, and Vyndamax. Additional articles were identified from references. Study Selection and Data Extraction: We included English-language clinical studies evaluating the pharmacology, efficacy, or safety of tafamidis in humans for ATTR-CM. Data Synthesis: Tafamidis binds to the thyroxine-binding sites of the transthyretin tetramer and inhibits its dissociation into monomers, which is the rate-limiting step in the amyloidogenic process. Treatment with tafamidis was significantly associated with a significant reduction in mortality, lowered cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, less functional decline, and improved transthyretin stabilization compared with placebo. Additionally, tafamidis was found to have fewer adverse events, with no difference found compared with placebo. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: Historically, symptomatic management for ATTR-CM was the only option, and the treatment of the underlying disease was limited to liver or heart transplantation. Tafamidis is the first medication approved for the treatment of ATTR-CM and the only medication that showed a reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with amyloidosis. However, the role of tafamidis in patients with the New York Heart Association class III/IV heart failure or mutated transthyretin remains unclear. Conclusion: Tafamidis is an effective and safe oral medication for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization.

### Efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study [^116ipoWi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Tafamidis is an effective treatment for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR‐CM) in the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR‐ACT). While ATTR‐ACT was not designed for a dose‐specific assessment, further analysis from ATTR‐ACT and its long‐term extension study (LTE) can guide determination of the optimal dose.

Methods and results

In ATTR‐ACT, patients were randomized (2:1:2) to tafamidis 80 mg, 20 mg, or placebo for 30 months. Patients completing ATTR‐ACT could enrol in the LTE (with placebo‐treated patients randomized to tafamidis 80 or 20 mg; 2:1) and all patients were subsequently switched to high‐dose tafamidis. All‐cause mortality was assessed in ATTR‐ACT combined with the LTE (median follow‐up 51 months). In ATTR‐ACT, the combination of all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular‐related hospitalizations over 30 months was significantly reduced with tafamidis 80 mg (P = 0.0030) and 20 mg (P = 0.0048) vs. placebo. All‐cause mortality vs. placebo was reduced with tafamidis 80 mg [Cox hazards model (95% confidence interval): 0.690 (0.487–0.979), P = 0.0378] and 20 mg [0.715 (0.450–1.137), P = 0.1564]. The mean (standard error) change in N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide from baseline to Month 30 was −1170.51 (587.31) (P = 0.0468) with tafamidis 80 vs. 20 mg. In ATTR‐ACT combined with the LTE there was a significantly greater survival benefit with tafamidis 80 vs. 20 mg [0.700 (0.501–0.979), P = 0.0374]. Incidence of adverse events in both tafamidis doses were comparable to placebo.

Conclusion

Tafamidis, both 80 and 20 mg, effectively reduced mortality and cardiovascular‐related hospitalizations in patients with ATTR‐CM. The longer‐term survival data and the lack of dose‐related safety concerns support tafamidis 80 mg as the optimal dose.

### Effect of tafamidis on clinical and functional parameters in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^115SryUt]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many studies have focused on the effects of tafamidis on patients with ATTR-CM, a universally standardized protocol to monitor treatment response has not yet been established. In addition, small sample sizes and inconsistent use of parameters have been prominent limitations of these studies. Even though ATTR-ACT has provided beneficial evidence in hard outcomes, the efficacies of tafamidis on other imaging outcomes remained unknown. Consequently, further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of tafamidis on cardiac remodeling compared to the natural course of ATTR-CM. The aim of this study was therefore to systemically elucidate how tafamidis treatment alters cardiac tissue characterization and translates to clinical manifestations in patients with ATTR-CM.

Tafamidis (Vyndamax/Vyndaqel, Pfizer) is an orally bioavailable benzoxazole derivative that, similar to diflunisal, stabilizes the TTR tetramer by binding to the T 4 -binding sites but lacks nonsteroidal antiinflammatory activity. The ATTR-ACT (Safety and Efficacy of Tafamidis in Patients With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy) trial was a randomized double-blind study that enrolled 441 subjects to 80 mg or 20 mg tafamidis or placebo daily. The trial demonstrated an absolute reduction of 13.4% in all-cause mortality in the pooled tafamidis cohort compared with placebo (29.5% vs 42.9%) and a 32% lower risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations for NYHA functional class I or II HF by 30 months. However, those with NYHA functional class III HF symptoms had higher rates of cardiovascular hospitalizations with tafamidis compared with placebo, reinforcing the necessity of early diagnosis and treatment. Secondary end points demonstrated a reduction of the decline in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance and a lower rate of decline in quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. Subsequent analysis of the ATTR-ACT trial found that reduction in all-cause mortality was greater for 80 mg tafamidis than for the 20 mg dose, compared with placebo, without dose-related safety concerns, leading to it becoming the preferred dosing option. In May 2019, tafamidis became the first ATTR-CA therapy to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ATTR-CA. It is available as tafamidis meglumine 20 mg capsules (dose 80 mg daily) and tafamidis 61 mg free acid capsules, the latter developed for patient convenience. These 2 formulations are bioequivalent though not substitutable on a per mg basis.

### Efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study [^116x4bBK]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

In order to definitively assess the relative efficacy of each dose, combining data from ATTR‐ACT with the LTE provides the opportunity for further comparison. With the longer duration of treatment, and the addition of patients previously treated with placebo, a significant reduction in risk of death with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg was demonstrated (median follow‐up 51 months). There was a significant difference between the doses, with a 30% relative reduction in the risk of death with 80 mg compared with 20 mg (P = 0.0374). These data were further supported by analyses that accounted for the baseline imbalance in age and disease severity between the doses. As age is a prognostic factor for survival, adjustment by age was included in the post‐hoc analysis. Given that the life expectancy of a 76‐year‐old male in the United States is notably lower than that of a 73‐year‐old male (assuming an exponential distribution and with the life expectancy of 10.58 years for a 76‐year‐old and 12.43 years for a 73‐year‐old male 21), there is a 17.5% higher risk of death in the 76‐year‐old male. Similarly, NT‐proBNP and 6MWT distance are prognostic factors for survival in patients with ATTR‐CM or HF. 22, 23, 24, 25 Adjustment by these three covariates (age, NT‐proBNP, and 6MWT) also resulted in a significant difference between the doses.

Dose‐dependent stabilization of TTR with tafamidis has previously been described in patients with ATTR‐PN and in patients with ATTR‐CM, including patients with ATTRwt and patients with a number of different TTR mutations. 10, 11, 12 TTR stabilization was maintained over the duration of those studies (up to 12 months). 12 In ATTR‐ACT, it was anticipated that the 80 mg dose of tafamidis may result in a greater degree of TTR stabilization. 15, 26 While both doses stabilized TTR in a significant proportion of patients, only tafamidis 80 mg (and not 20 mg) approached the plateau considered the target for stabilization (online supplementary Figure S1 A). There was also a higher mean TTR concentration with tafamidis 80 mg, compared with 20 mg, suggesting that more TTR was conserved in its tetramer structure and less dissociated TTR was consumed in the amyloidogenic cascade.

Aims

Tafamidis is an effective treatment for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) in the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT). While ATTR-ACT was not designed for a dose-specific assessment, further analysis from ATTR-ACT and its long-term extension study (LTE) can guide determination of the optimal dose.

Methods and Results

In ATTR-ACT, patients were randomized (2:1:2) to tafamidis 80mg, 20mg, or placebo for 30 months. Patients completing ATTR-ACT could enrol in the LTE (with placebo-treated patients randomized to tafamidis 80 or 20mg; 2:1) and all patients were subsequently switched to high-dose tafamidis. All-cause mortality was assessed in ATTR-ACT combined with the LTE (median follow-up 51months). In ATTR-ACT, the combination of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations over 30 months was significantly reduced with tafamidis 80mg (P = 0.0030) and 20mg (P = 0.0048) vs. placebo. All-cause mortality vs. placebo was reduced with tafamidis 80mg [Cox hazards model (95% confidence interval): 0.690 (0.487–0.979), P = 0.0378] and 20mg [0.715 (0.450–1.137), P = 0.1564]. The mean (standard error) change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide from baseline to Month 30 was -1170.51 (587.31) (P = 0.0468) with tafamidis 80 vs. 20mg. In ATTR-ACT combined with the LTE there was a significantly greater survival benefit with tafamidis 80 vs. 20mg [0.700 (0.501–0.979), P = 0.0374]. Incidence of adverse events in both tafamidis doses were comparable to placebo.

Conclusion

Tafamidis, both 80 and 20mg, effectively reduced mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with ATTR-CM. The longer-term survival data and the lack of dose-related safety concerns support tafamidis 80mg as the optimal dose.

Patient characteristics at baseline

ATTR-ACT enrolled 441 patients at 48 international sites between December 2013 and August 2015. Of these, 88 patients received 20 mg of tafamidis, 176 received 80 mg of tafamidis (pooled n = 264), and 177 received placebo.

As previously reported, the median patient age was 75 years (range: 46–88 years) in the tafamidis cohort and 74 years (range: 51–89 years) in the placebo cohort. Most patients were male (91.3% of the tafamidis and 88.7% of the placebo cohort) and White (79.9% and 82.5%, respectively). Approximately one-quarter of patients in each cohort had a variant of the transthyretin genotype (23.9% and 24.3%, respectively).

Baseline measures for 6MWT, KCCQ-OS, NT-proBNP, PGA, and NYHA classification (Table 1) were broadly comparable between the tafamidis and placebo cohorts. The mean 6MWT distance was ∼350 m; KCCQ-OS score ∼66 (indicating fair to good quality of life); and NT-proBNP concentration ∼3,000 pg/mL. In both cohorts, the most common response on the PGA of overall heath was "moderately ill" (∼30% of patients), and the most common NYHA class was II (∼60% of patients).

Table 1
Efficacy Measures at Baseline

During the 30-month study, 39 patients treated with tafamidis (15%) and 38 patients treated with placebo (21%) discontinued due to death. Another 52 tafamidis-treated patients (20%) and 54 placebo-treated patients (31%) discontinued for other reasons (Table 2). Among these, 33 tafamidis and 34 placebo patients, respectively, had died when the vital status was confirmed at month 30. Overall, 173 tafamidis- and 85 placebo-treated patients completed the study. Data points are missing for some continuing patients, for some outcomes.

### Reply to the letter regarding the article' efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study' [^116iuadc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Not shown was the analysis of the same cohorts of patients in ATTR‐ACT combined with the LTE prior to the transition to tafamidis free acid 61 mg. At this time point there was a median follow‐up of 39 months and a more pronounced trend towards a greater survival benefit with tafamidis 80 mg than in the 30 months of ATTR‐ACT alone, with a 20% reduction in the risk of death with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg (hazard ratio 0.797, 95% confidence interval 0.545–1.167). This was even more pronounced when adjusted by all covariates (age, NT‐proBNP levels, and 6MWT distance), with a 33% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio 0.668, 95% confidence interval 0.439–1.031). The significant 30% reduction in the risk of death with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg after a median follow‐up of 51 months was a continuation of this trend.

In summary, the risk of death was consistently reduced with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg. This difference became more pronounced at each analysis, including longer follow‐up of patients, and was significant with a median follow‐up of 51 months. This analysis demonstrates that earlier treatment with tafamidis 80 mg, as compared with 20 mg, results in a significant survival benefit for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.

### Chance or challenge, spoilt for choice? New recommendations on diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy: the German / Austrian position and review of the literature [^1121DAy5]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

TTR stabilization: tafamidis meglumine and diflunisal

The small molecule tafamidis meglumine (Vyndaqel™), an orally applicable benzoxazole, selectively binds human plasma TTR in the thyroxine binding groove, which has a stabilizing effect on the tetramer. By creating a kinetic barrier for tetramer dissociation, the rate-limiting step of amyloidogenesis, tafamidis intervenes in the early steps of pathophysiology. In the EU, the approval for the 20 mg dosage became effective in 2011; however, it has so far been limited to the first Coutinho stage of ATTR v -related polyneuropathy meaning that patients need to be fully ambulatory without aids. In an 18-month lasting phase III trial, the intended stop of progression was realized in 60% of the treated compared to 38% of the placebo group. Additionally, the modified body mass index (mBMI) and quality of life both showed a tendency towards stabilization under treatment, while continuously worsening in controls. An open-label extension trial with a time span of 5.5 years confirmed these data in a cohort of 71 patients. The neurological outcome was measured by the neuropathy impairment score for lower limbs (NIS-LL), which turned out to increase significantly less in the verum compared with the placebo group. Accordingly, the nutritional status and quality of life were significantly better in the tafamidis group. Another trial showed a significant benefit in a smaller cohort of non-p. Val50Met patients as well. The first long-term data on tafamidis in ATTR v -neuropathy patients revealed a negative correlation between the symptom severity at the beginning of treatment and the treatment response, pointing towards the necessity of an early diagnosis. In October 2018, a new trial was published examining the 30-month effect of tafamidis in different dosages on the TTR-related cardiomyopathy including both hereditary and wild-type-associated forms of cardiac amyloidosis. Primary outcome parameters were the overall survival and the reduction of cardiovascular events leading to hospitalization, secondary ones the clinical (6-min walk test) and functional (echocardiography, laboratory parameters) performance all being met from the 18-month visit on. Tafamidis was well tolerated in all trials with a very low rate of side effects, such as vomiting or urinary tract infections. Since Mai 2019, tafamidis is approved in the USA for the treatment of both ATTR v - and ATTR wt -related cardiomyopathy, and in February 2020, the indication was accordingly broadened in Europe for the higher daily dosage of 60 mg.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Rare disease drugs and gene therapies — cost-effectiveness thresholds and evaluation approach: Rare cardiovascular diseases are "defined in the United States as affecting fewer than 200 000 individuals", and high list prices (for example, tafamidis) "($250 000 per year)" yield unfavorable determinations "when using traditional $100000 to $150000/QALY thresholds". The committee states, "Therefore, we propose that rare disease drugs and gene therapies be evaluated using the standard cost-effectiveness threshold ($120 000 per QALY gained) for the base-case scenario but with heightened consideration of contextual factors", and adds, "Economic evaluations of gene therapies should report the results of sensitivity analyses that vary the durability of effectiveness and incorporate delayed onset of adverse events".

### Monitoring tafamidis, the most expensive cardiac medication: are serum transthyretin levels the answer? [^116VmaVP]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Beyond the scope of this observational study, a clinical question is whether we need to test TTR levels for therapeutic monitoring at all or more than once. From the available data, the stabilizing effect of tafamidis appears almost universal. Barring a low TTR level from a secondary cause, the data suggest that TTR levels would increase in almost all patients. ATTR-CM is a life-threatening condition with a poor prognosis if untreated; coupled with the astronomical cost of therapy, patients, providers, and insurers are understandably eager to assess response to therapy. However, treatment response in ATTR-CM is challenging for multiple reasons. Given that tafamidis slows the progression of disease, how does one determine whether an individual patient's trajectory represents an adequate response to therapy? Natural history studies, biomarker staging systems, and clinical experience provide perspective but not objective data to determine efficacy in an individual patient. Even therapies that may reverse disease will likely be hampered by the very slowly progressive nature of ATTR-CM. Because this disease likely develops over decades, it may take years to detect clinically significant changes in cardiac imaging parameters. Patients and providers, especially those less familiar with ATTR-CM, will benefit from the virtue of watchful waiting and avoidance of tests that will not change management. In the future, as treatment options are likely to expand beyond TTR stabilizers, perhaps TTR levels will be used to guide therapy. For now, in the absence of proven testing for tafamidis efficacy, close monitoring for heart failure symptoms, disease progression, and eligibility for organ transplantation remain the mainstays of clinical follow-up.

In summary, Falk et al report the observation that serum TTR levels increased with tafamidis use and speculate that TTR levels may provide insight into TTR stability and drug efficacy. There is an ongoing need for more data from both clinical trials and postapproval use to help inform clinical decision making as it pertains to the use of serum TTR levels in monitoring the treatment of patients with ATTR-CM.

Tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy — cost-effectiveness: With assumptions that tafamidis remained effective beyond the clinical trial duration, tafamidis increased average survival by 1.97 years and QALY by 1.29, but despite these benefits tafamidis (with an annual cost of $225 000) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio > $180 000 per QALY gained; the cost would need to decrease by approximately 80% for intermediate value with a cost per QALY ≤ $180 000.

### Design and rationale of the phase 3 ATTR-ACT clinical trial (tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial) [^111JWT9C]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Transthyretin amyloidosis is a rare, life-threatening disease resulting from aggregation and deposition of transthyretin amyloid fibrils in various tissues. There are 2 predominate phenotypic presentations of the disease: transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy, which primarily affects the peripheral nerves, and transthyretin cardiomyopathy (TTR-CM), which primarily affects the heart. However, there is a wide overlap with symptoms at presentation and disease course being highly variable and influenced by the underlying transthyretin mutation, age of the affected individual, sex, and geographic location. Treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis is typically focused on symptom management. Although tafamidis has been shown to delay neurologic progression of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy, there are no approved pharmacologic therapies shown to improve survival in TTR-CM. The natural history of TTR-CM is poorly characterized, which presents difficulties for the design of large-scale trials for new treatments. This review provides a brief overview of TTR-CM and the challenges of identifying clinically meaningful end points and study parameters to determine the efficacy of treatments for rare diseases. The design and rationale behind the ongoing phase 3 ATTR-ACT study (Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial), an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, is also outlined. The ATTR-ACT study will provide important insight into the efficacy and safety of tafamidis for the treatment of TTR-CM.

### Tafamidis treatment for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^112VTWkC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is caused by the deposition of transthyretin amyloid fibrils in the myocardium. The deposition occurs when wild-type or variant transthyretin becomes unstable and misfolds. Tafamidis binds to transthyretin, preventing tetramer dissociation and amyloidogenesis.

Methods

In a multicenter, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 441 patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in a 2:1:2 ratio to receive 80 mg of tafamidis, 20 mg of tafamidis, or placebo for 30 months. In the primary analysis, we hierarchically assessed all-cause mortality, followed by frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations according to the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method. Key secondary end points were the change from baseline to month 30 for the 6-minute walk test and the score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS), in which higher scores indicate better health status.

Results

In the primary analysis, all-cause mortality and rates of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations were lower among the 264 patients who received tafamidis than among the 177 patients who received placebo (P < 0.001). Tafamidis was associated with lower all-cause mortality than placebo (78 of 264 [29.5%] vs. 76 of 177 [42.9%]; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51 to 0.96) and a lower rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, with a relative risk ratio of 0.68 (0.48 per year vs. 0.70 per year; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81). At month 30, tafamidis was also associated with a lower rate of decline in distance for the 6-minute walk test (P < 0.001) and a lower rate of decline in KCCQ-OS score (P < 0.001). The incidence and types of adverse events were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

In patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, tafamidis was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and reduced the decline in functional capacity and quality of life as compared with placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study [^111XBBp6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Mortality inand combined with the long‐term extension study

Patients treated with tafamidis 80 mg in ATTR‐ACT were significantly older than those treated with 20 mg (median 76.0 vs. 73.5 years; P = 0.0405) and tended to have more severe disease as assessed by NYHA classification, NT‐proBNP, and 6MWT distance (online supplementary Table S1). In ATTR‐ACT there was a trend towards a greater survival benefit with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg, which was more pronounced (but not significant) with adjustment by covariates (Figure 2). In the broader cohort of ATTR‐ACT combined with the LTE (including placebo‐treated patients in ATTR‐ACT randomized to tafamidis), the differences in disease severity between the tafamidis 80 and 20 mg groups appeared to be less pronounced (online supplementary Table S2). With the longer exposure of patients in ATTR‐ACT combined with the LTE (median follow‐up 51 months), there was a significant survival benefit with tafamidis 80 vs. 20 mg, with a 30% relative reduction in the risk of death (P = 0.0374). The survival benefit with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg was also significant (P < 0.05) with all covariate adjustments: 39% reduction in risk of death with age adjustment; 36% with NT‐proBNP adjustment; 30% with 6MWT distance adjustment; and 43% with adjustment by all covariates combined (Figure 2).

### Monitoring effectiveness and safety of tafamidis in transthyretin amyloidosis in Italy: a longitudinal multicenter study in a non-endemic area [^1179uEJG]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Tafamidis is a transthyretin (TTR) stabilizer able to prevent TTR tetramer dissociation. There have been a few encouraging studies on Tafamidis efficacy in early-onset inherited transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) due to Val30Met mutation. However, less is known about its efficacy in later disease stages and in non-Val30Met mutations. We performed a multi-center observational study on symptomatic ATTR patients prescribed to receive Tafamidis. We followed up patients according to a standardized protocol including general medical, cardiological and neurological assessments at baseline and every 6 months up to 3 years. Sixty-one (42 males) patients were recruited. Only 28% of enrolled subjects had the common Val30Met mutation, mean age of onset was remarkably late (59 years) and 18% was in advanced disease stage at study entry. Tafamidis proved safe and well-tolerated. One-third of patients did not show significant progression along 36 months, independently from mutation type and disease stage. Neurological function worsened particularly in the first 6 months but progression slowed significantly thereafter. Autonomic function remained stable in 33%, worsened in 56% and improved in 10%. Fifteen percent of patients showed cardiac disease progression and 30% new onset of cardiomyopathy. Overall, Tafamidis was not able to prevent functional progression of the disease in 23 (43%) subjects, including 16 patients who worsened in their walking ability and 12 patients who reached a higher NYHA score during the follow-up period. A higher mBMI at baseline was associated with better preservation of neurological function. In conclusion, neuropathy and cardiomyopathy progressed in a significant proportion of patients despite treatment. However, worsening of neurological function slowed after the first 6 months and also subjects with more advanced neuropathy, as well as patients with non-Val30Met mutation, benefited from treatment. Body weight preservation is an important favorable prognostic factor.

### Tafamidis in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: effects on transthyretin stabilization and clinical outcomes [^113FV7U3]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is a progressive systemic disorder caused by misfolded TTR monomers that cumulatively deposit in the heart and systemically as amyloid.

Methods and Results

This phase 2 open-label trial evaluated the stabilization of TTR tetramers using 20 mg of tafamidis daily at week 6 (primary end point), month 6, and month 12, as well as safety of tafamidis treatment and efficacy with respect to progression of TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. Thirty-one wild-type patients (median age, 76.7 years; 93.5% men) with a median disease duration of 55.6 months and mild to moderate heart failure (96.8%; New York Heart Association, classes I-II) were enrolled. Thirty of 31 patients (96.8%) achieved TTR stabilization after 6 weeks and 25 of 28 patients (89.3%) after 12 months. After 12 months of treatment, 3 patients discontinued prematurely, 2 patients died, 7 patients were hospitalized because of cardiovascular events, 20 of 28 patients demonstrated preserved New York Heart Association classification status, but 15 of 31 (48.4%) patients had clinical progression (eg, admission for cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, and syncope). N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels did not increase significantly over time, troponin I and troponin T increased moderately, and no consistent clinically relevant changes were seen in echocardiographic cardiac assessments. Tafamidis treatment was generally well tolerated although 7 of 31 patients had bouts of diarrhea.

Conclusions

Tafamidis treatment effectively achieved and maintained TTR stabilization and was well tolerated. The absence of significant changes in most biochemical and echocardiographic parameters suggests that further evaluation of tafamidis in TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy is warranted.

### Long-term effects of tafamidis for the treatment of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy [^111u8KYp]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Safety and tolerability assessments

Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring treatment-emergent AEs (AEs that started or worsened between the start of study treatment and 30 days after the last dose). In addition, physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, and recording of vital signs were performed at each clinic visit, and Holter monitoring, echocardiography, and eye examinations with fundal photography were conducted at the 6- and 12-month visits.

Statistical analyses

Efficacy analyses were conducted in the ITT population, which included all patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had an interruption of ≤ 2 months between study Fx-005 and the extension study. As enrollment was constrained by the number of patients who completed study Fx-005 and elected to continue their participation, the sample size in the extension study was not based on formal sample size calculations and the study was not powered specifically for the evaluation of the efficacy measures. To assess efficacy in the extension study, three main hypotheses were proposed in the statistical analysis plan; (i) to determine whether the treatment effect of tafamidis in slowing disease progression over 18 months could be sustained for an additional 12 months (comprising a total of 30 months), we compared the monthly rate of change of the various outcome measures during the extension study (i.e. the last 12 months of treatment) with the monthly rate of change during the first 18 months (i.e. in study Fx-005) in the tafamidis–tafamidis group; (ii) to evaluate the efficacy of tafamidis in slowing disease progression in patients previously given placebo, we compared the monthly rates of change in the outcome measures during the extension study (tafamidis treatment) and study Fx-005 (placebo) in the placebo–tafamidis group; (iii) to assess whether earlier initiation of treatment resulted in better outcomes, we compared the changes in each efficacy measure from the baseline of the double-blind study (Fx-005) with month 12 of the extension study in the tafamidis–tafamidis group and the placebo–tafamidis group.

### Tafamidis in octogenarians with wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis: an international cohort study [^11596FKF]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In real-world clinical practice, octogenarians represent the vast majority of ATTRwt-CM patients. Our data suggest that tafamidis treatment relates to lower mortality, matched for of age, NAC disease stage and NYHA functional class, and without interaction between age and treatment efficacy. Therefore, tafamidis treatment may be considered in ATTRwt-CM octogenarians to improve survival. Nevertheless, mortality under treatment remains considerable and its predictors need further study to rationalize the selection of optimal octogenarian treatment candidates. Octogenarian ATTRwt-CM patients should urgently become the scope of future clinical trial design and inclusion to obtain objective results on treatment efficacy and safety that help guide multidisciplinary and complex, individualized decision-making. In addition, further research should determine optimal octogenarian candidates for disease-modifying treatments, in terms of benefit vs. futility due to very early asymptomatic or too advanced stage.

### Modeling the cost and health impacts of diagnostic strategies in patients with suspected transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis [^112irN1Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Status and Cardiovascular Events

The demographics of the ATTR‐ACT study were used to simulate the patient population; specifically, the model population was 91% male with an average age of 74.5 years. The prevalence of ATTR‐CMP was set at 13%, reflecting a population of patients hospitalized with HF and preserved ventricular function and increased LV wall thickening. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of ATTR‐CMP for PYP was 74% (95% CI, 70%–77%) and 100% (95% CI, 99%–100%) using grade 2 or 3 cardiac uptake on a radionuclide scan in patients in whom a monoclonal process has been excluded, as the definition of a positive study. We chose a high specificity threshold as it forms the basis for the current recommendations of eliminating EMB if the scan is grade 2 or3 positive and a monoclonal process has been excluded. However, in a sensitivity analysis, we used grade 1 or higher cardiac uptake as the definition of a positive study, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 97%–100%) and 68% (95% CI, 59%–77%). For CMR, we used a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI, 79%–95%) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI, 86%–92%), assuming that in addition to late gadolinium enhancement the latest CMR techniques such as T1 mapping would be available. As the diagnostic gold standard of ATTR‐CMP, EMB was assumed to have a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. We conducted the cost‐effectiveness analyses using all‐cause mortality. Annual risk of mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization for patients with HF with and without ATTR‐CMP was derived from population studies and ATTR‐ACT. In patients with amyloidosis undergoing treatment for tafamidis, we applied a hazard rate ratio of 0.70 and 0.68 for all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization, respectively. In the ATTR‐ACT trial, tafamidis was well tolerated and had a similar adverse event rate compared with placebo. Severe side effects were similar between the 2 groups, and permanent discontinuation of the study drug was more common in the placebo arm. For these reasons, we did not model any adverse quality of life effects resulting from taking tafamidis.

Transthyretin amyloid neuropathy — therapy monitoring, approvals, and symptomatic care are detailed. Inotersen can result in injection-site reactions as well as thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis; because of this, platelet counts should be followed weekly, and serum creatinine and the urine protein-creatinine ratio should be followed every 2 weeks. Diflunisal and tafamidis are TTR stabilizers; however, although approved for ATTR-CM, tafamidis does not have approval from the FDA for treatment of ATTRv polyneuropathy, and diflunisal was demonstrated effective in ATTRv polyneuropathy to slow disease progression but is not FDA approved for this indication. Currently, there is no evidence that TTR stabilizers or silencers are beneficial in polyneuropathy associated with ATTRwt amyloidosis. For neuropathic pain, pregabalin, gabapentin, and duloxetine may be beneficial, while tricyclic antidepressants may have increased side effects in many patients with amyloid neuropathy who also may have orthostatic hypotension or other autonomic symptoms such as urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, or constipation. Orthostatic hypotension may improve with increased fluid intake, salt tablets, fludrocortisone, midodrine, or droxidopa; pyridostigmine is another option without the risks of fluid retention or supine hypertension, and compression with knee- or thigh-high compression socks or stockings, and abdominal binders can be helpful without the risk of drug side effects or interactions.

### Association of tafamidis with health status in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis: a post hoc analysis of the ATTR-ACT randomized clinical trial [^116nf3G9]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and minimized patient-reported health status deterioration at 30 months in patients with transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. However, the clinical significance of health status changes remains unclear, particularly in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III symptoms who experienced more cardiovascular-related hospitalizations than those with NYHA class I-II symptoms.

Objective

To evaluate the health status of patients taking tafamidis with baseline NYHA class III symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial post hoc analysis evaluated data for patients with transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis and NYHA class I-III symptoms at baseline who were enrolled in ATTR-ACT, a placebo-controlled study of tafamidis held at 48 sites in 13 countries.

Interventions

Tafamidis meglumine, 80 mg or 20 mg (pooled cohort), vs placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Established thresholds for clinical benefit on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) were used to define response groups (very large decline to very large improvement); the proportion of patients in each group was calculated within each baseline NYHA class.

Results

Among 441 patients (264 tafamidis, 177 placebo), the mean (SD) age was 74.3 (7.0) years; 398 (90%) were male and 43 (10%) were female. Mean (SD) baseline KCCQ-OS scores were 67.3 (21.4) in the tafamidis group and 65.9 (21.7) in the placebo group (range: 0–100, with 100 indicating the best health). There was a significant shift toward better KCCQ-OS scores in patients receiving tafamidis (odds ratio for 10-point improvement 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6–3.4; P < .001). More patients taking tafamidis were alive and not worse at all time points (37% vs 15% at month 30). These findings were similar in patients with NYHA class III symptoms. In patients with NYHA class III symptoms alive at 30 months, improvements in health status were more common (35% vs 10%) and declines were less common (38% vs 57%) with tafamidis vs placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

In ATTR-ACT, although patients with baseline NYHA class III symptoms had worse overall outcomes, treatment with tafamidis yielded better health status compared with placebo.

### Tafamidis for transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy: a randomized, controlled trial [^112B7pfn]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 18 months of tafamidis treatment in patients with early-stage V30M transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP).

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, patients received tafamidis 20 mg QD or placebo. Coprimary endpoints were the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) responder analysis (< 2-point worsening) and treatment-group difference in the mean change from baseline in Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy total score (TQOL) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n = 125). These endpoints were also evaluated in the efficacy-evaluable (EE; n = 87) population. Secondary endpoints, including changes in neurologic function, nutritional status, and TTR stabilization, were analyzed in the ITT population.

Results

There was a higher-than-anticipated liver transplantation dropout rate. No differences were observed between the tafamidis and placebo groups for the coprimary endpoints, NIS-LL responder analysis (45.3% vs 29.5% responders; p = 0.068) and change in TQOL (2.0 vs 7.2; p = 0.116) in the ITT population. In the EE population, significantly more tafamidis patients than placebo patients were NIS-LL responders (60.0% vs 38.1%; p = 0.041), and tafamidis patients had better-preserved TQOL (0.1 vs 8.9; p = 0.045). Significant differences in most secondary endpoints favored tafamidis. TTR was stabilized in 98% of tafamidis and 0% of placebo patients (p < 0.0001). Adverse events were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Although the coprimary endpoints were not met in the ITT population, tafamidis was associated with no trend toward more NIS-LL responders and a significant reduction in worsening of most neurologic variables, supporting the hypothesis that preventing TTR dissociation can delay peripheral neurologic impairment.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that 20 mg tafamidis QD was associated with no difference in clinical progression in patients with TTR-FAP, as measured by the NIS-LL and the Norfolk QOL-DN score. Secondary outcomes demonstrated a significant delay in peripheral neurologic impairment with tafamidis, which was well tolerated over 18 months.

Forest plot of covariate‐adjusted all‐cause mortality in ATTR‐ACT and ATTR‐ACT combined with the long‐term extension study (LTE). Hazard ratios are for: patients in ATTR‐ACT (30 months follow‐up), tafamidis 80 mg (n = 176) compared with 20 mg (n = 88); patients in ATTR‐ACT combined with the LTE and treatment with tafamidis free acid 61 mg (51 months follow‐up), tafamidis 80 mg/tafamidis free acid 61 mg (n = 230) compared with tafamidis 20 mg/tafamidis free acid 61 mg (n = 116). The unadjusted row was based on the prespecified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment, New York Heart Association baseline classification, and genotype in the model. The single covariate‐adjusted rows were generated by adding age, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) (log transformed), and 6‐min walk test (6MWT) distance separately as covariates to the pre‐specified model. The all‐covariate‐adjusted row was generated by adding all covariates to the pre‐specified model. Patients who discontinued due to heart or combined heart and liver transplantation, or due to implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device, were counted as death for these analyses. ✱ p ‐values for ATTR‐ACT combined with the LTE (51 months of follow‐up) were: unadjusted, P = 0.0374; age‐adjusted, P = 0.0054; NT‐proBNP‐adjusted, P = 0.0099; 6MWT‐adjusted, P = 0.0444; age/NT‐proBNP/6MWT‐adjusted, P = 0.0030.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Rare disease drugs and gene therapies — recent scientific advances have led to the approval of first-in-class treatments for several rare cardiovascular diseases (defined in the United States as affecting fewer than 200 000 individuals), and some therapies, such as tafamidis for transthyretin amyloidosis ($250 000 per year), invariably result in unfavorable cost-effectiveness determinations when using traditional $100 000 to $150 000/QALY thresholds. Some bodies have proposed the use of broader ranges for cost-effectiveness thresholds for rare diseases, while others have noted that US policy already provides substantial financial incentives for rare disease therapies, which should be counterbalanced with value-based pricing to ensure access to newly approved therapies, and similar arguments have been made for one-and-done gene therapies. The writing committee recognizes the trade-off between incentivizing innovation and ensuring access, and therefore states, we propose that rare disease drugs and gene therapies be evaluated using the standard cost-effectiveness threshold ($120 000 per QALY gained) for the base-case scenario but with heightened consideration of contextual factors around severity of disease, unmet need, health equity, and access to care. Economic evaluations of gene therapies should report the results of sensitivity analyses that vary the durability of effectiveness and incorporate delayed onset of adverse events, and where available, results of distributional CEAs may provide additional insight into the cost effectiveness of treatments for rare diseases.

### Tafamidis meglumine (Vyndaqel) [^115HLXCK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Tafamidis is a selective stabilizer of TTR. Tafamidis binds to TTR at the thyroxine binding sites, stabilizing the tetramer and slowing dissociation into monomers, the rate-limiting step in the amyloidogenic process.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

A proprietary TTR stabilization assay was utilized as a pharmacodynamic marker and assessed the stability of the TTR tetramer ex vivo. The TTR stabilization assay quantifies immunoturbidimetric measurement of the stable TTR tetramer in plasma pre- and post-treatment with 2-day in vitro denaturation with urea. Using this proprietary assay, a dose-dependent trend for greater TTR tetramer stabilization is observed for VYNDAQEL 80-mg compared to VYNDAQEL 20-mg. However, the clinical relevance of a higher TTR tetramer stabilization towards cardiovascular outcomes is not known.

VYNDAQEL stabilized both the wild-type TTR tetramer and the tetramers of 14 TTR variants tested clinically after once-daily dosing. Tafamidis also stabilized the TTR tetramer for 25 variants tested ex vivo.

VYNDAQEL and VYNDAMAX may decrease serum concentrations of total thyroxine, without an accompanying change in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This reduction in total thyroxine values is probably the result of reduced thyroxine binding to or displacement from transthyretin (TTR) due to the high binding affinity of tafamidis to the TTR thyroxine receptor. No corresponding clinical findings consistent with hypothyroidism have been observed.

Biomarkers associated with heart failure (NT-proBNP and Troponin I) favored VYNDAQEL over placebo.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At approximately 2.2 times the steady state peak plasma concentration (Cmax) at the recommended dose, tafamidis does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

No clinically significant differences in steady state Cmaxand area under the plasma concentration over time curve (AUC) of tafamidis were observed for VYNDAMAX 61-mg capsule compared to VYNDAQEL administered as four 20-mg capsules.

Tafamidis exposure increases proportionally over single (up to 480 mg) or multiple (up to 80 mg) (1 to 6 times the approved recommended dosage) once daily dosing.

The apparent clearance were similar after single and repeated administration of VYNDAQEL 80 mg.

Absorption

Median tafamidis peak concentrations occurred within 4 hours following dosing.

Effect of Food

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tafamidis were observed following administration of a high fat, high calorie meal.

### Early access to tafamidis for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^115DP5xd]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tafamidis is a standard of care treatment for patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). While evidence was being assessed by regulatory authorities, a new, independent, and inclusive cohort of the phase 3 long-term extension study offered early access to tafamidis.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to present safety, mortality, and hospitalization findings for patients who received early access tafamidis.

Methods

Patients with ATTR-CM and who had not taken part in the phase 3 study were able to receive tafamidis free acid 61 mg (the dose later approved) for up to 60 months or until commercial availability in their region. Enrollment criteria were minimal.

Results

Among the 1,476 patients initiating tafamidis in the study between 2018 and 2023, mean (SD) age at enrollment was 76.5 (7.8) years, 88.8% were male, 85.6% had wild-type ATTR-CM, and 52.9% had NYHA functional class II symptoms (I: 14.9%, III: 30.8%, IV: 1.3%). Median exposure and follow-up were 12 (range: 0–55) and 19 (95% CI: 18.4–20.7) months, respectively. Overall, 7.6% of patients reported treatment-related adverse events, with 0.6% considered serious and 0.6% leading to study discontinuation. No new safety signals were identified. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV)-related mortality occurred in 23.4% and 13.8% of patients over the study period. Furthermore, 43.3% and 26.5% of patients had all-cause and CV-related hospitalizations. The total annual CV-related hospitalization rate was 0.26.

Conclusions

In an inclusive patient cohort receiving early access to tafamidis, safety findings were consistent with those reported from other trials and real-world studies. (Long-term Safety of Tafamidis in Subjects With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy; NCT02791230).

Transthyretin (TTR) therapies — kidney-related considerations in cardiac amyloidosis include that in ATTR-CM, the impact of the TTR stabilizer tafamidis on kidney outcomes has not been established and kidney outcomes with tafamidis have not been specifically studied. The use of diflunisal, an NSAID and TTR stabilizer, is not generally recommended for patients with significant kidney impairment, typically eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, or volume overload due to potential deleterious NSAID effects. The TTR silencer inotersen was associated with crescentic glomerulonephritis in 3 of 112 patients (3%) receiving active therapy in a phase 3 ATTRv polyneuropathy trial, which has not been observed with patisiran or vutrisiran.

### Causes of cardiovascular hospitalization and death in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (from the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial [ATTR-ACT]) [^113ab9cX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT), tafamidis significantly reduced mortality and cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations compared with placebo in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). This analysis aimed to assess the causes of CV-related death and hospitalization in ATTR-ACT to provide further insight into the progression of ATTR-CM and efficacy of tafamidis. ATTR-ACT was an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized study. Patients with hereditary or wild-type ATTR-CM were randomized to tafamidis (n = 264) or placebo (n = 177) for 30 months. The independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee determined whether certain investigator-reported events met the definition of disease-related efficacy endpoints using predefined criteria. Cause-specific reasons for CV-related deaths (heart failure [HF], arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, sudden death, stroke, and other CV causes) and hospitalizations (HF, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack/stroke, and other CV causes) were assessed. Total CV-related deaths was 53 (20.1%) with tafamidis and 50 (28.2%) with placebo, with HF (15.5% tafamidis, 22.6% placebo), followed by sudden death (2.7% tafamidis, 5.1% placebo), the most common causes. The number of patients with a CV-related hospitalization was 138 (52.3%) with tafamidis and 107 (60.5%) with placebo; with HF the most common cause (43.2% tafamidis, 50.3% placebo). All predefined causes of CV-related death or hospitalization were less frequent with tafamidis than placebo. In conclusion, these data provide further insight into CV disease progression in patients with ATTR-CM, with HF the most common adjudicated cause of CV-related hospitalization or death in ATTR-ACT. Clinical trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01994889.

### Pharmacological treatment for familial amyloid polyneuropathy [^111jkuZJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Disease-modifying pharmacological agents for transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) have become available in the last decade, but evidence on their efficacy and safety is limited. This review focuses on disease-modifying pharmacological treatment for TTR-related and other FAPs, encompassing amyloid kinetic stabilisers, amyloid matrix solvents, and amyloid precursor inhibitors.

Objectives

To assess and compare the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of disease-modifying pharmacological agents for familial amyloid polyneuropathies (FAPs).

Search Methods

On 18 November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase. We reviewed reference lists of articles and textbooks on peripheral neuropathies. We also contacted experts in the field. We searched clinical trials registries and manufacturers' websites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs investigating any disease-modifying pharmacological agent in adults with FAPs. Disability due to FAP progression was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were severity of peripheral neuropathy, change in modified body mass index (mBMI), quality of life, severity of depression, mortality, and adverse events during the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

The review included four RCTs involving 655 people with TTR-FAP. The manufacturers of the drugs under investigation funded three of the studies. The trials investigated different drugs versus placebo and we did not conduct a meta-analysis. One RCT compared tafamidis with placebo in early-stage TTR-FAP (128 randomised participants). The trial did not explore our predetermined disability outcome measures. After 18 months, tafamidis might reduce progression of peripheral neuropathy slightly more than placebo (Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) in the lower limbs; mean difference (MD) -3.21 points, 95% confidential interval (CI) -5.63 to -0.79; P = 0.009; low-certainty evidence). However, tafamidis might lead to little or no difference in the change of quality of life between groups (Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN) total score; MD -4.50 points, 95% CI -11.27 to 2.27; P = 0.19; very low-certainty evidence). No clear between-group difference was found in the numbers of participants who died (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.74; P = 0.63; very low-certainty evidence), who dropped out due to adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.54; P = 0.73; very low-certainty evidence), or who experienced at least one severe adverse event during the trial (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.62; P = 0.79; very low-certainty evidence). One RCT compared diflunisal with placebo (130 randomised participants). At month 24, diflunisal might reduce progression of disability (Kumamoto Score; MD -4.90 points, 95% CI -7.89 to -1.91; P = 0.002; low-certainty evidence) and peripheral neuropathy (NIS plus 7 nerve tests; MD -18.10 points, 95% CI -26.03 to -10.17; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) more than placebo. After 24 months, changes from baseline in the quality of life measured by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score showed no clear difference between groups for the physical component (MD 6.10 points, 95% CI 2.56 to 9.64; P = 0.001; very low-certainty evidence) and the mental component (MD 4.40 points, 95% CI -0.19 to 8.99; P = 0.063; very low-certainty evidence). There was no clear between-group difference in the number of people who died (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.41; P = 0.17; very low-certainty evidence), in the number of dropouts due to adverse events (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.39 to 10.87; P = 0.39; very low-certainty evidence), and in the number of people who experienced at least one severe adverse event (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.32; P = 0.73; very low-certainty evidence) during the trial. One RCT compared patisiran with placebo (225 randomised participants). After 18 months, patisiran reduced both progression of disability (Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale; least-squares MD 8.90 points, 95% CI 7.00 to 10.80; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) and peripheral neuropathy (modified NIS plus 7 nerve tests - Alnylam version; least-squares MD -33.99 points, 95% CI -39.86 to -28.13; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence) more than placebo. At month 18, the change in quality of life between groups favoured patisiran (Norfolk QOL-DN total score; least-squares MD -21.10 points, 95% CI -27.20 to -15.00; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence). There was little or no between-group difference in the number of participants who died (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.74; P = 0.35; low-certainty evidence), dropped out due to adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.82; P = 0.017; low-certainty evidence), or experienced at least one severe adverse event (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.28; P = 0.58; low-certainty evidence) during the trial. One RCT compared inotersen with placebo (172 randomised participants). The trial did not explore our predetermined disability outcome measures. From baseline to week 66, inotersen reduced progression of peripheral neuropathy more than placebo (modified NIS plus 7 nerve tests - Ionis version; MD -19.73 points, 95% CI -26.50 to -12.96; P < 0.001; moderate-certainty evidence). At week 65, the change in quality of life between groups favoured inotersen (Norfolk QOL-DN total score; MD -10.85 points, 95% CI -17.25 to -4.45; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence). Inotersen may slightly increase mortality (RR 5.94, 95% CI 0.33 to 105.60; P = 0.22; low-certainty evidence) and occurrence of severe adverse events (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.57; P = 0.16; low-certainty evidence) compared to placebo. More dropouts due to adverse events were observed in the inotersen than in the placebo group (RR 8.57, 95% CI 1.16 to 63.07; P = 0.035; low-certainty evidence). There were no studies addressing apolipoprotein AI-FAP, gelsolin-FAP, and beta-2-microglobulin-FAP.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence on the pharmacological treatment of FAPs from RCTs is limited to TTR-FAP. No studies directly compare disease-modifying pharmacological treatments for TTR-FAP. Results from placebo-controlled trials indicate that tafamidis, diflunisal, patisiran, and inotersen may be beneficial in TTR-FAP, but further investigations are needed. Since direct comparative studies for TTR-FAP will be hampered by sample size and costs required to demonstrate superiority of one drug over another, long-term non-randomised open-label studies monitoring their efficacy and safety are needed.

Results

Patient characteristics and transthyretin stabilization in

Of the 548 patients screened for ATTR‐ACT, 441 were randomized to receive tafamidis 80 or 20 mg or placebo (176, 88, and 177, respectively), and 113, 60, and 85 patients, respectively, completed the study. Survival status was collected for all 441 patients at Month 30. Demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in online supplementary Table S1.

Transthyretin stabilization at Month 1 was achieved in a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with tafamidis 80 and 20 mg [144/164 (87.8%) and 67/81 (82.7%) patients, respectively] than with placebo [6/170 (3.5%) patients, P < 0.0001 for both]. Treatment with tafamidis 80 mg also resulted in a greater degree of TTR tetramer stabilization than 20 mg (online supplementary Figure S1 A). Over the 30 months of the study, patients treated with tafamidis 80 mg had higher mean TTR concentrations than those treated with 20 mg or placebo, with tafamidis 20 mg also higher than placebo (online supplementary Figure S1 B).

Efficacy in

In ATTR‐ACT, both tafamidis 80 and 20 mg significantly reduced all‐cause mortality and CV‐related hospitalizations compared with placebo (P = 0.0030 and P = 0.0048, respectively) (Table 1).

Table 1

Tafamidis 80 and 20 mg also both significantly reduced the decline in the 6MWT distance at Month 30 compared with placebo [least squares (LS) mean (standard error, SE) metres, 75.77 (10.08) and 75.57 (13.71), respectively; P < 0.0001 for both], with the effect being observed from Month 6 (Figure 1A).

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics and Demographics

The baseline characteristics were well balanced among the 632 participants who were randomized 2:1 (acoramidis:placebo) in the ATTRibute-CM trial. For 30 months in ATTRibute-CM, participants in the acoramidis group experienced treatment-related benefits, whereas participants in the placebo group experienced a greater degree of disease progression. A total of 438 participants completed treatment in ATTRibute-CM. Of these participants, a total of 389 (89%) met eligibility criteria, including a willingness to discontinue concomitant open-label tafamidis if taken during ATTRibute-CM, and were enrolled in the OLE. Of those, 263 participants who received acoramidis in the ATTRibute-CM trial continued to receive acoramidis in the OLE (continuous acoramidis), and 126 participants who received placebo in ATTRibute-CM switched to open-label acoramidis (placebo to acoramidis). Their baseline characteristics and demographics at entry to the OLE are summarized in Table 1. Of particular importance are parameters associated with progression of disease or predictive of mortality (New York Heart Association class, NT-proBNP levels, National Amyloidosis Centre stage, and serum transthyretin levels).

### Effect of tafamidis on renal function in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in ATTR-ACT [^112J7JKQ]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure/restrictive cardiomyopathy and carries a poor prognosis. Tafamidis is a transthyretin protein stabilizer that was found to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations compared with placebo in ATTR-ACT (Safety and Efficacy of Tafamidis in Patients With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy). This was coupled with changes in 6-minute walk test distance and patient-reported health status (as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) significantly favoring treatment with tafamidis.

Renal failure is common in patients with heart failure, and the degree of renal dysfunction predicts excess mortality. Renal dysfunction is also comorbid with amyloidosis, and patients in ATTR-ACT on average had stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effect of amyloid-specific treatment on renal function in patients with ATTR-CM is unclear. In this analysis, we investigated the hypothesis that patients treated with tafamidis have significant stabilization or improvement in renal function compared with placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of tafamidis doses in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial (ATTR-ACT) and long-term extension study [^114Cb4bD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Efficacy outcomes

The primary analysis in ATTR‐ACT was a hierarchical combination of all‐cause mortality (in which transplantation, either heart or combined heart and liver, or implantation of cardiac mechanical assist device were counted as death) and frequency of CV‐related hospitalizations for pooled tafamidis compared with placebo using the Finkelstein–Schoenfeld method. 14, 15, 18 Here, this analysis was conducted separately for each tafamidis dose (80 and 20 mg) compared with placebo. The key secondary endpoints were change from baseline to Month 30 in the distance walked during the 6MWT 19 and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary (KCCQ‐OS) score, based on a subset of the 23‐item, patient‐completed KCCQ that assesses HRQoL. 20 Additional secondary analyses included CV‐related mortality and TTR stabilization at Month 1. Exploratory endpoints included change from baseline to Month 30 in NT‐proBNP and troponin I concentrations, and TTR stabilization and TTR concentration throughout the study. The TTR stabilization assay was performed using plasma samples (LabCorp, Los Angeles, CA, USA). 10, 11, 12

All‐cause mortality with tafamidis 80 mg compared with 20 mg was assessed over a longer duration of treatment by combining data from ATTR‐ACT (median follow‐up 30 months) with the LTE (median follow‐up 51 months). In addition to ATTR‐ACT data alone, analyses were conducted for ATTR‐ACT combined with LTE patients, which included the additional exposure to tafamidis free acid 61 mg after patients transitioned to the new 61 mg formulation (as of 1 August 2019). Patients continued to be compared based on their initial dose randomization (tafamidis 80 vs. 20 mg).

### Effect of tafamidis on renal function in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in ATTR-ACT [^11243YE7]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients who completed ATTR-ACT, a greater proportion treated with tafamidis vs placebo had an improvement in eGFR from baseline to 30 months (defined as change > 0 mL/min/1.73 m 2) when assessed using continuous eGFR (35.3% vs 22. 9%; OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.01–3.35). A sensitivity analysis was performed assuming participants with missing month 30 data did not improve, noting a higher proportion of patients with improved eGFR randomized to tafamidis vs placebo (22.7% vs 10.7%; OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.40–4.27).

Additionally, in patients who completed ATTR-ACT, improvement in renal function assessed by CKD staging was more common with tafamidis vs placebo treatment (17.7% vs 7.2%), and worsening of CKD stage was more common with placebo (42.2% vs 34.1%) (Figure 1A). There was a 2.75 times greater odds of improved CKD stage with randomization to tafamidis vs placebo (95% CI: 1.10–6.90; P = 0.034). At 30 months, patients were more likely to remain in better CKD stages if randomized to tafamidis vs placebo (Figure 1B).

The composite endpoint (all-cause death, kidney transplant, dialysis initiation, or ≥ 30% decline in eGFR from baseline) was reached in a lower proportion of patients in the tafamidis group compared with the placebo group (crude rates 34.5% vs 44.1%; HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.54–0.99; P = 0.040) (Table 2, with Kaplan-Meier plot taking censoring into account in Figure 2). This was irrespective of dose and driven by fewer all-cause deaths or declines in eGFR at 30 months because only 3 patients in the study received dialysis or underwent kidney transplantation (Table 2).

### Improvements in efficacy measures with Tafamidis in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical Trial [^1115wDxx]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical evaluations and statistical analyses

This post hoc analysis describes patients with improved efficacy measures compared with baseline in the pooled tafamidis (80 mg and 20 mg) and placebo cohorts at all available time points throughout the ATTR-ACT. Efficacy measures were 6MWT distance, KCCQ-OS score (on a 0–100 scale, where 0 = severe symptoms or limitations and 100 = no symptoms or limitations and excellent quality of life), NT-proBNP concentration, PGA of overall health (categories: "very much improved", "much improved", "minimally improved", "no change from baseline", "minimally worse", "much worse", "very much worse"), and NYHA functional class (I-IV)summarized at all available time points for the pooled tafamidis and placebo cohorts. The 6MWT, KCCQ-OS, PGA, and NYHA assessments were conducted at baseline and every 6 months over the duration of ATTR-ACT. The NT-proBNP concentration was assessed at baseline, month 12, and month 30. Improvement was defined at each assessment as a change from baseline of > 0 for 6MWT distance and KCCQ-OS score; < 0 for NT-proBNP concentration; a lower NYHA class relative to baseline; or improvement reported in the PGA (Supplemental Table 1).

This post hoc analysis included all patients who received treatment and were evaluated for ≥ 1 post baseline efficacy evaluation. Outcomes were the proportion of patients with improvement and the OR for improvement (tafamidis vs placebo) with 95% CI and P value. Missing data were imputed as not improved, but separate analyses of observed data (without imputation) are provided.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of acoramidis in ATTR-CM: initial report from the open-label extension of the ATTRibute-CM trial [^111NxZp3]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes analyzed with the more commonly used time-to-event approach of the clinical outcome of ACM or first CVH when extended to month 42 confirm the robust and persistent treatment effect that was observed as early as month 3 in ATTRibute-CM (Figure 2 ;). We evaluated this in a similar analysis of first CVH alone that also confirms the robustness and persistence of the treatment effect on CVH observed in ATTRibute-CM through 42 months of continuous acoramidis treatment in the OLE.

The time-to-event analyses, unlike the win ratio and Finkelstein-Schoenfeld test used for the primary end point in ATTRibute-CM, do not account for recurrent CVH events. We include in this report results from a negative binomial regression analysis to document the robust and sustained treatment effect of acoramidis not only on ACM and first CVH but also on recurrent CVH events. Taken together, these analyses of clinical outcomes demonstrate consistency across several different analytical approaches to the ATTRibute-CM trial and its OLE. The exclusion from the OLE of participants who received open-label tafamidis in ATTRibute-CM was nonrandomized and reduced the potential participation of patients who otherwise completed treatment in ATTRibute-CM and would have been eligible to enter the OLE except for their decision to not participate (mainly to continue open-label treatment with tafamidis). Although this is a potential limitation of the OLE (see below), it removes a potential confounder from the long-term data on the efficacy and safety of acoramidis.

We included analyses of the prognostic biomarker NT-proBNP and an assessment of functional capacity (6MWD) in the OLE to extend the observations from ATTRibute-CM. Findings of continued suppression of a progressive increase in NT-proBNP and relative preservation of functional capacity by 6MWD extend the robust treatment effect of acoramidis to 42 months of treatment.

Consistent with the early separation in the trajectory of the treatment effect of acoramidis on CVH at month 3, early separation was also observed in NT-proBNP between months 3 and 6 and in quality of life as assessed by KCCQ-OS score by month 3. Given the limited evidence from a single study, any consideration of a potential mechanism of how these early treatment effects might be interrelated would be speculative, but the observation identifies an area for additional investigation.

Statistical analyses

Unless stated otherwise, all analyses were carried out on the modified intent‐to‐treat population of the randomized controlled study, which included all randomized patients with at least one post‐baseline efficacy evaluation and who received at least one dose of study drug.

Details on the statistical analyses have previously been published. 14, 15 Here, the two doses of tafamidis were compared with placebo using the Finkelstein–Schoenfeld method, 18 as applied in the primary analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyse all‐cause mortality. Poisson regression analysis was used to analyse frequency of CV‐related hospitalization. Secondary and exploratory endpoints (NT‐proBNP and troponin I) were evaluated at each time point post‐baseline using a mixed model repeated measures ANCOVA (MMRM) with an unstructured covariance matrix (or as appropriate), centre, and patients within centre as random effects. The fixed effects were treatment, visit, TTR genotype (ATTRv vs. ATTRwt), and visit by treatment interaction; and baseline score was used as a covariate. For all MMRM analyses, there was no imputation of missing values. The proportion of patients achieving TTR stabilization at Month 1 was compared using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.

All‐cause mortality in ATTR‐ACT alone and combined with the LTE was assessed as above, based on the pre‐specified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment, NYHA baseline classification, and genotype in the model, and also separately adjusted for additional covariates by adding age, NT‐proBNP (log transformed), and 6MWT distance as covariates to the pre‐specified model (both individually and all three combined). Time of initiation of tafamidis was used as time zero in all survival analyses.

### Atrial fibrillation as a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^113S7G8c]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a fatal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) in the extracellular matrix of the heart, leading to progressive heart failure, conduction system disease, and arrhythmias. ATTR-CM can be classified as wild-type, in which no mutation in the TTR gene is identified, or variant, in which a mutation is present. Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are among the most common manifestations of ATTR-CM, occurring in up to 70% of patients, and the prevalence of these conditions increases with severity of ATTR-CM. AF/AFL can be poorly tolerated in patients with ATTR-CM owing to diastolic dysfunction and is associated with a significantly increased risk of thromboembolic events. However, prior studies suggest that AF/AFL is not predictive of mortality in patients with ATTR-CM.,

Tafamidis is a transthyretin kinetic stabilizer that inhibits tetramer dissociation, the initial step in amyloid formation, of wild-type and variant transthyretin. The phase III ATTR-ACT (Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial) evaluated the efficacy and safety of tafamidis (20 or 80 mg) vs placebo in patients with wild-type and hereditary ATTR-CM. Primary results showed that tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality and the rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations over 30 months (combined primary outcome). The aim of this analysis of ATTR-ACT data was to evaluate baseline or historical AF/AFL at the time of enrollment as a potential prognostic factor for all-cause mortality.

### Effect of tafamidis on clinical and functional parameters in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^111ovjmC]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis is an increasingly recognized and potentially fatal disease. Amyloidosis with cardiac involvement potentiates the development of arrhythmia, reduces myocardial contractility, and eventually leads to adverse cardiovascular events. Among the subtypes, light chain amyloidosis has been known for decades and managed with medications targeting plasma cells. Recently, transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) has been recognized, characterized by the excessive infiltration of misfolded transthyretin protein in the myocardial extracellular space and target organs. Many potential therapeutic targets have been identified for ATTR-CM, of which the transthyretin stabilizer tafamidis is the first well-established disease-modifying medication. The ATTR-ACT (Safety and Efficacy of Tafamidis in Patients With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy) trialdemonstrated that tafamidis was a first-in-class medication that improved all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, functional decline, and quality of life. Till now, tafamidis is the only new agent approved for ATTR-CM on both hereditary and wild-types.

The better clinical endpoints in patients with ATTR-CM who receive tafamidis treatment have been attributed to attenuated cardiac remodeling by amyloid deposition. Various imaging modalities have been applied to assess anatomical, structural, and functional changes. Echocardiography has been traditionally used to assess cardiac structure and function. However, traditional 2-dimensional echocardiographic parameters may be suboptimal for monitoring the disease course of ATTR-CM due to the subtle changes that occur during its progression. Speckle tracking echocardiography can provide additional information as it assesses the degree and regional pattern of compromised global longitudinal strain (GLS), and it has been shown to be a good screening and prognostic tool for ATTR-CM. Regarding other modalities, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is used to evaluate amyloid infiltration and interstitial fibrosis via late gadolinium enhancement, native T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV), and technetium-99m scintigraphy is used to quantify radiotracer uptake in the myocardium by planar imaging, therein illustrating regional amyloid accumulation. Nevertheless, CMR and cardiac scintigraphy are still not typically repeated in clinical practice to monitor disease activity.

### Improvements in efficacy measures with Tafamidis in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical Trial [^112WzSQZ]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This post hoc analysis of data from ATTR-ACT shows that a proportion of patients with ATTR-CM demonstrate improvements in heart failure, physical function, and quality of life measures at time points over 30 months of treatment with tafamidis or placebo. Although both cohorts showed a mean decline in health over the study duration, at all time points assessed, the proportion of patients with improvements from baseline was higher with tafamidis treatment than with placebo treatment. Furthermore, the OR for improvement favored tafamidis in all assessments. Our findings extend the understanding of the clinical expectation of tafamidis treatment and have important clinical implications for patients with ATTR-CM.

ATTR-ACT was a pivotal phase 3 trial that led to the approval of tafamidis for use in the treatment of patients with ATTR-CM. The published primary outcomes showed mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations to be significantly reduced in tafamidis-treated patients compared with those in placebo-treated patients at 30 months. Recently published observations additionally showed that improvement in KCCQ-OS score and PGA of overall health at month 30 was reported in a larger proportion of tafamidis-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The current post hoc analysis looked at improvement in a range of efficacy assessments over the course of the ATTR-ACT. To allow for potential bias in the observed data, we employed imputation to account for patients who discontinued or had missing data, assuming their condition to have deteriorated. Comparable trends were also seen with the observed data.

Our findings confirm that improvement in quality of life (as assessed by KCCQ-OS score and PGA of overall health) is more likely with tafamidis than with placebo treatment through 30 months of treatment. Similar conclusions can also be extended to measures of heart failure (NT-proBNP concentration) and physical function (6MWT distance and NYHA class). We note that improvement from baseline requires varying degrees of change for each efficacy measure. Moreover, no single measure of heart failure symptoms is able to fully characterize a patient's condition. For these reasons, it is perhaps more valuable to consider the trends across measures rather than the absolute proportions of patients showing improvement, or ORs. Across all efficacy measures, our results showed tafamidis treatment to be associated with a higher likelihood of improvement. The difference between tafamidis treatment and placebo treatment grew over the duration of the ATTR-ACT.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, and the role of senile amyloidosis [^114zNmt6]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological considerations

Therapeutic management of HFpEF and AF (and the combination thereof) is beyond the scope of this review and for this the reader is referred to the guidelines. Of note, although these guidelines generally also apply in the setting of concomitant amyloidosis, one issue should be mentioned here and that is that use of digoxin and calcium-antagonists for rate control for AF is not recommended given the risk of toxicity due to possible binding of these agents to amyloid fibrils. The focus here is on the pharmacological treatment of amyloidosis. In general, treatment of ATTR can be divided into three approaches: (i) stabilization of the TTR tetramers, (ii) suppression of the production of TTR by the liver, and (iii) removal of TTR amyloid deposits from tissues. An example of the first approach is the use of Diflunisal. This compound prevents dissociation of TTR into its monomers and has been shown to retard progression of polyneuropathy caused by ATTRm although no effect on cardiac involvement has been demonstrated as yet. The other available TTR tetramer stabilizer is Tafamidis and this agent does not have the NSAID side-effects of Diflunisal. It has already proved to be efficacious for neurological manifestations but very recently, in the ATTR-ACT study, Tafamidis was also shown to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with cardiac involvement. Of note, although these are very promising results it is as yet uncertain whether Tafamidis would also be beneficial in patients with concomitant AF. The second approach entails gene-silencing, aimed at suppressing the production of TTR by the liver by harnessing small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNA) or antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). Two such suppressors are now available: Patisiran (siRNA) and Inotersen (ASO). Both agents appear to have favourable effects on polyneuropathy, while Patisiran possibly also stops further worsening of the cardiomyopathy, but since this was only a secondary endpoint, it needs to be proven in a new study. Finally, treatment with anti-serum amyloid P (SAP) antibodies (Dezamizumab) after pre-treatment with CPHPC (Miridesap) to remove circulating SAP is a promising third approach, aimed at removing amyloid fibrils from the tissues. Initial results with these removers in patients with systemic amyloidosis with liver, spleen and kidney involvement are promising. Of note, although there is currently no treatment for IAA, theoretically treatment with anti-SAP antibodies might work in this setting, but this obviously needs to be proven.

Management of amyloid neuropathy — approved transthyretin (TTR)–silencing therapies, mechanisms, clinical effects, and supportive measures are described. There are currently 3 medications that are approved by the FDA for ATTRv polyneuropathy (tafamidis is also approved in Europe for polyneuropathy). TTR silencers act by blocking the translation of RNA to synthesize the protein transthyretin; patisiran and vutrisiran are small interfering RNAs and inotersen is an antisense oligonucleotide. These 3 TTR silencers reduce progression of polyneuropathy versus placebo, with cohort-level stabilization or reversal of disease progression in pivotal trials. Early diagnosis and treatment matter because delaying treatment by 1 year or more is associated with worse neuropathy impairment and quality-of-life measures. Because transthyretin transports retinol, daily vitamin A 3,000 IU supplementation is needed when these medications are prescribed; with patisiran, infusion-related reactions may occur and premedication is recommended with corticosteroid.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use and outcomes in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^114UCDSK]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is caused by myocardial deposition of misfolded transthyretin protein-forming amyloid fibrils which can result in symptomatic heart failure (HF). The only medication currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ATTR-CM is tafamidis which has been shown to reduce cardiovascular-related hospitalization and all-cause mortality (ACM).

What is the clinical question being addressed?

What is the effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor among transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy patients?

What is the main finding?

The use of SGLT2i is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and cardiac arrest), and ischemic stroke in patients with ATTR-CM.

The increase in LS mean (SE) levels of NT‐proBNP from baseline to Month 30 (online supplementary Table S3) was significantly reduced with tafamidis 80 mg compared with placebo [−2587.54 (570.25), P < 0.0001], while there was a trend towards a reduction with tafamidis 20 mg compared with placebo [−1417.02 (743.38), P = 0.0571]. Notably, while the increase in NT‐proBNP at Month 30 was lower with each dose of tafamidis separately compared with placebo, the increase with tafamidis 80 mg was also significantly lower than with 20 mg [−1170.51 (587.31), P = 0.0468] (Figure 3A).

### Efficacy of tafamidis in patients with hereditary and wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: further analyses from ATTR-ACT [^114Fewpx]. JACC: Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Tafamidis is an effective treatment for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), this study aimed to determine whether there is a differential effect between variant transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) and wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt).

Background

ATTR-CM is a progressive, fatal disorder resulting from mutations in the ATTRv or the deposition of denatured ATTRwt.

Methods

In pre-specified analyses from ATTR-ACT (Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial), baseline characteristics, all-cause mortality, and change from baseline to month 30 in 6-min walk test distance and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score were compared in patients with ATTRwt and ATTRv.

Results

There were 335 patients with ATTRwt (201 tafamidis, 134 placebo) and 106 with ATTRv (63 tafamidis, 43 placebo) enrolled in ATTR-ACT. Patients with ATTRwt (vs. ATTRv) had less advanced disease at baseline and a lower rate of disease progression over the study. The reduction in all-cause mortality with tafamidis compared with placebo was not different between ATTRwt (hazard ratio: 0.706 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.474 to 1.052]; p = 0.0875) and ATTRv (hazard ratio: 0.690 [95% CI: 0.408 to 1.167]; p = 0.1667). Tafamidis was associated with a similar reduction (vs. placebo) in the decline in 6-min walk test distance in ATTRwt (mean ± SE difference from placebo, 77.14 ± 10.78; p < 0.0001) and ATTRv (79.61 ± 29.83 m; p = 0.008); and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score in ATTRwt (12.72 ± 2.10; p < 0.0001) and ATTRv (18.18 ± 7.75; p = 0.019).

Conclusions

Pre-specified analyses from ATTR-ACT confirm the poor prognosis of untreated ATTRv-related cardiomyopathy compared with ATTRwt, but show the reduction in mortality and functional decline with tafamidis treatment is similar in both disease subtypes.

### Effect of tafamidis on renal function in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in ATTR-ACT [^111jNFUP]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Progressive renal dysfunction is common in patients with ATTR-CM and heart failure and is a harbinger for other adverse outcomes such as hospitalization and death. In this post hoc analysis of ATTR-ACT, we found that treatment with tafamidis was associated with reduced progression of renal dysfunction in patients with ATTR-CM. Similarly, more patients were alive with stable renal function if randomized to tafamidis vs placebo. These data have important implications for the multisystem benefit of disease-modifying therapy in ATTR-CM.

Renal dysfunction is common in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Baseline creatinine concentration was 1.4 mg/dL with eGFR of 56 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in this study, and 60% of patients had CKD stage 3 or worse. The staging system for transthyretin amyloid cardiac amyloidosis from the United Kingdom incorporates eGFR into disease stage, and the baseline eGFR was 61 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in that cohort of 869 patients. In light chain amyloidosis, an elevated serum creatinine concentration is associated with more severe disease, although measures of renal function are not included in either the Mayo or Boston University staging systems.

It is thought that cardiorenal syndrome is the most common pathophysiologic mechanism of progressive renal dysfunction in cardiac amyloidosis. The reduction in cardiac output and renal blood flow seen in severe amyloid cardiomyopathy coupled with venous congestion sets the stage for abnormalities in renal function. Amyloid cardiomyopathy leads to biventricular dysfunction, and increases in right atrial pressure are most correlated with CKD severity. Amyloidosis may also lead to ascites and elevated intra-abdominal pressure, contributing to renal compression and decreased perfusion. However, direct deposition of amyloid fibrils in the renal parenchyma may also be a factor in some cases and subtypes. In light chain cardiac amyloidosis, renal dysfunction may stem from direct light chain deposition in the vascular, tubulointerstitial, and/or glomerular structures in the kidneys, and proteinuria may result from glomerular deposition. In ATTR-CM, direct deposition of the transthyretin protein is relatively uncommon, although it has been noted in pathologic samples from patients, particularly in those with hereditary disease. It is possible that imaging studies using amyloid-specific nuclear radiotracers will help clarify the prevalence of direct amyloid deposition in the kidneys. We postulate that the stabilization of renal dysfunction seen with tafamidis vs placebo is most likely related to a slower progression of the cardiorenal syndrome.

### Treatment of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis: an update [^115JU6GD]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Transthyretin (TTR) is a tetrameric protein synthesized mostly by the liver. As a result of gene mutations or as an ageing-related phenomenon, TTR molecules may misfold and deposit in the heart and in other organs as amyloid fibrils. Cardiac involvement in TTR-related amyloidosis (ATTR) manifests typically as left ventricular pseudohypertrophy and/or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. ATTR is an underdiagnosed disorder as well as a crucial determinant of morbidity and mortality, thus justifying the current quest for a safe and effective treatment. Therapies targeting cardiac damage and its direct consequences may yield limited benefit, mostly related to dyspnoea relief through diuretics. For many years, liver or combined heart and liver transplantation have been the only available treatments for patients with mutations causing ATTR, including those with cardiac involvement. The therapeutic options now include several pharmacological agents that inhibit hepatic synthesis of TTR, stabilize the tetramer, or disrupt fibrils. Following the positive results of a phase 3 trial on tafamidis, and preliminary findings on patisiran and inotersen in patients with ATTR-related neuropathy and cardiac involvement, we provide an update on this rapidly evolving field, together with practical recommendations on the management of cardiac involvement.

### Survival in a real-world cohort of patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy treated with tafamidis: an analysis from the transthyretin amyloidosis outcomes survey (THAOS) [^111WcM6K]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the pivotal Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial (ATTR-ACT), tafamidis significantly reduced mortality rates, leading to its approval in many countries for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Real-world evidence on survival in patients with ATTR-CM following tafamidis treatment has not been extensively reported.

Methods and Results

The Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS) was a longitudinal, observational, phase 4 study of patients with transthyretin amyloidosis and asymptomatic participants carrying pathogenic transthyretin variants. Patients from THAOS with a predominantly cardiac phenotype at enrollment were included, and survival was analyzed according to tafamidis treatment status (treated or untreated). Results are based on the completed THAOS dataset. In tafamidis-treated (n = 587) and tafamidis-untreated (n = 854) patients, respectively, median age at enrollment was 77.7 and 76.4 years, 91.8% and 90.0% were male, and 91.8% and 83.8% had wild-type disease. Survival rates (95% CI) at 30 and 42 months, respectively, were 84.4% (80.5–87.7) and 76.8% (70.9–81.7) in tafamidis-treated patients, and 70.0% (66.4–73.2) and 59.3% (55.2–63.0) in tafamidis-untreated patients. Survival rates in genotype subgroups (wild-type and variant) were similar to those of the overall cohort. Survival rates were better in a contemporary cohort, as reflected by a sensitivity analysis performed in patients enrolled after vs before 2019. No new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

In this real-world cohort of patients with ATTR-CM, survival rates were higher than in ATTR-ACT and consistent with more recent reports, suggesting early diagnosis and treatment with tafamidis has improved life expectancy in ATTR-CM. These results provide further evidence supporting tafamidis' safety and effectiveness.

### Long-term effects of tafamidis for the treatment of transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy [^113PBmCG]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A mixed-model analysis of variance was used to assess the sustainability of the treatment effect, and the efficacy of tafamidis in slowing disease progression in patients previously given placebo, with the measurement at different visits as the dependent variable, and the study-by-treatment interaction and the time-by-study-by-treatment interaction as independent variables. The intercept and time variables were modeled as random effects. The test of treatment effect was based on the time-by-study-by-treatment interaction. If each patient underwent the same number of observations, the model would be equivalent to a 2-stage analysis, in which the slope of each patient's efficacy measure is determined by linear regression for Fx-005 and Fx-006 separately and the slopes within treatment groups are compared between the studies using a paired t test. To evaluate the early-start treatment effects, the changes from the pretreatment baseline of study Fx-005 to the end of the extension study by treatment sequence were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Muscle weakness at the individual joint locations (toe, ankle, knee, and hip) was also evaluated for early-start treatment effect.

Safety analyses were performed on all patients who received at least one dose of the study medication (i.e. the safety population).

### Effect of tafamidis on renal function in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in ATTR-ACT [^112BeMnJ]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

ATTR-ACT was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial of tafamidis vs placebo in patients with ATTR-CM. Briefly, patients with NYHA functional class I, II, or III heart failure and 18 to 90 years of age were eligible for enrollment if their N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide concentration was ≥ 600 pg/mL and their 6-minute walk test distance was > 100 m. Patients requiring dialysis or those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 of body surface area (by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) were excluded. Randomization to study drug vs placebo proceeded on a 2:1:2 basis (tafamidis meglumine 80 mg, tafamidis meglumine 20 mg, or placebo). Currently, a free acid formulation of tafamidis is available at 61 mg, which is bioequivalent to the tafamidis meglumine 80-mg dose. The primary outcome was the hierarchical combination of death and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalization at 30 months as analyzed using the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method. The study followed the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each institution. All patients provided written informed consent.

Results

Patient Demographics

The ATTR-ACT cohort included 176 patients treated with tafamidis 80 mg and 177 treated with placebo. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of these groups have been published previously. Briefly, tafamidis 80 mg patients were 89.8% male and 77.3% White (compared with 88.7% male and 82.5% White in the placebo group). Tafamidis 80 mg patients (versus placebo) tended to be older (median 76.0 versus 74.0 years). Overall, the majority of patients were ATTRwt (75.9%), with 24.1% ATTRv, of which Val122Ile was the most common mutation. At month 30 in ATTR-ACT, before enrolling in the LTE, patients treated with placebo had more severe disease than those treated with tafamidis 80 mg (Table 1).

Table 1.
Patient Characteristics at Month 30 in ATTR-ACT

A total of 110 patients treated with tafamidis 80 mg continued in the LTE (and continued to receive tafamidis 80 mg). A total of 82 placebo-treated patients continued in the LTE, 54 of whom were randomized to tafamidis 80 mg and 28 to tafamidis 20 mg. As of the data cutoff for this analysis, the median follow-up was 58.5 months in the continuous tafamidis group and 57.1 months in the placebo to tafamidis group.

### Impact of tafamidis on health-related quality of life in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (from the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical trial) [^113phAni]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial, tafamidis significantly reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). ATTR-CM is associated with a significant burden of disease; further analysis of patient-reported quality of life will provide additional data on the efficacy of tafamidis. In the Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial, 441 adult patients with ATTR-CM were randomized (2:1:2) to tafamidis 80 mg, tafamidis 20 mg, or placebo for 30 months, with pooled tafamidis (80 mg and 20 mg) compared with placebo. Change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) domain scores, EQ-5D-3L scores, and patient global assessment, were prespecified exploratory end points. A greater proportion of patients improved KCCQ-OS score at month 30 with tafamidis (41.8%) versus placebo (21.4%). Tafamidis significantly reduced the decline in all 4 KCCQ-OS domains (p < 0.0001 for all), and in EQ-5D-3L utility (0.09 [confidence interval 0.05 to 0.12]; p < 0.0001) and EQ visual analog scale (9.11 [confidence interval 5.39 to 12.83]; p < 0.0001) scores at month 30 versus placebo. A larger proportion of tafamidis-treated patients reported their patient global assessment improved at month 30 (42.3% vs 23.8% with placebo). In conclusion, tafamidis effectively reduced the decline in patient-reported outcomes, providing further insight into its efficacy in health-related quality of life in patients with ATTR-CM.

### Acoramidis hydrochloride (Attruby) [^1145NKPD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of ATTRUBY was demonstrated in a multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 611 adult patients with wild-type or variant (hereditary or de novo) ATTR-CM (NCT03860935).

Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive ATTRUBY 712 mg (n = 409) or placebo (n = 202) twice daily for 30 months. Treatment assignment was stratified by type of ATTR-CM [variant (ATTRv-CM) or wild-type (ATTRwt-CM)], NT-proBNP level, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The mean age of study participants was 77 years, 90.8% were male, 87.9% were White, 4.7% Black or African American, 2.1% Asian, 5.3% race other, 19% had a history of permanent pacemaker and 58% had a history of atrial fibrillation. No significant imbalance in baseline characteristics was observed between the two treatment groups.

Participants were permitted to initiate open-label tafamidis after 12 months in the study. A total of 107 participants received tafamidis: 61 (14.9%) in the ATTRUBY arm and 46 (22.8%) in the placebo arm. The median time to initiation of tafamidis for these 107 participants was 17 months.

Change from baseline with tafamidis 80 mg, tafamidis 20 mg, and placebo in (A) 6‐min walk test (6MWT) distance and (B) Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary (KCCQ‐OS) in ATTR‐ACT. P ‐values are for the treatment difference vs. placebo for tafamidis 80 mg (shown above the curve) and tafamidis 20 mg (shown below the curve). LS, least squares; SE, standard error.

Similarly, the change from baseline to Month 30 in KCCQ‐OS score showed a reduction in decline in patients treated with both tafamidis 80 and 20 mg compared with placebo [LS mean (SE), 13.48 (2.20) and 13.99 (2.96), respectively, P < 0.0001 for both] (Figure 1B). The effect was observed from Month 6 with tafamidis 80 mg and from Month 12 with 20 mg (Figure 1B).

Treatment with tafamidis 80 mg significantly reduced all‐cause mortality vs. placebo [Cox proportional hazards model (95% confidence interval, CI): 0.690 (0.487–0.979), P = 0.0378]. There was a trend towards improvement with tafamidis 20 mg vs. placebo [Cox proportional hazards model (95% CI): 0.715 (0.450–1.137), P = 0.1564].

The frequency of CV‐related hospitalizations was significantly lower with both tafamidis 80 and 20 mg compared with placebo (Table 1). There was a trend towards reduced CV‐related mortality with both doses of tafamidis compared with placebo [Cox proportional hazards model (95% CI): 0.690 (0.470–1.012), P = 0.0579 for tafamidis 80 mg; and 0.678 (0.404–1.139), P = 0.1421 for 20 mg].

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on comprehensive multidisciplinary care for the patient With cardiac amyloidosis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112HMYUK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis — tafamidis access, patient selection, and alternatives emphasize practical barriers, uncertain benefit in some populations, and limited data for substitutes. Access is challenged because "tafamidis administration for individual patients frequently relies on copayment assistance programs", and barriers include "the availability of and difficulty navigating the copayment assistance programs and authorization process". Patients less likely to benefit include those excluded from ATTR-ACT, such as "patients with NYHA functional class IV status and advanced HF, or those of advanced age (90 years or older), although use in such patients should be based on an individualized shared decision-making discussion". Early-disease efficacy remains uncertain, including "asymptomatic genetic carriers without clinically evident cardiac amyloidosis or those with localized, noncardiac disease, such deposits identified at the time of carpal tunnel surgery". For functional outcomes, "early evidence suggests that treatment can improve exercise capacity, as defined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing, in approximately 50% of treated patients". While "tafamidis should remain the first-line agent in the treatment of ATTR-CM as the only available approved agent", an alternative stabilizer is diflunisal, for which "the cost of diflunisal is approximately $25 to $50 per month, rendering it an alternative option for those who are "too well" or those patients who cannot afford tafamidis", although "only limited retrospective data inform its use in ATTR-CM", despite data that "diflunisal was superior to placebo in slowing neurologic disease progression in the randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ATTR polyneuropathy".

### Long-term survival with tafamidis in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy [^111ww7s2]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tafamidis is approved in many countries for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. This study reports data on the long-term efficacy of tafamidis from an ongoing long-term extension (LTE) to the pivotal ATTR-ACT (Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial).

Methods

Patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy who completed ATTR-ACT could enroll in an LTE, continuing with the same tafamidis dose or, if previously treated with placebo, randomized (2:1) to tafamidis meglumine 80 or 20 mg. All patients in the LTE transitioned to tafamidis free acid 61 mg (bioequivalent to tafamidis meglumine 80 mg) following a protocol amendment. In this interim analysis, all-cause mortality was assessed in patients treated with tafamidis meglumine 80 mg in ATTR-ACT continuing in the LTE, compared with those receiving placebo in ATTR-ACT transitioning to tafamidis in the LTE.

Results

Median follow-up was 58.5 months in the continuous tafamidis group (n = 176) and 57.1 months in the placebo to tafamidis group (n = 177). There were 79 (44.9%) deaths with continuous tafamidis and 111 (62.7%) with placebo to tafamidis (hazard ratio, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.44–0.79]; P < 0.001). Mortality was also reduced in the continuous tafamidis (versus placebo to tafamidis) subgroups of: variant transthyretin amyloidosis (0.57 [0.33–0.99]; P = 0.05) and wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (0.61 [0.43–0.87]; P = 0.006); and baseline New York Heart Association class I and II (0.56 [0.38–0.82]; P = 0.003) and class III (0.65 [0.41–1.01]; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

In the LTE, patients initially treated with tafamidis in ATTR-ACT had substantially better survival than those first treated with placebo, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.

### Improvements in efficacy measures with Tafamidis in the tafamidis in transthyretin cardiomyopathy clinical Trial [^116XxR3C]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a fatal disease. Tafamidis was approved to treat patients with ATTR-CM based on findings from the ATTR-ACT (Tafamidis in Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial).

Objectives

This post hoc analysis examined the proportion of patients who experienced improved efficacy measures through 30 months of treatment with tafamidis or placebo in ATTR-ACT.

Methods

Patients with ATTR-CM were randomized to tafamidis (80 mg or 20 mg) or placebo. Change from baseline in 6-minute walk test distance, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration, patient global assessment of overall health, and New York Heart Association functional class were assessed at regular time points. The proportion of patients with improvement was summarized for each time point with odds ratio. Missing data were imputed as deterioration.

Results

Higher proportions of tafamidis-treated patients (n = 264) than placebo-treated patients (n = 177) showed improvement in all assessments. The odds ratio for improvement favored tafamidis for all measures and at all time points. It was significant (P < 0.001) at month 30 for 6-minute walk test distance (4.9; 95% CI: 2.28–10.69), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score (3.3; 95% CI: 1.85–5.78), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (5.3; 95% CI: 2.66–10.73), and patient global assessment of overall health (2.9; 95% CI: 1.69–4.95).

Conclusions

This analysis found that higher proportions of patients treated with tafamidis experienced improvement from baseline in measures of heart failure, functional capacity, and health-related quality of life than those treated with placebo during ATTR-ACT. These data provide further evidence of the clinical benefits of tafamidis in patients with ATTR-CM. (Safety and Efficacy of Tafamidis in Patients With Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy [ATTR-ACT])

Results

Baseline Characteristics by LVEF Category in All Patients in ATTR-ACT

ATTR-ACT enrolled 441 patients, of whom 176 received tafamidis, 80 mg, 88 received tafamidis, 20 mg, and 177 received placebo. Of 436 included patients, 393 (90.1%) were male; 18 (4.1%) were Asian, 63 (14.4%) were Black, 352 (80.7%) were White, and 3 (0.7%) were other races; and the mean (SD) age was 74 (7) years. A total of 220 patients (50.5%) had HFpEF, 119 (27.3%) had HFmrEF, and 97 (22.2%) had HFrEF at enrollment (Table 1). Five patients with missing LVEF data at enrollment were excluded from this part of the analysis.

### Nonagenarian patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis: should they be treated with tafamidis? [^116gxRkU]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

We are able to share additional data on patients over the age of 90, thanks to our ongoing study of a nationwide prospective cohort of ATTR-CA patients of all ages (n = 4320 in total). When considering the 336 patients over the age of 90 (males: 69%; median interventricular septum: 16 mm, median left ventricular ejection fraction: 55%; median global longitudinal strain: −11%; median serum N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide level: 3438 pg/mL; median serum creatinine level: 112 µmol/L; median creatinine clearance rate: 53 mL/min; National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) stage 2: 44%; NAC stage 3: 24%), there are no significant differences in these variables between the tafamidis-treated and non-treated subgroups. 215 of the 336 nonagenarian patients are being treated with tafamidis. With a median follow-up time of 12 months, the 6- and 12-month survival rates are respectively 90% and 81% for the nonagenarians overall, 92% and 84% for tafamidis-treated nonagenarians, and 86% and 74% for non-treated nonagenarians. The difference between tafamidis-treated and non-treated nonagenarians is statistically significant (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.58 [0.38–0.89], P = 0.01; Figure 1).

Figure 1
Survival in nonagenarian patients treated or not with tafamidis, as assessed with the Kaplan-Meier method

Our finding is in line with Debonnaire et al.'sand Fontana et al.'sstatements on the need to treat patients regardless of their age — even after the age of 90. Furthermore, with a view to reducing the frequency of futile treatment, we consider that newly diagnosed older patients with ATTR-CA should undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment to inform decisions about these innovative therapies, on the basis of physiological age rather than chronological age. This collaboration between cardiologists and geriatricians will play a key role in guiding therapeutic strategies as new effective treatments become available. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for patients with ATTR-CA according to their level of frailty.

### Tafamidis meglumine (Vyndaqel) [^116tKLRy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

This analysis demonstrated a significant reduction (p = 0.0006) in all-cause mortality and frequency of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in the pooled VYNDAQEL 20-mg and 80-mg groups versus placebo (Table 2).

Analysis of the individual components of the primary analysis (all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization) also demonstrated significant reductions for VYNDAQEL versus placebo.

The hazard ratio from the all-cause mortality Cox-proportional hazard model for pooled VYNDAQEL versus placebo was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51, 0.96), indicating a 30% relative reduction in the risk of death relative to the placebo group (p = 0.026). Approximately 80% of total deaths were cardiovascular-related in both treatment groups. A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to event all-cause mortality is presented in Figure 1.

There were significantly fewer cardiovascular-related hospitalizations with VYNDAQEL compared with placebo with a reduction in risk of 32% corresponding to a Relative Risk Ratio of 0.68 (Table 3).

The treatment effects of VYNDAQEL on functional capacity and health status were assessed by the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score, respectively. A significant treatment effect favoring VYNDAQEL was first observed at Month 6 and remained consistent through Month 30 on both 6MWT distance and KCCQ-OS score (Figure 2 and Table 4).

### Cardiovascular diseases that have emerged from the darkness [^112Rf9LJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

It is important for both the patient and physician communities to have timely access to information recognizing rapid progress in the diagnosis and treatment of familiar but relatively uncommon cardiovascular diseases. Patients with 3 cardiovascular diseases (ie, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and transthyretin (TTR) cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR)]), once considered rare without effective management options and associated with malignant prognosis, have now benefited substantially from the development of a variety of innovative therapeutic strategies. In addition, in each case, enhanced diagnostic testing has expanded the patient population and allowed for more widespread administration of contemporary treatments. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, introduction of implantable defibrillators to prevent sudden death as well as high-benefit:low-risk septal reduction therapies to reverse heart failure have substantially reduced morbidity and disease-related mortality (to 0.5% per year). For pulmonary arterial hypertension, a disease once characterized by a particularly grim prognosis, prospective randomized drug trials with aggressive single (or combined) pharmacotherapy have measurably improved survival and quality of life for many patients. In cardiac amyloidosis, development of disease-specific drugs can for the first time reduce morbidity and mortality, prominently with breakthrough ATTR-protein-stabilizing tafamidis. In conclusion, in less common and visible cardiovascular diseases, it is crucial to recognize substantial progress and achievement, given that penetration of such information into clinical practice and the patient community can be inconsistent. Diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, once linked to a uniformly adverse prognosis, are now associated with the opportunity for patients to experience satisfactory quality of life and extended longevity.
