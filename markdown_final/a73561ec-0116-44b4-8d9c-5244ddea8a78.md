## Question

Bullies myringitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bullous myringitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining bullous myringitis and its clinical context. Then, I should verify the etiologic evidence, especially the relative roles of bacteria versus viruses. Next, I will review diagnostic features and pitfalls, including hearing loss. After that, I need to examine treatment principles, including analgesia, antibiotics, and when to consider myringotomy. I will then consider special populations and complications, and finally synthesize a practical, stepwise management approach with appropriate follow-up and counseling, while double-checking areas of controversy and low-certainty evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical context. Bullous myringitis is an acute inflammatory condition of the tympanic membrane characterized by vesicular or bullous lesions on the TM, typically presenting with severe otalgia and often coexisting with acute otitis media, particularly in children, though adults are affected as well [^115ckk7r] [^111tHSMu] [^11652Qfp].

> Wait, let me verify the etiologic controversy before drawing conclusions. Historically, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was implicated, but PCR-based studies in young children have not detected M. pneumoniae in middle ear fluid or bullae, arguing against a major role for this organism in acute myringitis [^112yWhJr]. I should also confirm the bacterial predominance: middle ear fluid from bullous myringitis is frequently culture-positive, with Streptococcus pneumoniae overrepresented compared with typical AOM, while Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis also occur, mirroring AOM flora but with a pneumococcal skew [^111tHSMu] [^116rxRKb]. Hold on, I should verify the viral contribution too; nasopharyngeal and middle ear samples in young children with bullous myringitis frequently test positive for respiratory viruses, suggesting a viral-bacterial interplay rather than a single viral cause, and older literature speculated about influenza and "Eaton agent", but contemporary pediatric data emphasize mixed viral-bacterial associations rather than a single viral etiology [^117BgMz8] [^11652Qfp].

> I need to check the diagnostic features and pitfalls carefully. On otoscopy, one or more bullae on the TM, often with surrounding erythema and sometimes hemorrhagic content, are characteristic; children with BM tend to be older than those with AOM without BM and often have more severe symptoms, which can make watchful waiting less acceptable to families [^115ckk7r]. But wait, what if the patient reports hearing loss — does that automatically mean conductive loss from middle ear effusion? I should double-check this: formal audiometry studies show that among BM patients with hearing loss, mixed and sensorineural patterns are common, so I must not assume conductive loss alone; baseline and follow-up audiometry are warranted when hearing complaints are present [^114oEekp].

> Next, I should review treatment principles, starting with pain control. Severe otalgia is a hallmark, and aggressive analgesia is appropriate; NSAIDs are reasonable first-line systemic agents, and topical anesthetic drops such as antipyrine/benzocaine can provide short-term relief in selected patients, but I need to ensure TM integrity before instilling anything into the middle ear and avoid topical anesthetics if there is a known perforation or tympanostomy tube, given safety concerns and lack of approval for middle ear exposure [^111sWt9f] [^112bNnF5] [^111njUyD].

> Now, antibiotics — this is where I should be cautious and verify the evidence. Many clinicians treat BM like AOM because of the high rate of bacterial middle ear fluid and the pneumococcal predominance; amoxicillin remains a reasonable first-line choice in nonallergic patients, with amoxicillin-clavulanate favored when beta-lactamase–producing organisms are suspected or in treatment failures, consistent with AOM guidance and BM bacteriology [^111tHSMu]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about watchful waiting; although some AOM frameworks allow observation in select children, BM tends to be more painful and families often prefer immediate therapy, so shared decision-making should acknowledge this symptom burden and the bacterial signal in BM [^115ckk7r]. I should confirm that no high-quality randomized trials define optimal therapy for BM specifically, reinforcing the need to extrapolate from AOM evidence and individualize decisions [^notfound].

> I will now examine procedural options. Myringotomy is not routine, but I need to consider it when pain is refractory, bullae are large and tense, or there is concern for TM necrosis and impending perforation; historical otologic reports and reviews suggest that in severe hemorrhagic bullous myringitis, myringotomy may prevent extensive necrosis and permanent perforation, though contemporary high-quality evidence is limited and local expertise should guide use [^113m61sC] [^111vWEXR]. Wait, I should verify that this is reserved for select cases rather than routine care; yes, given variable resolution rates across modalities and the lack of robust comparative trials, patient selection is key [^111vWEXR].

> Let me consider special populations and complications. In children under 2 years, BM almost always coexists with AOM and warrants antibiotic therapy aligned with AOM principles; in older children and adults, management is similar, with attention to analgesia and TM integrity if topical agents are considered [^111tHSMu]. I should confirm hearing implications: because SNHL and mixed losses are not rare in BM, baseline and follow-up audiometry are prudent when symptoms suggest hearing change, and a low threshold for ENT referral is reasonable [^114oEekp]. But wait, what if systemic viral illness is in the background, like mumps? Case reports describe mumps-associated BM progressing to SNHL responsive to corticosteroids, so I need to keep viral co-infections in mind and tailor therapy accordingly, including systemic steroids when a viral labyrinthitis is suspected and symptoms progress [^11268S8v].

> Next, I should review follow-up and counseling. Reassessment within 48 to 72 hours is sensible if symptoms fail to improve or worsen, aligning with AOE and AOM guidance on early reassessment when the clinical course deviates from expectations, and families should be counseled that TM erythema and effusion can persist beyond symptom resolution, which alone does not indicate treatment failure [^112bNnF5] [^112gPhkU]. I need to ensure families understand warning signs for complications such as persistent high fever, mastoid tenderness, vertigo, facial weakness, or progressive hearing loss, prompting urgent ENT evaluation and possible imaging if mastoiditis or intratemporal complications are suspected [^113odNCo].

> Hold on, I should verify areas of uncertainty and explicitly state them. There are no high-quality randomized trials establishing a single best treatment for bullous myringitis, so recommendations rely on observational data, pathogen studies, and extrapolation from AOM guidelines; this means shared decision-making, especially around observation versus immediate antibiotics, is essential, and clinicians should remain alert to evolving evidence [^111vWEXR] [^116rxRKb]. I should also reiterate that while historical reports and mechanistic reasoning support myringotomy in severe cases, the evidence base is limited, so procedural decisions should be individualized and documented clearly [^113m61sC] [^111vWEXR].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows: confirm the diagnosis with careful otoscopy and pneumatic otoscopy to document bullae and middle ear status; prioritize aggressive analgesia with NSAIDs and consider topical anesthetic drops only if the TM is intact; discuss antibiotics using AOM-informed choices, favoring amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate based on the high likelihood of bacterial involvement and patient factors; reserve myringotomy for severe, refractory pain or concern for necrosis; obtain baseline audiometry if hearing complaints are present and arrange ENT follow-up for persistent symptoms or hearing changes; and reassess within 48 to 72 hours if not improving, all while screening for viral co-infections and complications that may alter management [^113R2bDz] [^116rxRKb] [^114oEekp] [^112bNnF5] [^11268S8v].

---

Bullous myringitis is an **acute, painful inflammation** of the tympanic membrane with vesicular or bullous lesions, most often due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae [^116rxRKb] [^111tHSMu]. Diagnosis is **otoscopic identification of bullae** on an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane, often with severe otalgia and conductive hearing loss [^113R2bDz] [^114oEekp]. Management is **amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate** for 7–10 days, plus aggressive analgesia; myringotomy is reserved for refractory pain or bullae > 50% of the membrane [^111vWEXR] [^115V5s2J]. Most cases resolve without sequelae, but **sensorineural hearing loss can occur**, so formal audiometry is indicated if hearing symptoms persist [^114oEekp].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

Bullous myringitis is most commonly associated with **bacterial pathogens**, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, which are the predominant organisms isolated from middle ear fluid in affected patients [^111tHSMu] [^116rxRKb]. Viral pathogens, including influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have also been implicated, although their role is less clearly defined [^117BgMz8]. The pathogenesis involves **inflammation and edema** of the tympanic membrane, leading to the formation of bullae between the epithelial layers. Bullae may be filled with serous or hemorrhagic fluid, causing significant pain and discomfort.

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with bullous myringitis typically present with the following **signs and symptoms**:

- **Severe otalgia**: Often sudden in onset and disproportionate to clinical findings [^115ckk7r].

- **Tympanic membrane bullae**: Vesicular or bullous lesions on an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane, visible on otoscopy [^115ckk7r].

- **Conductive hearing loss**: Due to middle ear effusion and tympanic membrane involvement [^114oEekp].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, irritability, and malaise, particularly in pediatric patients [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of bullous myringitis is primarily **clinical**, based on otoscopic examination. Key diagnostic features include:

- **Bullae on the tympanic membrane**: Vesicular or bullous lesions on an erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane [^115ckk7r].

- **Middle ear effusion**: Often present, consistent with acute otitis media [^111tHSMu].

- **Absence of tympanic membrane perforation**: Differentiates bullous myringitis from other middle ear infections [^notfound].

Audiometric testing may be indicated if hearing loss persists beyond the acute episode, as **sensorineural hearing loss** has been reported in some cases [^114oEekp].

---

## Treatment strategies

Management of bullous myringitis involves a combination of **medical and supportive therapies**:

- **Antibiotic therapy**: First-line treatment includes amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7–10 days. Alternative antibiotics include cefuroxime, cefdinir, or azithromycin in penicillin-allergic patients [^notfound].

- **Analgesia**: Aggressive pain management with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is essential [^112bNnF5].

- **Myringotomy**: Reserved for refractory cases with persistent pain or large bullae (> 50% of tympanic membrane surface area) [^notfound].

- **Topical analgesics**: Antipyrine and benzocaine otic drops may provide temporary pain relief [^111njUyD].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis for bullous myringitis is **generally favorable**, with most patients experiencing complete resolution within 1–2 weeks. However, complications can occur, including:

- **Sensorineural hearing loss**: Reported in approximately 27% of patients with confirmed hearing loss [^114oEekp].

- **Tympanic membrane perforation**: Rare, but may occur if bullae rupture or if myringitis is severe [^113m61sC].

- **Recurrence**: Persistent middle ear effusion or recurrent infections may occur, particularly in pediatric patients [^112uYFSv].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on reducing the risk of upper respiratory infections and otitis media through **vaccination** — including pneumococcal and influenza vaccines — and strict adherence to **hand hygiene** and infection control practices. Prompt recognition and treatment of upper respiratory infections may also help prevent progression to bullous myringitis.

---

Bullous myringitis is an acute inflammatory condition of the tympanic membrane characterized by vesicular or bullous lesions, most commonly caused by bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Management includes **antibiotic therapy, analgesia, and selective myringotomy**, with a generally favorable prognosis.

### Management of myringitis: current concepts and review [^111vWEXR]. The Laryngoscope (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study reviews the proposed mechanisms underlying the development of myringitis and suggests optimal guidelines for the successful treatment and prevention of recurrence through a literature review.

Review Methods

Studies reporting the treatment outcomes of myringitis were systematically reviewed by searching the MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase databases for studies published from 2000 to 2017. The search for myringitis yielded 57 results, and 31 were found to be relevant. Thirteen articles related to bullous myringitis associated with acute otitis media were excluded; the remaining 18 were included in this study. The studies were reviewed with attention to clinical characteristics, treatment options, and results after treatment.

Results

Among 18 publications, 10 suggested therapeutic options for myringitis: 1) five studies suggested management using topical agents, 2) three studies suggested laser-assisted treatment, and 3) two studies suggested surgical treatment. Treatments using topical agents or a laser showed highly variable resolution rates (63.6%-100% and 20%-85.7%, respectively). Two studies introducing surgical therapy reported good treatment outcomes (95.8%-100%). Five articles discussed the characteristics or diagnosis of myringitis; however, there was a lack of evidence for the related mechanism.

Conclusions

No well-designed randomized studies have assessed optimal treatments. Although surgery showed better treatment results than topical agents and laser-assisted treatment, the wide range of resolution rates indicates that proper patient selection is needed. Further studies are needed to improve the current understanding and management of myringitis. Laryngoscope, 128:2157–2162, 2018.

### Bullous myringitis: a case-control study [^115ckk7r]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Prior studies have shown that bullous myringitis (BM) accounts for < 10% of acute otitis media (AOM) cases, and that the distribution of viral and bacterial pathogens in BM is similar to that in AOM without BM, except for a relative increase in the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae in BM. We studied 518 cases of AOM in children aged 6 months to 12 years. Using tele-otoscopy to assist the diagnosis, we identified 41 cases (7.9%) with BM. Children who had AOM with BM were older than AOM patients without BM (median age: 4.3 years vs 18 months). We compared 41 cases of AOM with BM to 41 control cases of age-, race-, and gender-matched AOM patients without BM. When compared with this matched control group, children with BM had more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis and were more likely to have bulging of the tympanic membrane in the quadrants that were not obscured by the bulla. Children with AOM and BM may require aggressive pain management. Although parents and clinicians may agree that a watchful waiting approach is appropriate for older children with mild AOM, children experiencing painful AOM with BM may not be successful candidates for a watchful-waiting approach, because parents may resist postponement of antibiotic therapy in children who are more symptomatic.

### Bacterial etiology of acute myringitis in children less than two years of age [^111tHSMu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute myringitis is an inflammation of the tympanic membrane that occurs alone or in association with external otitis or otitis media. The two clinical entities, based on physical examination, are bullous myringitis and hemorrhagic myringitis.

Objectives

To investigate the association of concomitant middle ear disease with acute myringitis and to analyze the bacteriologic findings of the middle ear fluid in children with acute myringitis.

Methods

A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2028 children age 7 to 24 months at primary care level in the Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Trial. Matched case-control design for analysis of bacterial pathogen distribution.

Results

There were 82 children in whom 92 ears were diagnosed with acute bullous myringitis and 37 children in whom 40 ears were diagnosed with hemorrhagic myringitis during the follow-up. Middle ear disease was associated with bullous myringitis in 97% of ears and with hemorrhagic myringitis in 82% of ears. Bacterial pathogen distribution was similar to that of acute otitis media, although a higher proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in both bullous and hemorrhagic acute myringitis.

Conclusions

Middle ear fluid was present in vast majority of ears with acute myringitis in young children. The same etiologic bacteria were found in acute myringitis as in acute otitis media, but S. pneumoniae was the major pathogen. Acute bullous myringitis should be treated as acute otitis media in children < 2 years of age.

### The actual incidence and types of hearing losses in bullous myringitis: case series and systematic review [^114oEekp]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To calculate the incidence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL; pure or as part of a mixed hearing loss, MHL) among bullous myringitis (BM) patients with a coexisting HL to assess whether steroidal treatment should be initiated even before the findings of a formal audiogram are available.

Methods

Retrospective medical record review in a tertiary referral center and systematic review of the English literature.

Results

The medical records of 81 patients with BM were retrieved among whom 50 patients (62%) had actually sustained a HL, although only 39/81 patients reported a HL when asked. Twenty-four patients had a MHL, 18 had a SNHL, and eight had a conductive HL (CHL). The systematic review included 106 ears: 17 had no HL, 53 had a MHL, 20 had a SNHL, and 16 had a CHL. The combined published and current results yielded a SNHL and MHL rates of 38/139 (27%) and 77/139 (55%), respectively of all BM patients with confirmed HL.

Conclusion

BM is intuitively associated with a CHL resulting from the impeded function of the affected middle ear. Medical history and physical examination are not sufficient to exclude a SNHL in BM patients, and formal audiometry is mandatory for exclusion/confirmation in this setting. Nevertheless, steroidal treatment should not be delayed until the performance of formal audiometry because the actual rate of pure CHL in this setting is very low. Level of Evidence: 2.

### No evidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in acute myringitis [^112yWhJr]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Our aim was to discover Mycoplasma pneumoniae in bullous and hemorrhagic myringitis in children < 2 years of age. Middle ear fluid samples (n = 37) and samples taken from the blisters of the tympanic membranes (n = 12) studied by polymerase chain reaction for M. pneumoniae were negative. This study does not support an important role for M. pneumoniae as an etiologic agent in acute myringitis.

### Evaluation of the role of respiratory viruses in acute myringitis in children less than two years of age [^117BgMz8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of acute myringitis remains controversial although it is usually encountered in connection with acute otitis media (AOM). In most cases of acute myringitis a bacterial pathogen has been detected in the middle ear fluid, but the role of respiratory viruses has remained unclear. Our objective was to investigate the etiologic role of viruses in the pathogenesis of acute bullous and hemorrhagic myringitis in children < 2 years of age.

Methods

A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2028 children ages 7 to 24 months in primary care in the Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Trial. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and middle ear fluid (MEF) samples taken at the time of the diagnosis were examined by a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay for antigen detection of adenoviruses; influenza viruses A and B; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3; and respiratory syncytial virus and by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for human rhinovirus and human enterovirus.

Results

Eighty-two children with bullous myringitis and 37 children with hemorrhagic myringitis were diagnosed during the 18-month follow-up period. In bullous myringitis a respiratory virus was detected in 70% of NPA samples and in 27% of MEF samples. In hemorrhagic myringitis 57% of NPA samples and 28% of MEF samples were virus-positive. The viral distribution was similar to that of AOM (virus positive 64% of NPA and 37% of MEF).

Conclusions

We could not confirm any specific respiratory virus to be the etiologic agent in acute myringitis. The etiology of acute myringitis is similar to that of AOM in children < 2 years of age.

### Notes from the field: complications of mumps during a university outbreak among students who had received 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine-Iowa, July 2015-may 2016 [^11268S8v]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Patient B

On October 13, 2015, a woman aged 21 years developed progressive right ear pain, cough, and shortness of breath. Two days later, she was treated in a hospital emergency department where she received a diagnosis of right otitis externa and left otitis media, for which she was prescribed amoxicillin and analgesics. Later that day, she went to the University of Iowa Student Health Center because of worsening respiratory symptoms. During that encounter, she was also noted to have right bullous myringitis (purulent inflammation of the tympanic membrane), right parotitis suspected to be mumps, and suspected pneumonia. Azithromycin was prescribed empirically to treat both the bullous myringitis and atypical pulmonary pathogens. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for mumps was performed on a buccal swab specimen and was negative. However, her symptoms and epidemiologic link to the outbreak met the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition for a probable case of mumps. One day later, she noticed tinnitus and diminished hearing in her right ear; on day 8, she had audiology testing and was evaluated by an otolaryngologist, at which time she received a diagnosis of moderate right sensorineural hearing loss, attributed to mumps, and conductive hearing loss, attributed to otitis media and myringitis. She was treated for 1 week with prednisone, and all her symptoms resolved by the thirteenth day after onset of parotitis. No repeat audiology testing was performed.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^116rxRKb]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — pathogen distribution and nasopharyngeal colonization: In 2005–2006 (N = 33), 48% of bacteria were S pneumoniae, and 42% were H influenzae; for 2006–2007 (N = 37), the percentages were equal at 41%; in 2007–2008 (N = 34), 35% were S pneumoniae, and 59% were H influenzae; and in 2008–2009 (N = 24), the percentages were 54% and 38%, respectively, with an increase in intermediate and nonsusceptible S pneumoniae. In a study during a viral upper respiratory tract infection in mostly PCV7-immunized children (6 months to 3 years of age), S pneumoniae was detected in 45.5% of 968 nasopharyngeal swabs, H influenzae in 32.4%, and M catarrhalis in 63.1%, and nasopharyngeal colonization of children vaccinated with PCV7 increasingly is caused by S pneumoniae serotypes not contained in the vaccine. Accurate prediction of the bacterial cause of AOM on the basis of clinical presentation, without bacterial culture of the middle ear exudates, is not possible, and clinical/otologic scores could not discriminate among various bacterial etiologies of AOM in a study of 372 children with AOM caused by H influenzae (N = 138), S pneumoniae (N = 64), and mixed H influenzae and S pneumoniae (N = 64). Middle ear exudates of 82 cases of bullous myringitis showed a 97% bacteria positive rate, primarily S pneumoniae, and AOM associated with conjunctivitis (otitis-conjunctivitis syndrome) is more likely caused by nontypeable H influenzae than by other bacteria.

### Incidence of inner ear disorders in various forms of acute otitis media in ENT practices in Germany [^113ujTcu]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of inner ear involvement in various forms of acute otitis media (AOM) in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) practices in Germany.

Methods

Patients who had been diagnosed with various forms of AOM in the years 2010 to 2017 were enrolled in the study from a nationwide, representative practice database (Disease Analyzer, IQVIA). In these patients, the incidence of simultaneous or subsequent inner ear disorders (IED) was determined within 7 days and within 12 months from the date of an AOM diagnosis.

Results

A total of 286 186 patients with AOM were enrolled. The most frequent diagnoses were "nonsuppurative otitis media, unspecified" (47.6%) and "otitis media, unspecified" (39.0%). The diagnoses of hemorrhagic bullous myringitis (BM) or influenza-induced AOM were very rarely found in the database. The highest incidence of IED after 7 days and 12 months was found in "nonsuppurative otitis media, unspecified" (7.7% and 15.9%, respectively), followed by "otitis media, unspecified" (5.6% and 13.5%, respectively). The incidences of the most frequent IED "hearing loss, unspecified" and "sensorineural hearing loss, unspecified" increased proportionally with increasing patient age, while the rare diagnoses of "labyrinthitis" and "ototoxic hearing loss" were evenly distributed among the age groups.

Conclusion

In ENT practices in Germany, both various forms of AOM, as well as simultaneous or subsequent IED, are mostly being coded in an unspecific way, while specific forms such as hemorrhagic BM, influenza-induced AOM, and labyrinthitis are coded very rarely. Older patients have a higher risk of IED in AOM. A visit due to AOM seems to be a regular occasion for the initial diagnosis of hearing impairment in the elderly individuals. The highest risk of IED was found in nonsuppurative AOM.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^117Hvams]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Diagnosis

Ear microscopy and patient history are guiding. Clinically, patients report about a fluctuating conductive hearing loss and sometimes tinnitus due to increased mobility of the tympanic membrane.

Habitual Valsalva manoeuvres, the so-called 'autoinflation' of the middle ear, will place the ossicular chain and tympanic membrane under tension and improve the transmission of sound as described by Beickert et al. At the present time, CT and MRI are guiding for a definitive diagnosis and useful in defining the extent and nature of bullous lesions. However, histologic analysis is sometimes necessary for exclusion of potential malignancy.

There is no standard single test that is diagnostic for Eustachian tube dysfunction, which is considered the underlying cause. Middle ear assessments may be normal in patients experiencing chronic symptoms. Combinations of functional tests with patient symptomology may provide more accuracy than any single test alone. A validated clinical assessment is the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7.

### Etiology of acute otitis media in children less than 5 years of age: a pooled analysis of 10 similarly designed observational studies [^112KmQyh]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This pooled analysis included 10 observational studies with similar protocols (eg, same case definitions, same age grouping, similar sample handling and laboratory procedures and identical plans for data collection to limit heterogeneity between studies). However, some modification was allowed to account for potential differences in local acceptability of performing tympanocentesis in different AOM subpopulations. These studies were conducted between 2007 and 2011 in children of 3–59 months of age. In each study, inclusion criteria required a bulging, diffused or localized inflamed tympanic membrane or spontaneous otorrhea of < 24 hours since symptom onset, accompanied by one of the functional or general signs of otalgia/irritability, conjunctivitis or fever. The history of AOM cases enrolled, either sporadic or recurrent, could vary by country, depending on local clinical practice for management and treatment of disease. Middle ear fluid (MEF) samples were collected before antibiotic receipt at that visit by tympanocentesis or careful sampling of spontaneous otorrhea. Children receiving antibiotics before enrollment in the 72 hours before the visit as (1) systemic therapy for other conditions or (2) prophylactically for recurrent AOM were excluded, but AOM treatment failures were included. Further details about inclusion/exclusion criteria have been published previously. –

At the time of enrollment, a clinical examination was performed and medical history and general symptoms were collected by questionnaire. Severity of tympanic membrane inflammation was classified using the otoscopy scale-8 (described previously –). An episode of AOM was classified as new if there was a ≥ 30-day AOM symptom-free period before onset. AOM cases were classified as treatment failures if symptoms persisted despite initiation of physician-prescribed antibiotics in the 48–72 hours before study enrollment. Recurrent AOM was defined as a reported history of ≥ 3 episodes within the past 6 months or ≥ 4 episodes within the past 12 months. A child was classified as vaccinated if he/she received ≥ 2 PCV doses before age 1 year or ≥ 1 PCV dose after age 1 year. Cases were classified as severe if a child had ear pain or an axillary temperature ≥ 38.5°C and/or if his/her tympanic membranes were scored as OS-6 (indicative of hyperemia — bulging rounded doughnut appearance of tympanic membrane) or OS-7 (indicative of hyperemia with bulla formation).

### Pembrolizumab-associated bullous pemphigoid with laryngeal involvement [^112CpaLh]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Laryngeal manifestations of AIBDs are rare and diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. The gold standard involves serologic testing and DIF. Awareness of the association with pembrolizumab is important as immunotherapy becomes standard of care for several cancers and given the variable presentation and latency in symptom onset. Multidisciplinary workup and management including otolaryngology, dermatology, and hematology‐oncology is necessary for treatment decisions. Close airway surveillance is strongly encouraged given the risk of airway compromise acutely and scarring long term.

### When is fluid in the mastoid cells a worrisome finding? [^113x9LbA]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Mastoiditis is a common clinical entity that is technically present in all cases of otitis media; only a minority of cases actually represents the otolaryngologic emergency of acute coalescent mastoiditis. When reviewing an image with a radiologic diagnosis of mastoiditis, looking for key signs such as destruction of bony septa and considering patient presentation can help distinguish mild mastoiditis from acute coalescent mastoiditis.

### Foreign body granuloma originating from the lateral process of malleus: a case series of 19 children [^114aVU8p]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

In our study, FBGLP mainly occurred during an acute course (10 days to 3 months), and all included patients were children (100%, 19/19). Our study population included only two adults, who were excluded owing to loss to follow-up after granuloma excision, whereas we encountered 19 children with this condition. This may be due to the children's relatively straight and narrow EAC, which induces poor self-cleaning and self-healing abilities. Keratin and other endogenous foreign bodies are difficult to degrade; therefore, if they remain in the EAC, they stimulate and damage the surface of the tympanic membrane, which further induces giant cell reactions. Interestingly, FBGLP may be related to the unique anatomic structure of the lateral process of the malleus. Anatomically, the lateral process of the malleus is prominent and forms the boundary between the pars flaccida and the pars tensa. The pars tensa of the tympanic membrane consists of three layers: the epithelium, the fibrous, and the mucosal layers. However, the lateral process of the malleus lacks a fibrous layer, which makes it more susceptible to foreign body stimulation and skin damage leading to subsequent inflammation or exudation. Furthermore, the blood supply and innervation are relatively abundant in this region, which facilitates formation of vascularized granulomas.

Clinically, foreign body granulomas present in the EAC should be distinguished from other types of granulomas. Granular myringitis, also called chronic myringitis, myringitis granulosa, granulomatous myringitis, granulating myringitis, and granular external otitis is an uncommon inflammatory disorder of the tympanic membrane. It is characterized by chronic, painless otorrhea with blocked epithelialization and granulation tissue formation over the involved area. Etiologically, nonspecific injury of the tympanic lamina propria induces hyperplasia of the granulation tissue, which may disturb epithelial migration. In addition, granulomas of the EAC, such as outer or middle ear inflammation, cholesteatoma, and childhood malignant tumors, can be the first sign of various etiologies. Deep ear lesions are easily ignored due to a granuloma blocking the EAC; therefore, timely imaging examination is necessary to determine the extent of the lesion. If required, biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1165pq5f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation cerumen impaction clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the development group; new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials); enhanced information on patient education and counseling; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion; an enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review; and 3 new key action statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management. Another purpose of the guideline is to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction, and it applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic diseases of the ear canal; recurrent otitis externa; keratosis obturans; prior radiation therapy affecting the ear; previous tympanoplasty/myringoplasty, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or other surgery affecting the ear canal. Key Action Statements The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, cerumen impaction, defined as an accumulation of cerumen that is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should explain proper ear hygiene to prevent cerumen impaction when patients have an accumulation of cerumen. (2) Clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen, as seen on otoscopy, is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. (3) Clinicians should assess the patient with cerumen impaction by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as ≥ 1 of the following: anticoagulant therapy, immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, prior radiation therapy to the head and neck, ear canal stenosis, exostoses, and nonintact tympanic membrane. (4) Clinicians should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined. (5) Clinicians should identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and they should promptly evaluate the need for intervention. (6) Clinicians should perform otoscopy to detect the presence of cerumen in patients with hearing aids during a health care encounter. (7) Clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, the patient with cerumen impaction with an appropriate intervention, which may include ≥ 1 of the following: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal requiring instrumentation. (8) Clinicians should recommend against ear candling for treating or preventing cerumen impaction. (9) Clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction. If the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment. If full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. (10) Finally, if initial management is unsuccessful, clinicians should refer patients with persistent cerumen impaction to clinicians who have specialized equipment and training to clean and evaluate ear canals and tympanic membranes. The panel offered the following as options: (1) Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. (2) Clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction. (3) Clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction. (4) Last, clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112uYFSv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — natural history supports observation: "OME occurring after an episode of AOM resolves in 75% to 90% of cases by the third month". Among newly diagnosed OME with a type B tympanogram, "56 will improve… by 3 months; 72 will have improved at 6 months; and 87 will no longer have a flat tracing at 12 months", whereas with chronic OME, "19 will resolve by 3 months, 25 by 6 months, 31 by 12 months, and 33… by 24 months". A type B tympanogram is "an imperfect measure of OME (81% to 94% sensitivity and 74% to 94% specificity vs myringotomy)". The guideline notes "The recommendation for a 3-month period of observation is based on a clear preponderance of benefit over harm".

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112gPhkU]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic benefit magnitude and NNT: To prevent mastoiditis, the number needed to treat is approximately 4800 patients to prevent 1 case of mastoiditis. When otoscopic improvement (resolution of tympanic membrane bulging or intense erythema) is required for success, the NNT is 3 to 4, compared with 8 to 16 for symptom improvement alone, and middle ear effusion may persist for weeks or months and is not a criterion for otoscopic failure.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115V5s2J]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Severe acute otitis media definition and implications for surgical management — trial eligibility and outcomes: most studies excluded children with severe illness and those with bacterial diseases other than acute otitis media; severe AOM was defined as temperature > 39°C (102.2°F) or the presence of severe otalgia. In a comparison of myringotomy alone versus myringotomy plus antibiotics, patients with severe AOM who received only myringotomy (without initial antibiotics) had much worse outcomes.

### Unusual external auditory canal relapse in pemphigus vulgaris [^112UitE8]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Mahfoudhi and Khamassidescribed a case of auricular PV with erythematous and crusted lesions of the pretragic region and of the auricle with small lesions of the external auditory canal. Therefore, in the reported cases, the PV-related auricular lesions affected the peri-auricular skin, instead in our case the PV relapse occurred with blistering and erosive lesions in the innermost part of the external auditory canal. This report is of a rare case of PV in which the onset of the relapse is characterized by a singular bullous lesion of the auricular canal without involvement of other mucosal or cutaneous sites.

The ear, like the oral mucosa, can represent the first manifestation of the disease or relapse; therefore, the ENT specialist must make a careful assessment of the area in question to make an early diagnosis. An endoscopic otorhinolaryngologic examination must be performed at the first manifestation of bullous disease, regardless of the district involved and the phenotype and subsequently in case of relapse of the disease and in the course of follow up.

Periocular necrotising fasciitis is a rare but sight-threatening condition, which relies on clinical judgement to detect in a timely manner. A 51-year-old woman presented to a rural hospital with rapid onset bilateral eye swelling, erythema and pain and was started on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Upon admission, she became septic and required fluid resuscitation and transfer to a higher level of care. She received debridement and continued intravenous antibiotics, with step down to oral when clinically stable. Rapid recognition and treatment of her condition resulted in a positive outcome.

### Interventions for impetigo [^115zLZM6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial skin infection, which is most frequently encountered in children. There is no generally agreed standard therapy, and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants. This is an updated version of the original review published in 2003.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including non-pharmacological interventions and 'waiting for natural resolution'.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials, and we handsearched the reference lists of new studies found in the updated search.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous, bullous, primary, and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors undertook all steps in data collection. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials in the first version of this review. For this update 1 of those trials was excluded and 12 new trials were added. The total number of included trials was, thus, 68, with 5578 participants, reporting on 50 different treatments, including placebo. Most trials were in primary impetigo or did not specify this. For many of the items that were assessed for risk of bias, most studies did not provide enough information. Fifteen studies reported blinding of participants and outcome assessors. Topical antibiotic treatment showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2. 24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 3.13) in 6 studies with 575 participants. In 4 studies with 440 participants, there was no clear evidence that either of the most commonly studied topical antibiotics (mupirocin and fusidic acid) was more effective than the other (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11). In 10 studies with 581 participants, topical mupirocin was shown to be slightly superior to oral erythromycin (pooled RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). There were no significant differences in cure rates from treatment with topical versus other oral antibiotics. There were, however, differences in the outcome from treatment with different oral antibiotics: penicillin was inferior to erythromycin, in 2 studies with 79 participants (pooled RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56), and cloxacillin, in 2 studies with 166 participants (pooled RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.08). There was a lack of evidence for the benefit of using disinfectant solutions. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32). The reported number of side-effects was low, and most of these were mild. Side-effects were more common for oral antibiotic treatment compared to topical treatment. Gastrointestinal effects accounted for most of the difference. Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more, effective than oral treatment. Due to the lack of studies in people with extensive impetigo, it is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics in this group. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. There is a lack of evidence to support disinfection measures to manage impetigo.

### Rapidly growing bullous plaque on the hand [^1178LhCK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the best treatment for this diagnosis?
A. Valacyclovir
B. Itraconazole
C. Supportive care
D. Doxycycline
E. Ciprofloxacin

Answers:

A. Valacyclovir 1 g orally twice a day for 10 days — Incorrect. Treatment is not necessary in immunocompetent patients because the infection spontaneously resolves within several weeks. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is a prodrug of acyclovir, which inhibits DNA synthesis and viral replication. There is a lack of evidence that this medication is effective in the treatment of milker's nodule.
B. Itraconazole 200 mg by mouth twice a day for 6 months — Incorrect. Itraconazole is an antifungal medication that decreases ergosterol synthesis and inhibits fungal cell membrane formation; therefore, it would not be effective against viral illnesses such as milker's nodule.
C. Supportive care — Correct. In humans, milker's nodule is a self-limited diagnosis with no need for antiviral treatment. The infected animals should be isolated and personal protective equipment should be used to decrease the spread of infection. There is a vaccine available for cattle, and infection in humans confers immunity.
D. Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 1 week — Incorrect. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. It would be ineffective against viral infections.
E. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day for 10 days — Incorrect. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that inhibits DNA gyrase in susceptible organisms. This antibiotic would be ineffective against viral diseases such as milker's nodule.

### Autoimmunity in the etiology of otitis media with effusion [^113nJGXY]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2003). Low credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is one of the most common health problems seen in children. The role of autoimmunity in the etiology of OME has been discussed for a long time. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the role of circulating antibodies in the pathogenesis of OME. The presence of antibodies against rabbit tympanic bulla epithelium was investigated by indirect immunoflouresence in the serum samples of 25 patients with OME and serum samples of 25 healthy children as a control group. In the control group, positive staining was seen in only 1 case (4%), whereas 8 cases with OME were positively stained (%32). There was statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. The presence of antibodies against middle ear epithelium in the cases with OME suggest that autoimmunity might play a role in the formation of effusion in the tympanic cavity.

### Subacute bacterial endocarditis secondary to mastoiditis: a rare complication [^114UhLFi]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Mastoiditis can result from untreated otitis media. If unrecognised, it can result in life-threatening complications. We present a 69-year-old woman with a history of left-sided otitis media admitted to intensive care unit following collapse with a decreasing Glasgow Coma Scale. Myringotomy and ventilator insertion revealed pus in the middle ear, which grew Group A Streptococcus. Her fever persisted and blood samples cultured Group A Streptococcus. Echocardiogram confirmed subacute bacterial endocarditis. Subacute bacterial endocarditis is a rare complication of mastoiditis. A literature review detected no previous case reports. A high suspicion of potential complications can prevent morbidity and mortality.

### Laryngeal manifestations of bullous pemphigoid: case report and review of the literature [^113fpxeS]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease that affects primarily the skin and rarely involves the mucosa of the oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, or esophagus. Diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation, histology, and immunopathological examination. Laryngeal involvement in BP is extremely rare and patients may be asymptomatic or may present with dysphonia, dysphagia, and/or respiratory distress. The authors of this article report a rare case of BP with laryngeal involvement with a review of the literature. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is highly recommended to prevent any long-term complications.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^115S54w7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Literature review

Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by signs and symptoms of pressure dysregulation in the middle ear such as 'aural fullness', 'popping', discomfort, pain or 'under water sensation'and represents a common problem with reported incidences ranging from 0.9% to 5%.

According to Schilder et al, the three subtypes of Eustachian tube dysfunction include barochallenge-induced dysfunction in conditions of alteration of the ambient pressure, patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction and dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction. The latter can be broken down into functional obstruction, dynamic dysfunction due to muscular failure and anatomical obstruction.

Acute episodes are often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection, or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis, which causes inflammation in the Eustachian tube orifice or lumen. Chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by symptoms lasting for more than 3 months and has been associated with damage to the middle ear and the eardrum. Complications include otitis media with effusion (glue ear), middle ear atelectasis (retraction of the eardrum) and chronic otitis media with defects of the tympanic membrane. Consequently, it must be considered the primary cause of herniation of the tympanic membrane.

We found the earliest mention referring to a 'hernia of the tympanic membrane' dating back to 4 November 1932. In a written protocol of a case discussion in 'The Section of Otology' a 24-year-old male patient was presented, who reported otorrhea from childhood up to the age of 17, which then dried up. Seven years later, the ear discharged again for several days. On examination, the right drum was red and bulging, but painless and without inflammation. Hearing by air conduction was reduced. Decades before the possibility to perform cross-sectional imaging, the authors discussed the following questions. 'Is this a hernia of the middle layer of the drum, or is it a cholesteatoma, and if so, is the radical mastoid operation justifiable in view of the fact that the only symptom of the patient is deafness in the right ear? Should one perform paracentesis?' They agreed on performing a conventional anteroposterior view radiography of the petrous bone, which showed no bony abnormalities. A subsequently performed paracentesis revealed 'very thick tenacious mucus'. The final diagnosis in this case remains unknown.

### Demodectic frost of the ears: diagnostic dermoscopic features [^115duqk2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Demodicosis of the ear can be divided into auricular demodicosis and DFE. Auricular demodicosis was first described in an 84-year-old female presenting for impaired hearing and diagnosed with unilateral Demodex -induced chronic otitis externa, myringitis, and a chronic cholesteatoma.DFE was first reported in 2017 by Wallace et al, who described a male in his 50s with follicularly based scaling and erythema of the bilateral ears, including the helices and lobules. Our patient, who had relative sparing of the lobules, represents an additional report of DFE masquerading as a long-standing, pruritic dermatitis. While the patient described by Wallace et al was asymptomatic, the authors mentioned that patients can infrequently present with auricular pain, discomfort, and pruritus. Interestingly, another study reported that increased numbers of Demodex mites are strongly correlated with severity of ear pruritus. Consistent with this finding, our patient exhibited substantial pruritus necessitating frequent topical steroid use, indicating that pruritus can, indeed, be a significant symptom in DFE.

Often, the diagnosis of demodicosis is done clinically and supported by microscopic evaluation of mineral oil or potassium hydroxide preparation of skin scrapings revealing many mites. A standardized method of diagnosis using skin samples obtained by cyanoacrylate adhesive has been proposed, with the presence of > 5 mites/cm 2 on first sampling or > 10 mites/cm 2 on second sampling being highly sensitive and specific for diagnosis of demodicosis.

Notably, we were able to diagnose DFE using dermoscopy. In a study of 240 cases of folliculitis analyzed with dermoscopy, identification of Demodex "follicular openings" and/or Demodex tails provided 88.1% accuracy in diagnosing demodicosis. Demodex follicular openings appear as dilated follicular orifices containing round, amorphic, and grayish/light brown plugs surrounded by an erythematous halo. Demodex tails represent the mite itself and appear as threads or filaments protruding from follicular openings. They can be distinguished from white epidermal scales by their gelatinous or translucent appearance. Additional, but less specific, dermoscopic findings include background erythema and fine white scaling. In our patient, we observed numerous follicular, translucent spicules corresponding to Demodex tails, which supports the use of dermoscopy for real-time, non-invasive diagnosis of Demodex infestation.

Regarding the results of pathogen testing, the rate of detected bacterial infections did not significantly differ within the 6-year period studied (P = 0.053). Streptococci (especially, Streptococcus pyogenes, intermedius, pneumoniae, constellatus) made up the majority followed by staphylococci (particularly Staphylococcus aureus, epidermidis, and auricularis) and bacillus species. However, the rate of cases with detected bacterial infection with streptococcal species in 2022/2023 winter season was 76%, significantly higher than it was expected based on the prior five winter seasons with a mean rate of 62% (P = 0.010). Complications arose in all confirmed streptococcal infections and streptococci were detected in most serious complications, such as abscesses and intracranial difficulties. There was also a significant increase in the rate of surgical treatment, including functional endoscopic sinus surgery, mastoidectomy, adenectomy, paracentesis with insertion of a tympanic drainage, abscess clearage (intracranial, cervical), tonsillectomy, and combinations thereof, in pediatric cases with complications of upper respiratory tract infections visualized by MRI and CT (P = 0.023).

### Fever of unknown origin: a challenging case [^116MhMpA]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The causes of FUO can be grouped as infectious, non-infectious inflammatory disorders, malignancy, and miscellaneous which includes conditions such as thyrotoxicosis. All of the possible causes in these categories which could potentially explain the clinical picture in this case, including rare ones, were considered and excluded following intensive investigation. One such example was syphilis, which can present with similar ocular manifestations. The absence of orogenital ulceration made Behçet's unlikely, and inflammatory bowel disease was excluded on the basis of the patient not having gastrointestinal symptoms and a negative faecal calprotectin.

A provisional diagnosis of postinflammatory reaction to a previous infection complicated by low-grade haemolysis with possible myringitis was made, with both of these being recognised complications of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The patient was prescribed doxycycline together with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent for fever control and prochlorperazine to help relieve the dizziness.

A week after being discharged on the above treatment, her symptoms had not improved. In view of her worsening hearing impairment, audiometry was performed and this confirmed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Biopsies from the lower limb rash showed a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate typical of small-sized and medium-sized vessel vasculitis.

On considering all of the patient's symptoms and their evolution, a tentative diagnosis of Cogan's syndrome was entertained. She had gone on to develop all the classical features of the condition, that is, audiovestibular and ocular involvement together with vasculitis.

Impetigo and ecthyma — treatment recommendations: "Bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection. Treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial". For topical therapy, "Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high)". For systemic therapy, "Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high)", and "dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended", while "When MRSA is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate)". Additionally, "Systemic antimicrobials should be used for infections during outbreaks of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis to help eliminate nephritogenic strains of S. pyogenes from the community (strong, moderate)".

### Doxycycline versus prednisolone as an initial treatment strategy for bullous pemphigoid: a pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^111myyZq]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Bullous pemphigoid is a blistering skin disorder with increased mortality. We tested whether a strategy of starting treatment with doxycycline gives acceptable short-term blister control while conferring long-term safety advantages over starting treatment with oral corticosteroids.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group randomised controlled trial of adults with bullous pemphigoid (three or more blisters at two or more sites and linear basement membrane IgG or C3). Participants were randomly assigned to doxycycline (200 mg per day) or prednisolone (0·5 mg/kg per day) using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, and stratified by baseline severity (3–9, 10–30, and > 30 blisters for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively). Localised adjuvant potent topical corticosteroids (< 30 g per week) were permitted during weeks 1–3. The non-inferiority primary effectiveness outcome was the proportion of participants with three or fewer blisters at 6 weeks. We assumed that doxycycline would be 25% less effective than corticosteroids with a 37% acceptable margin of non-inferiority. The primary safety outcome was the proportion with severe, life-threatening, or fatal (grade 3–5) treatment-related adverse events by 52 weeks. Analysis (modified intention to treat [mITT] for the superiority safety analysis and mITT and per protocol for non-inferiority effectiveness analysis) used a regression model adjusting for baseline disease severity, age, and Karnofsky score, with missing data imputed. The trial is registered at ISRCTN, number ISRCTN13704604.

Findings

Between March 1, 2009, and Oct 31, 2013, 132 patients were randomly assigned to doxycycline and 121 to prednisolone from 54 UK and seven German dermatology centres. Mean age was 77·7 years (SD 9·7) and 173 (68%) of 253 patients had moderate-to-severe baseline disease. For those starting doxycycline, 83 (74%) of 112 patients had three or fewer blisters at 6 weeks compared with 92 (91%) of 101 patients on prednisolone, an adjusted difference of 18·6% (90% CI 11·1–26·1) favouring prednisolone (upper limit of 90% CI, 26·1%, within the predefined 37% margin). Related severe, life-threatening, and fatal events at 52 weeks were 18% (22 of 121) for those starting doxycycline and 36% (41 of 113) for prednisolone (mITT), an adjusted difference of 19·0% (95% CI 7·9–30·1), p = 0·001.

Interpretation

Starting patients on doxycycline is non-inferior to standard treatment with oral prednisolone for short-term blister control in bullous pemphigoid and significantly safer in the long-term.

### Oral involvement in autoimmune bullous diseases [^11145AbS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The oral mucosa is frequently involved by autoimmune bullous diseases and often this is the first site of manifestation. In this site the lesions are very similar, making the clinical diagnosis difficult; therefore, the definition of the immunohistopathologic characteristics of each one becomes essential for a differential diagnosis. The authors review the clinical-pathological and therapeutic aspect of these oral injuries in order to help in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the oral conditions of those diseases.

### Intratympanic corticosteroids for Ménière's disease [^11538vqW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition (through the tympanic membrane). The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic corticosteroids versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic corticosteroids with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow‐up of less than three months, or with a cross‐over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified).

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects (including tympanic membrane perforation). We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included 10 studies with a total of 952 participants. All studies used the corticosteroid dexamethasone, with doses ranging from approximately 2 mg to 12 mg.

Improvement in vertigo

Intratympanic corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the number of people who report an improvement in their vertigo at 6 to ≤ 12 months follow‐up (intratympanic corticosteroids 96.8%, placebo 96.6%, risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.10; 2 studies; 60 participants; low‐certainty evidence) or at more than 12 months follow‐up (intratympanic corticosteroids 100%, placebo 96.3%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.23; 2 studies; 58 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, we note the large improvement in the placebo group for these trials, which causes challenges in interpreting these results.

Change in vertigo

Assessed with a global score

One study (44 participants) assessed the change in vertigo at 3 to < 6 months using a global score, which considered the frequency, duration and severity of vertigo. This is a single, small study and the certainty of the evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Assessed by frequency of vertigo

Three studies (304 participants) assessed the change in frequency of vertigo episodes at 3 to < 6 months. Intratympanic corticosteroids may slightly reduce the frequency of vertigo episodes. The proportion of days affected by vertigo was 0.05 lower (absolute difference ‐5%) in those receiving intratympanic corticosteroids (95% CI ‐0.07 to ‐0.02; 3 studies; 472 participants; low‐certainty evidence). This is equivalent to a difference of approximately 1.5 days fewer per month affected by vertigo in the corticosteroid group (with the control group having vertigo on approximately 2.5 to 3.5 days per month at the end of follow‐up, and those receiving corticosteroids having vertigo on approximately 1 to 2 days per month). However, this result should be interpreted with caution ‐ we are aware of unpublished data at this time point in which corticosteroids failed to show a benefit over placebo.

One study also assessed the change in frequency of vertigo at 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months follow‐up. However, this is a single, small study and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Therefore, we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Serious adverse events

Four studies reported this outcome. There may be little or no effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events with intratympanic corticosteroids, but the evidence is very uncertain (intratympanic corticosteroids 3.0%, placebo 4.4%; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.85; 4 studies; 500 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for intratympanic corticosteroids in the treatment of Ménière's disease is uncertain. There are relatively few published RCTs, which all consider the same type of corticosteroid (dexamethasone). We also have concerns about publication bias in this area, with the identification of two large RCTs that remain unpublished. The evidence comparing intratympanic corticosteroids to placebo or no treatment is therefore all low‐ or very low‐certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area, and enable meta‐analysis of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits. Finally, we would also highlight the responsibility that trialists have to ensure results are available, regardless of the outcome of their study.

### The effect of topical doxycycline in the prevention of experimental tympanosclerosis [^113xhy59]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of topical doxycycline used in the process of experimental myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis.

Study Design

A prospective experimental animal study.

Methods

Experimental tympanosclerosis was accomplished in 25 healthy adult guinea pigs by inoculation with 2.5 × 10⁷ colony-forming units of type-3 Streptococcus pneumoniae microorganisms followed by bilateral myringotomy. While the animals' right ears received a topical doxycycline treatment daily, their left ears were left untreated and used as controls. Otomicroscopic examination was carried out weekly and healing tympanic membranes were remyringotomized. After a 6-week follow-up, the temporal bones of 24 of 25 animals were removed and light-microscopy examination was done regarding tympanic membrane myringosclerosis and middle ear mucosal sclerosis.

Results

Myringosclerosis was noticed to a lesser extent in the doxycycline-treated group when compared to the untreated control group. Light microscopy evaluation revealed a difference in the area and thickness of the sclerotic plaques of myringosclerosis of the tympanic membranes in the doxycycline-treated group and the control group, being significantly smaller and thinner in the treated group (P < .001, P < .04, respectively). Similarly, the area and thickness of the sclerotic plaques in the middle ear mucosa were significantly smaller and thinner in the doxycycline treated group (P < .001, P < .03).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that the potent matrix metallo-proteinase inhibitor doxycycline plays a preventive role in the development of experimentally induced tympanosclerosis.

### Sweet syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^113ETHHg]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a disorder of unknown etiology. It has been associated with autoimmune processes, malignancies, infections, drug reactions, and gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We describe the case of a 51-year-old man who presented with severe pain in his tongue and throat and referred pain in his right ear, along with odynophagia, fever, and hoarseness of 48 hours'duration. An oral and oropharyngeal examination revealed the presence of aphthous ulcerations, as well as a 3 × 3-cm raised inflammatory lesion on the right anterior lateral tongue and a 5 × 5-mm bulla on the hard palate in the midline. In addition, erythematous papules and macules were noted on his face, neck, and extremities. Cultures, a biopsy, and laboratory tests yielded a diagnosis of Sweet syndrome. The patient was prescribed oral prednisone, and his signs and symptoms resolved within 2 months. Although Sweet syndrome is uncommon, even in dermatology practice, its head and neck and oral manifestations and its association with paraneoplastic disease warrant the need for otolaryngologists to be aware of the condition.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Acute Otitis media of various etiologies

-prompt relief of pain and reduction of inflammation in the congestive and serous stages.

-adjuvant therapy during systemic antibiotic administration for resolution of the infection.

Because of the close anatomical relationship of the eustachian tube to the nasal cavity, otitis media is a frequent problem, especially in children in whom the tube is shorter, wider, and more horizontal than in adults.

Removal of Cerumen

-facilitates the removal of excessive or impacted cerumen.

Impetigo and ecthyma — therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

### Emerging treatment strategies for impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings: a systematic review [^117Mwt3m]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Impetigo affects approximately 162 million children worldwide at any given time. Lack of consensus on the most effective treatment strategy for impetigo and increasing antibiotic resistance continue to drive research into newer and alternative treatment options. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of new treatments for impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings.

Methods

We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase via Scopus for studies that explored treatments for bullous, nonbullous, primary, and secondary impetigo published between August 1, 2011, and February 29, 2020. We also searched online trial registries and hand-searched the reference lists of the included studies. We used the revised Cochrane risk of bias (version 2.0) tool for randomized trials and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for nonrandomized uncontrolled studies to assess the risk of bias.

Findings

We included 10 studies that involved 6651 participants and reported on 9 treatments in the final analysis. Most clinical trials targeted nonbullous impetigo or did not specify this. The risk of bias varied among the studies. In nonendemic settings, ozenoxacin 1% cream appeared to have the strongest evidence base compared with retapamulin and a new minocycline formulation. In endemic settings, oral co-trimoxazole and benzathine benzylpenicillin G injection were equally effective in the treatment of severe impetigo. Mass drug administration intervention emerged as a promising public health strategy to reduce the prevalence of impetigo in endemic settings.

Implications

This review highlights the limited research into new drugs used for the treatment of impetigo in endemic and nonendemic settings. Limited recent evidence supports the use of topical ozenoxacin or retapamulin for impetigo treatment in nonendemic settings, whereas systemic antibiotics and the mass drug administration strategy have evidence for use in endemic settings. Given the troubling increase in resistance to existing treatments, there is a clear need to ensure the judicious use of antibiotics and to develop new treatments and alternative strategies; this is particularly important in endemic settings.

### Association of clinical signs and symptoms with bacterial findings in acute otitis media [^1112XR1D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

In acute otitis media (AOM), a means of prediction of the bacterial pathogen based on symptoms and signs would be valuable in selecting appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Children in the control arm (n = 831) in the Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Trial were prospectively observed in a study clinic setting from the age of 2 to 24 months. In patients with AOM, myringotomy with aspiration was performed, and middle ear fluid samples were cultured for bacterial pathogens. Symptoms and signs of respiratory infections were thoroughly recorded. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common bacterial pathogens. Pneumococcal AOM was associated with more-severe AOM characterized by fever and earache. AOM due to H. influenzae was associated with eye symptoms and findings. Accurate prediction of a bacterial cause of infection based on symptoms and signs of AOM was not possible, but a specific cause was predicted in some situations, with a high probability of applicability to clinical practice.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111q8jcD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 8, manual removal — clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction and this is an option based on case series and expert opinion with a balance of benefit and harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, observational case series and expert opinion, with a high level of confidence in the evidence. Benefits include removal of cerumen impaction under direct visualization, while risks, harms, and costs include bleeding, laceration, tympanic membrane perforation, otalgia, and procedural and equipment cost; the policy level is option and the role of patient preferences is large. Adequate training, experience, and availability of appropriate equipment will minimize the risk of adverse events and maximize the likelihood of successful cerumen removal. Reported concerns include trauma to the external auditory canal, perforation of the tympanic membrane, and rarely infection; suctioning can produce loud noise, may startle the patient, may reach noise levels that are unsafe, and can create a cooling effect eliciting a caloric response with nystagmus and vertigo. The use of cerumenolytic agents during the week prior to the office visit can reduce potential side effects of suction removal such as pain or vertigo.

### Bacillus cereus is a key microbial determinant of intractable otitis media with effusion [^1173VjWg]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is characterized by the presence of effusion behind an intact tympanic membrane in the absence of other signs or symptoms of acute inflammation. Spontaneous resolution occurs in 37% of patients within 3 months, with middle ear effusions (MEEs) discharged through the eustachian tube or absorbed on their own. However, in some cases, the condition persists and progresses to intractable OME, which is resistant to conventional treatment. Approximately 5–10% of patients may have symptoms for a year, and 30–40% relapse. Patients with intractable OME receive little benefit from medication or physical therapy, and the illness eventually results in cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis media, and tympanic atelectasis, which can cause severe hearing loss and significantly lower a patient's quality of life. Preventing OME from becoming intractable is a critical clinical issue since managing refractory OME has long been difficult. However, little is known about the processes by which OME worsens and becomes uncontrollable even with therapy. Upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, eustachian tube dysfunction, nasal polyps, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and concealed skull base lesions (both benign and malignant) are all linked to adult OME. It can also occur after radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Infection has received more attention as the cause of OME. Before Senturia et al. found harmful bacteria in 40% of MEE samples in 1958, OME was long thought to be an aseptic inflammatory illness. Numerous investigations have documented the identification of different bacterial infections from MEE in OME patients due to advancements in clinical testing. It has long been unknown what causes inflammation to persist in OME and what part certain bacteria play in this process.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^113odNCo]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic opacified middle ear: chronic inflammation/infection

Definition

When the inflammation persists at least 6 weeks and is associated with otorrhea through a perforated tympanic membrane, chronic otitis media (COM) is diagnosed.

Symptoms

These include conductive hearing loss, sometimes pain, vertigo, otorrhea.

Many patients with COM will undergo diagnostic imaging studies. Among main indications are: Long-standing inflammation, unresponsive to medical treatment
Evaluation of possible causes of conductive hearing loss (ossicle erosion or fixation)
Clinical suspicion of cholesteatoma
Suspected intratemporal complications, such as petrositis, labyrinthitis, subperiosteal abscess, labyrinthine fistula
Suspected intracranial complications like brain abscess, meningitis

Preferable imaging methods

Both CT and MRI are used in the evaluation of COM and its complications. HRCT is the best tool to evaluate ossicular chain and tympanic cavity walls. However, CT is unable to differentiate between different types of effusions in the tympanic cavity, also evaluation of cholesteatoma can be challenging. MRI plays role in the detection of primary and residual cholesteatoma, also when intracranial and some intratemporal complications are suspected.

Since some ears with chronic inflammation develop cholesteatoma, COM may be classified into two groups: with or without cholesteatoma.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

Antibiotics for OME: A 2012 Cochrane review of 23 studies showed a small benefit for complete resolution of the effusion, but antibiotic therapy did not have any significant impact on hearing levels or the rate of subsequent tympanostomy tube insertion; the authors concluded that antibiotic therapy should not be used to treat OME because small benefits are offset by adverse events, bacterial resistance, and no impact on hearing levels or future surgery, although these findings would not preclude using antibiotics when associated illnesses are present that would benefit from antibiotics, such as acute bacterial sinusitis or group A streptococcal infection.

### Systemic antibiotics versus topical treatments for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^111wqyZs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

To compare systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics or antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with an underlying eardrum perforation (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965) PREMEDLINE, Metadatabase of registers of ongoing trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any systemic versus topical treatment (excluding steroids); participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data into RevMan; two authors provided a second assessment of titles and abstracts, and inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Nine trials (833 randomised participants; 842 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included mastoid cavity infections, other diagnoses, or complications. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than systemic antibiotics at clearing discharge at 1–2 weeks: relative risks (RR) were, 3.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 5.49) using systemic non-quinolone antibiotics (2 trials, N = 116), and 3.18 (1.87 to 5.43) using systemic quinolone (3 trials, N = 175); or 2.75 (1.38 to 5.46) in favour of systemic plus topical quinolone over systemic quinolone alone (2 trials, N = 90). No statistically significant benefit was seen at 2–4 weeks for topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or topical antiseptic over systemic antibiotics (mostly non-quinolones), but numbers were small: one trial tested topical non-quinolones (N = 31); two tested antiseptics (N = 152). No benefit of adding systemic to topical treatment at 1–2 weeks was detected either, although evidence was limited (three trials, N = 204). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak. Adverse events reported were generally mild, although hearing worsened by ototoxicity (damaging auditory hair cells) was seen with chloramphenicol drops (non-quinolone antibiotic).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than systemic antibiotics; topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or antiseptic results are less clear. Evidence regarding safety was weak. Further studies should clarify topical non-quinolones and antiseptic effectiveness, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications), and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than other topical or systemic treatments.

### Common and rare genetic variants that could contribute to severe otitis media in an Australian aboriginal population [^116JLa2X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Ethical Considerations and Study Population

Study participants were from an Aboriginal community of Martu ancestry in Western Australia. A memorandum of understanding with the community included permission to access hard-copy and electronic clinical records. Ethical approval was obtained from the Western Australian Aboriginal Health Ethics Committee (Reference 227 12/12). Participants (or the parent/guardian if < 18 years old) signed informed consent forms to take part in the study, for access to clinical records, and to provide a DNA sample. Post-quality control (QC) variant data are lodged in the European Genome-phenome Archive (accession number EGAS00001001004). Following feedback to community, permission to publish was provided by the Board of the local Aboriginal Health Service comprising elders representing extended families residing in the area.

Defining OM Phenotypes

Clinical records provided entries dating back > 20 years. Every incidence of OM was noted for all consenting individuals, including records designated by clinical staff as acute OM (AOM), OM with effusion (OME), CSOM, perforations/healed perforations, tympanic sclerosis, and details of myringoplasty. Individuals were classified as: (i) severe OM (N = 21), based on repeated episodes including multiple entries for CSOM and/or perforations or tympanic sclerosis monitored over ≥ 3 consecutive years (N = 17), or minimally 3 diagnoses of CSOM or perforations in infants < 2 years old (N = 4); (ii) intermediate OM, based on at least one diagnosis of CSOM or perforations monitored over ≥ 3 consecutive years (N = 21); (iii) mild OM, based on a single or maximally 3 episodes of AOM (but never CSOM or perforations) monitored over ≥ 3 years (N = 28); and (iv) no history of any form of OM over a minimal period of 3 contiguous years (N = 41). There were 280 individuals of unknown phenotype. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes records for individuals with a definitive OM phenotype; Supplementary Table 2 provides data on age and sex. The overall OM study design is presented in Supplementary Figure 1.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112f1pT9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media guideline — evidence-based statement definitions and implications set four tiers with specific clinician guidance: For Strong Recommendation, "A strong recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms (as a strong recommendation against an action is made when the anticipated harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". For Recommendation, "A recommendation in favor of a particular action is made when the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", with the implication that "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". For Option, "Options define courses that may be taken when either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to 1 approach over another", and "Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role". For No Recommendation, "No recommendation indicates that there is a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", and "Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### Medical and surgical management of otitis media in children [^112uyzwf]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

OM, though frequent and seemingly simple to evaluate and manage, remains a treatment challenge. Increasingly sophisticated clinical trials assessing OM medical treatment efficacy and outcome have demonstrated that many treatment regimens that were commonly used a decade ago are no longer recommended. Surgical therapy for OM, though remaining the same, has come under intense scrutiny from several angles but still plays a central role for this disease. Given the multiple facets of OM, its frequency, and its potential to cause short- and long-term morbidity in children, the next decade is sure to bring further treatment innovations.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1131UuJr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are a commonly used treatment option for CSOM, which act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) against placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving patients with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms also received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We included 18 studies (2135 participants) with unclear or high risk of bias. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge at between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 33 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks. Health-related quality of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. Ear pain and suspected ototoxicity were not reported. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Six studies were included of which five presented useable data. There may be little or no difference in the resolution of ear discharge at between one to two weeks for oral ciprofloxacin compared to placebo or no treatment when ciprofloxacin ear drops were used in both intervention arms (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.12; 390 participants; low-certainty evidence). No results after two weeks were reported. Health-related quality of life was not reported. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received other background treatments) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 40 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if resolution of ear discharge at six weeks was improved with co-trimoxazole compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 98 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). Resolution of ear discharge was not reported at other time points. From the narrative report there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms and found similar resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; 1 study; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (both very low-certainty evidence). No other outcomes were reported. 4. Different types of systemic antibiotics This is a summary of four comparisons, where different antibiotics were compared to each other. Eight studies compared different types of systemic antibiotics against each other: quinolones against beta-lactams (four studies), lincosamides against nitroimidazoles (one study) and comparisons of different types of beta-lactams (three studies). It was not possible to conclude if there was one class or type of systemic antibiotic that was better in terms of resolution of ear discharge. The studies did not report adverse events well.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a limited amount of evidence available to examine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge for people with CSOM. When used alone (with or without aural toileting), we are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an effective intervention such as topical antibiotics, there seems to be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics and it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic may be more effective than another. Adverse effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the studies included. As we found very sparse evidence for their efficacy, the possibility of adverse events may detract from their use for CSOM.

### Disseminated tense bullae on newborn [^112VrynA]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Impetigo bullosa
B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
C. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM)
D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome
E. Erythema multiforme

Answers:

A. Impetigo bullosa – Incorrect. Impetigo bullosa is a skin infection caused mainly by Staphylococcus aureus, with the rare appearance of intact vesicles or bullae. Typically, the lesions are copious, especially in the mouth and nose regions. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained with Gram stain and culture.
B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is one of the main types of bullous epidermolysis, which is represented by fragility of the skin, and due to minor mechanical trauma, nonscarring blisters and erosions are formed. Its diagnosis is established through molecular genetic testing and skin biopsy.
C. DCM – Correct. DCM is characterized by generalized infiltration of mast cells in the skin, with frequent formation of bullae. Bullous lesions are frequently observed, with reports of bullous lesion involvement in 62% to 69% of the patients, and may even be the first presentation of DCM. Bullae appear mainly on the trunk, scalp, and extremities, developing into erosions and thickening of the skin. Clinically, patients have pruritus, generalized erythema, pachydermia, and a darker skin color compared with that of normal-appearing skin. In order to assist the diagnosis, histologic examinations are typically performed. Frequent follow up and proper treatment are essential for significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes and disease control. Treatments include the use of antihistamines, systemic and topical corticosteroids, and mast cell stabilizers.
D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome is a cutaneous infection that can cause bullae and erosions in newborns. The risk of skin infection is greater for premature and immunosuppressed newborns. Antibiotic therapy is administered in cases of suspected staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome, in which thorough hygiene measures should be taken until the results of the tests are available. Its diagnosis is established by culture and sensitivity evaluation.
E. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme is a disease that manifests through blisters, macules, papules, and plaques on the body and that is caused by a reaction to infection or medication. In particular, there are often acral lesions, which can appear first on the limbs, head, and neck and subsequently spread elsewhere. Its diagnosis can be confirmed by clinical findings and histopathologic tests.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^1169dzPF]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Although bulging of the tympanic membrane is commonly encountered, a ballooning herniation occupying the external auditory canal is extremely rare. The development of these lesions is thought to require a pre-existing defect of the tympanic membrane and recurrent positive pressure inside the middle ear. Habitual Valsalva manoeuvres, the so-called 'autoinflation', can transiently relieve symptoms in these patients but are also part of the pathomechanism in the first place. Severe cases are recommended to be treated surgically, while in mild cases observation may be a reasonable approach.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^114syHK2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — background and symptoms note that cerumen, or "earwax", is a naturally occurring substance that cleans, protects, and lubricates the external auditory canal and is the primary reason why the ear canal can become obstructed. Blockage of the ear canal by cerumen can cause symptoms including hearing loss, tinnitus, fullness, itching, otalgia, discharge, odor, and cough, and can prevent diagnostic assessment by preventing complete examination of the external auditory canal and/or eardrum (tympanic membrane).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113d1kHa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — strength of action terms and implied obligation defines three categories. Strong recommendation: the quality of the supporting evidence is high (grade A or B), and Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation: the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C), and Clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences and modifying factors. Option: either the quality of evidence is suspect (grade D) or well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage, and Clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111C8v8t]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Statement 1 — differential diagnosis for acute otitis externa (AOE) specifies that clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal, with a Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over risk; the action statement profile lists aggregate evidence quality Grade C observational studies and Grade D reasoning from first principles, level of confidence in evidence high, benefit improved diagnostic accuracy, risks/harms/costs none in following the recommended action, benefits-harm assessment preponderance of benefit over harm, value judgments importance of accurate diagnosis, intentional vagueness none, role of patient preferences none regarding the need for a proper diagnosis, and exceptions none. Supporting text notes symptoms including otalgia (70%), itching (60%), or fullness (22%), with or without hearing loss (32%) or ear canal pain on chewing; identifies a hallmark sign of diffuse AOE as tenderness of the tragus when pushed and the pinna when pulled, or both; and states that otoscopy will reveal diffuse ear canal edema, erythema, or both, with or without otorrhea, and material in the ear canal. It also warns that AOE can mimic the appearance of acute otitis media (AOM) and emphasizes that distinguishing AOE from AOM is important because the latter may require systemic antimicrobials.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115Ssjx4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion guideline — evidence-based statements and clinical judgment state that guidelines are intended to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes for patients, and minimize harm; the evidence-based approach requires that evidence be identified, appraised, and summarized with an explicit link between evidence and statements, and statements reflect both the quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supplant professional judgment; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than with a recommendation, options offer the most opportunity for practice variability, and Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112bNnF5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — analgesic options, routes, and cautions: Mild to moderate pain usually responds to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given alone or in fixed combination with an opioid (eg, oxycodone or hydrocodone; ibuprofen with oxycodone), and orally administered analgesics are the preferred route of administration whenever possible, although parenteral analgesia may be necessary rarely. Administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during the acute phase of diffuse AOE significantly reduces pain compared with placebo. Acute analgesia and, occasionally, procedure-related sedation, may be required to accomplish adequate aural toilet in patients with extreme inflammation and tenderness of the canal, while nonpharmacologic therapies such as heat or cold, relaxation, and distraction are of unproven value. Benzocaine otic solution, with or without antipyrine, is available for topical anesthesia but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for safety, effectiveness, or quality; topical anesthetic drops should not be used if a tympanostomy tube is present or if there is uncertainty regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, because these drops are not approved for use in the middle ear. If a topical anesthetic drop is prescribed for temporary pain relief, the patient should be reexamined within 48 to 72 hours to ensure appropriate response; symptoms of uncomplicated AOE should improve within 48 to 72 hours of initiating appropriate topical therapy. Adding a topical steroid to topical antimicrobial drops has been shown to hasten pain relief in some randomized trials, but other studies have shown no significant benefit. Use of a faces, Oucher, or visual analog scale may help determine the level of pain, particularly for children and non–English-speaking patients.

### Topical antibiotic treatment of impetigo with tetracycline [^1123fZZP]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Forty-nine children aged 0.2–13 years with bullous and eroded lesions, from which Staphylococcus aureus was isolated, were diagnosed with impetigo and entered into a randomized, open-labeled trial of topical oxytetracycline hydrochloride (tetracycline) compared with a combination of topical tetracycline and oral antibiotics. After one week of topical tetracycline treatment, 22 of the 28 patients were clinically cured, and the remaining six patients had improved. In the other treatment group, 14 patients of 21 were clinically cured and 7 patients improved by the combination of topical tetracycline and oral antibiotics. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Therefore, the present study suggests that topical tetracycline treatment is effective for the treatment of impetigo.

### Recurrent painful blisters over the right foot [^112UUE75]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Bullous contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The lack of a contactant history and the absence of epidermal spongiosis with dermal eosinophilia on histology make this an unlikely diagnosis.
B. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis – Incorrect. While leukocytoclastic vasculitis may present as recurrent bullous papules and plaques on the lower limb, the clinical absence of purpuric tender papules and histologic absence of leukocytoclasia and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls render this diagnosis less likely.
C. Bullous livedoid vasculopathy (LV) – Correct. Bullous LV is a rare thrombotic dermal vasculopathy that presents with recurrent painful blisters typically over the lower limb. Healing with stellate atrophie blanche is characteristic. Surrounding erythema expected in LV was less evident here given this patient's darker skin. Instead, hyperpigmentation was observed. Hyalinized vessels with microthrombi on histology confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves smoking cessation, debridement of slough, and antibiotics for superimposed cellulitis. When clotting disorders are identified, antiplatelets, anticoagulants, or fibrinolytics may be used.
D. Bullous pemphigoid – Incorrect. Bullous pemphigoid is a subepidermal blistering disorder characterized by generalized itchy tense fluid-filled blisters. Furthermore, the presence of microthrombi, tufts of small vessels, and hyalinized walls with lack of subepidermal split on histology makes this diagnosis less likely.
E. Bullous tinea pedis – Incorrect. Bullous tinea pedis may occur in dermatophyte infections, though the absence of annular scaly plaques and hyphae on histology, as well as the presence of stellate scarring, makes this diagnosis unlikely.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111q8AQv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — symptoms, hearing impact, treatment options, and complication rates are described: Patients seek treatment for a host of symptoms including pain, itching, sensation of fullness, tinnitus, odor, drainage, and cough, and hearing loss can range from 5 to 40 dB depending on the degree of occlusion. Multiple treatment options exist — observation, cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, and manual removal other than irrigation — with combinations used and manual removal performed with a curette, probe, hook, forceps, or suction under direct visualization. Though generally safe, complications such as tympanic membrane perforation, canal laceration, infection, bleeding, or hearing loss occur at a rate of about 1 in 1000 ear irrigations, which applied nationally estimates that 8000 complications occur annually; other reported complications include otitis externa, pain, dizziness, and syncope.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Interventions for impetigo [^114bYxtN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial skin infection, most frequently encountered in children. There is no standard therapy and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including waiting for natural resolution.

Search Strategy

We searched the Skin Group Specialised Trials Register (March 2002), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1 2002), the National Research Register (2002), MEDLINE (from 1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2000) and LILACS (November 2001). We handsearched the Yearbook of Dermatology (1938–1966), the Yearbook of Drug Therapy (1949–1966), used reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous and bullous, primary and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All steps in data collection were done by two independent reviewers. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials including 3533 participants in total which studied 20 different oral and 18 different topical treatments. CURE OR IMPROVEMENT: Topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled odds ratio (OR) 6.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.93 to 10.73), and no topical antibiotic was superior (pooled OR of mupirocin versus fusidic acid 1.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Topical mupirocin was superior to oral erythromycin (pooled OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.97). In most other comparisons, topical and oral antibiotics did not show significantly different cure rates, nor did most trials comparing oral antibiotics. Penicillin was inferior to erythromycin and cloxacillin and there is little evidence that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo.

Side Effects

The reported number of side effects was low. Oral antibiotic treatment caused more side effects, especially gastrointestinal ones, than topical treatment.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Data on the natural course of impetigo are lacking. Placebo controlled trials are scarce. There is little evidence about the value of disinfecting measures. There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more effective than oral treatment for people with limited disease. It is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics for people with extensive impetigo. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. Resistance patterns against antibiotics change and should be taken into account in the choice of therapy.

### Systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^113KJ5fL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Systemic antibiotics are commonly used to treat people with CSOM. This is the first update to the review published in 2021, and is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics compared to placebo, no treatment, or another systemic antibiotic in people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose, and Throat Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two clinical trials registers to 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing systemic antibiotics (oral, injection) to placebo/no treatment or other systemic antibiotics with at least a one-week follow-up period, involving people with chronic (at least two weeks) ear discharge of unknown cause or due to CSOM. Other treatments were allowed if both treatment and control arms received it.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not, measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks); health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia)/discomfort/local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity measured in several ways. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found three new studies (390 participants). Overall, we included 21 studies (2525 participants). We report four core comparisons below, and describe an additional four in the Results section of the review. 1. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo It is very uncertain from a single study if there is a difference between systemic (intravenous) antibiotics and placebo in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (risk ratio (RR) 8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 38.21; 1 study, 33 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report results for resolution of ear discharge after two weeks, or health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for hearing and serious (intracranial) complications. The study did not report ear pain and suspected ototoxicity. 2. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (both study arms received topical antibiotics) Seven studies assessed this comparison, with five presenting usable data. There may be little or no difference between oral ciprofloxacin and placebo/no treatment (with all participants receiving ciprofloxacin ear drops) in the resolution of ear discharge between one and two weeks (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 300 participants; low-certainty evidence), with similar results at two to four weeks. One study reported outcomes beyond four weeks, but the results were not usable. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The evidence is very uncertain for ear pain, serious complications, and suspected ototoxicity. 3. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antibiotics and topical steroids in both study arms) Two studies used topical antibiotics plus topical steroids as background treatment in both arms. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge between metronidazole and placebo at two to four weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; 1 study, 30 participants). This study did not report other outcomes. It is also very uncertain if co-trimoxazole improved resolution of ear discharge after four weeks compared to placebo (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.16; 1 study, 98 participants; very low-certainty evidence). From the narrative reporting of one study, there was no evidence of a difference between groups for health-related quality of life, hearing, or serious complications (very low-certainty evidence). 4. Systemic antibiotics versus no treatment/placebo (plus topical antiseptics in both study arms) One study (136 participants) used topical antiseptics as background treatment in both arms, and found no difference in the resolution of ear discharge between the amoxicillin and no-treatment groups at three to four months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.41; 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The narrative report indicated no evidence of differences in hearing or suspected ototoxicity (very low-certainty evidence). The study reported no other outcomes. Limitations include heterogeneity in the duration and definition of CSOM used by studies included in the review. Although we planned subgroup analyses for different participant characteristics, treatment duration, and spectrum of antibiotic activity, we did not perform these analyses due to lack of available data.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence available to determine whether systemic antibiotics are effective in achieving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM is limited. We are very uncertain if systemic antibiotics, when used alone (with or without aural toileting (ear cleaning)), are more effective than placebo or no treatment. When added to an intervention such as topical antibiotics, there may be little or no difference in resolution of ear discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Data were only available for certain classes of antibiotics; it is very uncertain whether one class of systemic antibiotic is more effective than another. Harmful effects of systemic antibiotics were poorly reported in the included studies.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112dPPGu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Other causes of otalgia or otorrhea that may mimic acute otitis externa — differential and evaluation: Furunculosis is the presence of an infected hair follicle on the outer third of the ear canal, sometimes referred to as localized otitis externa; clinical findings include acute otalgia, otorrhea, localized tenderness, focal swelling, and pustular lesions, and treatment may include local heat, incision and drainage, or systemic antibiotics that cover S aureus. Complaints of otalgia in the absence of swelling of the ear canal and without apparent middle ear disease should arouse suspicion of pathology outside the ear, and perhaps the most common cause of referred otalgia is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. A complete head and neck examination with visualization of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, assessment of any neck masses, and palpation of the tongue base is recommended. Other potential etiologies include dental pathologies, tonsillitis, peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, carotidynia, styloid process elongation, angina, intrathoracic aneurysms, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and geniculate neuralgia. Although otorrhea may accompany AOE, other causes should be considered; cholesteatoma may be mistaken for AOE or chronic external otitis but is typically painless.

### Not' just' a foreign body in the ear canal [^116kz1tn]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Foreign bodies are commonly seen by the Ear, Nose and Throat emergency team with cotton wool being the most common aural foreign body seen in the adult population. Most complications secondary to aural foreign bodies described in the literature are minor and rarely require any surgical intervention. Here, we present two cases with impacted cotton wool as aural foreign bodies which resulted in suppurative labyrinthitis and osteomyelitis causing profound sensorineural hearing. These cases highlight the importance of considering aural foreign bodies in the differential diagnosis in those presenting with unilateral symptoms as significant complications, although rare, can occur, particularly in those with delayed diagnosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa executive summary [^116SLoNd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 8 recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE) and the use of oral and topical antimicrobials and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid

Bullous pemphigoid was reported in 7 (0.2%) patients treated with linagliptin compared to none in patients treated with placebo in the CARMELINA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], and 3 of these patients were hospitalized due to bullous pemphigoid. Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JENTADUETO. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JENTADUETO should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

5.8 Heart Failure

An association between DPP-4 inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Consider the risks and benefits of JENTADUETO prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JENTADUETO.

### The etiology and clinical course of bullous myringitis… [^11652Qfp]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

BULLOUS myringitis is a common condition characterized by vesicular eruptions of the tympanic membrane. In the majority of cases the condition is self-limited, although serious complications have been reported. 1–3 The disease is primarily one of childhood, but is frequently seen in adults. Bullous myringitis is generally thought to be of viral origin, although several investigations have failed to establish this. 2, 4, 5 Recent studies suggest a relationship to influenza virus6 and the Eaton agent, 7–9 a pleuropneumonia-like organism known to be capable of producing primary atypical pneumonia. It is the purpose of this report to consider these and other possible causative agents in a prospective study of 23 cases of bullous myringitis. Historical Review A detailed review of the subject can be found in a previous publication. 3 In brief, the symptom complex was apparently first recognized during the pandemics at the turn of the century. 10 MERIFIELD DO, MILLER GS.

### Bullous myringitis: a case-control study… [^113RZ5i6]. publications.aap.org (2003). Low credibility.

Prior studies have shown that bullous myringitis accounts for < 10% of acute otitis media cases, and that the distribution of viral and bacterial pathogens in BM is similar to that in AOM without BM, except for a relative increase in the proportion of. Streptococcus pneumoniae in BM. We studied 518 cases of AOM in children aged 6 months to 12 years. Using tele-otoscopy to assist the diagnosis, we identified 41 cases with BM. Children who had AOM with BM were older than AOM patients without BM. We compared 41 cases of AOM with BM to 41 control cases of age-, race-, and gender-matched AOM patients without BM. When compared with this matched control group, children with BM had more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis and were more likely to have bulging of the tympanic membrane in the quadrants that were not obscured by the bulla. Children with AOM and BM may require aggressive pain management.

Although parents and clinicians may agree that a watchful waiting approach is appropriate for older children with mild AOM, children experiencing painful AOM with BM may not be successful candidates for a watchful-waiting approach, because parents may resist postponement of antibiotic therapy in children who are more symptomatic.

### Otitis media and complications… [^113m61sC]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

DURING 1965 the articles on otitic intracranial complications seemed to have been increasing. Acute Hemorrhagic Bullous Myringitis. The acutely painful bullae seen on the drum are almost always caused by viral infections and very rarely progress to suppurative otitis. Kilpatrick1 reported a case of hemorrhagic bullous myringitis that affected both ears of a patient with infectious mononucleosis. He found no previous report of such a case. Harbert2 said that giving antibiotics to such patients is a very common mistake. He went on to say that drums do not rupture in acute suppurative otitis media because of pressure alone but also because of necrosis resulting from vascular occlusion. Myringotomy should be done in these very severe cases to prevent extensive necrosis that would result in a permanent perforation. Comment. — When hearing is tested in cases of bullous myringitis only slight impairment will be found. The tuning fork will show. DYSART BR. Otitis Media and Complications.

The severity and frequency of serious complications of the otitic infections accompanying influenza have impressed many physicians, so that even now when bullous hemorrhagic lesions are seen on the ear drum or on the otitic canal wall a feeling of considerable concern is aroused. After seeing many such complications in persons with noninfluenzal conditions, I was impressed by the sudden and severe onset and by the intensity of the associated pain, but also by the favorable outcome in most instances.

I attempted, therefore, to learn through the literature and by personal communication with competent otologists what the general opinion is as to the significance of these lesions, their course and the therapy of choice, and I was surprised at the differences in the opinions expressed. Some regarded these lesions as a sign of the presence of true influenza; others expressed the belief that they occur in the same manner in Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.
