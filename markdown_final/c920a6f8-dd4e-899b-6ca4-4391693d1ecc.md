## Question

Gray exudate in mouth in herpes infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gray exudate in the mouth is a feature of herpes infection and how to interpret it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic oral manifestations of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and whether a gray exudate is described. Then, I should verify what "gray exudate" typically represents in oral pathology and whether that aligns with HSV biology. Next, I will review direct descriptions of HSV oral lesions for any mention of gray membranes or exudate. After that, I should consider key differentials that do present with gray or white exudative coatings, especially Candida and bacterial superinfections. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious conclusion and outline practical next steps for diagnosis and management, making sure I anchor each point to the best available references.

> Let me first confirm the canonical HSV oral presentations. Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis typically features numerous pinhead vesicles that rupture rapidly into painful, irregular ulcerations; in children, this is often accompanied by fever, malaise, and cervical lymphadenopathy, and the course is about 5–10 days if untreated, with recurrences thereafter [^0c4a8c4c] [^f84da18a]. Recurrent disease most often manifests as herpes labialis with a prodrome and grouped vesicles on the lip vermilion, while intraoral recurrences are less common and tend to be on keratinized mucosa such as the hard palate, often without a prodrome and sometimes asymptomatic [^88577a33] [^3931b190].

> Wait, let me verify whether any of these authoritative descriptions mention a gray exudate. I need to check carefully. The primary gingivostomatitis descriptions emphasize vesicles that ulcerate and may be covered by a yellow-gray membrane, which could be interpreted as a grayish exudate in some cases, particularly early in the disease course or with secondary bacterial colonization [^f84da18a]. Hold on, I should verify the exact wording: yes, "yellow-grey membranes" are described over the ulcerations in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, which supports the idea that a gray-tinged coating can occasionally be seen in HSV, albeit this is not the most characteristic or consistent feature [^f84da18a].

> I will now examine what "gray exudate" usually signifies in the mouth. Gray or white pseudomembranous plaques are classic for Candida albicans infections, where the pseudomembrane can be scraped off to reveal an erythematous base; this is a different pathobiology from HSV and is particularly common in immunocompromised hosts or those on antibiotics or steroids [^ded97a1e] [^b64d644c]. Let me consider bacterial superinfections as well; in palliative care cohorts, abnormal bacterial spectra and plaques are frequent, and grayish coatings can reflect mixed bacterial overgrowth or secondary infection superimposed on ulcerated mucosa, which could confound the clinical picture if HSV ulcers are present [^985b7d2b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check whether any high-credibility HSV guidelines or reviews explicitly list gray exudate as a defining feature. The CDC/IDSA HIV OI guidance details vesicle-to-ulcer-to-crust evolution for orolabial HSV but does not characterize the ulcer base as gray or exudative, reinforcing that a gray coating is not a hallmark of HSV itself [^0c4a8c4c]. Similarly, contemporary reviews of acute oral ulcers emphasize vesicles and erosions for HSV rather than exudative coatings, which again suggests that if gray exudate is present, one should think about superinfection or alternative diagnoses rather than HSV alone [^88577a33].

> Let me synthesize. Gray exudate is not a typical or defining feature of herpes simplex oral disease; however, in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, ulcerations may be covered by a yellow-gray membrane, and in immunocompromised or heavily colonized mouths, secondary bacterial or fungal overgrowth can produce grayish coatings that obscure the underlying HSV pathology [^f84da18a] [^985b7d2b]. I should confirm that this interpretation aligns with the differential: when gray exudate predominates, Candida pseudomembrane, bacterial superinfection, or other exudative mucosal diseases should be prioritized, while HSV remains a consideration if vesicles, scalloped ulcer margins, or a compatible prodrome are present [^ded97a1e] [^b64d644c].

> Next, I should review practical diagnostic steps. If HSV is suspected, I need to ensure virologic testing is pursued because clinical diagnosis alone is unreliable, especially in immunocompromised hosts; HSV PCR from the lesion base is preferred for sensitivity, and typing for HSV-1 versus HSV-2 informs counseling and recurrence risk [^c4a7ec60]. But wait, what if the gray coating is thick and scrapable? In that case, I should obtain a KOH prep or fungal culture to evaluate for Candida, and consider bacterial cultures if there is concern for superinfection, particularly in slow-healing or atypical lesions [^985b7d2b]. If lesions are refractory or atypical, I should also keep acyclovir resistance in mind and consider culture with susceptibility testing, especially in patients with advanced HIV or transplant populations [^88240e1f].

> I need to ensure management advice is aligned with the likely etiologies. If HSV is confirmed, initiate acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir according to severity and host status, using IV acyclovir for severe disease or immunocompromised patients and transitioning to oral therapy as lesions regress; treat until complete healing to reduce complications and transmission [^0c4a8c4c] [^19e5c09f]. If Candida is identified, use a topical antifungal such as nystatin or clotrimazole, and address predisposing factors like xerostomia, antibiotics, or immunosuppression; if bacterial superinfection is present, tailor antibiotics to culture results when feasible [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric considerations: for children with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, systemic acyclovir can reduce lesion burden and improve oral intake, which is particularly relevant when pain limits hydration [^079e5635].

> In conclusion, gray exudate is not a classic feature of oral herpes simplex; however, primary HSV ulcers may occasionally show a yellow-gray membrane, and gray coatings are more commonly due to Candida or bacterial superinfection rather than HSV itself. Accurate diagnosis relies on correlating morphology with targeted virologic, fungal, and bacterial testing, especially in immunocompromised patients or when the course is atypical or refractory [^f84da18a] [^c4a7ec60] [^985b7d2b].

Gray exudate in the mouth during herpes infection is most often due to **secondary bacterial superinfection** of HSV ulcers, producing a grayish purulent coating [^notfound]. This gray exudate is not a classic feature of HSV alone and should prompt evaluation for bacterial infection, especially in immunocompromised patients [^notfound]. Management includes **antiviral therapy for HSV** [^0c4a8c4c] and antibiotics for suspected bacterial superinfection, with close follow-up to monitor healing and complications [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of gray exudate in herpes infection

Gray exudate in the oral cavity during herpes infection is **atypical** and usually indicates secondary bacterial infection superimposed on HSV ulcers [^notfound]. HSV ulcers are typically shallow, well-demarcated, and covered by a yellowish fibrinous membrane; a gray exudate suggests bacterial overgrowth, often with purulence and odor [^f84da18a].

---

## Pathophysiology of gray exudate formation

The gray exudate results from **bacterial colonization and superinfection** of HSV ulcers. HSV disrupts the mucosal barrier, allowing bacteria such as Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, or gram-negative rods to invade, leading to purulent exudate formation [^notfound]. Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of secondary infection due to impaired immune responses [^853fefe4].

---

## Clinical presentation and associated symptoms

Patients with gray exudate in herpes infection may present with:

- Painful oral ulcers with grayish purulent coating
- Halitosis (bad breath) due to bacterial overgrowth
- Localized swelling and erythema
- Regional lymphadenopathy
- Systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and fatigue, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [^f84da18a]

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate diagnosis of gray exudate in herpes infection involves a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory testing:

- **Clinical examination**: Identification of typical HSV ulcers with grayish purulent exudate, along with assessment of systemic symptoms and immune status [^f84da18a].
- **Virological testing**: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for detecting HSV DNA in lesion samples, providing high sensitivity and specificity [^c4a7ec60].
- **Bacterial culture**: Swabbing the exudate for bacterial culture and sensitivity testing helps identify the causative bacteria and guide antibiotic therapy [^notfound].
- **Histopathological examination**: In atypical or persistent cases, biopsy may be necessary to differentiate HSV infection from other mucosal diseases and to identify bacterial involvement [^7ba52dbf].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Gray exudate in the oral cavity can also be associated with other conditions, necessitating careful differentiation:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic clues** |
|-|-|-|
| Candidiasis | White, curd-like pseudomembrane; removable | KOH prep; fungal culture |
| Bacterial stomatitis | Grayish purulent exudate; foul odor | Bacterial culture |
| Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis | Severe gingival inflammation; grayish slough | Clinical exam; bacterial culture |
| Syphilis | Painless ulcers; grayish base | Serology; darkfield microscopy |
| Aphthous ulcers | Shallow ulcers; no exudate | Clinical exam; exclusion of other causes |

---

## Treatment strategies

Effective management of gray exudate in herpes infection requires a combination of antiviral and antibacterial therapies:

- **Antiviral therapy**: Acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir are recommended for HSV infection, with intravenous acyclovir reserved for severe or immunocompromised cases [^0c4a8c4c] [^19e5c09f].
- **Antibiotic therapy**: Empiric antibiotics targeting common oral bacteria (e.g. penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cephalosporins, or metronidazole) are indicated when bacterial superinfection is suspected, with adjustments based on culture results [^notfound].
- **Supportive care**: Analgesics, antiseptic mouth rinses, and hydration support are essential to alleviate pain, reduce bacterial load, and prevent complications [^8cb67750].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of gray exudate in herpes infection depends on the patient's immune status, the severity of HSV infection, and the timeliness of intervention. In immunocompetent patients, **prompt antiviral and antibiotic therapy** typically results in complete healing within 2–3 weeks [^0c4a8c4c]. In immunocompromised patients, delayed healing, persistent infection, and complications such as HSV dissemination, sepsis, or necrotizing stomatitis may occur [^853fefe4].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing secondary bacterial infection in herpes infection involves:

- **Maintaining oral hygiene**: Regular brushing, flossing, and antiseptic mouth rinses reduce bacterial load [^notfound].
- **Prompt antiviral therapy**: Early initiation of antiviral treatment reduces the duration and severity of HSV lesions, minimizing the risk of secondary infection [^079e5635].
- **Immune system support**: Addressing underlying immunosuppression and optimizing overall health status are crucial in preventing recurrent and severe infections [^notfound].

Gray exudate in the mouth during herpes infection is most often due to **secondary bacterial superinfection** of HSV ulcers, producing a grayish purulent coating. This gray exudate is not a classic feature of HSV alone and should prompt evaluation for bacterial infection, especially in immunocompromised patients.

The epidemiology of oral and genital herpes has dramatically changed over the past decade. Herpes simplex virus-1, traditionally associated with oral herpes, is now implicated in an increasing percentage of genital herpes cases. The possibility of "autoinoculation" (or self-infection) of anatomic sites other than that of the primary infection has been recognized. New methods of suppression therapy are being examined. These changes have led to a revision in the recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This review discusses herpes infections of the oral and genital mucosa and the suggested approach to the infected patient who presents in the emergency department. Specific attention is given to the CDC's 2006 guidelines for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.

Question 2: What is the etiological agent commonly associated with this disease?
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18
D. Herpes simplex virus 1
E. Epstein-Barr virus

Answers:
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32 — Incorrect. The HPVs 13 and 32 are low-risk oncogenic subtypes and related to Heck disease.
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4 — Incorrect. HPVs 2 and 4 are more associated to common warts present in the oral cavity.
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18 — Correct. HPV 6 and 11 are associated with a low oncogenic risk, while HPV 16 and 18 are related to a high oncogenic risk. These four HPV subtypes are commonly detected in oral condyloma accuminatum. The molecular analysis was positive for high-risk oncogenic deoxyribonucleic acid-human papillomavirus in the presented case.
D. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) — Incorrect. HSV-1 is an alphaherpesvirus, which causes an infection that is usually asymptomatic, affecting skin and mucosa. Gingivostomatitis is the most common manifestation of primary HSV (HSV-1) infection, mainly manifesting as multiple painful oral lesions, swollen gums, blisters, and sores. The lesions described are incompatible with those reported in this case, which were painless.
E. Epstein-Barr virus — Incorrect. Epstein-Barr virus is a herpesvirus, which is widespread throughout the world. A typical clinical manifestation is infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis, an increase of cervical lymph nodes sensitivity and size, and moderate-to-high fever. The clinical findings are not compatible with those observed in the present case.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^0c4a8c4c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) clinical manifestations — Orolabial herpes is the most common manifestation of HSV-1 infection, with oral lesions evolving from papule to vesicle, ulcer, and crust; in untreated persons, the course of illness is 5 to 10 days and lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year. The majority of individuals with HSV-2 seropositivity have clinically silent infection, and genital herpes is typically caused by HSV-2, though HSV-2 can also cause orolabial herpes; genital HSV-1 is clinically indistinguishable from HSV-2 but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often. Typical genital mucosal or skin lesions evolve through papule, vesicle, ulcer, and crust, and viral shedding on mucosal surfaces occurs frequently and can result in transmission. HSV shedding occurs more frequently in people with HIV with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3 than in those without HIV or with higher CD4 counts.

### Oral shedding of herpes simplex virus type 2 [^b36a20ac]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and HSV-2 reactivate preferentially in the oral and genital area, respectively. We aimed to define frequency and characteristics associated with oral shedding of HSV-2.

Methods

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data of patients with documented HSV-2 infection and at least one oral viral culture obtained were selected from the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic database.

Results

Of 1388 people meeting the entry criteria, 44 (3.2%) had HSV-2 isolated at least once from their mouths. In comparison with the 1344 people who did not have HSV-2 isolated from their mouth, participants with oral HSV-2 were more likely to be male (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.7), HIV positive (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.0), and homosexual (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.2), and to have collected a larger number of oral specimens (median 32 v 4, p < 0.001). Of the 58 days with oral HSV-2 isolation, 15 (25%) occurred during newly acquired HSV-2 infection, 12 (21%) during a recurrence with genital lesions, three (5%) during a recurrence with oral lesions, and three (5%) during a recurrence with oral and genital lesions; 25 (43%) occurred during asymptomatic shedding. Oral HSV-2 was found less frequently than oral HSV-1 (0.06% v 1%, p < 0.001) in people with HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibody, and less frequently than genital HSV-2 (0.09% v 7%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Oral reactivation of HSV-2 as defined by viral isolation is uncommon and usually occurs in the setting of first episode of genital HSV-2 or during genital recurrence of HSV-2.

### Is herpes simplex a systemic disease? [^d4c5228f]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Orofacial herpes simplex virus infections are usually caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and HSV-2 infections have been accepted as a sexually transmitted disease. HSV establishes a latent infection in the dorsal root ganglia of the host and remains there for the rest of life. HSV affects mainly skin and genitalia, although in immunocompromised patients it may cause local infection with vast skin involvement, chronic herpetic ulcers, or widespread mucous membrane damage, as well as systemic infections localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems, gastrointestinal tract, and ocular system. Usually, HSV infections are in the domain of dermatology, but the accumulating facts for localization of the disease in many systems of the human body give us the possibility to pose the question: Is herpes simplex a systemic disease?

### Viral diseases of the oral mucosa [^e59aa521]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

A wide variety of both DNA and RNA viruses affect the oral cavity. When considered in conjunction with cutaneous features, careful examination of the oral mucosa and oropharynx aids the clinician in making a diagnosis. Examination of the oral cavity should be incorporated as a regular component of the dermatologic examination because diagnostic clues are readily available to assist in the evaluation of infectious processes.

### Herpetic geometric glossitis in an immunocompetent patient with pneumonia [^4f9c96ce]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Herpetic geometric glossitis is an uncommon, clinically distinctive presentation of oral herpes simplex virus infection that affects the tongue. All published reports have been in patients who are immunocompromised. We present an immunocompetent woman with viral pneumonia who developed painful linear fissures on the back of the tongue suggestive of herpetic geometric glossitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by both biopsy specimen and immunohistochemistry. As in other cases, the patient promptly responded to treatment with antiviral therapy. The morphology, laboratory findings, and similarities to herpetic corneal dendrites are discussed. Herpetic geometric glossitis should no longer be considered as a diagnosis only in immunosuppressed individuals, but in immunocompetent persons as well.

### Acute primary herpetic gingivostomatitis [^f0aab192]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a double-stranded virus belonging to human herpes virus family. Although it exists in eight various forms, HSV-1 causes most of the oral infections. Since dentists are more likely to be consulted in the case of oral infections, familiarity with these lesions becomes mandatory. It is more commonly reported in children and rarely in adults. This article presents an acute episode of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis in a 32-year-old male patient.

### Human herpes simplex labialis [^b42ee515]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Humans are the natural host for eight of more than 80 known herpes viruses. Infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are ubiquitous worldwide and highly transmissible. Herpes simplex labialis (HSL) is the best-recognized recrudescent infection of the lips and perioral tissues caused by HSV-1. Facial lesions of HSL may be unsightly, frequent outbreaks unpleasant, and the infection itself more severe locally and systemically in immunocompromised people. This article highlights the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic features and management issues for HSL.

### Common oral lesions: part I. superficial mucosal lesions [^ded97a1e]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Common superficial oral lesions include candidiasis, recurrent herpes labialis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, erythema migrans, hairy tongue, and lichen planus. Recognition and diagnosis require taking a thorough history and performing a complete oral examination. Knowledge of clinical characteristics such as size, location, surface morphology, color, pain, and duration is helpful in establishing a diagnosis. Oral candidiasis may present as pseudomembranous candidiasis, glossitis, or perlèche (angular cheilitis). Oral candidiasis is common in infants, but in adults it may signify immune deficiency or other illness. Herpes labialis typically is a mild, self-limited condition. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis most often is a mild condition; however, severe cases may be caused by nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Erythema migrans is a waxing and waning disorder of unknown etiology. Hairy tongue represents elongation and hypertrophy of the filiform papillae and most often occurs in persons who smoke heavily. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that may be reticular or erosive. Certain risk factors have been associated with each of these lesions, such as poor oral hygiene, age, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption, and some systemic conditions may have oral manifestations. Many recommended therapies for oral lesions are unsupported by randomized controlled trials.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^40fd27fd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types: HSV-1 is near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and ~48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes. Conversely, HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and ~12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and for potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^0539920d]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old otherwise healthy male presented to the dermatology clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a 2-day history of multiple painful, non-pruritic ulcers in the genital and facial regions, fever, odynophagia, headache, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed pustules and vesicles with central umbilication at the same stage of development and targetoid crusted ulcers on the right inguinal area (Fig 1), base of the penis, right gluteal region, and left cheek along with bilateral painful inguinal adenopathy. The oropharynx showed erythematous patches and erosions with white exudate.

Question 1: Based on the clinical presentation, what is the most likely etiology of the patient's ulcers?
A. Treponema pallidum
B. Monkeypox virus
C. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
D. Candida albicans
E. Non-infectious inflammation

Answers:
A. Treponema pallidum – Incorrect. Primary syphilis infection is classically characterized by a painless genital ulcer, often associated with non-tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Serologies for syphilis were negative in this case.
B. Monkeypox virus – Correct. Upon further questioning, the patient reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with alternating male partners and recent contact with symptomatic partners. After 7 days, the patient developed additional lesions on the bilateral thighs, face, right anterior neck, and buttocks. Lesions evolved to erosions with overlying crusts, with spontaneous resolution of all lesions after 3 weeks. Monkeypox is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus. Beginning in May of 2022, a rapid increase in the number of monkeypox cases emerged. Historically, lesions began on the face and spread across the trunk and extremities. In the current outbreak, it has been observed that lesions begin primarily in the genital region in men who have sex with men.
C. HSV – Incorrect. Genital herpes presents as painful grouped vesicles or ulcers. Disseminated HSV could present as facial and genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient. Serologies for HIV were negative.
D. Candida albicans – Incorrect. Cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright red erythema surrounded by satellite pustules and papules in moist areas. Deep fungal infections can cause genital ulcers but C. albicans is not the typical pathogen.
E. Non-infectious inflammation – Incorrect. Behcet syndrome is characterized by recurrent oral apthae associated with genital ulcers. The precise etiology is unknown, but an autoimmune etiology has been proposed. The classic triad includes uveitis as well.

### Interactions between human immunodeficiency virus and herpes viruses within the oral mucosa [^77b23f2a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

There is evidence from clinical case reports and epidemiological studies that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be transmitted through oral sex. Herpes viruses that appear in the oral mucosa might influence the oral replication of HIV. A review of data suggesting that interactions occur between HIV and herpes viruses indicates that such interactions might operate in the oral mucosa. Defining the mechanisms by which herpes viruses interact with HIV in the oral mucosa should permit intervention measures to be targeted more precisely.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1b74c920]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease clinical manifestations — oral HSV-1 illness in untreated patients lasts 5 days to 10 days and lesions recur 1 to 12 times per year, and genital HSV shedding occurs more frequently in persons with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3 than in those with higher counts, while in profoundly immunocompromised patients extensive, deep, nonhealing ulcerations have been reported most often in those with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3. Increasingly, first-episode genital herpes is caused by HSV-1 and is indistinguishable from HSV-2 infection, but recurrences and viral shedding occur less often with genital HSV-1 infection.

### Unusual oral presentation of HSV-1 lesions in an adult liver transplant recipient [^7b624dd0]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) hepatitis in liver transplant patients is a rarely reported infective complication of HSV with severe consequences, often leading to fulminant hepatitis if left untreated. The clinical signs are often atypical, leading to under-reporting in the literature and potential delays in treatment. Our case report describes such atypical mucocutaneous lesions in a liver transplant recipient. We highlight the need for further reports, especially those with images, in order to aid the diagnosis of HSV infection, and to allow prompt treatment to prevent complications such as HSV hepatitis.

### Treatment of mucocutaneous presentations of herpes simplex virus infections [^e20e8550]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types I and II are diverse and quite frequent. After primary infection, the virus establishes a life-long latency in the sensory ganglia and recrudescences may occur at an unpredictable rate. Recurrent labial and genital herpes infections represent the majority of clinical manifestations of HSV infections. Their management is currently well established using evidence-based medicine data. Primary labial herpes is generally not treated with antivirals in otherwise healthy children, although intravenous aciclovir may be offered in severe primary infections, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. The decision whether or not to treat recurrent labial herpes should be evaluated individually and depends on the frequency and severity of relapses, the impairment of the quality of life, and the cost of therapy. Patients with mild disease may benefit from topical therapy, and those with severe and frequent recurrences may be considered for intermittent or long-term oral antiviral therapy. Primary genital herpes is treated with oral or intravenous antivirals, depending on the severity of the infection and associated symptoms. Recurrent genital herpes can be managed with episodic short courses of oral antivirals in patients whose recurrences are moderate to severe and rare, and have a clear prodrome. Patients with > 5 episodes/year, severe recurrences or unrecognisable prodromes may be best managed with long-term suppressive antiviral prophylaxis. HSV is also responsible for a variety of other clinical manifestations, including herpetic whitlow, neonatal infection, disseminated and atypical cutaneous infections, traumatic herpes, eczema herpeticum, and HSV-associated erythema multiforme. HSV infection may also represent a complication following cosmetic procedures of the oro-facial region, surgical and dental interventions, sun exposure and burns. Precise treatment guidelines for these HSV infections are not firmly established.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) clinical manifestations — children with HIV may have atypical and more extensive disease, and systemic disease is uncommon in the ART era: children with advanced HIV infection may have primary infection with multiple lesions that are atypical in appearance and delayed in healing; very rarely, disseminated HSV with visceral involvement and generalized skin lesions occurs in individuals with HIV; children with HIV also may have prolonged shedding of HSV after both primary and reactivation infection; prolonged cutaneous HSV infection and organ involvement are AIDS-indicator conditions, but these illnesses are uncommon in children with HIV in the era of ART, with a documented incidence rate of systemic HSV of only 0.30 per 100 child-years; in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, HSV viremia occurs in approximately one- third of patients.

### Human herpes simplex virus infections: epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management [^3941f843]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Eight of the more than 80 known herpesviruses are human pathogens. Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a contagious infection with a large reservoir in the general population. It has a potential for significant complications in the immunocompromised host. In addition, psychological distress caused by the negative stigma associated with genital herpes and visible facial lesions in those experiencing frequent outbreaks renders it a challenging clinical dilemma. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic features of HSV infections, providing the clinician with an up-to-date understanding of the available management strategies for mucocutaneous HSV-induced disease.

### Erythema multiforme [^aed07116]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Erythema multiforme is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, though it can also be "idiopathic". The characteristic skin lesions are typical or atypical acral raised target lesions. The oral mucosa can be affected, alone or in combination with other mucosal/cutaneous sites, sometimes causing extreme pain, severely impacting food intake, and warranting hospitalization. A comprehensive understanding of erythema multiforme clinical characteristics, triggering agents, and differential diagnosis including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, is crucial to conduct proper workup and management. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be immediately ruled out because of the need of antibiotics. The cornerstone of management is symptomatic treatment and will be detailed in this review as well as the etiologic treatment. Lastly, the management of persistent or recurrent erythema multiforme can be challenging, especially when antivirals fail to prevent a relapse, but breakthrough treatments have been reported successful in this difficult-to-treat subset of patients.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^a73378f5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Because approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection. In this instance, education and counseling for persons with genital HSV infections should be provided. The presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult to interpret. HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish between oral and genital infection and typically should not be performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection. Persons with HSV-1 antibodies often have oral HSV infection acquired during childhood, which might be asymptomatic. Lack of symptoms in a person who is HSV-1 seropositive does not distinguish anogenital from orolabial or cutaneous infection, and, regardless of site of infection, these persons remain at risk for acquiring HSV-2. In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing has low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody. However, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, and HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic. Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by virologic tests from genital lesions.

Type-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing HSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or atypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV PCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation, and a patient's partner has genital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general population is not recommended. Patients who are at higher risk for infection (e.g. those presenting for an STI evaluation, especially for persons with ≥ 10 lifetime sex partners, and persons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a history of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific HSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with genital symptoms.

### Acute pruritic eruption [^be1b7ae5]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
A. Allergic contact dermatitis
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection
D. Coxsackie A infection
E. Herpes zoster infection

Answers:
A. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. This is less likely considering the patient's clinical history, rapid progression of her rash, and presence of scattered vesicles. In addition, she denied exposure to new personal care products.
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection – Incorrect. While HSV-1 is a consideration for vesicular eruptions, it tends to be more localized and presents more classically as herpes labialis or herpes gingivostomatitis rather than a generalized eruption.
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection – Correct. The clinical history and acute onset are most consistent with an infection. Despite the absence of overt viral cytopathic changes (multinucleation, nuclear margination, chromatin molding) on pathology, follicular necrosis was noted – a feature of herpes virus infection. Thus, the clinical picture was most consistent with pVZV infection. A swab of an unroofed vesicle for viral polymerase chain reaction and VZV stain on pathology confirmed this diagnosis.
D. Coxsackie A infection – Incorrect. While hand, foot, mouth disease can present with a similar eruption, this patient exhibited no oral, hand, foot, buttock, or scalp lesions, making this differential diagnosis less likely. Further, the exanthem of hand, foot, mouth disease is not pruritic.
E. Herpes zoster infection – Incorrect. While herpes zoster is a reactivation of the latent VZV, this typically presents with a dermatomal, unilateral vesicular eruption associated with pain, including sensations of burning and tingling.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics [^91c591bc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestations of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in children — including those with HIV — are outlined: Up to one third of immunocompetent children may develop primary orolabial gingivostomatitis, and HSV viremia occurs in approximately one-third of patients with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. HSV is a common cause of severe posterior pharyngitis in older children and adolescents. Children with advanced HIV infection may have primary infection with multiple lesions that are atypical in appearance and delayed in healing, and very rarely disseminated HSV with visceral involvement and generalized skin lesions occurs in individuals with HIV. Recurrent perioral or perinasal vesicles can occur intermittently in healthy children and children with HIV, but those with AIDS are at risk of frequent recurrences with severe ulcerative disease and symptoms similar to primary infection; children with HIV also may have prolonged HSV shedding after both primary and reactivation infection, and HSV esophagitis can occur in severely immunocompromised children.

### Herpetic geometric glossitis presenting as vegetative plaques in the context of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [^7d189a07]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The seroprevalence of infection with HSV types 1 and 2 among persons aged 14–49 years living in the United States was 53.9% and 15.7% from 1999 to 2010, respectively, and has shown stable declines in both sexes up to 2016.

Clinically, HSV reactivations affect the vermilion border and adjacent keratinized oral mucosa. Nevertheless, immunocompromising conditions are associated with more chronic, severe, and atypical reactivations with involvement of multiple sites and an increased risk of viral spread, which persists up to 3 weeks after the clinical resolution of the lesions. Of these atypical reactivations, HGG shows a characteristic branching pattern that resembles the dendritic corneal ulcers produced by HSV. Other clinical manifestations of HGG include papules, erythematous nodules, and ulcers over the tongue, all of which are associated with severe pain.

### Herpes simplex virus infection, with particular reference to the progression and complications of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis [^f84da18a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) represents the clinically apparent pattern of primary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, since the vast majority of other primary infections are symptomless. PHGS is caused predominantly by HSV-1 and affects mainly children. Prodromal symptoms, such as fever, anorexia, irritability, malaise and headache, may occur in advance of disease. The disease presents as numerous pin-head vesicles, which rupture rapidly to form painful irregular ulcerations covered by yellow-grey membranes. Sub-mandibular lymphadenitis, halitosis and refusal to drink are usual concomitant findings. Following resolution of the lesions, the virus travels through the nerve endings to the nerve cells serving the affected area, whereupon it enters a latent state. When the host becomes stressed, the virus replicates and migrates in skin, mucosae and, in rare instances, the central nervous system. A range of morbidities, or even mortality, may then occur, i.e., recurrent HSV infections, which are directly or indirectly associated with PHGS. These pathological entities range from the innocuous herpes labialis to life-threatening meningoencephalitis.

### Herpes labialis [^3931b190]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus type 1 infection usually causes a mild, self-limiting painful blistering around the mouth, with 20% to 40% of adults affected at some time. Primary infection usually occurs in childhood, after which the virus is thought to remain latent in the trigeminal ganglion. Recurrence may be triggered by factors such as exposure to bright light, stress, and fatigue.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of antiviral treatments for the first attack of herpes labialis? What are the effects of interventions aimed at preventing recurrent attacks of herpes labialis? What are the effects of treatments for recurrent attacks of herpes labialis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 27 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antiviral agents, sunscreen, topical anaesthetic agents, topical antiviral agents, and zinc oxide cream.

### Symptoms of the oral cavity and their association with local microbiological and clinical findings – a prospective survey in palliative care [^dca50b41]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The high incidence of Candida spp. as the leading microbiological finding denotes the most remarkable result of the study, showing quite different microbiological characteristics in the given palliative care population, almost doubling regular prevalence in healthy subjects. This finding stands out even more, as the bacterial environment of the oral cavity was found to be not relevantly altered compared to a healthy working population, with the exception of an increased prevalence of multiresistant bacteria, obviously related to preceding hospitalisations.

Also, a relatively low number of our patients (19) have been positively tested for herpes simplex virus by PCR. Their spectrum of symptoms did not differ from other patient subgroups; especially, there was no increase in oral pain, as might have been suggested. Only two of the four patients addressing pain as a relevant symptom of the oral cavity had positive HSV PCR results.

A number of factors like thrush, yeasts, herpes simplex virus, anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepines and opioids etc. went along with the perception of dry mouth, less often with the perception of altered taste. Significant correlations, though, predominantly involved the criteria of dry mouth, taste disturbances or yeasts/thrush respectively. As many conditions lead to a stereotype symptom pattern, clear causal relations, as attributed for instance to the role of anticholinergic drugs or opioids, can hardly be extrapolated in a complex palliative care setting.

This study allows a description of clinical and pathobiological associations rather than causal relations. The remarkably high prevalence of Candida spp. in the oral cavity may well be a causative factor for oral symptoms like dry mouth or taste disturbances (and therefore a possible target for empirical antifungal treatment). At the other hand, xerostomia and taste disturbances may rather be caused by salivary gland dysfunction (suggesting the substitution of saliva or therapeutic interventions to stimulate the salivary glands), that is followed by Candida infection. Therefore, future research agenda should involve efforts for a better understanding of the complex pathophysiological processes within the oral cavity of palliative care patients, including the potential role of cancer itself and its metabolic and immunological impact.

Nevertheless, even the mere description of clinical and pathobiological associations might be clinically useful: if a patient complains about dry mouth, the clinical alertness for associated Candida infection should be high.

### Herpes simplex virus DNA testing by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for accurate clinical diagnosis and detection of mucosal viral shedding [^52a31d02]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) periodically forms characteristic blisters in the perioral and genital areas in a subset of people. Because of the lack of accurate tests for this common virus, various types of perioral/anogenital lesions are often misdiagnosed as herpes. Also, though asymptomatic HSV-positive people shed virus, the precise time course of symptoms and viral shedding is unclear. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method amplifies target DNA sequences without thermal cycles, simpler and faster than polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To investigate clinico-laboratorial correlation and whether HSV can be detected in the oral cavity during symptom occurrence, we collected 445 specimens from 211 patients who visited our clinic with suspected herpetic lesions or non-symptomatic volunteers. DNA was extracted from swabs simultaneously taken from lesions (n = 219) and seemingly asymptomatic oral mucosa (n = 226). HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA sequences were amplified by LAMP and validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The LAMP method detected HSV DNA almost as sensitively (97%) as PCR. Positivity for HSV DNA was found in 54% (40/74) of specimens from the perioral/oral area. Review of clinical images of recurrent herpes labialis revealed that HSV DNA was detected only from lesions located on the perioral skin and/or the dry, vermillion part of the lip; no HSV DNA was found in immunocompetent patients with lesions confined to the oral mucosa except primary infection. This observation may be an important principle for clinical diagnosis of recurrent herpes. HSV was detected in the oral mucosa in 2.7% (6/226) of samples; all of these patients had either primary infection or were immunosuppressed. Virus shedding in the mucosa was apparently tightly regulated by the immune system. Patients with suppressed or no immunity (naïve cases) did shed virus in the mucosa. LAMP is a simple method to reliably distinguish recurrent/primary herpes from other conditions.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^73bbe952]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) transmission and shedding in children and HIV are characterized by frequent asymptomatic shedding and multiple contact routes. Young children generally acquire HSV-1 from the oral secretions of caretakers or playmates, and infection most often results from exposure to HSV shed asymptomatically in saliva. Salivary shedding detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in adults who are HSV-1-seropositive is frequent (9% to 30% of days). Genital shedding of HSV-2 by women who do not have HIV, as detected by PCR, is frequent (19% of days). Either HSV type can be transmitted by oral-oral, oral-genital, and genital-genital contact. Oral and genital HSV shedding is more common near the first episode and in patients with HIV (30% of days in individuals who are HSV seropositive and not on antiretroviral therapy [ART]), and shedding of oral HSV persists longer in young children.

### Genital herpes… [^a304c400]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION Primary genital herpes has an incubation period of two to 12 days, with a mean of four days, followed by a prodrome of itching, burning or erythema. 1 Multiple transient, painful vesicles then appear on the penis, perineum, vulva, vagina or cervix, and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy may follow 3. In immunocompetent patients, the initial ulceration crusts and heals by 14 to 21 days. Systemic symptoms are common in primary disease and include fever, headache, malaise, abdominal pain and myalgia. 2, 3 Recurrences are usually less severe and shorter in duration than the initial outbreak. 1, 3. TREATMENT OF PRIMARY INFECTION Antiviral therapy is recommended for an initial genital herpes outbreak, especially if the patient has systemic symptoms or is immunocompromised. 2 Oral acyclovir is effective in reducing symptoms 1.

Intravenous administration may be required in immunocompromised patients and those with severe disseminated infection. 1 Topical acyclovir reduces the duration of viral shedding and the length of time before all lesions become crusted, but this treatment is much less effective than oral or intravenous acyclovir.

1. Orolabial Herpes Orolabial herpes is the most prevalent form of mucocutaneous herpes infection; 35 to 60 percent of white persons in the United States show serologic evidence of having been infected by HSV-1. 1 Black persons and persons from low economic populations are infected earlier in life. Overall, the highest rate of infection occurs during the preschool years. 1 Female gender, history of sexually transmitted diseases and multiple sexual partners have also been identified as risk factors for HSV-1 infection.
33. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis usually affects children under the age of five.

It typically takes the form of painful vesicles and ulcerative erosions on the tongue, palate, gingiva, buccal mucosa and lips. Edema, halitosis and drooling may be present, and tender submandibular or cervical lymphadenopathy is not uncommon.

### Oral mucosal fixed drug eruption: characteristics and differential diagnosis [^9f6d4d46]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about the characteristic features of oral mucosal fixed drug eruption (FDE).

Objective

To present the clinical highlights and the differential diagnosis of oral mucosal FDE in a relatively large group of patients from Turkey.

Methods

This was a methodological, retrospective, cross-sectional study of 61 patients with oral mucosal FDE. The causative drug was established mainly by oral provocation test.

Results

The age range of 61 patients (38 females, 23 males) was 7 to 62 years. Naproxen and cotrimoxazole were the main inducers. Fourteen patients (23%) had a solitary oral lesion predominantly located on the dorsum of the tongue, or on the hard palate, the former statistically significantly associated with cotrimoxazole. Bullous/erosive (n = 47), aphthous (n = 12), and erythematous (n = 2) morphology were observed. A considerable number of patients were referred with a prior clinical diagnosis of herpes simplex and Behçet's disease; some of them were already receiving long-term treatment with acyclovir and colchicine, respectively.

Limitations

The main limitation of the present study resides in its retrospective design.

Conclusions

Isolated oral lesions, aphthous lesions, severe bullous/erosive lesions, and the absence of residual pigmentation are the main features that may cause difficulties in the differential diagnosis. It is important to differentiate dysmenorrhea-related monthly attacks of oral FDE in female patients caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from menstruation-triggered attacks of herpes simplex infection, and isolated orogenital aphthous FDE from Behçet's disease, especially in countries with a high frequency of the disease in order to prevent irrelevant therapies.

### An unusual presentation of herpes infection in the head and neck [^71385a42]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is among a spectrum of viruses known to affect the upper aerodigestive tract. Gingivostomatitis and pharyngitis are the most common clinical manifestations of first-episode HSV infection, whereas recurrent herpes labialis is the most common clinical manifestation of reactivation HSV infection. Herpetic viral infections seldom attack the larynx. Laryngeal disorders provoked by the herpes virus are characterised by a large spectrum of presentations and polymorphisms, and can simulate mucous lesions such as an extensive laryngeal neoplasm (supraglottic tumour). We report a case of a 69-year-old woman, smoker, who presented with a large ulcerated supraglottic mass mimicking laryngeal cancer, requiring emergency tracheostomy for worsening stridor, which turned out to be an HSV laryngitis superimposed onto an underlying Streptococcus A lower respiratory tract infection. The patient was treated for Streptococcus A infection and her symptoms resolved following treatment. Patient's tracheotomy tube was removed on follow-up appointment.

### Herpetic geometric glossitis presenting as vegetative plaques in the context of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [^419d9c5e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment of uncomplicated mucocutaneous lesions can be achieved with oral acyclovir 400 mg every 8 hours, famciclovir 500 mg every 12 hours, or valacyclovir 1 g every 12 hours for 5–10 days. For severe mucocutaneous HSV infections, intravenous acyclovir treatment is recommended initially at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 8 hours; when lesions begin to improve, therapy can be switched to the oral route, and antiviral therapy must be continued until healing of lesions is complete. Patient with HIV who have severe or frequent recurrences are candidates for chronic suppressive therapy, which should be evaluated annually by an infectious disease specialist.

This case report describes the rare clinical presentation of HGG as vegetative plaques that coexisted on a constitutional fissured tongue and highlights the quick favorable response to acyclovir treatment. Also, this case underscores the importance of considering atypical HSV clinical manifestations in the differential diagnosis of oral or anogenital dermatoses that present in patients with HIV.

### Herpetic geometric glossitis presenting as vegetative plaques in the context of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [^7ba52dbf]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

During the evaluation of patients with chronic HIV infection and sudden development of oral lesions, it is important to rule out other infectious conditions, such as secondary syphilis. Oral manifestations of Treponema pallidum can mimic oral herpes infection, candidiasis, and oral hairy leukoplakia, and may also be observed without the classical rash with macules and papules that involves palms and soles; for this reason, venereal disease research laboratory and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption tests in HIV patients are justified. Also, it is important to keep in mind that atypical hypertrophic variants of HSV that resemble squamous cell carcinoma of the anogenital region have been described in patients with HIV, which highlights the need to biopsy lesions with rapid growth before any therapeutic procedure is offered.

The diagnosis of HSV is based on the onset of classic symptoms and morphology and distribution of lesions, but in immunocompromised patients it is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis with laboratory tests. The Tzanck smear is an economical, accessible, and fast tool available in most clinics; nevertheless, it does not have the specificity to distinguish between different types of herpes viruses. Since HIV-positive patients have an elevated cancer risk, use of cytology as a diagnostic test is not recommended in chronic cases of tumor-like, vegetative, or ulcerated HSV lesions because it has only moderate reliability for tumoral diseases; thus, malignancies could be overlooked. Viral culture allows the precise identification of HSV 1 or 2 and also identifies acyclovir-resistant HSV. Polymerase chain reaction for HSV has 95% sensitivity and specificity and is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of herpetic meningitis and encephalitis. Histological analysis with immunostaining also confirms the diagnosis, and it can also differentiate between HSV 1 and 2.

### Perianal ulcer and proctocolitis in an immunocompromised patient [^9ee53ffe]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely cause of the proctocolitis?
A. Lymphogranuloma venereum
B. KS
C. Herpes simplex virus
D. Cytomegalovirus
E. Mpox

Answers:
A. Lymphogranuloma venereum – Correct. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is an infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3. LGV is characterized by painful inguinal lymphadenopathy and proctocolitis, most commonly in men who have sex with men or in patients with a history of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Ulcerations at the site of inoculation are also characteristic findings. As our patient had already received a partial antibacterial course of therapy for a prior positive urine NAAT for Chlamydia, negative rectal swab NAAT does not exclude LGV.
B. KS – Incorrect. Cutaneous KS presents as vascular plaques frequently affecting the extremities or oral mucosa, and gastrointestinal involvement can cause hemorrhagic nodules, tenesmus, and diarrhea that can mimic ulcerative colitis.KS does not account for the histopathology or the perianal ulceration.
C. Herpes simplex virus – Incorrect. In an immunocompromised individual, herpes simplex virus can be complicated by disseminated infection, erosions, or proctocolitis. Biopsy from the edge of the perianal ulcer was not performed. However, the absence of viral cytopathic changes on histopathology of rectal biopsy makes this a less likely explanation for the proctocolitis.
D. Cytomegalovirus – Incorrect. Cytomegalovirus manifests in immunocompromised individuals as anogenital ulcerations or, more rarely, as nodules or maculopapular eruptions. It can cause proctitis with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bleeding. However, the absence of viral cytopathic changes on histopathology makes this a less likely explanation.
E. Mpox – Incorrect. Mpox colitis presents with rectal pain accompanied by perianal ulcers or rectal bleeding following a viral prodrome of fever, myalgia, or pharyngitis. Negative polymerase chain reaction for Mpox excludes this diagnosis.

### Diffuse skin-colored papules in a child [^72cd0b14]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What group of viruses is implicated in this skin disease?
A. Human papillomavirus
B. Coxsackievirus
C. Poxviridae
D. Herpes viruses
E. Polyomaviridae

Answers:
A. Human papillomavirus – Correct. Beta human papillomaviruses are a group of DNA viruses implicated in the production of various warts on the skin. Specifically, there have been more than 20 different strains of HPV implicated in EV. Some strains of HPV, namely HPV-5, -8, and -14, are associated with higher oncogenic potential of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with EV. Skin lesions are thought to develop as a result of the cumulative cocarcinogenic effects of genetics, HPV, and ultraviolet radiation. Malignancy is usually observed approximately 20–30 years after the formation of benign lesions. The patient in this case was investigated for low-risk (6, 11, 40, 43, 44, 54, 69, 70, 71, E6/E7) and high-risk (16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 83, E6/E7) HPV strains using an in-situ hybridization assay. The results of these investigations were negative, and the patient was most likely infected with an alternative HPV strain that has been associated with EV.
B. Coxsackievirus – Incorrect. Coxsackieviruses are associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease. Typical cutaneous lesions include red vesicular macules, papules, and blisters on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the hands, and ulcerative oral lesions.
C. Poxviridae – Incorrect. Poxviridae are associated with molluscum contagiosum (ie, molluscum contagiosum virus). Typical cutaneous lesions include clusters of indurated, red, umbilicated papules that present in moist areas such as the intertriginous regions.
D. Herpes viruses – Incorrect. Herpes viruses are implicated in several diseases of the skin, including herpes zoster (shingles), and herpes simplex infection for example. Herpes zoster presents with typical vesicular cutaneous lesions confined to a dermatomal distribution. Non-genital herpes simplex infection typically presents with grouped vesicular and eroded cutaneous lesions around the mouth and face, as well as the anogenital region.
E. Polyomaviridae – Incorrect. Polyomaviridae have been associated with diseases of the skin, including Merkel cell carcinomas and trichodysplasia spinulosa. Merkel cell carcinoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging, red, solitary nodule, typically on the head and neck. Trichodysplasia spinulosa presents with skin-colored follicular papules with a central keratin spine, typically on the nose and forehead.

### Oral antivirals revisited in the treatment of herpes zoster: what do they accomplish? [^5db8907d]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Oral antiviral agents currently represent the most important therapeutic keystone in the treatment of herpes zoster. Three oral antiviral agents are available for the treatment of herpes zoster: acyclovir, its derivative valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Meta-analysis of published data has shown that oral acyclovir significantly reduces various herpes zoster-related symptoms as well as the duration, intensity and prevalence of zoster-associated pain (ZAP). However, this drug does not influence postherpetic neuralgia. The newer agents famciclovir and valacyclovir exhibit a better oral bioavailability than acyclovir. These agents have demonstrated similar efficacy to acyclovir with ZAP and they require less frequent administration. When initiated within 72 hours, oral antiviral therapy of herpes zoster is beneficial in selected, elderly immunocompetent patients, reducing the duration and intensity of ZAP and providing more rapid skin lesion healing. Oral antivirals are also of benefit in immunocompromised patients with uncomplicated herpes zoster. However, signs of cutaneous and visceral dissemination should be monitored; if signs occur, intravenous antiviral therapy is indicated.

### A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of topical 2% viscous lidocaine in improving oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth conditions [^f444e5f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Painful infectious mouth conditions are a common presentation to paediatric emergency departments. These are usually viral conditions such as gingivostomatitis (herpetic and non herpetic), ulcerative pharyngitis, herpangina and hand foot and mouth disease. Most of the paediatric literature concerns primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) caused by infection with the herpes simplex virus. Although self limiting, there is considerable morbidity from decreased oral intake. Amir et al found that 89% of patients with PHGS drank less than normal. The oral lesions can persist for 7 to 18 days with the risk of dehydration. The presence of extra-oral lesions in addition to intra-oral lesions is highly indicative of PHGS, and may be used to differentiate PHGS from other ulcerative mouth conditions of children: mainly herpangina and hand foot and mouth disease (both caused by the coxsackie virus). In herpangina, lesions are typically seen on the posterior portion of the oral cavity and palate, with an absence of extra-oral lesions. Hand foot and mouth disease typically has both intra-oral and extra-oral lesions and the distribution of characteristic lesions on the hands and feet distinguishes it from PHGS. These findings are particularly valuable as the majority of PHGS cases are diagnosed on clinical findings alone. Treatment for such conditions is generally symptomatic and therefore a precise diagnosis is not critical as such.

### US expert Delphi consensus on the prevention and management of stomatitis in patients treated with datopotamab deruxtecan [^da9393a8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral mucositis/stomatitis (hereafter stomatitis) is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of any of the structures in the mouth and is characterized by ulceration, erythema, and impaired oral functioning, examples of which have been shown previously. It is a common adverse event associated with many anticancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted therapies like everolimus (67% incidence of all-grade stomatitis reported in patients with solid tumors). The presence of stomatitis may be superimposed with oral infections such as candidiasis and herpes simplex virus and clinical criteria for differential diagnosis has been established in guidelines. In severe cases, stomatitis negatively impacts patients' quality of life, causing oral pain and inability to eat or drink 9. Dose delay or reduction, rescheduling, and cessation of treatment are often necessary consequences, and may impact cancer treatment dose density and outcomes.

### Interventions for men and women with their first episode of genital herpes [^2d8efcdc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Genital herpes is incurable, and is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). First-episode genital herpes is the first clinical presentation of herpes that a person experiences. Current treatment is based around viral suppression in order to decrease the length and severity of the episode.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the different existing treatments for first-episode genital herpes on the duration of symptoms and time to recurrence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (from inception to April 2016), MEDLINE (from inception to April 2016), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group (from inception to April 2016), EMBASE (from inception to April 2016), PsycINFO (from inception to April 2016), CINAHL (from inception to April 2016), LILACS (from inception to April 2016), AMED (from inception to April 2016), and the Alternative Medicines Specialised Register (from inception to April 2016). We handsearched a number of relevant journals, searched reference lists of all included studies, databases of ongoing trials, and other Internet databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on participants with first-episode genital herpes. We excluded vaccination trials, and trials in which the primary objective assessed a complication of HSV infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

All studies written in English were independently assessed by at least two review authors for inclusion, risk of bias for each trial, and to extract data. Studies requiring translation were assessed for inclusion, trial quality, and data extraction by external translators.

Main Results

We included 26 trials with 2084 participants analysed. Most of the studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US), and involved men and women experiencing their first episode of genital herpes, with the exception of three studies which included only women. We rated the majority of these studies as having an unclear risk of bias; largely due to lack of information supplied in the publications, and due to the age of the trials. This review found low quality evidence from two studies of oral acyclovir, when compared to placebo, reduced the duration of symptoms in individuals undergoing their first episode of genital herpes (mean difference (MD) -3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.91 to -0.54; I(2) = 52%). In two studies (112 participants), intravenous acyclovir decreased the median number of days that patients with first-episode herpes suffered symptoms. Oral valaciclovir (converted to acyclovir) also showed a similar length of symptom duration when compared to acyclovir in two studies. There is currently no evidence that topical acyclovir reduces symptoms (MD -0.61 days, 95% CI -2.16 to 0.95; 3 RCTs, 195 participants, I(2) statistic = 56%). There is also no current evidence that the topical treatments of cicloxolone cream, carbenoxolone sodium cream, adenosine arabinoside, idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide, when compared to placebo reduced the duration of symptoms in people undergoing their first episode of herpes. Two studies reported no evidence of a reduction in the number of median days to recurrence following treatment with oral acyclovir versus placebo. Adverse events were generally poorly reported by all of the included studies and we were unable to quantitatively analyse this outcome. For those taking acyclovir, there were no serious adverse events; the most common adverse events reported for oral acyclovir were coryza, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhoea and renal colic. For intravenous acyclovir these were phlebitis, nausea and abnormal liver function tests and for topical acyclovir there was pain with the topical application. Those undergoing interferon treatment had significantly more adverse events compared to those taking placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low quality evidence from this review that oral acyclovir reduced the duration of symptoms for genital herpes. However, there is low quality evidence which did not show that topical antivirals reduced symptom duration for patients undergoing their first episode of genital herpes. This review was limited by the inclusion of skewed data, resulting in few trials that we were able to meta-analyse.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) severe mucocutaneous disease or organ involvement in immunocompromised children and youth — intravenous-to-oral management and resistance signals are described as follows: Placebo-controlled trials in children and youth with immunocompromising conditions (other than HIV infection) indicate that those with severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions or organ involvement benefitted from IV acyclovir. Patients with severe mucocutaneous lesions can be switched to oral antiviral therapy after their lesions have begun to regress, and duration of therapy will depend on the rate and character of healing, but therapy should be continued until lesions have completely healed; failure to heal, or a marked delay or change in rate of healing, should raise concern for acyclovir resistance.

Warts/Condyloma diagnosis — Diagnosis of genital and oral warts is made by visual inspection and can be confirmed by biopsy. However, biopsy is needed only if the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesions do not respond to standard therapy, or the warts are pigmented, indurated, fixed, bleeding, or ulcerated. No data support the use of HPV testing for screening, diagnosis, or management of visible genital/oral warts or oral HPV disease in people with HIV.

### Burning mouth syndrome due to herpes simplex virus type 1 [^9ceb9569]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Burning mouth syndrome is characterised by chronic orofacial burning pain. No dental or medical cause has been found. We present a case of burning mouth syndrome of 6 months duration in a healthy 65-year-old woman, which was associated with high copy numbers of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA in the saliva. Her pain resolved completely after antiviral treatment with a corresponding absence of salivary HSV-1 DNA 4 weeks and 6 months later.

### Oral manifestations of COVID-19 – A literature review [^9370a0fd]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Initially, it was reported that coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19) affects respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological systems, but the oral, olfactory and integumentary systems are also involved. This review discusses various oral manifestations of Covid-19 reported in the literature along with possible underlying mechanisms. The reported manifestations include taste impairment, oral mucosal changes (petechiae, ulcers, plaque-like lesions, reactivation of herpes simplex virus 1(HSV1), geographical tongue and desquamative gingivitis) and dry mouth. The prominent location for mucosal lesions are tongue, palate and labial mucosa. The exact pathogenesis of these oral symptoms is not known. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptors are expressed in abundance on oral mucosa allowing severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect them. Gustatory impairment along with olfactory changes is now listed as a symptom of Covid-19 by the World Health Organization, but further research is needed to confirm a link between reported additional oral symptoms and Covid-19. Dental professionals may encounter individuals with Covid-19 and be called upon to identify various oral manifestations of this disease.

### Burning mouth syndrome associated with varicella zoster virus [^a4fa86d7]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We present two cases of burning mouth syndrome (BMS)-of 8-month duration in a 61-year-old woman and of 2-year duration in a 63-year-old woman-both associated with increased levels of antivaricella zoster virus (VZV) IgM antibodies in serum and with pain that improved with antiviral treatment. Combined with our previous finding of BMS due to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, we recommend evaluation of patients with BMS not only for VZV or HSV-1 DNA in the saliva, but also for serum anti-VZV and anti-HSV-1 IgM antibodies. Both infections are treatable with oral antiviral agents.

### Acyclovir for treating primary herpetic gingivostomatitis [^079e5635]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is a highly contagious infection of the oral cavity which typically affects children but can also occur in adults. Symptoms may vary widely from mild discomfort to life-threatening encephalitis.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of systemic acyclovir for primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 22 May 2008); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1950 to 22 May 2008); and EMBASE (1980 to 22 May 2008). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing acyclovir to placebo in children and young adults < 25 years of age with a diagnosis of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis with or without herpes labialis were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently and in duplicate screened and extracted information from, and assessed the risk of bias in the included clinical trials. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed for data synthesis.

Main Results

Only two clinical trials, one with 72 participants and the other with 20 participants were included in this review. The second study failed to report several methodological items and was inconsistent in its reporting of the outcomes measurement. The first trial, with a moderate risk of bias, showed better results in the acyclovir group compared to the placebo group in children < 6 years of age in reducing the number of individuals with oral lesions (risk ratio (RR) 0.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.38)), new extraoral lesions (RR 0.04 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.65)), difficulty in eating (RR 0.14 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.58)), and drinking difficulties (RR 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.83)) after 8 days of treatment. Following the onset of treatment, three patients from the placebo group were admitted to hospital for rehydration (P = 0.11). Four children (two from the acyclovir, and two from the placebo group) showed mild gastrointestinal symptoms that resolved spontaneously after 24 to 48 hours without a change in the study treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

We found two relevant trials in this systematic review, only one of them could provide some weak evidence that acyclovir is an effective treatment in reducing the number of oral lesions, preventing the development of new extraoral lesions, decreasing the number of individuals with difficulties experienced in eating and drinking and reducing hospital admission for children under 6 years of age with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^3a685330]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What would you expect to see on dermoscopy of active lesions?
A. Targetoid white rings without structure, with central brownish crust or vesicle, and perilesional erythema.
B. Well-defined white structures with pronounced erythema and central brown dots.
C. Dot vessels on a red structureless background.
D. Blurry linear vessels and whitish amorphous masses (cottage cheese-like structures).
E. Diffuse monomorphic dotted and glomerular vessels on a diffuse, yellowish red background with a circular scaling edge.

Answers:
A. Targetoid white rings without structure, with central brownish crust or vesicle, and perilesional erythema – Correct. The dermoscopic features observed in our reported case are demonstrated in Fig 2. Dermoscopic descriptions of monkeypox lesions are lacking in the literature. Reported dermoscopic characteristics of other viral lesions are similar to what is seen in our case.
B. Well-defined white structures with pronounced erythema and central brown dots – Incorrect. HSV lesions demonstrate central brown pigmentation surrounded by white color and peripheral erythema, similar to monkeypox lesions. The lesions can be differentiated by central brown dots seen in HSV lesions.
C. Dot vessels on a red structureless background – Incorrect. These features would be seen in genital ulcers of Behcet syndrome. Oral ulcers can be characterized by central white structureless areas, similar to monkeypox. Dot vessels, however, will be seen in oral and genital lesions.
D. Blurry linear vessels and whitish amorphous masses (cottage cheese-like structures) – Incorrect. These features would be observed in lesions of cutaneous candidiasis. Linear vessels are not characteristic of monkeypox lesions.
E. Diffuse monomorphic dotted and glomerular vessels on a diffuse, yellowish red background with a circular scaling edge – Incorrect. This finding describes Biett's sign that can be found in secondary syphilis lesions and is considered a strong indicator. Monkeypox lesions do not show vessels or peripheral scaling.

### Nongenital herpes simplex virus… [^8cb67750]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

The vesicle should be unroofed with a scalpel or sterile needle, and a swab should be used to soak up the fluid and to scrape the base. The swab should be sent in special viral transport media directly to the laboratory. Vesicles contain the highest titers of virus within the first 24 to 48 hours of their appearance. 4 It is useful for the detection of asymptomatic viral shedding. Direct fluorescent antibody testing may be performed from air-dried specimens, and can detect 80 percent of true HSV-positive cases compared with culture results. 10 Immunoglobulin G antibodies that are type-specific to HSV develop the first several weeks after infection and persist indefinitely. 12 Viral shedding was significantly shorter in the group treated with acyclovir. 12 Children should be treated symptomatically with oral analgesics and cold, soothing foods such as ice pops and ice cream.

Various concoctions of topical anesthetics and other medications have been used to numb the painful ulcers so that children can be kept well hydrated. EPISODIC ORAL TREATMENT FOR RECURRENT HERPES LABIALIS In a Cochrane review on the treatment of herpes labialis in patients receiving cancer treatment, acyclovir was found to be effective with regard to viral shedding; time to first decrease in pain; complete resolution of pain; and total healing. 13 The brief period of viral replication in recurrent herpes labialis lesions suggests short therapeutic regimens should produce good results. In one RCT, 701 patients self-initiated therapy with famciclovir or placebo within one hour of prodromal symptoms onset.

17 More than 90 percent of patients in both groups healed completely within 10 days. 17 Treatment with docosanol cream, when applied five times per day and within 12 hours of episode onset, is safe and somewhat effective. An RCT of healthy adults with a history of frequent herpes labialis recurrences evaluated treatment with 5% acyclovir cream versus a vehicle control.

### Erythema multiforme [^4dab6fcd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Mucosal involvement

The typical primary lesion of the oral mucosa consists of vesicles, but they rupture easily, giving way to post-bullous erosions. The initial mucosal lesions are rarely visualized. The onset of the disease is often brisk, preceded by tingling sensations in the affected areas. Lesions preferentially occur on non-keratinized mucous membranes such as the lips, cheeks, ventral surfaces of the tongue and are often painful. The gum is typically spared, allowing the differential diagnosis of primary herpetic infection, which is accompanied by general signs and symptoms, fever, and painful cervical lymph nodes. Involvement of the vermilion of both lips is common, with the presence of hemorrhagic crusts. Skin rosettes are inconsistent. The intensity of oral involvement varies; it can be minimal with few lesions, or, conversely, extremely extensive, preventing any food intake with subsequent hospitalization. Mucosal lesions spontaneously resolve within two to three weeks without leaving a scar. Outbreaks of oral erythema multiforme can recur at an unpredictable rate. Some patients will have only one outbreak in their lifetime, while others will have one to two per year. Conversely, some patients will have frequent or even continuous outbreaks. The current body of research does not provide any evidence to explain why patients differ in the frequency of outbreaks from once in lifetime to annually or continuous EM flare-ups. In HSV-induced EM some patients will only have one episode while others will have recurrences every month. HSV lesions do not always precede EM. The diagnosis is confirmed when long term suppressive antiviral therapy reduces the EM flares. The prognosis of oral erythema multiforme is dominated by the frequency of these recurrences, making this condition sometimes disabling, warranting a preventive treatment.

Oral EM

Isolated oral EM is a subset of EM that presents with clinical features of multiple self-limited irregular oral ulcers. The disease can be recurrent. HSV is the most common triggering agent. The diagnosis is challenging and is based on the exclusion of other mucosal diseases such as auto-immune bullous diseases, erosive mucosal lichen planus, and SJS, rendering the biopsy a crucial step in management. The current epidemiologic data is not enough to support this phenotype but in our experience, cases of isolated oral EM lesions without any skin manifestations, in the absence of drug intake and after ruling out auto-immune bullous diseases and connective tissue diseases by serology and/or biopsy would be considered and treated as EM.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) transmission and perinatal risk in the context of HIV — key quantitative patterns and modifiers are described: In women without HIV, genital HSV-2 shedding detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is frequent at 19% of days, and oral and genital HSV shedding is more common near the first episode and in patients with HIV, reaching 30% of days in HSV-seropositive individuals not on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Either HSV type can be transmitted by oral-oral, oral-genital, and genital-genital contact. During delivery, the transmission risk is approximately 1% in pregnant women with remote primary HSV infection but rises to 30% to 50% for infants of women with recent infection; maternal HSV antibody status before delivery appears to reduce the probability of transmission and the severity of neonatal infection. Transmission risk is increased by genital shedding at delivery, a fetal scalp monitor electrode, and prolonged rupture of membranes > 6 hours, and many mothers of neonates with active HSV disease lack a history of prior genital HSV infection or lesions because maternal infection is frequently asymptomatic. Among HSV-seropositive pregnant women at delivery, HSV-2 is detected by PCR in 23% to 31% with HIV versus 9% to 12% without HIV, with shedding greatest when the CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count is low and/or the patient is not receiving ART; there is no evidence that in utero fetal HSV infection occurs more frequently in pregnant women with HIV than in those without HIV. In the general population, neonatal HSV occurs at 1 case per 2,000 to 10,000 deliveries. In adults, genital HSV-2 co-infection is associated with higher HIV RNA titers and increased risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners, and three studies suggest that maternal HSV-2 co-infection increases intrapartum HIV transmission.

### Human papillomavirus infection in the oral cavity of HIV patients is not reduced by initiating antiretroviral therapy [^70ee31d0]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Retrospective studies have reported that the use and increased duration of ART were associated with the detection of HPV DNA in oral secretions, and that oral HPV DNA has been detected more frequently in HIV-infected patients who were virologically suppressed than those not suppressed on ART. Studies have also suggested that the prevalence of HPV-associated oral warts is increased in HIV-infected patients after initiating ART. These findings are counterintuitive since the degree of immune reconstitution resulting from virologically effective combination ART controls other AIDS-associated opportunistic infections caused by DNA viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus, and JC virus.

These retrospective findings led us to hypothesize that HPV in the oropharynx would persist in HIV-infected patients after ART initiation. If true, the potential for development of HPV-related oral warts and carcinomas might further increase among HIV-infected individuals on ART, who already have an increased risk of solid tumors despite long-term suppression of HIV replication. In particular, the risk of oropharyngeal, anal, and cervical cancer (all of which can be HPV-associated) are 3–60-fold higher among HIV-infected patients in the modern ART era than in the contemporaneous general population, and the incidence of oropharyngeal and anal cancer have significantly increased in the HIV-infected population compared with the premodern ART era when survival among the HIV-infected was much shorter. Therefore, AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) protocol A5272 sought to explore the changes that occur in oral HPV DNA detection among treatment-naive HIV-positive adults over the first 24 weeks after initiating ART, as well as the prevalence of oral warts prior to and 48 weeks after ART initiation. We further explored oral HPV DNA detection in relation to immune reconstitution, measured by change in the absolute CD4 + cell count change and control of HIV replication. Our analyses accounted for oral sex behavior prior and during the study period.

### Don't just look at the surface: when mucosa tells more than the skin [^064502e7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS ON PAGE 1

Answer to question 1: D

MIRM is characterised by mucositis, possibly but not necessarily associated with sparse cutaneous involvement, which occurs after an MP infection.

Canavan et al considered this condition a separate entity from SJS due to its distinctive epidemiology, morphology, pathophysiology and disease outcomes. For this reason, specific diagnostic criteria have been proposed (table 1). From an epidemiological point of view, patients with MIRM are usually young and predominantly male. The incidence of MIRM is closely related to the spread of MP, whereas around 25% of patients with this infection may have mucocutaneous eruption. Clinically, these subjects usually present prodromal respiratory symptoms, followed after 1 week by mucocutaneous rash. In particular, MIRM affects the oral mucosa in 94% of cases and often the urogenital region. These clinical features can help doctors distinguish MIRM from EM major, usually and predominantly characterised by skin involvement with acral targetoid lesions and minimal or absent mucosal implication.

Table 1
Proposed diagnostic criteria for classic cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae -induced rash and mucositis

This patient developed a lower degree of skin involvement than SJS, along with vesiculobullous and significant erosive mucosal eruptions that also involved the urogenital region, as part of a respiratory tract infection. The absence of widespread epidermal necrosis, and the extensive and centrally distributed lesions, along with the type of exposure to drug which is not causative of SJS, further helped to rule out a drug-induced reaction. Finally, a diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis was unlikely due to the absence of extensive cutaneous detachment.

Herpetic gingivostomatitis was also improbable due to multiorgan involvement. Nevertheless, in the setting of a differential diagnosis, a viral culture and a PCR for herpes simplex virus (HSV) should always be considered to rule out a herpetic infection, which is the main immunological trigger for EM major and can lead to potential complications in immunocompromised patients.

A differential diagnosis is relevant not only due to the different treatment options and patient education but also to predict the course of the disease, which is usually milder compared with EM majorand SJS, with an overall good prognosis and rapid recovery.

### Circinate oral and genital mucositis [^3d1c1c04]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Answers:
A. Reactive arthritis – Correct. The patient presented with urethritis, arthritis, and mucosal oral and genital lesions. Typical mucocutaneous manifestations of reactive arthritis include circinate balanitis, keratoderma blenorrhagicum, and nail changes, similar to psoriatic nails with onycholysis, pitting, and subungual hyperkeratosis or periungual pustules. Oral lesions are uncommon and have been reported as red patches, painless erosions, and ulcers occurring on the tongue, palate, buccal mucosa and lips, glossitis, and geographic tongue. Previous investigators have described the oral lesions as psoriasiform or as ectopic geographic tongue because of its morphology, but images have been scarcely reported. There are no established diagnostic criteria for reactive arthritis, and its diagnosis relies on medical history and clinical findings. Patients rarely present with the classic triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis, and arthritis.
B. Lichen planus – Incorrect. Buccal mucosa and tongue are most often involved in oral lichen planus, with white streaks, often forming a lacework (reticular form) or white plaques. Male genitalia involvement often includes annular lesions or flat-topped papules affecting most frequently the glans penis. Oral ulcerative lesions are especially painful (patient's oral lesions were unnoticed) and can be surrounded by the reticular form on its edges.
C. Behçet syndrome – Incorrect. The typical lesions in Behçet syndrome are multiple and recurrent painful aphthous lesions over the mouth and genitals, along with eye involvement or skin involvement (pseudofolliculitis, erythema nodosum, acneiform lesions).
D. Herpes simplex infection – Incorrect. Herpes simplex infection occurs typically with painful ulcers along with swollen lymph nodes.
E. Secondary syphilis – Incorrect. Secondary syphilis would show a positive serologic test result for syphilis (treponemal and nontreponemal tests).

Age-adjusted prevalence of caries and dental hygiene

Plaques not resembling Candida /thrush were the most prevalent finding on clinical examination (Table 2). An abnormal bacterial spectrum, defined as quantitative alterations of otherwise physiologically colonizing bacteria of the oral cavity and/or evidence of non-physiological bacteria, was found in 34 patients. In 10 patients, two distinct species were prominent; 1 patient showed a cluster of three pathogens (Enterobacter cloacae / Pseudomonas putida / Klebsiella oxytoca). Four mouth swabs revealed multiresistant bacteria (×3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA; ×1 vancomycin-resistant enterococci, VRE).

Yeasts were found in mouth swabs of 70 patients, as compared to 37 subjects of the control group (healthy working population, Table 5). In 10 patients, two different Candida spp. were isolated (Table 6). HSV DNA was detected by PCR in 19 patients, with mean low to moderate titers.

Table 6
Presence of two Candida spp. in 10 palliative care patients

The microbiological finding of Candida spp. was not always related to the clinical finding of overt thrush (from 72 patients with yeasts, 28 patients also showed thrush on mucosa), but in 52 of 72 (61.1%) and 21 of 72 (29.1%), respectively, of patients with yeasts, no thrush or even other types of plaques could be found. Patients showing plaques resembling thrush (defined as white, patchy pseudomembraneous plaques on erythematous ground) had a microbiological confirmation of Candida spp. in 20 of 23 (86.9%, tongue) or 28 of 32 (87.5%, mucosa) of cases, respectively. Plaques that did not show these clinical characteristics were still associated with yeasts in microbiological culture in 74.1% (60 of 81, tongue) or 80.9% (51 of 63, mucosa) of cases. Other possible specifications of oral candidiasis like hyperplastic type, erythematous type or angular cheilitis were not differentiated further.

### A patient with painful oral ulcers [^55487c60]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 50-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with pale painful tongue ulcers and constitutional symptoms for 2 months. Her current medication included prednisolone 5 milligrams per day and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 to 1.5 grams per day for 2 years. Examination revealed multiple painful ulcers at tip of tongue, lower lip, and painful ulcer deep to muscular layer at dorsal aspect of tongue (Figs 1 and 2). There was no regional lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Serology for HIV is negative. Histopathological, Grocott-Gomori's Methenamine Silver, and Periodic acid-Schiff stain results are shown in Fig 3, A - C.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Oral ulcer in systemic lupus erythematosus
B. Herpes simplex virus
C. Histoplasmosis
D. Giant cell arteritis
E. MMF – induced oral ulcer

Answers:
A. Oral ulcers in systemic lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Oral ulcers in systemic lupus erythematous typically present as nonpainful, nonspecific ulcers at palate, buccal mucosa, and fissure at tongue. The histopathological features show vacuolar interface dermatitis with deep, periadnexal, and perivascular infiltration.
B. Herpes simplex virus – Incorrect. The herpes simplex virus lesions typically present as scallop border ulcerations at keratinized mucosa and chronic, enlarging ulcerations involving nonkeratinized mucosa in immunocompromised setting. The histologic findingsare ballooning cells, multinucleated giant cells, and herpetic cytopathic effect including gray margination of the chromatin at the nuclear edge.
C. Histoplasmosis – Correct. Primary oral histoplasmosis is rare. The common oral areas are tongue, palate, buccal mucosa, and gingiva. Hematoxylin and eosin staining reveals 2 to 4 μm budding yeast organisms surrounded by clear space within the cytoplasm of macrophages. The organisms will be highlighted in Grocott-Gomori's Methenamine Silver and Periodic acid-Schiff staining.
D. Giant cell arteritis – Incorrect. Tongue necrosis is an atypical presentation of giant cell arteritis. However, the classic manifestations of giant cell arteritis are headache, jaw claudication, and visual loss. Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis.
E. MMF – induced oral ulcer – Incorrect. Common presentations are major and minor aphthous ulcers. Histological analyses are nonspecific. The lesions will heal after MMF cessation for weeks.

### Pediatric herpes simplex of the anterior segment: characteristics, treatment, and outcomes [^38334daf]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections of the cornea and adnexae to raise awareness and to improve management of this important eye disease in children.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Participants

Fifty-three patients (57 eyes) 16 years of age or younger with HSV keratitis (HSK), HSV blepharoconjunctivitis (HBC), or both in an academic cornea practice.

Methods

The following data were collected: age at disease onset, putative trigger factors, coexisting systemic diseases, duration of symptoms and diagnoses given before presentation, visual acuity, slit-lamp examination findings, corneal sensation, dose and duration of medications used, drug side effects, and disease recurrence.

Main Outcome Measures

Presence of residual corneal scarring, visual acuity at the last visit, changes in corneal sensation, recurrence rate, and manifestations of HSK were assessed in patients receiving long-term prophylactic systemic acyclovir.

Results

The median age at onset was 5 years. Mean follow-up was 3.6 years. Eighteen eyes had HBC only; 4 patients in this group had bilateral disease. Of 39 eyes with keratitis, 74% had stromal disease. Thirty percent of HSK cases were misdiagnosed before presentation. Seventy-nine percent of patients with keratitis had corneal scarring and 26% had vision of 20/40 or worse at the last visit. Eighty percent of patients had recurrent disease. Six of 16 patients (37%) receiving long-term oral acyclovir had recurrent HSV, at least one case of which followed a growth spurt that caused the baseline dosage of acyclovir to become subtherapeutic.

Conclusions

In a large series, pediatric HSK had a high rate of misdiagnosis, stromal involvement, recurrence, and vision loss. Oral acyclovir is effective, but the dosage must be adjusted as the child grows.

### Lip ulceration in an immunocompromised patient [^88240e1f]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What is the most appropriate test to determine further management?
A. Serology for HSV-1 IgM
B. Viral culture and sensitivity testing
C. Fungal culture
D. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures
E. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy
Answers:
A. Serology for HSV-1 IgM – Incorrect. Serologic antibody titers to HSV-1 IgM may indicate a recent infection but are not as clinically useful as HSV-1 polymerase chain reaction or culture in establishing an active infection or treatment resistance.
B. Viral culture and sensitivity testing – Correct. The patient had multiple positive HSV-1 polymerase chain reaction results, which established the diagnosis of herpes labialis but failed to respond to therapeutic doses of valacyclovir for 1 week. To assess for antiviral resistance, HSV isolates must be obtained by tissue viral culture. Viral culture and sensitivity testing were done, which found acyclovir resistance and prompted reconsideration of treatment.
C. Fungal culture – Incorrect. Fungal cultures may be used to diagnose other infectious causes of oral mucosal lesions and should be considered in immunosuppressed patients before administration of antimicrobial agents. Our patient had a positive Tzanck smear and lesions clinically suggestive of herpes labialis; therefore, fungal cultures would not help guide further management.
D. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures – Incorrect. Given the patient's positive Tzanck smear and lesions clinically suggestive of herpes labialis, bacterial cultures would not help guide further management.
E. DIF microscopy – Incorrect. DIF microscopy is useful in the evaluation of mucocutaneous immunobullous disorders, such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, and PNP. These conditions present with desquamative gingivitis, painful ulcerations of the gingiva, buccal and lingual mucosa, or severe stomatitis in the case of PNP.

### Herpetic whitlow as a harbinger of pediatric HIV-1 infection [^2b2c0617]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Herpetic whitlow applies to a primary or recurrent herpes simplex infection of the fingers. It is a rare condition in immunocompetent patients, and usually has a rapid evolution and prompt response to treatment. We report a 10-year-old girl referred to our department of infectious diseases with recurrent and unresponsive ulcerated and necrotic lesions of the fingers of both hands as a first sign of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Numerous instances of extensive or recurrent herpes lesions of the mouth, lips, and perianal areas have been found in the literature, but we have not found any report of periungual infection as a first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Pediatricians and dermatologists need to be aware of this association in order to make an early diagnosis and start treatment of these patients' disease.

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis… [^41afa79d]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis Recurrent aphthous stomatitis, or "canker sores, " is an oral ulcerative condition with a prevalence ranging from 5 to 21 percent. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is characterized by recurring, painful, solitary or multiple ulcers, typically covered by a white-to-yellow pseudomembrane and surrounded by an erythematous halo. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis usually involves nonkeratinizing mucosa. There are three clinical forms: minor, major, and herpetiform. The minor form is the most common and appears as rounded, well-demarcated, single or multiple ulcers less than 1 cm in diameter that usually heal in 10 to 14 days without scarring. 36, 37 Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash decreases the severity of an episode but does not reduce the incidence of ulcers. 15 Amlexanox 5% paste may promote healing and lessen pain.

16 In severe or constantly recurring cases, systemic therapy with agents such as thalidomide may be necessary. Because of the risk of serious adverse effects and its off-label status, thalidomide generally is reserved for severe cases such as those associated with HIV infection.
17. 18 It usually affects the tongue, although other oral sites may be involved. Erythema migrans may occur in children and adults and exhibits a female predilection. Tongue lesions exhibit central erythema caused by atrophy of the filiform papillae and usually are surrounded by slightly elevated, curving, white-to-yellow borders. Two major clinical forms of oral lichen planus exist: reticular and erosive. The reticular form can appear as bilateral asymptomatic, white, lacy striations or papules on the posterior buccal mucosa. The erosive form manifests as zones of tender erythema and painful ulcers surrounded by peripheral white, radiating striae.

It may also manifest as generalized erythema and ulceration of the gingiva, known as desquamative gingivitis.

### Aphthous ulcers [^367028ab]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are one of the most common oral diseases worldwide. Their clinical presentation is characterized by multiple, recurrent, small, round, or ovoid ulcers with circumscribed margins and erythematous haloes present in different sizes. Oral lesions similar to aphthous ulcers may be present in several systemic diseases. This article will summarize the differential diagnosis of aphthous ulceration, with emphasis on a practical guide for the management of recurrent aphthous ulceration, including topical and systemic therapy.

### Spatial mapping of long-term recrudescent herpes simplex labialis [^1872fa3f]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1) infections, both primary and reactivation, have been repeatedly studied, but only for short periods of time. The long-term (years) natural history of recrudescent (clinically apparent) outbreaks of oral-labial HSV infection is not well characterized. We have found no report that describes the long-term; (ie, > 6 months), continuous natural history of labial HSV-1 clinical expression. This case study helps to fill that knowledge gap in that it records the frequency of HSV-1 outbreaks over a span of 38 years and precise location of outbreaks over a span of 11 years.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^c3aca03d]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) mucocutaneous infections — first-choice acyclovir dosing in children with or exposed to HIV is outlined as follows: For moderate to severe symptomatic gingivostomatitis, acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg body weight/dose IV every 8 hours. Patients can be switched to oral therapy after lesions have begun to regress and therapy continued until lesions have completely healed. For mild symptomatic gingivostomatitis, acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) dose by mouth QID for 7–10 days. For recurrent herpes labialis, acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) dose by mouth QID for 5 days. For first-episode genital herpes (adults and adolescents), acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) dose by mouth TID for 7–10 days.

### Aphthous ulcers: a difficult clinical entity [^b278aa74]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2000). Low credibility.

Recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) are the most common oral ulcerative disease, affecting 10% to 20% of the population. There are 3 clinical subtypes-minor, major, and herpetiform. Minor aphthous ulcers are the most common subtype, representing 80% to 90% of all recurrent aphthous ulcers. Clinically, RAU present as extremely painful, shallow ulcerations with an erythematous halo on unattached oral mucosa. The primary differential diagnosis is oral herpes simplex. The etiology of RAU is unknown. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy.

### Oral manifestations of allergic, infectious, and immune-mediated disease [^bd45084a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Patients often have oral symptoms, and physicians frequently identify lesions during routine oral examination. Being able to associate these concerns and findings with systemic disease is important to providing effective management of these conditions. This review summarizes the etiology, presentation, and treatment of many oral lesions associated with systemic diseases and infections. The primary focus was on lesions associated with allergic, infectious, and immune-mediated disease; however, other common concerns are addressed as well as lesions that may be misinterpreted as disease and how to address unknown lesions.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^994085e8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunocompromised hosts — Herpes zoster dermatomal pain often precedes the eruption by 24–72 hours; in otherwise healthy hosts, lesions continue to erupt for at least 4–6 days with the entire disease duration being approximately 2 weeks, whereas in immunocompromised hosts lesions may continue to develop over a longer period (7–14 days) and heal more slowly. High-dose IV acyclovir remains the treatment of choice for VZV infections in compromised hosts, and oral acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are beneficial but oral therapy should be reserved for mild cases with transient immune suppression or to complete therapy after a clinical response to IV acyclovir. Recipients of allogeneic blood and bone marrow transplants routinely take acyclovir (800 mg bid) or valacyclovir (500 mg bid) during the first year following transplant for prevention of VZV and HSV reactivation. For HSV, suppression of reactivation or continued treatment until ulcerated lesions have totally healed may decrease the incidence of acyclovir-resistant infections; acyclovir-resistant HSV isolates require a prolonged course of intravenous foscarnet, although continuous infusion of high-doses of acyclovir has been reported to be successful in HSCT patients, and surgery should be avoided unless a documented bacterial or fungal abscess is identified.

### Management of aphthous ulcers… [^2b6163ee]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Etiology Aphthae more commonly affect young adults, and a familial tendency may exist. 3 Paradoxically, smoking offers a somewhat protective effect against recurrent aphthae. 2 Other etiologic factors such as stress, physical or chemical trauma, food sensitivity and infection have been proposed. Infectious agents such as Helicobacter pylori and herpes simplex virus have been investigated but have not been consistently found in aphthous ulcers. 4 The lack of clarity regarding etiology has resulted in treatments that are largely empiric and aimed at symptom reduction. Infection-causing ulceration in the mouth should be considered when evaluating patients with oral symptoms. A common infection, particularly in patients with HIV infection and aphthae, is herpes 5. When Tzank staining is available, a sample from a herpetic lesion will reveal inclusion-bearing giant cells. Other viral, bacterial, treponemal and fungal agents have the potential to cause mouth ulcers.

Biopsy alone or in conjunction with a culture of lesions or blood testing may aid in distinguishing the causative agent. HEMATOLOGIC/ONCOLOGIC DISEASES Hematologic etiologies should be considered when evaluating recurrent or slow-healing mouth ulcers. Cyclic neutropenia is associated with mouth ulcers during neutropenic periods. 1 This preparation also provides a protective local coating for the ulcer. Early initiation of this treatment may result in a more rapid response. The paste can be applied until the ulcer is healed. For more extensive oral ulceration, dexamethasone elixir, 0. 5 mg per 5 mL, may be used as a rinse and expectorated. 1 Patients should be warned of the potential for secondary fungal infection when using a steroid rinse. Systemic steroids are generally not recommended in the management of aphthous ulcers, although they may be helpful in the management of conditions that mimic aphthous ulcers.

IMMUNE MODULATORS Immune modulators used for the management of aphthous ulcers have been investigated most thoroughly in patients infected with HIV. Aphthous ulcers in HIV-infected patients may have extremely protracted healing times, up to months. Thalidomide is the agent most frequently used for management of aphthous ulcers that cause severe pain with eating. Thalidomide in a dosage of 200 mg once to twice daily for three to eight weeks yields a faster healing rate than placebo.

### Herpes simplex and human papilloma virus coinfections in oral mucosa of men – A 6-year follow-up study [^22aa87d2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes latency in neurons and recurrent infections in oral mucosa. This prospective study analyzes HSV prevalence in oral mucosal brush samples from men with known human papillomavirus (HPV) status. We hypothesized that HSV-1-infection could facilitate HPV persistence as a cofactor. This study was a part of the Finnish Family HPV study accomplished at the University of Turku/Turku University Hospital, Finland. A total of 139 men (mean age 28.6 ± 4.9 years) were enrolled at 36+-weeks of their partner's pregnancy and thereafter followed-up for 6 years. Altogether, 722 samples, extracted from oral brush samples collected at the enrollment timepoint (baseline) and at 2-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-month, and 6 years, were available. HSV DNA was analyzed with quantitative PCR. HSV-1 results were compared with the known HPV data. The prevalence of oral HSV-1 shedding varied between 0–7.2% (mean 2.8%) among the men. Mean copy numbers varied between 4 and 550 genome copies/sample. A total of 18 (12.9%) men were found HSV-1-positive at least once, two of them twice. Neither smoking nor oral sex was associated with the oral HSV-1-DNA finding. HPV/HSV-1 co-infection was found in 6 (4.3%) men, all of them having persistent HPV-infection. In conclusion, HSV-1 and its coinfection with HPV in oral mucosa was rare.

### Acute oral ulcers [^b64d644c]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of acute oral ulcers can be challenging. Important historic details include the pattern of recurrence, anatomic areas of involvement within the mouth and elsewhere on the mucocutaneous surface, associated medical symptoms or comorbidities, and symptomology. Careful mucocutaneous examination is essential. When necessary, biopsy at an active site without ulceration is generally optimal. Depending on the clinical scenario, supplemental studies that may be useful include cultures; perilesional biopsy for direct immunofluorescence testing; and evaluation for infectious diseases, gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, connective tissue diseases, or hematinic deficiencies. Clinicians should maintain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with acute oral ulcers.

### Herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus co-infection presenting as exuberant genital ulcer in a woman infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^2b3ad3a9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

In patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), genital herpes can result in severe and atypical clinical presentations, and can become resistant to aciclovir treatment. Rarely, these manifestations may represent concurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) with other agents. We report a 41-year-old black woman with HIV who presented with extensive and painful ulceration of the genitalia. Histological examination of a biopsy sample was suggestive of herpetic infection, and intravenous aciclovir was started, but produced only partial improvement. PCR was performed on the biopsy sample, and both HSV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was detected. Oral valganciclovir was started with therapeutic success. CMV infection is common in patients infected with HIV, but its presence in mucocutaneous lesions is rarely reported. This case exemplifies the difficulties of diagnosis of genital ulcers in patients infected with HIV. The presence of exuberant and persistent HSV genital ulcers in patients with HIV should also raise suspicions of the presence of co-infection with other organisms such as CMV.

### Oral lesions in autoimmune bullous diseases: an overview of clinical characteristics and diagnostic algorithm [^526a7f14]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Main Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of erosive oral lesions include infectious agents, due to viruses and bacteria, drug-induced reactions, inflammatory conditions, and systemic diseases (Table 1). These conditions have some specific morphological features and overlapping clinical features, therefore histology is required for the diagnosis.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of oral blisters, ulcers, gingivitis, and stomatitis

SJS/TEN Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis

Oral lesions caused by infectious agents are usually transient. Primary infection with herpes simplex is the most common viral cause of erosions and blisters in the oral mucosa. Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe, mostly drug-induced reactions with an abrupt onset of erosive stomatitis and hemorrhagic cheilitis followed by widespread skin lesions (Fig. 1 j–l). The gingiva is rarely affected in Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other mucosal involvement is frequently seen, such as ocular and genital involvement.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is the most frequent inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa with recurrent self-limiting ulcers affecting non keratinized mucosa. Multiple factors are involved in the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Behçet syndrome is a chronic multi-system condition characterized by diffuse aphthous erosions and ulcers on the labial, buccal, and lateral tongue mucosa. Ocular and genital involvement is also frequently seen.

Lupus erythematosus is a systemic autoimmune disorder with a wide variety of clinical features. Oral lesions in lupus erythematosus are usually multiple, located on the buccal mucosa, hard palate, lips, and gingiva. The distribution is asymmetrical with different morphological features ranging from plaques, erythema, and ulcerations.

Oral lichen planus is a chronic immune mediated disease with highly variable clinical features ranging from subtle white reticular patterns to erosions and ulcerations (Fig. 1 m–o). Lesions are usually symmetrically distributed in the oral cavity. Affected sites of the oral cavity include the buccal mucosa, tongue, and gingiva. Histopathologic biopsies of oral lichen planus often show sub-epithelial blistering without preservation of the basal cells, in contrast to pemphigoid.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated HSV — considerations for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) — Orolabial and genital HSV should not influence the decision on when to start ART in persons with HIV. Transient increases in HSV-2–associated genital ulcers have been observed during the first 6 months after initiation of ART in HIV/HSV-2 coinfected persons; in such cases, suppressive anti-HSV therapy can be considered. The frequency and severity of clinical episodes of genital herpes is often reduced in individuals after immune reconstitution on ART; however, immune reconstitution does not reduce the frequency of genital HSV shedding.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^0985b225]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Treatment — severe primary or recurrent HSV in children and adolescents with HIV: Children and youth with HIV who have severe mucocutaneous HSV infections should be treated with IV acyclovir, and when improvement is noted they can be switched to oral therapy until healing is complete (strong; moderate). Placebo-controlled trials in children and youth with immunocompromising conditions indicate that those with severe mucocutaneous HSV lesions or organ involvement benefitted from IV acyclovir. Patients with severe mucocutaneous lesions can be switched to oral antiviral therapy after their lesions have begun to regress. Duration of therapy will depend on the rate and character of healing, but therapy should be continued until lesions have completely healed. Failure to heal, or a marked delay or change in rate of healing, should raise concern for acyclovir resistance.

### Recurrent-associated reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption responsive to systemic steroids: a case series [^9695c111]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

While oral antiviral therapy is used for recurrent HSV oral mucositis, there has been no preferred treatment for recurrent RIME stemming from M. pneumoniae infection, given the small number of recognized cases. Treatments reported in the literature have included antibiotics, systemic steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin. In all our cases, there was a response to systemic steroids within 48 hours, in which existing lesions and symptoms started to improve, and there was resolution of the lesions with completion of steroid taper in 15 to 30 days.

A limitation of this case series is that it was a retrospective study, and therefore we were restricted to the data that were collected at the time of the visits. We do not have data from physical examination or laboratory studies for a few episodes that were described by telephone, although on some occasions, the parents sent photographs which were reviewed. Although Mycoplasma serologic results were collected, RT-PCR for M. pneumoniae would have provided further specificity. However, RT-PCR was performed for HSV to rule out the most likely alternative differential diagnosis. Another limitation is that convalescent Mycoplasma serologic results were not collected, which would have allowed us to determine whether IgM levels remained persistently elevated between episodes. In our cases, there were documented elevations in IgM levels at least 1 year apart, although IgM levels may remain elevated for longer periods.

### Recurrent orolabial ulceration in a 19-year-old man [^7ec7f800]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 19-year-old otherwise healthy man presented with a three-day history of painful progressive ulceration of the orolabial mucosa. These were preceded by one week of intermittent cough, malaise, cold sweats, diarrhea and nausea. He takes no medications. On examination, there were multiple erosions and tense 0.5–1.5 cm vesiculobullae along the labial, buccal and alveolar mucosae (Figs 1 and 2) and bilateral conjunctival injection, but no involvement of the anogenital mucosa or non-mucosal skin. Punch biopsies were performed (Fig 3). Direct and indirect immunofluorescence stains, tissue stains and cultures for bacterial organisms, and polymerase chain reaction testing for herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses were all negative.

### Common oral lesions… [^88577a33]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

1, 2, 4 Major aphthae are associated with HIV infection. The herpetiform type accounts for 5% to 10% of recurrent aphthous stomatitis; they occur in patches of up to 100 aphthae anywhere in the oral cavity, ranging in size from 0. 1 to
0. 3 cm. These heal within two weeks and appear similar to herpetic stomatitis. 1, 2. Herpetic Stomatitis Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 cause herpes labialis and herpetic gingivostomatitis. HSV-1 has a 60% to 95% worldwide prevalence in adults and is normally acquired by adolescence. 14, 15 HSV-1 has classically been identified as the cause of oral lesions, whereas HSV-2 was associated with genital lesions; however, more data indicate substantial overlap. 16 The initial infection with oral HSV can be markedly symptomatic with numerous vesicles throughout the mouth and may be accompanied by fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and pain that can interfere with speech and eating.
16.

After initial exposure, HSV is dormant in the trigeminal ganglia and can cause episodic, recurrent outbreaks; stress, fatigue, illness, sunlight, and menses can reactivate HSV. 16, 17 The most common site of herpetic recurrence is the lips, but HSV may also occur at adjacent nasal structures. Up to 40% of infected individuals may develop recurrent herpes labialis. 16 A prodrome of itching, burning, pain, or tingling precedes recurrence in 60% of patients. 15–17 Studies involving exposure to experimental ultraviolet light suggest that wearing sunscreen may prevent outbreaks; however, more research is needed for actual sun exposure. 17 The relatively uncommon recurrent intraoral herpes occurs on mucosa of the hard palate, lacks a prodrome, and may be asymptomatic 16. 25–27. Persons infected with hepatitis C virus have up to a sixfold higher incidence of lichen planus; oral lichen planus may be the initial manifestation.

25 Approximately one-half of individuals with cutaneous lichen planus also have intraoral lesions. 28 Reticular, erythematous, and erosive types have been described.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^b62c0c3b]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Natural history — Initial infection describes transmission and asymptomatic shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is typically spread by direct contact, most often from virus shed into saliva or genital secretions, and can be acquired by contact with virus-laden saliva of asymptomatic individuals, who may be a common source of transmission. After initial acquisition of HSV-1, active replication in mucosa or skin spreads through neurons to dorsal root ganglia or, in the face, the trigeminal ganglia. Some patients have symptoms during the initial acute infection but most do not, and nearly two-thirds of primary HSV infections are either unrecognized or asymptomatic.

Herpes simplex virus infection — first choice therapy for gingivostomatitis and recurrent herpes labialis in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children specifies acyclovir regimens and transition guidance: Moderate to Severe Symptomatic Gingivostomatitis uses Acyclovir 5–10 mg/kg body weight/ dose IV every 8 hours, with Patients can be switched to oral therapy after lesions have begun to regress and therapy continued until lesions have completely healed. Mild Symptomatic Gingivostomatitis uses Acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) dose by mouth QID for 7–10 days, and Recurrent Herpes Labialis uses Acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight (maximum 400 mg/dose) dose by mouth QID for 5 days.

### Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and antibody response to primary infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 in young women [^0c134992]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus infections type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are common, but the epidemiology of HSV disease is changing.

Methods

HSV-seronegative women, aged 18–30 years, who were in the control arm of the HERPEVAC Trial for Women were followed for 20 months for primary HSV infections.

Results

Of the 3438 evaluable participants, 183 became infected with HSV: 127 (3.7%) with HSV-1 and 56 (1.6%) with HSV-2. The rate of infection for HSV-1 (2.5 per 100 person-years) was more than twice that for HSV-2 (1.1 per 100 person-years). Most infections (74% of HSV-1 and 63% of HSV-2) occurred without recognized signs or symptoms of herpes disease. The HSV-2 infection rate was 2.6 times higher in non-Hispanic black participants than in Hispanics and 5.5 times higher than in non-Hispanic whites (P < .001), while the HSV-1 infection rate was 1.7 times higher in non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks. Younger participants (18–22 years) were more likely to acquire HSV-1 infections and less likely to develop recognized disease than older participants. Overall, 84% of recognized disease cases were genital. No differences were noted in the clinical manifestations of genital HSV-1 vs genital HSV-2 disease. The clinicians' assessment that cases were caused by HSV was good when they assessed cases as clinically confirmed or unlikely (validated in 83% and 100% of cases, respectively).

Conclusions

HSV-1 is now more common than HSV-2 as a cause of oral and genital mucosal infections in young women, but there are important age and race differences.

Discussion

Despite being a rare condition, neonatal HSV infection is one of the most important and challenging differential diagnoses in paediatrics. The disease is a costly condition given that possible complications are associated with long hospital stays, continuous monitoring, prolonged drug treatment, and periodic imaging and laboratory tests. Neonatal herpes has high fatality rates, and even with adequate treatment, patients are at risk for persistent skin lesions, long-term neurological disability, and other lasting sequelae.

Due to the immaturity of the immune system, prematurely born babies have a higher risk of developing complications from bacterial and viral infections. The risk of transmission of HSV from mother to neonates is greater if the maternal infection is primary since there is insufficient time for transplacental passage of immunoglobulins. In mothers with prolonged infection, it is likely that antibody transfer to the fetus will occur, acting as immunoprophylaxis. Additionally, the risk of neonatal herpes is significantly higher in primary maternal infections near term, as there is no time for an effective immune response against the virus.

Congenital herpes simplex is typically diagnosed in newborns after 10 days of age, and the clinical picture comprises the following forms: skin, eye, and mouth (SEM); central nervous system (CNS) impairment; and disseminated disease. Mucocutaneous lesions, usually found as vesicles in the mouth or on the skin, are the most common feature, accounting for approximately 45% of cases. Neonates with neurological involvement account for about 30% of the cases and may manifest irritability, seizures, lethargy, and poor feeding.

Disseminated disease is the most severe form, accounting for approximately 25% of infections, and is related to multisystem involvement. In our case, necrotizing enterocolitis stood out as a complication that, although not usually associated with HSV infection, is known to have a multifactorial etiology and may have been precipitated by the condition. HSV manifestations can be mistaken for bacterial sepsis or metabolic disorders due to the patient's poor appearance and multiorgan symptoms.

Epidemiology of HSV in the United States — HSV-1 seroprevalence reaches 30% by adolescence and approaches 60% in older adults. HSV-2 seroprevalence before reported onset of sexual activity is low (approximately 2%); rises to 20% to 26% in adults 30 to 40 years. It is generally regarded that HSV-1 is transmitted primarily through contact with infected oral secretions and that HSV-2 is acquired primarily through contact with infected genital secretions.
