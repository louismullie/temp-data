## Question

several painful lipomas under skin, labs are normal what tests to run

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what tests to run for several painful subcutaneous lipomas when routine labs are normal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of pain in lipomas and whether this changes the diagnostic approach. Then, I should verify the key differentials that present with painful lipomas and the red flags that mandate imaging or biopsy. Next, I will review the optimal imaging sequence and when to escalate to MRI. After that, I need to check which syndromic contexts warrant targeted labs or genetic testing despite normal routine labs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and explicitly state when no further testing is needed if classic benign features are present.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of pain. Most lipomas are painless, so the presence of pain shifts the differential toward angiolipoma, which is a lipoma variant with vascular components that often causes tenderness, and toward Dercum's disease (adiposis dolorosa), a rare entity characterized by multiple painful lipomas and sometimes associated with obesity and chronic pain syndromes; I should keep both in mind as I proceed [^111cfS5S] [^114Kt6iH].

> Wait, let me verify the key differentials and red flags that would change management. Painful subcutaneous masses that are soft, mobile, and subcutaneous are most consistent with angiolipomas or Dercum's disease, but I must exclude atypical lipomas, liposarcoma, and other soft-tissue tumors when features are atypical or worrisome; risk factors for malignancy include size greater than 10 cm, rapid growth, fixation, location on the thigh, and invasion into deeper structures, which should prompt cross-sectional imaging and consideration of biopsy rather than reassurance alone [^116e5Ety] [^113BFrdV].

> I will now examine the imaging strategy. Ultrasound is the first-line modality for small, superficial masses because it can characterize lipomas with high specificity and distinguish them from cysts, vascular malformations, and solid tumors; if ultrasound is inconclusive or features are atypical, MRI is the next step to define extent, vascularity, and relationship to neurovascular structures, and to assess for liposarcoma when suspected; I should confirm that ultrasound performance for superficial lipomas is indeed high, and yes, specificity around 97% has been reported in musculoskeletal literature [^113j7Vjp] [^115yFbPr] [^113BFrdV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about labs. Routine CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers are often normal in benign lipomas and angiolipomas, so a normal panel does not exclude disease but also does not add diagnostic value in classic presentations; I should avoid ordering broad, unfocused lab panels unless the history or exam suggests a systemic process or syndrome [^116iHrnU].

> Next, I should review when targeted labs or genetic testing are warranted despite normal routine studies. If there is a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia or other hereditary tumor syndromes, I should consider MEN1 testing because subcutaneous lipomas occur in more than 30% of MEN1 patients; if there are features of Cowden syndrome, PTEN testing is indicated; if there is asymmetric overgrowth with lipomas, I should consider hemihyperplasia–multiple lipomatosis and discuss tumor surveillance; if there are neuromuscular symptoms or a maternal lineage pattern, I should consider mitochondrial disorders such as MERRF, which have been linked to multiple symmetric lipomatosis in some cases; and if there is marked hypertriglyceridemia or a history of pancreatitis, I should evaluate for familial chylomicronemia syndrome and related lipodystrophies, recognizing that routine labs may miss these unless specifically tested [^111MoRFK] [^117LpMAA] [^115kJgiR] [^1121ZCAZ] [^1118zhqU] [^1138CxzP] [^116sgAqQ].

> Let me think about the practical, stepwise algorithm I would apply at the bedside. First, confirm the diagnosis clinically: soft, mobile, subcutaneous nodules with a doughy feel favor lipoma; if classic and painless, no further testing may be needed. Second, if painful or atypical, obtain ultrasound to characterize and document; if ultrasound is diagnostic for angiolipoma or simple lipoma, no further testing is required. Third, if ultrasound is inconclusive or features are worrisome, obtain MRI to exclude malignancy and define surgical planes. Fourth, if MRI suggests malignancy or the mass is large, rapidly growing, or fixed, proceed to core needle biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Fifth, reserve targeted labs or genetics for syndromic clues or family history as outlined above, rather than ordering them reflexively [^116e5Ety] [^113j7Vjp] [^113BFrdV].

> But wait, what if the patient has multiple symmetric lipomas around the neck and upper trunk with a history of alcohol use? I should consider multiple symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung's disease), which is often associated with chronic alcohol use and may coexist with neuropathy; in such cases, counseling on alcohol cessation and surgical options for debulking are reasonable, and I should remember that mitochondrial etiologies have been described in a subset, so I should tailor testing to the phenotype and family history rather than ordering broad panels indiscriminately [^113vYryL] [^1118zhqU].

> I should double-check that I am not missing a lipodystrophy syndrome. Lipodystrophies typically present with loss of subcutaneous fat and metabolic derangements rather than multiple painful lipomas, so they are not high on the list here; however, if there is marked hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, or abnormal fat distribution, then a lipodystrophy workup with metabolic profiling and, when indicated, genetic testing would be appropriate, recognizing that routine labs alone can be misleading in partial forms [^116kJaeU] [^1157Ky5Q].

> In summary, I need to ensure the approach remains focused: confirm the clinical diagnosis, use ultrasound to characterize painful or atypical lesions, escalate to MRI when needed, and reserve targeted labs or genetics for syndromic features or family history. A normal routine lab panel does not exclude benign disease and should not trigger unnecessary testing in classic presentations, which helps avoid overdiagnosis while catching the rare but important exceptions that truly change management [^116e5Ety] [^113j7Vjp] [^113BFrdV].

For multiple painful subcutaneous lipomas with normal labs, **no additional labs are needed** unless there are atypical features or systemic symptoms. Painful lipomas are most often **angiolipomas** or Dercum's disease (adiposis dolorosa), both benign and not detected by routine labs [^111cfS5S]. If diagnosis is uncertain or features are atypical, obtain **ultrasound** to confirm lipomatous lesions and exclude other soft-tissue masses; reserve MRI for large, deep, or equivocal cases [^113j7Vjp] [^113BFrdV]. Consider biopsy only if imaging is inconclusive or malignancy is suspected. No routine genetic testing is indicated unless there is a family history suggestive of hereditary syndromes (e.g. MEN1, FML) [^1158kgRs] [^111ahjvf].

---

## Clinical significance of painful lipomas

Painful lipomas are uncommon and often indicate **angiolipomas** (lipomas with vascular components) or Dercum's disease (adiposis dolorosa) [^111cfS5S]. Angiolipomas typically present as multiple, small, tender subcutaneous nodules, often on the trunk or extremities, and are benign. Dercum's disease is characterized by multiple painful lipomas, often associated with obesity, fatigue, and cognitive disturbances. Routine laboratory tests are usually normal in both conditions, and the diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by imaging when necessary [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

Perform a thorough history and physical examination to characterize the lesions (size, number, distribution, tenderness, mobility) and screen for systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue, neurological symptoms) [^113BFrdV]. Also assess for a family history of multiple lipomas or genetic syndromes (e.g. MEN1, familial multiple lipomatosis) [^1158kgRs] [^111ahjvf].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Ultrasound**: First-line imaging to confirm lipomatous lesions, differentiate from other soft-tissue masses (e.g. cysts, lymph nodes, sarcomas), and assess vascularity. Ultrasound has high specificity (96.9%) for superficial lipomas [^113j7Vjp] [^115yFbPr].

- **MRI**: Reserved for large, deep, or equivocal lesions, or when malignancy is suspected. MRI provides detailed soft-tissue characterization and helps differentiate benign lipomas from liposarcomas [^113BFrdV].

---

### Laboratory tests

Routine laboratory tests (CBC, ESR, CRP, lipid profile, thyroid function) are generally not indicated unless there are atypical features or systemic symptoms. If clinical suspicion arises for specific syndromes (e.g. MEN1, familial multiple lipomatosis), targeted genetic testing may be considered [^1158kgRs] [^111ahjvf].

---

### Biopsy

Biopsy is reserved for cases where imaging is inconclusive, lesions are rapidly growing, or malignancy is suspected. Histopathological examination can confirm the diagnosis and exclude malignancy [^113BFrdV].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for multiple painful subcutaneous nodules includes:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Angiolipoma | - Multiple <br/> - Small <br/> - Tender <br/> - Subcutaneous nodules | - Clinical exam <br/> - Ultrasound <br/> - Biopsy if uncertain |
| Dercum's disease | - Multiple painful lipomas <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Cognitive disturbances | - Clinical exam <br/> - Ultrasound <br/> - Biopsy if uncertain |
| Liposarcoma | - Large <br/> - Deep <br/> - Firm <br/> - Rapidly growing masses | - MRI <br/> - Biopsy |
| Neurofibromatosis | - Multiple subcutaneous nodules <br/> - Café-au-lait spots <br/> - Family history | - Clinical exam <br/> - Genetic testing |
| Multiple symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung's disease) | - Multiple symmetric lipomas <br/> - Neck <br/> - Shoulders <br/> - Upper trunk <br/> - Alcohol use disorder | - Clinical exam <br/> - MRI <br/> - Biopsy if uncertain |

---

## Management and follow-up

Management of painful lipomas is primarily conservative, with surgical excision reserved for symptomatic relief or cosmetic reasons. Recurrence is common, especially in Dercum's disease, so **patient counseling is essential**. Regular follow-up is recommended to monitor for changes in size, number, or symptoms.

---

## Conclusion

For multiple painful subcutaneous lipomas with normal laboratory results, **no additional laboratory tests are typically required**. Clinical evaluation and imaging (ultrasound or MRI) are the mainstays of diagnosis, with biopsy reserved for uncertain or atypical cases. Management is conservative, with surgical excision for symptomatic or cosmetic reasons.

### Presentation of multiple painful subcutaneous nodules: dercum's disease, a rare variant of lipoma [^111cfS5S]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her 50s presented to her general practitioner (GP) with an 8-month history of multiple painful subcutaneous nodules of various sizes in her trunk and limbs. Her previous GP made the clinical diagnosis of lipoma when they presented as non-painful nodules 2 years ago. Initial ultrasound demonstrated multiple lipomata with the largest size in the left upper thighs displaying features of subtle internal vascularity, entirely contained within the subcutaneous layer. MRI scan of thigh lesions showed multiple angiolipomas consistent with the entity of Dercum's disease. Subsequent biopsy histology confirmed the image diagnosis of angiolipoma. She was referred to a musculoskeletal oncological surgeon for evaluation and reassurance regarding optimising medical management of her associated obesity. Her angiolipoma and obesity are well managed by her GP. This case highlights the diagnostic workup of a rare variant of lipoma, Dercum's disease. The differential diagnosis of multiple painful lipomas was reviewed and discussed, consequently leading to the discussion of managing the associated obesity in this case.

9 Lipomas must be clinically differentiated from other tumors. The primary differential diagnosis in a subcutaneous mass is a sebaceous cyst or abscess. Lipomas are soft, flesh-colored nodules that are easily moveable under the overlying skin. Sebaceous cysts are generally identifiable by a central punctum, and abscesses can be identified by the presence of warmth, redness, and pain. Ultrasonography is increasingly used to aid in the diagnosis of lipomas. High-frequency ultrasonography can provide high-resolution images of subcutaneous tumors and surrounding structures. 10 The differential diagnosis of lipomas also includes liposarcomas; risk factors for malignancy are size greater than 10 cm, older age, rapid lesion growth, location on the thigh, and invasion into deeper tissue, such as nerve or bone, leading to a firm or fixed feeling on examination.

Lesions concerning for malignancy should be imaged with computed tomography or contrast magnetic resonance imaging.
11. Patients commonly present with cosmetic concerns or symptoms related to compression of surrounding tissue. A single incision or punch excision will generally allow manual expression of the lipoma without difficulty when standard excision is not required.
12. 19 Diagnosis is based on the appearance of firm, raised, papules or nodules, ranging from tan to reddish brown. They tend to be darker at the center and fade to normal skin color at the margin. Dermatofibromas exhibit dimpling or retraction of the lesion beneath the skin with lateral compression. 20 No treatment is required unless there is a change in size or color, or bleeding or irritation from trauma. A 2012 study found that 73% of patients who underwent laser ablation reported satisfaction with the results.
21.

22 Diagnosis of epidermal inclusion cysts is based on appearance and palpation of a discrete, freely movable cyst or nodule. Careful inspection often reveals a central punctum. Treatment is unnecessary unless desired by the patient, and can be accomplished via simple excision with removal of the cyst and cyst wall. Inflamed or ruptured cysts often resolve spontaneously without therapy, although they tend to recur. Intralesional steroid injections can hasten resolution of inflamed cysts and should be followed by interval excision. 23.

### Increased prevalence of subcutaneous lipomas in patients with Wilson disease [^115m5waB]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Goals

To determine the prevalence and characteristics of lipomas in patients with Wilson disease.

Background

Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in copper accumulation in the liver and the central nervous tissue. Subcutaneous lipomas were often noted by the authors during clinical examinations of patients with Wilson disease. This is the first study to analyze the prevalence and progression of lipoma development in patients with Wilson disease.

Study

Eighty consecutive patients attending a tertiary care center were examined for the presence of subcutaneous lipomas.

Results

Subcutaneous lipomas could be detected during the examination of 21 (26%) of the 80 patients with Wilson disease. Multiple subcutaneous lipomas were present in 16 (76%) of the 21 affected patients. Lipomas were mainly found on the extremities and the trunk. Neither initial presentation nor decoppering treatment influenced the presence or course of lipomas in these patients.

Conclusions

Subcutaneous lipoma formation is more common in patients with Wilson disease than in the general population. We suggest that the presence of lipomas contributes to the differential diagnosis of Wilson disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^116iHrnU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 9 — ancillary tests for adult neck mass: Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is at increased risk for malignancy and/or does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging, with recommendation based on nonconsecutive studies, observational studies, case series, and panel consensus with preponderance of benefit over harm. The decision to obtain any of these tests should be based on the clinician's clinical suspicion for a particular disease, it is not recommended that these tests be obtained in patients for whom there is no clinical suspicion, and for patients who are at increased risk, ancillary testing should be performed simultaneously with the malignancy workup to avoid delayed cancer diagnosis. Quality improvement opportunity is to identify laboratory or other test that can aid in neck mass diagnosis; aggregate evidence quality is Grade C; level of confidence is Medium; benefits include diagnosing the neck mass and avoiding invasive procedures/anesthesia; risks include direct costs of ancillary tests, false-positive tests, incidental findings, and risk of failure to diagnose concurrent malignancy based on these test results; benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm; and policy level is Recommendation.

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: an expert clinical review from the National Lipid Association [^1136LGLU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) — key signs and physical examination findings include lipemic plasma; lipemia retinalis with a milky or creamy appearance of retinal vessels that should be assessed; and eruptive xanthomas consisting of raised yellow papules on an erythematous base, typically on the back, buttocks, elbows, or neck, which may mimic acne or molluscum contagiosum and typically regress as serum triglyceride levels decrease. Additional features include hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent abdominal pain, and acute or recurrent pancreatitis. Patients suspected of FCS should be evaluated for eruptive xanthomas, lipemia retinalis, hepatosplenomegaly, and body fat distribution to rule out lipodystrophy, and a careful physical examination can reveal at least 1 manifestation in many patients with FCS.

Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline — initial diagnostic testing and evaluation for suspected Cushing's syndrome: After excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use, we recommend testing for Cushing's syndrome in patients with multiple and progressive features compatible with the syndrome and in patients with adrenal incidentaloma. We recommend initial use of one test with high diagnostic accuracy (urine cortisol, late night salivary cortisol, 1 mg overnight or 2 mg 48-h dexamethasone suppression test), and we recommend that patients with an abnormal result see an endocrinologist and undergo a second test, either one of the above or, in some cases, a serum midnight cortisol or dexamethasone-CRH test. Patients with concordant abnormal results should undergo testing for the cause of Cushing's syndrome, patients with concordant normal results should not undergo further evaluation, and we recommend additional testing for patients with discordant results, normal responses suspected of cyclic hypercortisolism, or initially normal responses who accumulate additional features over time.

### Brazilian expert consensus on the diagnosis, classification, screening for complications and treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy [^111iykRe]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing for FPLD is useful in the following situations:
Individuals who met the suspected criteria for FPLD (Table 1).
Individuals who do not meet the suspected or diagnostic criteria (Tables 1 and 2) but have family members who have been clinically or genetically diagnosed with FPLD (cascade screening).

In the first case, genetic evaluation serves as a diagnostic test, whereas in the second case, it functions as a predictive test. Since FPLDs exhibit significant phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, this investigation is useful for screening family members and helps to understand the natural history of the disease, treatment planning, and genetic counselling.

How to interpret NGS results?

Negative genetic test with clinical criteria for diagnosing FPLD: In this scenario, the patient may carry a variant of unknown significance that should be considered in the diagnosis of FPLD1 or FPLD type X (FPLD-X). The index patient should be monitored for lipodystrophy-related disorders, and family members should be screened for clinical criteria to determine the disease inheritance pattern.

Positive genetic test with clinical criteria for diagnosing FPLD: The diagnosis of FPLD is confirmed. If genetic tests are available, the impact of the identified variant and its presence in other family members should be investigated further.

Positive genetic test without clinical criteria for diagnosing FPLD: Clinical evaluation and follow-up is recommended to monitor FPLD-related metabolic conditions and assess the pathogenicity of the variant, inheritance pattern, and genotype–phenotype relationship. Notably, changes in body composition were described before puberty, particularly in girls with FPLD2. In light of this, screening for FPLD should be considered at the age of ten in girls from families with pathogenic variants of LMNA to anticipate metabolic complications.

What about genetic counselling?

Genetic counselling is essential for patients with FPLD, helping them to understand how heredity contributes to the onset of the disease and the likelihood of its occurrence in their offspring and other family members. In addition, it facilitates decision-making processes related to family planning and the available treatments.

### The diagnosis and management of lipodystrophy syndromes: a multi-society practice guideline [^116kJaeU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Establishing the presence of lipodystrophy

Lipodystrophy should be suspected in patients with regional or generalized lack of adipose tissue outside of the normal range by physical examination, which can be supported by anthropometry, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging. Recognizing the loss of sc fat is particularly challenging in partial lipodystrophy and especially in men, in whom low body fat overlaps with normal variation and metabolic manifestations of lipodystrophy are less severe. In both genetic and acquired lipodystrophies, the loss of fat may be gradual, delaying diagnosis.

Physical, historical, and comorbid features that increase the suspicion of lipodystrophy are shown in Table 3.

Table 3.
Clinical Features That Increase the Suspicion of Lipodystrophy

Because serum leptin assays are not standardized and leptin concentrations in patients with lipodystrophy (especially partial forms) overlap the general population, leptin levels do not help in diagnosis but may help with the choice of therapies.

Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis should include conditions presenting with severe weight loss (malnutrition, anorexia nervosa, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, adrenocortical insufficiency, cancer cachexia, HIV-associated wasting, chronic infections). Especially difficult is differentiating lipodystrophy from uncontrolled diabetes because both may have extreme hypertriglyceridemia. However, restoring glycemic control in patients with nonlipodystrophic diabetes leads to a regain of body fat. Generalized lipodystrophies can be confused with mutations of the insulin receptor or acromegaly/gigantism, and FPLD with Cushing's syndrome, truncal obesity, and multiple symmetric lipomatosis.

### Familial occurrence of adiposis dolorosa [^113s5pZa]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Adiposis dolorosa is a rare condition characterized by multiple painful lipomas. We describe two typically affected siblings who were found to have at least 5 affected first-degree relatives in two generations. Manifestations were remarkably variable, ranging from complete disability to solitary asymptomatic tumors. Review of histopathologic findings did not reveal any features that might distinguish the tumors from common sporadic lipomas. Mutational analysis excluded the 8344 A to G mitochondrial mutation seen in other patients with multiple lipomas. Adiposis dolorosa may be an extreme manifestation of the more common condition of familial multiple lipomas. Further work is needed to define the genetic basis of these conditions.

Cowden syndrome, also known as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (OMIM 158350), is caused by PTEN mutations and is characterized by benign skin findings with increased lifetime risks for breast (30–85%; often early-onset), follicular thyroid (10–38%), renal (34%), endometrial (5–28%), and colorectal cancers (9%), and possibly melanoma (6%). Clinical diagnostic criteria involve combinations of major and minor criteria, and we recommend referral for anyone meeting any three criteria from the major or minor diagnostic criteria; referral should be considered for any individual with a personal history of or first-degree relative with Lhermitte–Duclos disease diagnosed after age 18. Table 4 lists major criteria including gastrointestinal hamartomas (including ganglioneuromas but excluding hyperplastic polyps; ≥ 3), macrocephaly (≥ 97th percentile: 58 cm for adult women, 60 cm for adult men), and multiple mucocutaneous lesions such as multiple trichilemmomas (≥ 3, at least 1 proven by biopsy), acral keratoses (≥ 3 palmoplantar keratotic pits and/or acral hyperkeratotic papules), mucocutaneous neuromas (≥ 3), or oral papillomas, multiple (≥ 3) OR biopsy proven OR dermatologist diagnosed; representative minor criteria include esophageal glycogenic acanthosis (≥ 3), lipomas (≥ 3), and intellectual disability (i.e., intelligence quotient ≤ 75).

Pediatric Rheumatology 2023, 21(Suppl 2): P290

Introduction: Lipoma arborescens (LA) is a rare cause of chronic monoarticular arthritis. It should be considered during investigation of oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Objectives: To report the case of a teenage boy presenting with chronic monoarthritis of the knee undergoing investigation for JIA and tuberculous monoarthritis. The diagnosis of LA was based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological study.

Methods: Case report and narrative literature review.

Results: A 12-year-old boy presented with a 2-year history of pain and progressive swelling of the left knee. No morning stiffness, nor impact in daily activities. No history of trauma or constitutional symptoms. He underwent multiple arthrocentesis for pain relief previous to pediatric rheumatologist referral.

On clinical examination, patient presented warm left knee, painless diffuse effusion and asymmetric length of legs. Laboratory tests showed no elevated inflammatory parameters, and negative antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and HLA-B27. Purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was 7 mm and normal chest x-ray. MRI showed marked effusion, synovial proliferation, post synovial fatty metaplasia, absence of bone erosions, subcortical bone edema in periphery of femoral condyles.

There was no response to treatment prescribed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. During follow up, needle aspiration was performed yielding 60 mL of aseptic citrine-colored fluid tested negative for Gene xpert and bacilloscopy. Histological assessment was performed after a synovial biopsy and diagnosis was consistent with LA.

Conclusion: Diagnostic of JIA requires ruling out other causes, including infections. Thorough investigation is mandatory in monoarthritis, including laboratory tests, imaging studies, synovial fluid analysis and biopsy in selected cases.

We describe the case aiming to raise suspicion of LA during pediatric rheumatology consultation. LA is a rare benign tumor characterized by villonodular proliferation of the synovium. There is fewer than 100 cases reported. It usually affects knee joint, in the suprapatellar pouch. Presents as slow progressive swelling, pain and effusion. Laboratory tests are normal. MRI is the imaging method of choice. Treatment is mostly by open or arthroscopic synovectomy with low risk of recurrence.

### The multifaceted challenges of Proteus syndrome [^1124tTBt]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Proteus syndrome is a rare and sporadic disorder that causes postnatal overgrowth of multiple tissues in a mosaic pattern. The overgrowth can involve skin, subcutaneous tissue, connective tissue (including bone), the central nervous system, and viscera. Complications of Proteus syndrome include, among others, progressive skeletal deformities, invasive lipomas, benign and malignant tumors, and deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism. Care of patients with Proteus syndrome presents significant challenges to both physicians and parents because of the various medical as well as psychosocial consequences of the disease. Herein, the case of a 5-year-old patient who manifested a number of these complications is presented. Current knowledge about the diagnosis, natural history, etiology, and management of the disorder is reviewed.

### The diagnosis and management of lipodystrophy syndromes: a multi-society practice guideline [^114XgK2f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Lipodystrophy

Diagnosis of lipodystrophy is based on history, physical examination, body composition, and metabolic status. (Class I, Level B)
There are no defined serum leptin levels that establish or rule out the diagnosis of lipodystrophy. (Class IIa, Level C)
Confirmatory genetic testing is helpful in suspected familial lipodystrophies. (Class I, Level A)
Genetic testing should be considered in at-risk family members. (Class IIa, Level C)
Serum complement levels and autoantibodies may support diagnosis of acquired lipodystrophy syndromes. (Class IIa, Level B)

Firm diagnostic criteria for lipodystrophy have not been established. Figure 2 shows a suggested diagnostic approach.

Figure 2.
Diagnostic approach to lipodystrophy syndromes. Lipodystrophy should be suspected in patients with regional or generalized lack of adipose tissue. History should assess age of onset of fat loss and comorbidities. Physical examination should determine distribution of sc fat loss and presence of prominent muscles, phlebomegaly, acanthosis nigricans, hepatomegaly, xanthomas, and acromegaloid or progeroid appearance. All patients should undergo a metabolic workup for insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease. Conventional anthropometry including skinfold thickness measurements, ± dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (if available) should be performed to confirm the pattern of fat loss. Common genetic lipodystrophies include CGL, FPLD, and progeroid lipodystrophies. They require genotyping to confirm the diagnosis, followed by genetic counseling and screening of family members. Patients with progeroid lipodystrophies have progeroid features like bird-like facies, high-pitched voice, skin atrophy and pigmentation, alopecia, and nail dysplasia. Patients with FPLD have fat loss of the extremities typically occurring around puberty and can have a positive family history. Patients with CGL have near-complete lack of fat starting at birth or infancy. Acquired lipodystrophies have fat loss typically in late childhood. Patients with AGL have generalized loss of sc fat and often have associated autoimmune diseases. Patients with APL have cranio-caudal fat loss affecting the face, neck, shoulders, arms, and upper trunk, and most patients have low serum C3 levels.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^116YrrFA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to provide guidelines for evaluation, treatment, and genetic testing for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).

Participants

The group, which comprised 10 experts, including physicians, surgeons, and geneticists from international centers, received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Process

Guidelines were developed by reviews of peer-reviewed publications; a draft was prepared, reviewed, and rigorously revised at several stages; and agreed-upon revisions were incorporated.

Conclusions

MEN1 is an autosomal dominant disorder that is due to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene MEN1, which encodes a 610-amino acid protein, menin. Thus, the finding of MEN1 in a patient has important implications for family members because first-degree relatives have a 50% risk of developing the disease and can often be identified by MEN1 mutational analysis. MEN1 is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic islet, and anterior pituitary tumors. Some patients may also develop carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, meningiomas, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, and lipomas. Patients with MEN1 have a decreased life expectancy, and the outcomes of current treatments, which are generally similar to those for the respective tumors occurring in non-MEN1 patients, are not as successful because of multiple tumors, which may be larger, more aggressive, and resistant to treatment, and the concurrence of metastases. The prognosis for MEN1 patients might be improved by presymptomatic tumor detection and undertaking treatment specific for MEN1 tumors. Thus, it is recommended that MEN1 patients and their families should be cared for by multidisciplinary teams comprising relevant specialists with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with endocrine tumors.

### Multiple benign symmetric lipomatosis – a differential diagnosis of obesity. is there a rationale for fibrate treatment? [^113vYryL]. Obesity Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple benign symmetric lipomatosis (MSL) is characterized by a rapid progression of multiple, symmetric nonencapsulated fat masses in the face, neck, and extremities. The lipomas are thought to be the result of defective brown adipose tissue (BAT). In up to 90% MSL is associated with chronic alcohol abuse. Prognosis depends on the concomitant presence of a neuropathy with a mortality of 25.8%. Therapeutic options are limited to alcohol abstinence and surgical interventions. We report here about a 53-year-old MSL patient who increased his body weight by 37 kg over 10 years. Multiple lipectomies were performed, but disease progressed. We treated him with fenofibrates (200 mg/day). Disease progression discontinued and circumferences of abdominal adipose tissue reduced. Fibrates, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) agonists, are pleiotropic hypolipidemic drugs, and might have worked by suppression of protein expressions involved in the architecture of BAT keeping it in a quiescent state.

### A pictorial essay of thoracic wall diseases: multiple pathologies in the same anatomical site [^113XQEGG]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Chest wall pathologies encompass a wide spectrum of conditions, with some clinical implications that often require correct nosological framing. Chest X-ray is essential to detect and localize lesions; CT and MRI play a pivotal role in the diagnosis, since they better define their origin and extension. Some thoracic pathologies may reproduce typical imaging findings (such as lipomas or elastofibroma dorsi), and the diagnosis may be easily achieved. On the other hand, many lesions show indeterminate imaging features, so the diagnosis requires further investigation, such as biopsy.

### Benign skin lesions: lipomas, epidermal inclusion cysts, muscle and nerve biopsies [^113okHVD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Lipomas are benign skin tumors composed of mature fat cells and are the most common subcutaneous tumors. Although many of these can be removed in the surgical clinic or minor operating room, some require more advanced preoperative planning and more complicated resection. The diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of benign tumors, and other commonly associated tumors that may require a more substantial workup and operative intervention, are discussed. Muscle and nerve biopsies are used for the diagnosis of a variety of medical problems. Although there are other genetic and biochemical markers now available that can diagnose diseases previously proven by biopsy, these surgical techniques still have appropriate uses. Although the procedures are straightforward, there are important technical issues to assist in getting the best specimen to avoid confounding disease diagnosis.

RESULTS

Table 1 summarizes the demographics of the patient population. A total of 35 patients were enrolled, 27 female, and 8 male, ranging in age from 20 to 67 years old (mean 45.2 years). The mean BMI was 24.7, with a range of 18.0–29.7.

Table 1
Demographic Characteristics

One patient was withdrawn after completing the abdominal treatment, when it was found impossible to achieve adequate tissue draw into the applicator for the flank treatments. All other patients completed all prescribed treatments and all scheduled blood tests.

As expected 1, erythema, numbness, and edema were experienced by the majority of patients immediately following the procedures. Less common were tingling and bruising (Table 2). In most cases these signs and symptoms were considered by the investigator to be minor or moderate in severity, and in all cases they resolved without treatment. At the Week 12 examination, all treatment sites appeared normal and no subjects reported any associated symptoms. Immediately following the procedures, the mean pain score was 4 (SD ± 3) on a scale of 1–10. There were no reports of late‐onset pain.

Clinical Assessments — All Treatment Sites Combined

Table 3 displays the mean serum lipid tests. Values were all well within the reference range, and varied little from baseline to subsequent time points. Repeated measures ANCOVA (uncorrected for multiple testing) showed no statistically significant changes from baseline in total, HDL, LDL, or VLDL cholesterol. The mean values for total cholesterol at baseline and 1, 4, and 12 weeks post‐treatment are shown in Figure 1 and mean values for triglycerides are shown in Figure 2. The mean triglyceride value at Week 12, 83.4 mg/dl, was slightly but statistically significantly different from the baseline value of 77.0 mg/dl (P = 0.04), though still well below the upper limit of the reference range (150 mg/dl).

Case Report

A 57-year-old woman presented with a history of multiple painful subcutaneous masses especially around her neck but also bilaterally on her upper arms, back, abdomen, and upper legs. The patient was referred from the neurology department for management of these painful masses, which were obstructing her ability to breath and sleep, forcing her to require home oxygen and a wheelchair for ambulation. She could not lie on her back because of the prominence of the lipomatosis behind her neck and upper back. Our patient reported a history of myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) syndrome with symptoms including cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, muscle weakness, and myoclonus. She reported multiple family members having MERRF syndrome including her mother, maternal grandmother, maternal great grandmother, sisters, brothers, her sons, and nephews with variable presentations and lipomas.

Physical examination found the patient seated in a wheelchair on supplemental oxygen. Multiple symmetric large, variably sized tender masses were easily apparent and palpable around her neck, upper back, upper lateral arms, mid and lower back, lower abdomen, and upper thighs (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3).

Lipodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of conditions in which individuals never develop or progressively lose adipose tissue in parts or all of their bodies (Table 1). In this commentary, we will make the case that 1) defining lipodystrophy is a work in progress; 2) not all forms of lipodystrophy are very rare; 3) lipodystrophy and obesity can occur simultaneously and their metabolic consequences are similar and possibly synergistic; 4) leptin treatment can have impressive therapeutic effects; and 5) these conditions provide useful paradigms to explore the role of the adipose tissue on metabolic homeostasis and to investigate pathways leading from distinct genetic mutations to very different clinical phenotypes.

Lipedema — genetic adipose tissue disorder — occurs almost exclusively in women with clinical redistribution of fatty tissue to the extremities; patients can develop extremity enlargement without overweight or obesity, and obesity can be an aggravating factor with prevalence increasing with body weight. It presents as symmetrical enlargement of the legs due to increased subcutaneous fat deposits that may cause pain and bruising and may ultimately cause lymphedema. The diagnosis is mainly clinical with a differential overlapping lymphedema, and some suggest most cases are misdiagnosed as lymphedema or obesity; diagnostic testing is largely to rule out competing diagnoses and may include blood tests, ultrasound, CT, or MRI of the extremity skin, along with structural and functional lymphatic evaluation via stress test and indirect lymphography, fluorescence microlymphography, functional lymphatic scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance lymphangiography; dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) or bio-impedance analysis might better evaluate body composition, and an algorithmic approach has been proposed for patients with painful, disproportionate limb enlargement. Treatment includes nutrition and physical activity, though weight reduction measures often result in minimal benefits on abnormal body fat distribution and may contribute to psychological and obesity-related harms; other options include manual lymphatic drainage and compression stretch bandages/hosiery, and surgical treatment may include lipedema reduction procedures, lymph-sparing liposuction, or debulking (dermato-fibro-lipectomy).

### Brazilian expert consensus on the diagnosis, classification, screening for complications and treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy [^114Du4sH]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future perspectives

Our proposed diagnostic criteria for FPLD were primarily based on expert consensus and observational data, which may limit their external validity. Nevertheless, the lack of standardized diagnostic tools and dependence on clinical expertise can lead to underdiagnosis or misclassification of FPLD, highlighting the importance of this consensus in supporting clinical decision-making.

An additional consideration is that certain therapeutic recommendations, particularly those pertaining to metreleptin and volanesorsen, are based on small randomized trials or uncontrolled studies. This underscores the need for more robust and generalizable evidence.

Expanding the BRAZLIPO registry presents a significant opportunity to enhance the characterization of the natural history of FPLD, validate the diagnostic criteria, and refine long-term follow-up strategies. Further research and methodological advancements are essential to thoroughly define genotype–phenotype correlations and to evaluate the comprehensive impact of preventive strategies. This would facilitate more meaningful cost-effectiveness analyses, and support the formulation of evidence-based policies and clinical recommendations.

Future research endeavors should prioritize the integration of centers and controlled clinical trials within the BRAZLIPO registry. This approach aims to assess the safety and efficacy of novel therapies, refine diagnostic methodologies, and improve early identification of affected individuals.

On physical examination, his body mass index was 39.6 kg/m² (weight − 113 kg, height − 1.69 m) otherwise vital signs were normal. There was diffuse bilateral symmetrical, non-tender, soft swelling of his trunk, shoulder, upper arms and thighs with bilateral breast enlargements. [Figure 1 (A)]. Also, he had thick and redundant skin folds with huge lipomas in his back torso sparing the neck [Fig. 1 (B)], and disproportional enlargement of both arms and thighs as compared to a normal appearing forearm and shine [Fig. 2 (A) & (B)]. On neurologic exam, straight leg raise test was difficult to perform because of the central mass. He had mild lumbar vertebrae tenderness. The motor and sensory exams were normal. No joint swelling, tenderness, or crepitation detected. The rest of his examination was non-revealing. Table 1 summarized the baseline laboratory findings where most of the results were in the normal range except hyperuricemia (10.6 mg/dl). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical [Fig. 3 (A)] and lumbar [Fig. 3 (B)] vertebrae showed diffuse subcutaneous fat deposits in the posterior neck and lower back with multilevel degenerative disc prolapse and osteophytic changes. Biopsy from the mass revealed non-capsulated sheets of mature adipocytes with modest fibrous infiltration which is consistent with the pathologic features of benign lipomatosis.

Results

Clinical suspicion of FPLD

Clinical suspicion is essential for the timely diagnosis of FPLD. The condition should be suspected in individuals presenting with a reduction or absence of subcutaneous adipose tissue (lipoatrophy) in the limbs (essential criterion), accompanied by at least one of the following conditions commonly associated with FPLD and insulin resistance: acanthosis nigricans, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dL), and/or low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL < 50 mg/dL in women or < 40 mg/dL in men), MASLD, diabetes mellitus, or impaired fasting glucose, or glucose intolerance (particularly if occurring before the age of 40 years), and early coronary atherosclerotic disease (CAD) (diagnosed before the age of 45 years).

If these clinical manifestations occur after puberty, particularly before adulthood, FPLD should be suspected. The criteria for suspecting FPLD are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Criteria for suspecting familial partial lipodystrophy

Diagnosis of FPLD

Medical history

Gathering a detailed medical history is essential for diagnosing FPLD. It is important to determine the age at which lipodystrophy and any associated diseases occur. Fat redistribution typically becomes apparent after puberty or in early adulthood, with a more pronounced clinical presentation in women, who are often the index cases. Additionally, a history of pre-existing autoimmune diseases or triggering events leading to the loss of fat tissue should be assessed, particularly for differential diagnosis in cases of acquired PL. Given the autosomal dominant inheritance of FPLD, evaluating first-degree relatives for similar appearance and/or common conditions (Table 1) increases the likelihood of diagnosis. Establishing a family pedigree is crucial in suspected cases.

### The diagnosis and management of lipodystrophy syndromes: a multi-society practice guideline [^1162XrhA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The lipodystrophy syndromes are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders that have in common selective deficiency of adipose tissue in the absence of nutritional deprivation or catabolic state (Figure 1). Lipodystrophies are categorized based on etiology (genetic or acquired) and distribution of lost adipose tissue, affecting the entire body (generalized) or only regions (partial). This yields four major categories: congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), and acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL) (Figure 1). Additional subtypes include progeroid disorders, autoinflammatory disorders, and others (Table 1). This practice guideline will not discuss lipodystrophy in HIV infected patients or localized lipodystrophy (eg, from injectable drugs).

### Abdominal tuberculosis in a non-immunosuppressed patient [^112dXjXt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains prevalent in developing countries and has recently re-emerged in the Western world. The spread of the disease is aided by poverty and overcrowding. However, the increased prevalence of HIV and multidrug-resistant TB has accelerated the gravity of this epidemic. The true incidence of intra-abdominal TB is unknown as patients with concurrent pulmonary TB may be asymptomatic from their abdominal disease or have a varied presentation mimicking other common and rare infectious and non-infectious abdominal diseases, including malignancies. This situation can make a proper diagnosis difficult, and may not only result in mortality but also in unnecessary surgery. We report a case of abdominal tuberculosis who was admitted with severe abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass mimicking neoplasm on imaging studies.

A 29-year-old-man originating from Ghana, presented with a two month history of abdominal pain. He had a free medical history and has lived in Athens for the last three years, without traveling abroad recently. The abdominal pain was constant and mainly peri-umbilical. He complained of constipation, anorexia and aggravation of abdominal pain by food intake. No fever, night sweats, diarrhea, or nausea were described. On clinical examination his abdomen was soft, but deep palpation was painful in the peri-umbilical area revealing a palpable mass of diameter 8cm. Additional findings included mild hepatomegaly and generalised lymphadenopathy (one cervical lymph node of diameter of 1cm, and multiple inguinal and femoral lymph nodes of maximum diameter of 2cm). Laboratory tests were non-specific and showed mild anemia (Hb 11.7g/dL), elevation of inflammatory markers (ESR 57mm, CRP 99.1mg/L, FIB 616 mg/dL) and increased CA-125 (69.1 U/mL). No parasites were found in stool examination. HIV antibodies were absent. TB skin test was positive (20mm). The chest and plain abdomen radiography were unremarkable. A computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a hypodense mass of mesentery in midline, 5×8×8.5 cm, with normal outline, multi-lobed in some areas, and with mild peripheral enhancement. No ascites or lymphadenopathy was observed. The differential diagnosis included primary neoplasms (lymphangioma, mesothelioma, lipoma/sarcoma, leiomyoma/sarcoma, GIST), metastases from gastrointestinal tract tumors or testicles, lymphoma and infection (tuberculosis, actinomycosis). The computed tomography of the chest did not reveal any lesions. Bone marrow examination had nonspecific findings. Exploratory laparotomy was performed to exclude the possibility of malignant tumor and during the operation a mesenteric mass that included jejunal loops was found, which was partially resected. It was a caseating formation and highly suspect of TB. Histopathology showed epitheloid granulomas with central caseous necrosis and multinucleated giant cells, supposedly of tubercles. Acid-fast staining was negative and no microorganism grew from culture including the mass, bone marrow, blood, and urine. The patient received quadruple anti-TB therapy (rifampicin 600mg, isoniazid 300mg, pyrazinamide 1500mg, ethambutol 750mg) and recovered.

### Diagnosis and management of soft-tissue masses [^113BFrdV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Soft-tissue masses of the extremities are common entities encountered by nearly all providers of musculoskeletal patient care. Proper management of these lesions requires a specific process of evaluation. A detailed history and physical examination must be performed. Appropriate imaging studies must be obtained based on clinical indications. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis of soft-tissue masses, with CT and ultrasonography used as secondary options. These modalities aid the clinician in developing an appropriate differential diagnosis and treatment plan. When the initial evaluation is inconclusive, biopsy must be performed. A diagnosis must be established before definitive treatment with surgical excision or, in rare cases, radiation therapy is performed. Clinicians without significant experience in treating soft-tissue masses should consider referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist for specialized care when a definitive diagnosis of a benign lesion cannot be made. Several studies have shown that multidisciplinary care in specialized referral centers optimizes outcomes and diminishes comorbid complications.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^111MoRFK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

MEN1 genetic testing — indications, counseling, and follow-up: MEN1 germline mutation testing should be offered to index patients with MEN1 and their first-degree relatives, including relatives who are either asymptomatic or who have clinical manifestations of MEN1; testing of asymptomatic relatives should be offered at the earliest opportunity because MEN1 manifestations may occur by the age of 5 yr. MEN1 germline mutation testing may be recommended in individuals with an atypical MEN1 phenotype, and all individuals offered testing should be provided with genetic counseling before testing. Testing should be undertaken by a clinical genetics laboratory accredited in mutation analysis of the MEN1 gene, and if a coding region MEN1 mutation is not identified, then testing for partial or whole-gene deletion, or haplotype analysis of the MEN1 locus, or analysis of other genes should be considered. Relatives of a patient with a known MEN1 mutation should be offered MEN1 germline mutation analysis before biochemical and radiological screening tests to avoid multiple tests and reduce financial costs, and individuals found to have a MEN1 germline mutation should be screened regularly for development of MEN1-associated tumors.

### Approach to the patient with lipodystrophy [^1157Ky5Q]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Lipodystrophy constitutes a spectrum of diseases characterized by a generalized or partial absence of adipose tissue. Underscoring the role of healthy fat in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis, fat deficiency in lipodystrophy typically leads to profound metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and ectopic fat accumulation. While rare, recent genetic studies indicate that lipodystrophy is more prevalent than has been previously thought, suggesting considerable underdiagnosis in clinical practice. In this article, we provide an overview of the etiology and management of generalized and partial lipodystrophy disorders. We bring together the latest scientific evidence and clinical guidelines and expose key gaps in knowledge. Through improved recognition of the lipodystrophy disorders, patients (and their affected family members) can be appropriately screened for cardiometabolic, noncardiometabolic, and syndromic abnormalities and undergo treatment with targeted interventions. Notably, insights gained through the study of this rare and extreme phenotype can inform our knowledge of more common disorders of adipose tissue overload, including generalized obesity.

### Two cases of hemihyperplasia-multiple lipomatosis syndrome and review of asymmetric hemihyperplasia syndromes [^117B71KV]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hemihyperplasia-multiple lipomatosis syndrome (HHML) is a condition characterized by asymmetric nonprogressive overgrowth, multiple lipomas, and superficial vascular malformations. We present two cases of HHML to enhance the diagnostic acumen of dermatologists and avoid potential misdiagnosis of this rare but probably underrecognized entity. We also provide a brief review of asymmetric overgrowth syndromes, which have overlapping yet distinct clinical manifestations.

### Obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease: a joint expert review from the Obesity Medicine Association and the National Lipid Association 2024 [^111y6yKp]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Abdominal obesity, blood lipid levels, and metabolic syndrome — adipose tissue is dynamic, with approximately 10% of adipocytes turning over annually across adulthood and BMI ranges; estimated adipocyte numbers differ by adiposity, with lean individuals typically having 25–35 billion adipocytes and patients with obesity 100–150 billion, and study estimates of 41–65 billion without obesity (variation of 60%) versus 128–237 billion with obesity (variation of 85%). Despite increased regional adiposity in certain conditions, patients with benign multiple symmetrical lipomatosis are not at increased risk for hyperglycemia or dyslipidemia, and thiazolidinediones increase the proliferation of functional adipocytes; improved adipose tissue function via this increase helps explain why thiazolidinediones improve both glycemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

### 2023 update on European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement on homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: new treatments and clinical guidance [^1116w6Qp]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical criteria

Plasma LDL-C is the critical discriminator for clinical diagnosis of HoFH. The 2014 EAS consensus statement recommended LDL-C diagnostic criteria of > 13 mmol/L (> 500 mg/dL) for untreated patients or > 8 mmol/L (> 300 mg/dL) for patients treated with conventional therapy (i.e. statin plus ezetimibe), together with evidence of cutaneous or tendon xanthomas before 10 years, or untreated elevated LDL-C levels consistent with heterozygous FH in both parents. However, LDL-C criteria are not the sole guide to diagnosis, given the genetic complexity of HoFH (see below) and variability in LDL-C levels and clinical phenotype; indeed, LDL-C levels < 13 mmol/L were reported in several cohorts of genetically confirmed HoFH. Therefore, this panel proposes that HoFH should be suspected if untreated LDL-C levels are > 10 mmol/L (> ∼400 mg/dL), requiring further evaluation, including a detailed medical and family history and/or genetic testing (Box 2). The multiplicity of lipid-lowering treatments that these patients typically receive means that historic cut-offs for treated LDL-C are probably obsolete.

Box 2
Updated criteria for the diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia

Clinical criteria

- **LDL-C criteria**: Untreated LDL-C > 10 mmol/L (> ∼400 mg/dL) is suggestive of HoFH requiring further investigation to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Additional criteria**: Cutaneous or tendon xanthomas before age of 10 years and/or untreated elevated LDL-C levels consistent with heterozygous FH in both parents* *In digenic form, one parent may have normal LDL-C levels and the other may have LDL-C levels consistent with HoFH.

Genetic criteria

- Genetic confirmation of bi-allelic pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants on different chromosomes at the LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, or LDLRAP1 genes or ≥ 2 such variants at different loci (Box 3); for abbreviations for genetic nomenclature see below. ABCG5, ABCG8: Genes encoding ATP-binding cassette subfamily G members 5 and 8 APOB: Gene encoding apolipoprotein B LDLR: Gene encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor LDLRAP1: Gene encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1 LIPA: Gene encoding lysosomal acid lipase PCSK9: Gene encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 protein (PCSK9)

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement on management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^116q7Yx4]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) familial testing benefits — clinical impact and urgency state that benefits of genetic testing include the identification and exoneration of at-risk individuals. Identification of a PV/LPV MEN1 variant in at-risk family members leads to a reduced age at diagnosis, earlier (often presymptomatic) disease detection, and earlier intervention (before metastasis), which is anticipated to reduce MEN1-related morbidity and mortality; accordingly, familial MEN1 PV/LPV testing should be promptly pursued as delay has been associated with increased disease manifestation and progression.

### Lipoma excision [^116vB1nZ]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Lipomas are adipose tumors that are often located in the subcutaneous tissues of the head, neck, shoulders, and back. Lipomas have been identified in all age groups but usually first appear between 40 and 60 years of age. These slow-growing, nearly always benign, tumors usually present as nonpainful, round, mobile masses with a characteristic soft, doughy feel. Rarely, lipomas can be associated with syndromes such as hereditary multiple lipomatosis, adiposis dolorosa, Gardner's syndrome, and Madelung's disease. There are also variants such as angiolipomas, neomorphic lipomas, spindle cell lipomas, and adenolipomas. Most lipomas are best left alone, but rapidly growing or painful lipomas can be treated with a variety of procedures ranging from steroid injections to excision of the tumor. Lipomas must be distinguished from liposarcoma, which can have a similar appearance.

### CARE-radiology statement explanation and elaboration: reporting guideline for radiological case reports [^111sng12]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Diagnostic assessment

7a. Diagnostic methods (physical examination, pertinent laboratory testing and other imaging) should be reported.

7b. Diagnostic challenges should be reported, when applicable.

7c. Diagnostic reasoning including any differential diagnoses should be reported.

7d. Surgical and pathological diagnosis results should be presented when applicable.

7e. If the diagnosis is beyond the scope of radiologists, diagnoses made by other medical providers should be reported, along with how the radiologists validated such diagnoses.

7f. The report should describe relevant prognostic characteristics, such as tumour staging and genotype.

Explanation: Diagnostic assessment is one of the essential components of the radiology case report, and accurate reporting of this component is a prerequisite for assessing diagnostic accuracy. The case report's authors should describe the diagnostic approach, including physical examinations (eg, important specialty examinations and whole-body examinations) and relevant laboratory tests, along with the differential diagnoses that were considered. In addition, any challenges encountered in the diagnostic process and how they were addressed should be included (eg, inability to complete certain tests for cultural or economic reasons, or lack of patient consent). If available, surgical and pathological diagnoses should be presented, including staging and genetic typing. Additional details should be provided if a non-author institution made important diagnoses (eg, surgical or pathological).

Example: The physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the right inguinal area. The laboratory tests revealed leucocytosis (11.39×10³/µL), elevated C reactive protein (35.4 mg/L) and leucocyturia; however, the urine culture showed a negative result. Due to the progression of localised right inguinal pain, the emergency doctor arranged a CT scan to rule out incarcerated inguinal hernia.

The entire tissue mass was sent for pathological examination, and the findings were identical to those seen in 2005; the diagnosis of recurrent CGCG was thus confirmed. The brown tumour of hyperparathyroid disease was excluded because normal levels of parathyroid hormone, plasma phosphate, calcium and total protein were detected.

Preoperative cervical biopsy revealed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and focal infiltration (depth of approximately 1 mm). The preoperative clinical diagnosis was stage IIA2 cervical cancer.

### Clinical and laboratory data of a large series of patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy [^111Zzkzo]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We report one of the largest series of patients with BSCL treated at a single medical center. The lack of genetic analysis in one-third of the patients is a limitation to the best clinical characterization of the group. We believe that since the majority of patients were from the same region, two-thirds of the patients who already had genetic diagnosis must represent the proportion of the types of BSCL in this population. We hope that earlier clinical/genetic diagnosis and more efficient treatment options can reduce complications, prevent early deaths, and thus increase the expectation and quality of life of these patients.

A 37-year-old otherwise healthy woman presented with a 1-month history of a diffuse, painful, and erythematous swelling on her right thigh (Fig 1), along with high fever (up to 41°C) arthralgia, headache, and night sweats. She was initially treated with multiple antibiotics for infection, but the treatment failed. Routine laboratory tests showed a leukocyte count of 2.40 × 10⁹/L (reference range: 4.00–10.00 × 10⁹/L), lactate dehydrogenase 2213 U/L (reference range: 114–240 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 260 U/L (reference range: 1–40 U/L), and aspartate aminotransferase 626 U/L (reference range: 1–37 U/L). Blood culture results were negative. Bone marrow biopsy was unremarkable. Subsequently, biopsies of the right thigh (Fig 2) as well as immunohistochemistry (Fig 3) were performed.

### RASopathies [^117189sS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

RASopathies are a group of disorders characterized by mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. RAS-MAP signaling plays a critical role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Germline mutations can result in distinctive syndromes, including Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1. Mosaic RASopathies can present as localized cutaneous lesions like epidermal nevi and nevus sebaceous, or more extensive conditions such as encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis. We review the heterogenous presentation of RAS mutations, discuss new targeted therapies, and highlight areas of uncertainty, including carcinogenesis risk and appropriate screening.

### Surgical treatment of multiple symmetric lipomatosis with ultrasound-assisted liposuction [^117DJp6g]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple symmetric lipomatosis (MSL) is a rare disease of unknown etiology, characterized by the presence of multiple, symmetrical, noncapsulated lipomas, mostly in the neck and upper trunk. To date, there is no effective medical treatment of MSL. Surgical treatment is based on 2 options, namely, lipectomy and/or liposuction. In this retrospective study, we compare traditional lipectomy with ultrasound-assisted liposuction. Our initial experience demonstrates that the ultrasound-assisted liposuction procedure can be applied to patients with MSL, allowing simultaneous treatment of multiple areas in a single session and the removal of a substantial amount of fat, thus improving aesthetic results. If lipomas are circumscribed and isolated, traditional lipectomy is probably to be preferred.

Dercum's disease, also known as adiposis dolorosa, is a rare disease characterized by the accumulation of painful subcutaneous deposits of mature adult fatty tissue around the thighs, trunk, and upper arms and usually in a multifocal distribution. We are reporting an unusual presentation of Dercum's disease, presenting as a single painful, erythematous lesion around the left hip in a 71-year old postmenopausal woman. This report emphasizes the unusual presentation of adiposa dolorosa with a new modality for therapy. A summary of the major clinical associations, diagnostic challenges, and treatment modalities are also included in this manuscript.

### Familial chylomicronemia syndrome: an expert clinical review from the National Lipid Association [^1138CxzP]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Genetic testing for familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is central to diagnosis and panel design: Genetic testing is the gold standard for diagnosing FCS, and the decision to undergo genetic testing for FCS should consider the following factors: (1) high baseline clinical suspicion of FCS; (2) expected benefits and risks of testing; and (3) patient values and preferences. Next-generation DNA sequencing panels must evaluate the 5 canonical causal genes — LPL, GPIHBP1, APOA5, APOC2, and LMF1 — and ideally also include hereditary lipodystrophy genes and APOE genotyping. In patients with high clinical suspicion (NAFCS score ~45), there is a high probability — 75% to 80% — of a positive genetic diagnosis. Indeterminate results typically arise when either 1 or 2 variants of uncertain significance are detected in an FCS gene or only a single heterozygous pathogenic variant is found; 15% to 20% of patients with MCS are heterozygous for such variants. Additionally, ~8% of patients with MCS have refractory hypertriglyceridemia, often despite a low NAFCS score. Genetic counseling would be ideal before and after genetic testing, and the benefits of genetic testing include a definitive diagnosis, guidance in management, risk assessment for family members, and psychosocial support via patient advocacy groups.

Rare genetic disorders — Inherited and congenital lipodystrophies are associated with moderate-to-severe hypertriglyceridemia, characterized by loss of adipose tissue with autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance; loss of adipose tissue is selective and variable and may be partial or complete, with some forms manifesting at birth and others beginning in childhood and puberty. Varieties of familial partial lipodystrophy involve fat loss from the extremities more than the trunk, and hypertriglyceridemia is also seen in several types of glycogen storage disease in children.

### Liposarcoma or lipoma: does genetics change classic imaging criteria? [^113X4Ucj]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Differentiating benign from malignant fatty tumours has always been very difficult for both radiologists and pathologists. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses provide complementary tools for differentiating soft tissue tumours. Our objective was to compare imaging criteria of malignancy with a new diagnostic gold standard, namely, pathological analysis combined with cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses. Nineteen patients with a fatty tumour were included. All had computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging examination before any biopsy or surgery. All had histopathological and cytogenetic and/or molecular genetic analyses. The imaging diagnosis of benign or malignant lesions was accurate in 15 cases, with 4 false positives for malignancy. Erroneous criteria were a large size (4 cases), and a mass that was not purely fatty. In conclusion, the main pitfall for a false positive radiological diagnosis of liposarcoma is certainly a large-sized tumour. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses contribute to the diagnosis and can be performed at the same time with a core biopsy.

### Madelung lipomatosis presenting as a manifestation of myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) syndrome [^1118zhqU]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Results of family studies suggest autosomal dominant or mitochondrial inheritance in multiple symmetric lipomatosis, and it is the possible mitochondrial inheritance that is of interest here. Chong et alreported 2 cases of multiple symmetric lipomatosis with the MERRF A8344G mutation. Olsen et alreported that the same MERRF mutation was reported in 16% of multiple symmetric lipomatosis cases with postulated hypertrophy of brown adipose tissue. Holme et alreported a case of multiple symmetric lipomas with the MERRF A8344G mutation as the only manifestation of disease in a carrier of MERRF syndrome. This mutation was found in the lipomas of the mother who did not manifest neuromuscular disease. She had 4 sons; the eldest had MERRF syndrome, and the second son had exercise-induced muscle pain but no neurologic signs. The youngest sons were healthy. Through these findings, it is suggested that patients with multiple symmetric lipomatosis be screened for mitochondrial dysfunction, as it could have implications for future management and genetic counseling. The clinical diagnosis of MERRF is based on the following 4 features: myoclonus, generalized epilepsy, ataxia, and ragged red fibers in the muscle biopsy.

Our patient had findings of Madelung lipomatosis and MERRF syndrome, with subsequent genetic confirmation. These lipomas, particularly cervical lipomas, can be progressive, infiltrative, and massive. Fortunately, they only rarely have demonstrated malignant transformation to liposarcoma. These lipomas can be very difficult to remove and can frequently recur after surgery. Our patient was referred to a plastic surgeon for evaluation to see if she would be a candidate for at least partial removal to improve her ability to breath and sleep.

This case demonstrates the potential relationship between Madelung lipomatosis and MERRF syndrome. We believe one should be aware that patients presenting with a classic Madelung presentation may have other associated findings that should be investigated, particularly neuromuscular symptoms, as they may be displaying a representation of MERRF syndrome.

NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors — Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) clinical spectrum and inheritance: The MEN syndromes are characterized by tumors that arise from endocrine organs and cells throughout the body, with MEN1 and MEN2 being the two most common syndromes. MEN1 is an autosomal-dominant inherited syndrome characterized by hyperparathyroidism (most commonly 4-gland hyperplasia), pituitary adenomas, and PanNETs, and may also be associated with NETs of the lung and thymus, adrenal tumors, multiple lipomas, and cutaneous angiomas. MEN2 is also autosomal-dominant and is associated with MTC (98%), PCC (50%), often bilateral, and hyperparathyroidism (25%). Familial MTC can occur in patients without MEN2 and is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease.

Cushing's syndrome — subsequent evaluation after initial testing: For abnormal results from one high-sensitivity test, the guideline states "we recommend performing another recommended test". It adds "We suggest the additional use of the dexamethasone-CRH test or the midnight serum cortisol test in specific situations", and "We suggest against the use of the desmopressin test, except in research studies, until additional data validate its utility". It further advises "We recommend against any further testing for Cushing's syndrome in individuals with concordantly negative results from two different tests (except in patients suspected of having the very rare case of cyclical disease)", and "We recommend tests to establish the cause of Cushing's syndrome in patients with concordantly positive results from two different tests, provided there is no concern regarding possible non-Cushing's hypercortisolism (Table 2)". Follow-up is advised as "We suggest further evaluation and follow-up for the few patients with concordantly negative results who are suspected of having cyclical disease and also for patients with discordant results, especially if the pretest probability of Cushing's syndrome is high". Remarks include that specialist review is helpful — "If the initial test result is abnormal, further evaluation by an endocrinologist will ensure that the disorder is confirmed or refuted and that the possibility of a false-positive result will be considered" — and that with high pretest probability but a normal initial test, "use of an additional alternative test has the potential benefit of disclosing those with milder disease", with the option to defer testing: "Postponing additional testing to allow progression of clinical and biochemical features may be useful. The patient should be reassured that this poses minimal risk in the setting of mild hypercortisolism".

Arthritis Care & Research (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Lyme disease, more specifically with respect to testing for erythema migrans, AAN/ACR/IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining antibody testing rather than currently available direct detection methods (such as PCR or culture performed on blood or skin samples) in patients with one or more skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for erythema migrans, performed on an acute-phase serum sample (followed by a convalescent-phase serum sample if the initial result is negative).
