## Question

How many distinct diagonals of a convex hexagon can be drawn?

Answer Choices:
A. 6
B. 8
C. 9
D. 36

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many distinct diagonals can be drawn in a convex hexagon. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of a diagonal in a polygon. Then, I should verify the general formula for the number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon. Next, I will substitute n = 6 and compute the result. After that, I should double-check the arithmetic and consider whether any diagonals coincide or are indistinct in a convex hexagon. Finally, I will match the computed number to the provided answer choices and confirm the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misapply it: in a polygon, a diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices, which means we exclude the sides of the polygon itself from the count.

> Next, I should review the general formula. The number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon is given by n(n − 3)/2, because each vertex connects to n − 3 other vertices via diagonals (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices), and we divide by 2 to avoid double-counting each diagonal.

> Now, I will substitute n = 6 into the formula: 6 × (6 − 3) / 2 = 6 × 3 / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9. Wait, let me verify the arithmetic: 6 times 3 is 18, divided by 2 is indeed 9, so the calculation is correct.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm whether any diagonals coincide in a convex hexagon. In a convex polygon, all diagonals are distinct line segments between non-adjacent vertices, so there is no overcounting or degeneracy to subtract, which means 9 is the correct total number of distinct diagonals.

> I will now examine the answer choices: A. 6, B. 8, C. 9, D. 36. My computed value of 9 matches option C, whereas 6 would be the number of sides, 8 is close but incorrect, and 36 is far too large and would correspond to something like 6 squared rather than the diagonal formula, so the correct choice is C.

---

The number of distinct diagonals in a convex hexagon is **9**. This is calculated using the formula for diagonals in an n-sided polygon: [n(n−3)/2], which for n = 6 gives [6 × 3/2] = 9. The correct answer is **C. 9**.

---

## Formula for calculating diagonals in a polygon

The general formula for the number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon is:

Number of diagonals = [n(n−3)/2]

This formula accounts for the fact that each vertex connects to (n-3) other vertices via diagonals (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices), and each diagonal is counted twice, so we divide by 2 to correct for double-counting.

---

## Application to a hexagon

For a hexagon, **n = 6**. Plugging this into the formula:

Number of diagonals = [6(6−3)/2] = [6 × 3/2] = [18/2] = 9

Thus, a convex hexagon has **9 distinct diagonals**.

---

## Verification by enumeration

To verify, label the vertices of the hexagon as A, B, C, D, E, and F. The diagonals are:

- AC, AD, AE
- BD, BE, BF
- CE, CF
- DF

Counting these gives a total of **9 diagonals**, confirming the formula result.

---

## Common misconceptions

A common mistake is to confuse the number of sides with the number of diagonals, leading some to incorrectly choose **6** (option A). Another error is to misapply the formula or miscount, which might lead to **8** (option B). Option D (36) is far too large and results from a fundamental misunderstanding of the formula.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. 9**, as calculated by the standard formula and verified by enumeration.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^6118d11b]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

To visualize the representation of corners in the low-dimensional neural manifold of the subiculum, we performed three-dimensional (3D) embeddingof the population activity of all recorded neurons in the triangle, square and hexagon (Fig. 1k, Extended Data Fig. 5a–c and Methods). Across different mice, we found that the representation of each corner for a given environment was distinct from other corners and the rest of the space and that the sequential order of corners was effectively preserved in the low-dimensional neural manifold (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). On the other hand, corner representations also converged at a specific point on the manifold (as indicated by the black circles in Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). This convergence suggests that subiculum neurons also generalize the concept of corners, in addition to representing their distinct locations. A prediction of this 'separated yet connected' corner representation is that corner cells more generally encode the presence of a corner and only modestly encode the precise allocentric location of corners (for example, the northwest versus the southwest corner). To test this idea, we first trained a decoder on corner cell activity and used this decoder to predict the animal's quadrant location in the square environment (Fig. 1l). While decoding performance significantly exceeded chance levels, the accuracy of the decoding was only moderate (approximately 35%, Fig. 1l), consistent with the idea that corner cells generalize their coding to all corners. Next, we implemented a decoder to predict the geometry (that is, identity) of the environment and compared the prediction accuracy of the decoder when using data from locations near versus away from the geometric features of the environment (that is, corners, boundaries). This approach revealed that subiculum neurons carried more information about the overall environmental geometry when the animal was closer to a geometric feature (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f). Together, these results point to the subiculum as a region that encodes information related to corners and the geometry of the environment.

### UK recommendations for the management of transgender and gender-diverse patients with inherited cancer risks [^3ef308a9]. BJC Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent literature from the US suggest a diamond to represent non-binary patients or other gender-diverse identities. However, participants of Barnes et al. expressed that a diamond did not seem validating, as it is used when gender is unknown, or not clinically relevant. This could also cause confusion for those interpreting the pedigree, leading to patients denoted as a diamond being omitted from risk assessment. Tuite et al. suggest the alternative of an inverted triangle. However, this may be confused with the triangle which is standardly used to indicate a pregnancy not carried to term. Therefore, this group agreed that an additional symbol, beyond existing standards, should be used to denote non-binary patients or other gender-diverse identities.

Von Vaupel-Klein & Walsh proposed a hexagon with annotation of sex assigned at birth as an easily recognisable and distinct pedigree a symbol. With the addition of a key/legend this could be an efficient and clear symbol to use for non-binary and gender-diverse patients. Moreover, a hexagon may be preferred by these patients, as it is a determinant of a gender identity, distinct from other symbols. There was some debate about the use of the hexagon due to the feasibility of drawing the symbol, and the potential of a poorly drawn hexagon to resemble a circle. Nonetheless, consensus was reached that a hexagon would be appropriate to use until further research is carried out. Further research involving TGD patients and members of the public, as well as clinicians, will be crucial to reach international consensus on the appropriate pedigree symbol.

Basis sets

Community structure: The number of nodes within each community is considered constant for simplicity. There is an assignment vector for each community with a value of one for each node that belongs to that community and zero otherwise. The number of such vectors is determined by the number of communities that are currently considered. Further, there are 'connecting node assignment vectors' for each community, which give a probability for a node in a certain community to connect to another node in another community, the probability for a second connecting node is lower. This probability is a Gaussian with a number of connecting nodes as its variable. See supplementary Note 3 for further discussion on this choice.

Hex: The eigenvectors of a large hexagonal graph were computed. We kept as a basis set the 12 most informative eigenvectors (excluding the constant). We then resize the eigenvectors according to the size of the graph that is currently considered using standard interpolation method (matlab imresize).

Successor representation model

The successor representation is defined as:where A is the transition matrix, I is the identity matrix and γ is a discount factor.

The SR can be updated within blocks, after updating the transition matrix online, or using TD learning. After observing a transition at time step t + 1 ofthe SR is updated according to:whereis the learning rate. We made the SR symmetrical at the end of each block.

Spectral regularization (filtering the SR using its own eigendecomposition):

We have calculated the eigendecomposition (using SVD) of the SR that has been learnt using TD. We then calculated the regularized SR by: where U m is the matrix of the m = 7 most informative eigenvectors of the symmetrised SR andis a diagonal matrix with the m = 7 largest eigenvalues on its diagonal. γ = 0.8. The number of simulations for Fig. 4b is 10.

Behavioural experiments

Participants: We recruited 100 participants, 60 participants for experiment 1 (30 in each group) and 40 participants for experiment 2 (20 in each group). All participants are UCL students with an average age of 23.5.

The study was approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (Project ID 11235/001). Participants gave written informed consent before the experiment.

### Stability criteria for complex microbial communities [^e58f97d0]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Positive equilibria are guaranteed to be stable under competition for abiotic resources. We show four examples demonstrating feasible solutions of (1) that are stable to small perturbations. Plots show the density (colored from red to blue) of eigenvalues for the Jacobian matrix at this equilibrium, defined using a fixed matrix of consumer preferences. The form of the consumer preferences is shown inset in blue, where each row represents a distinct resource, each column represents a distinct consumer, and darker blue indicates a higher rate of consumption. Each plot is obtained over multiple random draw for consumer and resource densities, drawn from a uniform distribution. In the left-hand panels, we consider a gradient from near-specialism, where each consumer has a favorite resource (but there are weak, randomly-drawn off-diagonal interactions), to near-generalism, where the off-diagonal preferences are stronger than the specialism. In the right-hand panels, we show a similar gradient of near-specialism to near-generalism, but where the resource preferences follow a smooth curve away from the preferred resource for each species. Both left- and right-hand panels therefore show a gradient from generalism to specialism, but the right-hand case assumes that there is an unambigious spectrum of similarity for resources, and that species that can consume a given resource also tend to consume similar resources. In all four cases, our theorem for local stability holds: the real parts of all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix are always negative. We also note the similarity in the 'dragonfly' shape for this distribution across all cases, contrasting with the classic circle (or elliptical) distributions for eigenvalues found in the case of pairwise interactions, but similar to the distribution of eigenvalues found for bipartite Lotka–Volterra equilibria

Experimental measurement of translation error rate.

a Overview of the experimental pipeline. A dual luciferase system consisting of Renilla and either wildtype or mutant Firefly was transformed to the segregant strains. Each strain was cultured and assayed for Firefly and Renilla activities, which were used to estimate translation error rate (See "Methods"). b The Firefly to Renilla ratios of luminescent signals are largely consistent across strains carrying the wildtype Firefly. The distribution of data points representing the Firefly (x) and Renilla (y) luminescent signals of individual replicates was shown as a hexagonal binning plot, with the colors representing the number of points falling in each hexagon by the color scale to the right. A diagonal line shows the linear model fitted to the raw data, whose parameter and Coefficient of Determination are indicated in the top left corner. c Similar to b except that the strains carrying the mutant Firefly are analyzed. d Similar to Fig. 2d except translation error rates are analyzed.

### Mono-planar T-Hex: speed and flexibility for high-resolution 3D imaging [^d0089922]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Towards greater flexibility of segmentation, a key parameter is the PE increment d of each individual shot, which is the spacing of readout lines in EPI and the radial increment per turn for a spiral readout. For conventional segmentation, d is constrained to integer multiples of the lattice constant Δk as shown in Figure 1A. However, other distances occur on the hexagonal grid as illustrated in Figure 1B. Defining the hexagonal grid by the basis vectorsand, a greater variety of vector lengths results from forming integer combinations ofand:

Due to the symmetries of the grid, all possible distances are represented by vectors from the origin to points in the first dodecant marked yellow in Figure 1B (M 1 ≥ M 2 ≥ 0).

This greater choice of distances can be exploited to increase the flexibility of segmentation by selecting a grid point with favorable distance d from the origin (eg, M 1 = 2, M 2 = 1, marked red in Figure 1B) and tilting the grid such that the corresponding vectoris orthogonal to the principal axis of the stack (2nd PE axis in Figure 1C). For all choices of, the points on the tilted hexagonal grid fall onto a finer, rectilinear grid (green lines in Figure 1D), as derived in the Appendix of Ref.

For optimal imaging performance, the eventual sampling density must account for the required FOV and the parallel imaging capability of the array used. Either or both may be anisotropic, calling for different densities in the two PE directions. To implement these, the tilted hexagonal pattern is rescaled in the two dimensions and cropped according to the desired resolution.

### Stability criteria for complex microbial communities [^fb31234d]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Positive equilibria are guaranteed to be stable if exchange of resources is reciprocal. We show two examples demonstrating feasible solutions of (5). Plots show the density (colored from red to blue) of eigenvalues for the Jacobian matrix at this equilibrium, defined using a fixed, diagonal matrix of consumer preferences. This is shown inset in blue, where each row represents a distinct resource and each column represents a distinct consumer; blue squares indicates a nonzero rate of consumption. We also consider a fixed, more general matrix of production rates (inset in green). Again, each row represents a distinct resource, each column represents a distinct consumer, and darker green indicates a higher rate of production. Each plot is obtained over multiple random draws for consumer and resource densities s and r, defined in the main text, and drawn from a uniform distribution (subject to the constraints necessary to ensure that these densities can be obtained with positive influx and mortality rates ρ and μ). In the left-hand panel, we consider a random set of production rates, which does not satisfy the bound necessary to guarantee stability, and indeed we see that there are some positive eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, to the right of the black dashed line. In the right-hand panel, we show a similar case but where we impose that the production matrix P is symmetric, meaning that each consumer gets as much of its favored resource as it gives. Even though the production matrix looks 'similar' to the naked eye in each case, this symmetry in the latter example is enough to guarantee local stability, with the largest eigenvalue bounded away from zero by a gap related to the consumer abundances

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

2 METHODS

2.1 Trajectory design

2.1.1 Tilted hexagonal grids

Fast 3D Fourier encoding is often achieved by stacking identical 2D readouts in the third dimension. EPI and Archimedean spirals then form 2D Cartesian grids in planes orthogonal to the read direction. These planes, which are parallel for EPI and radial about the principal axis of the stack for spirals, shall be referred to as phase‐encoding (PE) planes. However, Cartesian sampling is usuallly suboptimal. Structures with approximately circular or elliptical support are sampled more efficiently on hexagonal grids. In parallel imaging with undersampling, the greater isotropy of hexagonal patterns improves the conditioning of image reconstruction for a given mean sampling density.,

Spiral and EPI trajectories can readily be stacked in such a way that they cover hexagonal grids in their PE planes (Figure 1A). However, due to the finite feasible length of individual readouts, one shot may not suffice to cover an entire nominal k‐space plane when targeting high resolution. The common solution to this problem is to segment each plane into N interleaved shots. However, due to the inflexibility in time allocation arising from N being an integer, it is often impossible to optimize the sequence timing for contrast and SNR as discussed more closely in the Supporting Information.

### Non-stationary statistics and formation jitter in transient photon condensation [^8ac27745]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this work, we have described the transient non-equilibrium dynamics of light in a dye-filled optical cavity quenched through a condensation phase transition. By rapidly exciting a large number of dye molecules, the system is brought to a far-from-equilibrium state. By averaging over all forms of fluctuations, we observed a delayed formation of the condensed phase, interpreted as a transient equivalent of critical slowing down. When quenched above the condensation threshold excitation energy, the quantum fluctuations associated with spontaneous emission seed the growth of the order parameter as the system relaxes into equilibrium. The relaxation dynamics is slower close to the critical point, a feature easily interpreted under the geometrical properties of the effective free-energy landscape, which becomes flat. The same mechanism is responsible for the usual critical slowing down in the relaxation rate of the ordered phase that follows a second-order phase transition. Also, despite the absence of latent heat and the fact that we are dealing with second-order and not first-order phase transitions, analogies can be drawn with the precipitation in supercooled, or supersaturated, liquids. Even quenched above the critical point, a seed of spontaneously emitted photons is needed to nucleate condensation, playing the role of the seeding crystals in supercooled, or supersaturated, liquids. Also, once seeded, crystallization across the entire liquid is faster for liquids quenched further across their critical parameters, with temperature playing the same role as the excitation fraction that follows the quench, in the optical cavity context.

By measuring the statistical properties of this transient condensation, we describe a novel form of diverging fluctuations around the critical point, jitter in the formation of the ordered phase. These are witnessed by strong diagonal correlations and off-diagonal anti-correlations in the non-stationary, second-order correlation function, g (2) (t 1, t 2). More precisely, we demonstrated that while the diagonal of g (2) is a powerful probe of the geometrical properties of the free-energy landscape, its off-diagonal elements reflect the relevant dissipation processes, with the anti-correlation lobes a joint effect of jitter and cavity loss. Fluctuations, arising from spontaneous emission, are highly amplified as the order parameter goes through the convex part of the free-energy landscape towards its equilibrium point.

FIGURE 1
A, Gray dots depict part of the hexagonal grid in a transverse section of a stack of spirals or echo‐planar readouts. Blue dots mark the revolutions acquired within a shot for N = 1, 2, and 3 shots per k‐space plane. B, The hexagonal grid is described by oblique coordinates. All existing distances between grid points are represented in distances of the origin to points in one dodecant (yellow wedge), including its edges. Blue rings mark the distances reflected in (A), and the red ring highlights a distance not available with integer N. C, This distance is used when tilting the grid with respect to the rotational axis of the stack. The FE lines or spiral revolutions acquired in three subsequent shots are highlighted in red, orange, and yellow. D, The hexagonal grid is tilted as shown in (C). Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, "holes" appear on the central k‐space axis.

### Pleats in crystals on curved surfaces [^da309448]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Hexagons can easily tile a flat surface, but not a curved one. Introducing heptagons and pentagons (defects with topological charge) makes it easier to tile curved surfaces; for example, soccer balls based on the geodesic domes of Buckminster Fuller have exactly 12 pentagons (positive charges). Interacting particles that invariably form hexagonal crystals on a plane exhibit fascinating scarred defect patterns on a sphere. Here we show that, for more general curved surfaces, curvature may be relaxed by pleats: uncharged lines of dislocations (topological dipoles) that vanish on the surface and play the same role as fabric pleats. We experimentally investigate crystal order on surfaces with spatially varying positive and negative curvature. On cylindrical capillary bridges, stretched to produce negative curvature, we observe a sequence of transitions-consistent with our energetic calculations-from no defects to isolated dislocations, which subsequently proliferate and organize into pleats; finally, scars and isolated heptagons (previously unseen) appear. This fine control of crystal order with curvature will enable explorations of general theories of defects in curved spaces. From a practical viewpoint, it may be possible to engineer structures with curvature (such as waisted nanotubes and vaulted architecture) and to develop novel methods for soft lithography and directed self-assembly.

### A catalog of the diversity and ubiquity of bacterial microcompartments [^b4c5c5ae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

BMCs have a polyhedral, often icosahedral shape, and typically range from about 40–200 nm in diameter. Structures of model shells confirmed icosahedral symmetry with pentagons occupying 12 vertices and hexagons forming the facets – (Fig. 1a). The pentagons (BMC-P) are formed by five subunits of the pfam03319 fold and have the shape of a truncated pyramid(Supplementary Fig. 1a). BMC-H proteins contain the pfam00936 domain and form almost perfect hexagons with a diameter of about 65 Å and with a concave and convex side(Supplementary Fig. 1b). A central pore allows for passage of substrates and products. The facets of shells also contain BMC-T proteins, which are genetic fusions of two pfam00936 domains that form trimers that in size and shape resemble the hexamers. Variations of the pfam00936 domain that are the result of a circular permutation of the primary structure expand the number of distinct hexagonal building blocks to five (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1b–f).

In 2014, a comprehensive bioinformatic survey identified 357 BMC loci representative of 30 types/subtypes across 23 bacterial phyla. This cataloging of BMC loci within genomic databases was feasible, because both pfam03319 and pfam00936 protein folds are unique to BMCs and are often encoded together with their cargo proteins in chromosomal loci. Within the last six years, the number of metagenomic datasets has increased nearly an order of magnitude. In addition to the microbiome data that have become available, the extraction of tens of thousands of genomes from the uncultivated majority of microorganisms has been facilitated through recent advances in genome-resolved metagenomics.

In this work, we have mined these massive new datasets and compiled a database of more than 7000 BMC loci that cluster into 68 BMC types or subtypes, including 29 new functional BMC types or subtypes. BMC loci are widespread, now evident in 45 phyla across the bacterial tree of life. Collectively our results show that the known BMC functional diversity and distribution at the phylum level has essentially doubled in the last six years and foregrounds the widespread occurrence of bacterial organelles.

### The definition and measurement of heterogeneity [^cd67f037]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods that do not require a priori stratification

There are three main approaches to quantify heterogeneity when no compelling a priori stratification exists: (A) treating heterogeneity as the "volume" of a space that completely encloses one's data points, (B) clustering-based methods, and (C) dendrogram-based methods.

Heterogeneity as a convex hull volume

Roughly speaking, the space enclosed by the smallest perimeter around all pairwise paths in one's data is a convex hull. The volume of this space is sometimes used as a heterogeneity index, but if data are not distributed uniformly within the convex hull, heterogeneity will be overestimated (Fig. 4a–c). We know of no psychiatric study using convex hull volume to quantify heterogeneity.

Fig. 4
Illustration of convex hull and dendrogram-based heterogeneity indices for non-categorical systems.

Panel a illustrates the basic concept of a convex hull on synthetic 2-dimensional data. The volume of the hull is taken as an index of heterogeneity. Panel b shows one problem with the convex hull method, which occurs when data lie along a lower dimensional surface (here just a curve). In this example, the data are all concentrated along the outer border of the hull, leaving the core unoccupied. However, the convex hull volume index will nonetheless count the empty space toward the heterogeneity value. Panel c illustrates the effect of outliers on convex hull volume. Since a convex hull is found by creating a "shell" around one's data, outlying points will expand this shell in ways that leave much of the convex hull empty (though still counting toward the heterogeneity value). Panel d shows the dendrogram computed using agglomerative clustering for a simple mixture of five 2-dimensional (2D) Gaussians. The functional diversity (FD) measure, shown in the title, is the sum of all branch lengths in this tree. Panel e shows a simple simulation with five 2D Gaussians (standardized to lie within the bounds [−1.5, 1.5] in both axes) that were progressively separated further. One can appreciate that the FD measure decreases as the distributions become more distinct. This is the opposite effect demonstrated by the convex hull volume, insofar as FD increases as the space becomes more densely populated with data points.

### Evolutionary relationships among shell proteins of carboxysomes and metabolosomes [^08f374c6]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are self-assembling prokaryotic organelles which encapsulate enzymes within a polyhedral protein shell. The shells are comprised of only two structural modules, distinct domains that form pentagonal and hexagonal building blocks, which occupy the vertices and facets, respectively. As all BMC loci encode at least one hexamer-forming and one pentamer-forming protein, the evolutionary history of BMCs can be interrogated from the perspective of their shells. Here, we discuss how structures of intact shells and detailed phylogenies of their building blocks from a recent phylogenomic survey distinguish families of these domains and reveal clade-specific structural features. These features suggest distinct functional roles that recur across diverse BMCs. For example, it is clear that carboxysomes independently arose twice from metabolosomes, yet the principles of shell assembly are remarkably conserved.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^e4527d16]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Closer examinations in Fig. 5e–i reveal that each panel displays a dominant diagonal about which the panel bends more than the other diagonal. Figure 5f, g is a schematic that shows the difference between an isometrically deformed origami panel and a non-isometrically deformed origami panel, assuming that straight creases remain straight. An isometrically deformed origami panel will display a single curvature because the Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere inside the panel. On the other hand, a non-isometrically deformed origami panel displays double curvature (negative Gaussian curvature) because this deformation mode stores less elastic energy. For the thinner panels as shown in Fig. 5h, by comparing the depth of bending (the black lines), we identify obvious dominant diagonals (AE and E′C) that align with the alternating asymmetric triangulation. In Fig. 5i, we also see that the dominant diagonals are AE and E′C for the thicker hypar model; however, the more in-plane deformation makes the dominant out-of-plane bending diagonals less distinguishable as in the thinner panels.

We collect positional information from the 3D images to compare with the analytical predictions in Fig. 2e. We sample coordinates of the mountain vertices to get estimates for the coefficient k. We then pick the middle points of square creases to form a zig-zag path (i.e. the green lines in Fig. 5e) to estimate the folding angles (ρ) of the corrugations.

### A network-based framework for shape analysis enables accurate characterization of leaf epidermal cells [^04acc8db]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The visibility graph is a fundamental combinatorial structure in computational geometry to represent a set of objects along with a visibility relation between them. Depending on how the objects are defined, three primary types of visibility graphs are used to characterize, recognize, and reconstruct the objects, and they have found various applications (Supplementary Fig. 1). For instance, when the visibility graphs are formed on the vertices of multiple polygons, they can be used for computation of shortest paths among polygonal obstacles, with applications in robotics; when nodes correspond to the amplitude of particular time points, visibility graphs can characterize properties of time series; when the nodes are placed along with a piecewise linear approximation of a shape, network clusters in the resulting visibility graph have been used for shape decomposition, but not for shape comparison. Our visibility graph concept also differs from the shape context, used for shape matching. The shape context provides a descriptor based on the length and rotation of neighboring points on the contour that can be used to measure the similarity between two objects. However, visibility graphs have not yet been used for shape comparison and characterization of local and global properties of shape, which is the main contribution of our study.

Comparison of visibility graphs

While visibility graphs with an equal number of nodes can be compared based on Euclidean distance of their adjacency matrices, after appropriate rotation (see Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig. 2 for illustration of rotational distance), the comparison of visibility graphs with a different number of nodes requires a distance measure applicable to matrices of a different dimension. A suitable and easy-to-implement distance measure for visibility graphs with a different numbers of nodes relies on the comparison of the distribution of entries, or on the distribution of eigenvalues, of the matrices associated with the graphs. These distributions provide a summary of values that characterize the graphs. We propose to compare the unweighted visibility graphs based on the differences in the distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix (i.e. another matrix representation of a given graph), L = A − D, with D denoting the diagonal matrix of node degrees (Fig. 2a). The distribution of the eigenvalues of a Laplacian, which are guaranteed to be nonnegative, have already been used to compare images. To quantify the distance between the distributions of eigenvalues for two visibility graphs we use the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic (Fig. 2a). The resulting distances yield a distance matrix that can be employed in clustering.

### Geometric frustration in polygons of polariton condensates creating vortices of varying topological charge [^3bf44056]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We observe that in some instances for frustrated odd-numbered polygons, the condensates do not successfully "agree" with each other on which direction to form a current. This leads to a state that does not have a single central vortex but rather forms a vortex–antivortex pair as shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5a, b shows the experimental real-space magnitude of the PL and phase, respectively. The diagonal dashed lines are guide to the eye marking a split in density across the condensate polygon. Figure 5c shows a zoomed-in region corresponding to the black dashed square. A vortex–antivortex pair can be observed with cores separated by ~1 μm. Figure 5d–g shows a corresponding numerical simulation of a condensate steady state with a vortex–antivortex pair, obtained by displacing pump spot number 4 in the pentagon by 2.8 μm radially outwards. Figure 5h shows that the measured phase difference between the vertices 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, and 0–3 is equal to π, whereas the phase of condensate 4 is not well defined due to destructive interference, fracturing it into two parts. Line profiles taken along the black circles in Fig. 5c, f unveil an opposite 2 π phase winding about each of the vortex cores (see Fig. 5i).

### Machine learning model for predicting the conversion to dementia using the cube copying test [^cec799ee]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that very early signs of constructional apraxia-like symptoms are already present during the preclinical or MCI stages in individuals who will eventually convert to AD, DLB, or FTD and that these subtle changes can be detected using high-precision AI technology. Visuospatial dysfunction in patients with dementia encompasses difficulties in object recognition, spatial orientation, figure-ground discrimination, visual integration, and visual attention. – These impairments are often reflected in CCT drawings as inappropriate sizes, inaccurate line lengths and shapes, failures in connecting lines or positioning, lack of parallelism, missing elements, unnecessary lines, and distortions or simplifications of three-dimensional structures.–

In this study, converters' drawings exhibited greater discrepancies from the reference values for the number of lines in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and the number of vertices compared to those of non-converters. These deviations likely reflect characteristics such as drawing with multiple discontinuous lines rather than a single straight line, producing wavy lines, endpoints failing to overlap at a single point, and lines that were inappropriately segmented or connected at incorrect points.

Converters also exhibited shorter horizontal and vertical lines and longer diagonal lines than non-converters, along with greater variance in the lengths of all line types. This pattern suggests a distorted drawing style characterized by compromised perspective and reduced accuracy. Additionally, the average angle differences between lines of the same type, as well as the variance of angle differences between horizontal and diagonal lines, were larger. These findings indicate that converters' drawings lacked parallelism, reflecting inconsistency in their drawing styles (Figure 7).

### Geometric imaging of borophene polymorphs with functionalized probes [^084f1ad7]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

A common characteristic of borophene polymorphs is the presence of hollow hexagons (HHs) in an otherwise triangular lattice. The vast number of possible HH arrangements underlies the polymorphic nature of borophene, and necessitates direct HH imaging to definitively identify its atomic structure. While borophene has been imaged with scanning tunneling microscopy using conventional metal probes, the convolution of topographic and electronic features hinders unambiguous identification of the atomic lattice. Here, we overcome these limitations by employing CO-functionalized atomic force microscopy to visualize structures corresponding to boron-boron covalent bonds. Additionally, we show that CO-functionalized scanning tunneling microscopy is an equivalent and more accessible technique for HH imaging, confirming the v 1/5 and v 1/6 borophene models as unifying structures for all observed phases. Using this methodology, a borophene phase diagram is assembled, including a transition from rotationally commensurate to incommensurate phases at high growth temperatures, thus corroborating the chemically discrete nature of borophene.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^666675a9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

To examine these questions, we take a Bayesian sequential inference perspective in which 1D decision variables in models like the SPRT are deconstructed into two decision variables that represent the degree of belief in two hypotheses H 0 and H 1. By using the sequential Bayesian inference beliefs directly, the positive/negative range for the 1D decision variable is split into two independent axes that represent normalized belief over each hypothesis as a separate decision trajectory, given by the posterior probability P i (t) = P (H i ∣ x (1: t)) where x (1: t) is the accumulated evidence at time t (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Multiple-choice decision trajectories.

c, d show evidence accumulation, x, as independent probability trajectories per choice hypothesis, H i. a, b show how these trajectories combine to form n -dimensional decision trajectories (colors match between the lower and upper plots). Dashed lines are example "flat" decision boundaries, θ, with shaded gray showing values/areas above the decision boundary in which a decision has been triggered. Notice that the evidence accumulation is constrained to an (n − 1)D subspace: a plane for three choices (a) and a tetrahedron for four choices (b). For visualization, (b) shows a four-dimensional object embedded into three dimensions projected onto a two-dimensional page; the fourth axis is orthogonal to those shown and "goes into" the page. The import of these different perspectives is that two-choice probability trajectories evolve in time, so decision boundaries can be time-dependent; however, n -choice decision trajectories also evolve in space, so decision boundaries can also have spatial dependence and thus a complex high-dimensional structure.

### Nonlinear magnetotransport shaped by fermi surface topology and convexity [^0e243c1b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The nature of Fermi surface defines the physical properties of conductors and many physical phenomena can be traced to its shape. Although the recent discovery of a current-dependent nonlinear magnetoresistance in spin-polarized non-magnetic materials has attracted considerable attention in spintronics, correlations between this phenomenon and the underlying fermiology remain unexplored. Here, we report the observation of nonlinear magnetoresistance at room temperature in a semimetal WTe 2, with an interesting temperature-driven inversion. Theoretical calculations reproduce the nonlinear transport measurements and allow us to attribute the inversion to temperature-induced changes in Fermi surface convexity. We also report a large anisotropy of nonlinear magnetoresistance in WTe 2, due to its low symmetry of Fermi surfaces. The good agreement between experiments and theoretical modeling reveals the critical role of Fermi surface topology and convexity on the nonlinear magneto-response. These results lay a new path to explore ramifications of distinct fermiology for nonlinear transport in condensed-matter.

### Returners and explorers dichotomy in human mobility [^3074c520]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The correlation between total radius and k -radius of gyration allows us to quantify the degree of similarity between overall and recurrent mobility. Figure 3 compares total r g andof each individual for k = 2, 4, 8, indicating that the population splits into two distinct classes. The data points concentrated around the diagonal correspond to individuals whose total r g is comparable to, indicating that their characteristic travelled distance is dominated by their k- th most frequented locations. We call them k -returners, as their mobility range is well-approximated by their k- th most frequented locations. The points concentrated around the abscissa correspond to individuals whoseis considerably smaller than total r g, indicating that we cannot reduce their mobility to k locations; we call them k -explorers. For example, the characteristic travelled distance of a two-returner is mainly determined by the two most frequented locations, typically corresponding to her home and work. In contrast, a two-explorer travels recurrently between many different locations.

The separation between the two classes is especially clear for high radii of gyration, as for high total r g we find very few points between the diagonal and the abscissa in Fig. 3. Yet, as the insets show, the split into the two classes is valid for smaller total r g as well. The number of k -returners increases with k (Supplementary Fig. 3), and when k equals the total number of visited locations each individual becomes a returner. Note that while explorers gradually become returners as k increases, the opposite process is extremely rare (see Supplementary Note 8, Supplementary Fig. 10). The partition of individuals into returners or explorers observed in both the GSM and the GPS data is not due to confounding variables like the heterogeneity of the number of calls or the demography of the municipality of residence (see Supplementary Note 6, Supplementary Fig. 7).

### Bond percolation in coloured and multiplex networks [^97bf7ad5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Colour switching in finite components. a Theoretical expected fraction of colours m i as a function of percolation probability p features a switching behaviour in the example network with α = 0.1. These profiles are the same for all finite components independently of their size. b Theoretical and observed fraction of colours in the giant component. c The 2 σ spread of random variables f 1, f 2 and f 3 as predicted in the components of size n = 50 is compared to observations in generated networks. The vertical guide lines mark values of p at which the disjoint network features phase transitions. A parametric study describing how colour fractions evolve in networks with various modularity is given in Supplementary Table 1

In colour-dependent percolation, one investigates the properties of the percolated network as a function of probability vector p = (p 1, p 2 p 3). All configurations of p amount to the volume of a unit cube. Figure 6 presents the regions of this parameter space where the network becomes critical, that is C 2 = 0, or close-to-critical, C 2 is small. This configurations are recovered by numerically solving Eq. (16) that parametrises the corresponding manifolds. One can see that what appears as single curves in Fig. 4d, e for simple percolation, is now a surface placed in the unit cube, see Fig. 6. When p 1 = p 2 = p 3, which corresponds to a diagonal of the cube as indicated by the yellow line, the colour-dependent and simple percolations are equivalent. Figure 6b shows that in the case α = 0.1, the critical points form a box-shaped surface, whereas α = 0 changes this surface into a more complex shape, see Fig. 6a. Note, in Fig. 6a the yellow line intersects this surface three times, which corresponds to the three phase-transition points that are also observed in Fig. 4e. Although there is a conceptual difference between the cases presented in Fig. 6a, b, one would expect that the actual networks should be close in some sense. Indeed, Fig. 6b is obtained by perturbing the network represented in Fig. 6a with a small parameter α. This similarity can be highlighted if we compare the isosurfaces at which C 2 is small. In Fig. 6c, d: one can see that these isosurfaces do bear resemblance.

### Cortical thickness systematically varies with curvature and depth in healthy human brains [^4c04d438]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4.2 Mean curvature

Unlike Gaussian curvature, mean curvature is an extrinsic property of the surface, providing a useful measure of foldedness. It has an intuitive meaning, changing as a piece of paper is folded into a cone or cylinder. Just like paper folding, the extent of shape change might be restricted by intrinsic properties of the surface, such as its initial thickness and surface area (Mota & Herculano‐Houzel). The direction of the outward unit normal provides the orientation at a given point, so that the mean curvature distinguished between convex and concave shapes. It has previously been shown to be a good indicator of gyral and sulcal patterns of the cortex (Batchelor et al; Cachia et al; Luders et al.). For discrete surfaces, the mean curvaturecan be calculated bywhereis the number of edges connected to the vertex; denotes the length of the i th edge connected to the vertex; is the dihedral angle, or the angle between normal vectors of the adjacent triangles meeting at the edge; andis the sum of the areas of the adjacent triangles (Mesmoudi et al.) (Figure 6). This formulation assumes that the neighboring vertices of the polygon is a cylindrical arc with a small radius tangent to adjacent edges.

2.4.3 Principal curvatures

At a given point on a curved surface, there are two orthogonal planes that correspond to the maximum and minimum normal curvatures, and, respectively. (Here we use the convention, but note that some studies instead use.) The principal curvatures are quantified as the reciprocal of the radius of the circle of best fit tangent to the surface at that point. The local shape of a point on an arbitrary surface can be determined by principle curvatures (Figure 7). They can be calculated from the mean and Gaussian curvature asand) (Gray,) or conversely, the mean and Gaussian curvature can be written in terms of principal curvatures asand, respectively. In this study, we calculated the principal curvatures from the values of mean and Gaussian curvature at each vertex (Hu et al.).

### Individuals with ventromedial frontal damage display unstable but transitive preferences during decision making [^3ca82ed2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Tests of a probabilistic model of transitivity

All data were analyzed with MATLAB (Mathworks). We used the set A choices to perform tests of a probabilistic model of transitivity. We first obtained the choice percentages (out of a possible total of 15 choices) for each of the 10 choice pairs (representing all possible pairings of the 5 items) in each category. We then tested the mixture model of preference described by Regenwetter and colleagues. The mixture model states that a person's response comes from a probability distribution over all possible strict linear orderings of the items. Thus, preferences are transitive, but one's transitive state at any given time can vary. The probability of a person choosing one item (X) over another (Y) is the sum of all the preference states in which X is preferred to Y. In a two alternative forced choice task, this probability is constrained by the triangle inequalities. For every distinct X, Y, and Z in a choice set:Where P xy denotes the probability of choosing X over Y, etc. For up to 5 options in a two alternative forced choice task, satisfying the triangle inequalities is necessary and sufficient for a set of choices to be consistent with the mixture model.

For choice percentages that did not satisfy the triangle inequalities, we used the QTEST 2.1, software to determine whether these violations were unlikely to be due to random sampling. QTEST 2.1 uses maximum likelihood estimation to find the goodness of fit of the data at each vertex in the linear ordering polytope defined by the triangle inequalities, using a chi-bar-square distribution with simulated weights. A p < 0.05 was taken as evidence that a subject's choices in that category were inconsistent with the mixture model of preference.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^f3e38e2d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Analytical limit of the folded geometry

Once folded, the hypar pattern buckles out of the plane into a saddle-shaped shell to resolve the fundamental incompatibility between the in-plane strain induced by folding and its three-dimensional embedding. Each panel in the pattern is subjected to twisting along its longitudinal direction. Performing a simple surgery of cutting one corrugation out, we observe an immediate release of the twist, causing the corrugation to lose compatibility as we try to fit it back onto the folded shell, as demonstrated by the insets in Fig. 2a, b. The folded hypar sheet has two orthogonal symmetry planes spanned by the diagonal creases, which divide the shell into four symmetric pieces, each within a quadrant of the x, y -plane. From a homogenized view of the global deformation, we define a surface that describes the shape of the corrugated shell. We cannot assume smoothness at the joint between any two pieces of surface from adjacent quadrants due to the inherent discrete nature of the square hypar. Nevertheless, within each quadrant, the piece of surface is supposed to be a smooth ruled surface bounded by two curves, which can be parametrized as:where ζ (r) and ξ (r) are curves lying on the symmetry planes constructed approximately by the folded diagonal creases. The straight corrugations resemble rulings.

### Kaleidoscopic imaging patterns of complex structures fabricated by laser-induced deformation [^e9d3937b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Design and fabrication of a complex structure

To demonstrate the ability to fabricate quasi-3D complexities, we selected a common hexagonal honeycomb pattern with an inscribed circle diameter (ID) of 10 μm (Fig. 3a) as a simple 2D LiP, as shown in Fig. 3a. A hexagonal lens array (Fig. 3b) can be figured out according to equation (2) on Au (25 nm)/PS(1,000 nm) bilayer with λ 0 = 4.5 μm (see 'Methods' section). In the array each hexagonal cell consists of an annular concave lenslet around a circular convex one with a diameter of about 7 μm and six horn-like small humps located at the six vertexes of each hexagon, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3c. We call such array with the complex structure coaxially nested convex–concave microlens array. The size of the convex lenslet is close to the smallest clear-imaging lens in visible region. Although the profile exhibits a small difference in the circumscribed circle diameter and the ID as shown in Fig. 3a, the outside concave lens and the embedded convex lens have approximate spherical surface allowing for clear imaging (Fig. 3c). Figure 3d, e shows the topology of a region with a size of 80 μm × 80 μm as well as that of an individual lens, displaying the consistency of the design and the experiment. It should be emphasized that to our best knowledge the complex coaxially nested convex–concave microlens array was not available before. In fact, the formation of a coaxially nested convex–concave microlens is a complex straining process, for which the first-order structure preferentially grows along the LiPs, and the secondary-order structures form convex–concave microlenses in the middle. Both clear real and virtual images of a letter A by the convex–concave microlenses have the same size and similar brightness (Fig. 3f–h), indicating good imaging performance and further proving the smooth surface and uniformity of the convex–concave microlenses (also see fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns inserted in Fig. 3g, h).

### A transient high-dimensional geometry affords stable conjunctive subspaces for efficient action selection [^fbdbc6cd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The separability of a neural population encoding control representations can be modulated by its geometric organization. For instance, representational dimensionality–the minimum number of axes needed to account for the variability of neural patterns that span across the task input conditions– is known to balance a computational tradeoff between separability and generalizability of representations in terms of available readouts –. Specifically, a higher-dimensional representational geometry allows the system to encode even similar inputs into more separable or orthogonal neural patterns, thus reducing the overlap of the patterns (Fig. 1A). Thus, representations encoded in a high-dimensional format could be beneficial for cognitive control, in that changing contextual contingencies often requires distinguishing highly correlated inputs.

Fig. 1
Representational dimensionality, dynamics, and selectivity.

Schematic illustration of representational dimensionality, dynamics, and selectivity of the conjunctive control representations. Each panel plots the response of a toy population of three units to input conditions varying in shape (square or circle) and color (red or black). Axes represent the firing rates of single units, collectively defining a neural activity space for the population. Each point within this activity space represents the population response to a given input (identified by colored shapes). Distance between points reflects how distinct responses are, and the jittered cloud of points reflects the trial-by-trial variability in responses to a given input. A The geometric format of the population neural responses is defined by response patterns arranged in 3 dimensions. A linear readout is implemented by a decision hyperplane (yellow) that divides the readout subspace into different classes (e.g. different shapes of inputs). The high-dimensional representation (traced by solid black lines), where no cluster of responses are aligned to each other, allows a wider variety of input conditions to be linearly separable. In addition, responses projected to a readout subspace defined by a linear hyperplane tend to dissociate input conditions (e.g. red-square and black-square) that are on the same side of the decision boundary, increasing the separability of neural responses overall. B Due to the time-varying nature of neural activity, the neural state space is changing and reshaping its underlying geometry over time. The dynamic neural trajectories potentially require changes in the weights for optimal linear hyperplanes for downstream readouts. C Units within the population show a heterogeneous turning profile or nonlinear mixed selectivity. To illustrate, the tuning profile for one unit (r 2) is plotted along the corresponding axis. The bars plot the activity of r 2 to each of the four conditions of input and depict a non-linear mixed selective pattern. Note that similar geometric properties are expected at the level of a single unit (i.e. mixed-selectivity) or population of neurons (i.e. integrative subspaces). The event-file representations could be conceptualized as one form of mixed selectivity where a unit or groups of units are exclusively tuned to a specific combination of task-critical factors more than other pairs.

### Thermodynamics of high-pressure ice phases explored with atomistic simulations [^50b3cacf]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Water ice exhibits remarkable structural diversity: there are currently 20 experimentally confirmed polymorphs with distinct atomic arrangements. Intriguingly, at high pressures between 2 GPa to 200 GPa, with the exception of one face-centred cubic (fcc) superionic phase (ice XVIII), all known phases of ices have a body-centred cubic (bcc) lattice of oxygen atoms, with subtle differences in the positions and the dynamics of the hydrogen atoms.

Ice VII is the proton-disordered counterpart of the antiferroelectric phase ice VIII, and hydrogen atoms can occupy any of the half-diagonals of the bcc unit cell. Ice VII′ forms upon compression (above ~40 GPa at 300 K) during which hydrogen atoms exhibit substantial translational movements along the bcc half-diagonal, leading to a bimodal distribution in the hydrogen positions between two oxygen atoms. Ice VII″ has a stronger delocalisation of protons compared to VII′, and is the solid phase that coexists with the liquid above ~1000 K. Above ~80 GPa, the bimodal distribution of hydrogen positions becomes unimodal and peaks at the centre: this is ice X. Between ~300 GPa and 700 GPa, density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the PBE functional predict the P bcm phase, with a distorted hexagonal close-packed oxygen lattice, to be stable. It has been proposed that P bcm forms due to a dynamic instability in ice X above ~400 GPa.

### Evolution of core archetypal phenotypes in progressive high grade serous ovarian cancer [^2b224b6f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Archetype analysis and biological task classification

We analyzed the HGSOC scRNA-seq transcriptomes intending to identify distinct biological tasks that each of the cells needs to perform and face evolutionary trade-offs. Based on the theory proposed by Shoval et al. we seek to represent the transcriptome datasets as a Pareto-optimal situation by identifying that encloses the data with the vertex of the polytope representing task-specific archetypes. For this analysis, we used the first five principal components of the CCA-normalized scRNA-seq data from the longitudinal cohort, individual patient samples from the longitudinal and the early (treatment-naive), or late (multiline treatment) cohorts. We used the ParetoTI package for R to determine the minimum number of vertices required to enclose the transcriptome data based on the principal convex hull algorithm. Fitting polytopes with an increasing number of vertices ranging from 3 to 8 revealed three vertices (triangle) were sufficient to enclose the data in each case, with additional components resulting in no gain in the proportion of variance explained by the resulting polytope. In addition, we analyzed the CCA-normalized count data to verify the number of archetypes using the ParTI package for MATLAB. We calculated the variance explained by increasing the number of archetypes and confirmed that the three archetypes were ideal using the elbow method. A t -ratio test (P < 0.01) confirmed that the polytope was a statistically significant fit for the data. Subsequently, the polytope fit and archetype scores, or standardized Euclidean distance of each cell to the nearest vertex, were determined using the ParetoTI package. For each archetype, specialist cells were defined as cells above the 80th percentile of archetype scores, while cells that did not meet this criterion for any archetype were classified as non-specialists. The evolution of the archetypes was represented as the percentage of specialists at each time point using the R package fishplot.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^f3b7e627]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Strong segregation theory of the hexagonal columnar phase

To compute the SST free energy of the competitor Hex phase we use the method of ref. which considers a variable class of IMDS shapes — intermediate to circular and hexagonal shapes — and corresponding space-filling (so-called kinked-path) chain trajectories chain trajectories within domains. Complete details and subdomain packing analysis provided in Supplementary Note 6.

Finite segregation strength self-consistent field calculations

Self-consistent field (SCF) calculations of Lam, Hex and DG phases are done using the PSCF code as described in ref. Distributions of the free end junctions are computed from the SCF segment distribution functions as detailed in Supplementary Note 9. As detailed in Supplementary Note 8, the tilt of the chain trajectories is computed from the (polar) order parameter at the IMDS (i.e. regions composed equally of equal parts A and B segments), which is computed from spatial gradients of segment distribution functions as described in ref.

IDMS shape analysis

For the IMDS shape analysis, we adapted methods for calculating smooth approximations to curvature on a discrete meshes based on least-squares fitting of well-behaved quadric surfaces to small surface patches. The quadric surface fits provide for smooth evaluations of curvature that are local to each surface patch. We obtain a global curvature distribution by stitching together the collection of surface patches, averaging over individual patch curvature evaluations at the intersection of multiple patches. This algorithm also provides a route to smoothing over rough meshes, such as those that appear in the skeletal SST construction. This algorithm is described in detail in Supplementary Note 7 A. To construct the "band diagrams", we specify a set of cutting planes and find their intersections with a given meshed surface, yielding curved paths on the surface. We then identify the mesh edges that intersect each plane and use linear interpolation to evaluate vertex- or face-addressed data at the location where each edge intersects with a plane. This method is outlined in Supplementary Note 7 B.

End-exclusion zone corrected free energies

End-exclusion zone (EEZ) corrections to the parabolic brush theory calculations of chain stretching free energy, which are described in Supplementary Note 10, were found using the results of. We incorporated a look-up table and interpolation tool available in the supplementary code of that reference (available at 10.7275/rtvx-h237) to adjust the stretching free energy for each wedge in our medial SST calculations.

### Two-dimensional tessellation by molecular tiles constructed from halogen-halogen and halogen-metal networks [^437bdb47]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Higher-order interwoven tessellation

The α and β phase hexagonal arrangements can be viewed as geometric expressions of regular AT (3 6), where molecule centres are placed at the vertices of the polygons. Figure 4a shows a schematic illustration in which the distinct intermolecular distances connecting the adjacent vertices in the α and β phases are labelled by red and blue lines, respectively. One might ask whether these two phases can interweave to form a more complex architecture. Previous reports typically show formation of non-periodic structures when two or more ordered phases co-exist on the substrate. In this work, in addition to the large-scale, phase-separated α and β phases, inhomogeneously mixed phases (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5) are indeed observed in selected local areas as the HPBI coverage was increased above 0.55 ML (1 ML is defined as one monolayer of HPBI in α phase). Most intriguingly, three types of ordered mixed-phase structures (named A, B, and C) are discovered under high coverage regime; STM images and corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns of these images show periodic arrangements of close-packed clusters with six-fold symmetry, as shown in Fig. 4b–d and insets therein. Three molecular cluster types can be resolved in these ordered structures, including monomers, triangular-shaped trimers, and hexagonal-shaped heptamers; the inter-molecular distances within the trimer and heptamer are equal to those in the α phase. Structure A is based on a monomer and a trimer, while structure B is based on a heptamer; structure C is based on a trimer and a heptamer. Interestingly, the distances between adjacent molecules located at the separated clusters (blue lines in Fig. 4b–d) is about 2.04 nm, equal to those in the β phase. Therefore, these complex structures can be interpreted as interwoven tessellations of the α and β phases. For a clearer view, the packing topologies were sketched and overlain on the STM images (Fig. 4b–d); the red and blue lines label intermolecular distances similar to those in the α and β phases, respectively. Careful comparison reveals that structures A and B can be interconverted through a simple exchange of red and blue lines. Structure C features a more complicated architecture containing units, which appear in structures A and B.

### Modification of boron nitride nanocages by titanium doping results unexpectedly in exohedral complexes [^2ad11a57]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Procedures of search for global minimum structures

Topologies of all BN cages were constructed by the plantri program, and then converted to atomic Cartesian coordinates by the embed program in the CaGe package. Cage isomers with distinct atomic connectivity and regioisomers with distinct B and N distribution are uniquely identified based on the canonical labeling of atomsfollowing the breadth-first-search numbering algorithm. We systematically determined the lowest energy isomers of pristine cages, which all have alternately linked B and N atoms. To enumerate possible candidates for cages containing a key hexagon, we optimized the arrangement of B and N atoms and attained all possible isomers having the minimum number (namely two) of B–B bonds (see Supplementary Method 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 for algorithm). The subsequent Ti(BN) n complexes were calculated using the 6-31G(d) (or 3-21G for = 48) basis set (see Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 for justification of using the 6-31G(d) basis set), allowing us to rule out a great number of high energy isomers. For endohedral complexes Ti@(BN) n, as well as Ti(BN) n made of the lowest energy pristine cage, we explored all possible initial structures by placing the Ti atom at different faces of the cage and determined the corresponding lowest energy isomer. Preliminary tests showed that the Ti atom bound at vertex or bond center sites are energetically less favorable than at face centers. The detailed prescreening procedure is described in Supplementary Method 3, with the total number of considered structures summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

### Direct observation of a crescent-shape chromosome in expanded Bacillus subtilis cells [^0ab6bc8b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

An indirect but powerful method of studying the chromosomal structure is provided by chromosome capture techniques (3C, 4C, 5C), most notably 'Hi-C'. This technique uses proximity-based ligation in combination with next-generation sequencing to uncover the average spatial organization of the DNA within a population of cells. Over the past decade, Hi-C has been established as a major tool for studying the 3D chromosome organization and it has contributed key insights about the chromosome organization in many bacterial species. Interestingly, the most well-studied bacterial model organisms Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis show an entirely different chromosomal structure in Hi-C maps. E. coli was deduced to have a textbook circular chromosomal shape with separately condensed chromosomal arms that are twisted within the cylindrical cell. Bacillus subtilis however, shows a distinct "second diagonal" feature in the Hi-C maps which indicates that two chromosomal arms are spatially aligned, which presumably is facilitated by the action of bacterial structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins. Aligned chromosome arms were also observed in other microorganisms. albeit for some (e.g. Caulobacter crescentus), the second diagonal did not span the full length of the chromosome, suggesting a segregation of the nascent origins but not a full zipping of the entire chromosome. Many questions remain, however, as Hi-C methods involve extensive cell fixation which can alter the DNA organization, and conclusions are drawn from population averages where the single-cell structure and cell-to-cell variabilities are lost.

### Stripenn detects architectural stripes from chromatin conformation data using computer vision [^78df4e6d]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

Overview of the Stripenn algorithm

Stripenn systematically detects and quantitates architectural stripes from genome-wide chromatin conformation measurements. Our method applies principles from computer vision to detect genomic anchors that interact with entire domains at high frequencies (Fig. 1a). The program's output is a table containing coordinates and scores of predicted stripes, which can be used for downstream analysis and visualization purposes. Since Stripenn detects stripes based on principles of the image processing field, the first step is to convert each chromosome's contact matrix, which is provided in the cooler file format, to a digital image. Next, contrast adjustment and noise reduction are applied to a sliding window of 400 pixels along a diagonal line of the image (Fig. 1a). To enhance the contrast between signal and background, brightness is adjusted for multiple levels. To reduce noise, Gaussian blur effect can be applied to each brightened image. Then, Canny edge detection algorithm, which is the most popular edge detection technique to date, is applied to processed images. The Canny edge detection algorithm, which is the backbone of Stripenn, relies on computing the gradient intensity of an image and applying various gradient magnitude thresholding to minimize spurious response to edge detection (see "Methods"). An edge in any digital image can point to a variety of directions; hence, the Canny algorithm uses filters to detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edges. Considering that contact matrices are symmetrical about the diagonal line, Stripenn only reports vertical edges predicted by the edge detection algorithm. Since a stripe is defined by a genomic anchor positioned on the diagonal line, predicted vertical edges longer than 10 pixels are connected to the diagonal line. Canny edge detection predicts two edges for each stripe and adjacent lines within a pre-defined distance are paired, forming a single vertical stripe. Together, Stripenn adapts principles from digital image processing and edge detection techniques to demarcate architectural stripes.

### Programmable interactions and emergent geometry in an array of atom clouds [^7ba0b504]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Interactions govern the flow of information and the formation of correlations between constituents of many-body quantum systems, dictating phases of matter found in nature and forms of entanglement generated in the laboratory. Typical interactions decay with distance and thus produce a network of connectivity governed by geometry-such as the crystalline structure of a material or the trapping sites of atoms in a quantum simulator 1,2. However, many envisioned applications in quantum simulation and computation require more complex coupling graphs including non-local interactions, which feature in models of information scrambling in black holes 3–6 and mappings of hard optimization problems onto frustrated classical magnets 7–11. Here we describe the realization of programmable non-local interactions in an array of atomic ensembles within an optical cavity, in which photons carry information between atomic spins 12–19. By programming the distance dependence of the interactions, we access effective geometries for which the dimensionality, topology and metric are entirely distinct from the physical geometry of the array. As examples, we engineer an antiferromagnetic triangular ladder, a Möbius strip with sign-changing interactions and a treelike geometry inspired by concepts of quantum gravity 5,20–22. The tree graph constitutes a toy model of holographic duality 21,22, in which the quantum system lies on the boundary of a higher-dimensional geometry that emerges from measured correlations 23. Our work provides broader prospects for simulating frustrated magnets and topological phases 24, investigating quantum optimization paradigms 10,11,25,26 and engineering entangled resource states for sensing and computation 27,28.

### Separability and geometry of object manifolds in deep neural networks [^e270f057]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Comparison of theory with numerically measured capacity

The results presented so far were obtained using algorithms derived from a mean-field theory which is exact in the limit of large number of neurons and manifolds and additional simplifying statistical assumptions (Supplementary Note 3.1). To test the agreement between the theory and the capacity of finite-sized networks with realistic data, we have numerically computed capacity at each layer of the network, using recently developed efficient algorithms for manifold linear classification(see Methods). Comparing the numerically measured values to theory shows good agreement for both point-cloud manifolds (Fig. 9 a) and smooth manifolds (Fig. 9 b, Supplementary Fig. 12). This agreement is a remarkable validation of the applicability of mean-field theory to representations of realistic datasets generated by complex networks.

### Diagonal nematicity in the pseudogap phase of HgBaCuO [^ac6140b6]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The pseudogap phenomenon in the cuprates is arguably the most mysterious puzzle in the field of high-temperature superconductivity. The tetragonal cuprate HgBa 2 CuO 4+δ, with only one CuO 2 layer per primitive cell, is an ideal system to tackle this puzzle. Here, we measure the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy within the CuO 2 plane with exceptionally high-precision magnetic torque experiments. Our key finding is that a distinct two-fold in-plane anisotropy sets in below the pseudogap temperature T *, which provides thermodynamic evidence for a nematic phase transition with broken four-fold symmetry. Surprisingly, the nematic director orients along the diagonal direction of the CuO 2 square lattice, in sharp contrast to the bond nematicity along the Cu-O-Cu direction. Another remarkable feature is that the enhancement of the diagonal nematicity with decreasing temperature is suppressed around the temperature at which short-range charge-density-wave formation occurs. Our result suggests a competing relationship between diagonal nematic and charge-density-wave order in HgBa 2 CuO 4+δ.

Features in linear layers are extracted after a ReLU nonlinearity. Color changes from dark to light along the network. Center correlations arewhereis the center of object μ (Supplementary Eq. (1)).

Another source of inter-manifold correlations are correlations between the axes of variation of different manifolds; those also decrease along the network hierarchies (Supplementary Fig. 9) but their effect on classification capacity is small (as verified by using surrogate data, Supplementary Fig. 10).

Effect of network building blocks on manifolds' geometry

To better understand the enhanced capacity exhibited by DCNNs we study the roles of the different network building blocks. Based on our theory, any operation applied to a neural representation may change capacity by either changing the manifolds' dimensions, radii, or the inter-manifold correlations (where a reduction of these measures is expected to increase capacity).

Figure 8 a, b shows the effect of single operations used in AlexNet and VGG-16. We find that the ReLU nonlinearity usually reduces center correlations and manifolds' radii, but increases manifolds' dimensions (Fig. 8 a). This is expected as the nonlinearity tends to generate a sparse, higher dimensional, representations. In contrast, pooling decreases manifolds' radii and dimensions but usually increase correlations (Fig. 8 b), presumably due to the underlying spatial averaging. Such clear behavior is not evident when considering convolutional or fully connected operations in isolation (Supplementary Fig. 11).

### Rapid suppression and sustained activation of distinct cortical regions for a delayed sensory-triggered motor response [^e29cbdf5]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

Next, we employed spectral embedding on the data to detect non-convex and more complex clusters. To do so, we computed the similarity matrixwhose element at rowand columnmeasures the similarity betweenandaswhereis a free parameter determining how local similarity is measured in the feature space. We tunedby putting the average of similarity values equal to 0.5 (the tuned value foris). Then, we computed the normalized Laplacian matrix aswhereis the identity matrix, andis the diagonal degree matrix defined as. The transformed features are rather abstract and computed as the eigenvectors of. It should be noted that the new feature space is non-linearly transformed version of the PCA-space which is itself a linearly transformed version of the original firing rate space. Such a transformation is believed to naturally separate data points which are clustered together. Using the elbow method on the eigenvalues of matrix(i.e. finding the sharp transition in the derivative of sorted eigenvalues), we considered (after excluding the very 1 st eigenvector) the first 13 eigenvectors of matrixas representative features which yielded matrix.

Finally, neurons were clustered based on the resulting matrixusing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The algorithm considers that underlying distribution of data is a mixture ofGaussians with meansdiagonal covariance matrices, and weights. For a given, we estimated the parameters of this mixture model by using expected maximization (EM) algorithm (5000 repetitions and 1000 iterations). The number of clusters was then selectedby minimizing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Figure S5 B). Using the fitted parameters, we assigned a cluster indexto each neuron corresponding to the Gaussian distribution to which it belongs with the highest probability. The output of the GMM step was the vectorcontaining the cluster indices of neurons. Task-modulated clusters (20/24) were sorted by their onset latency and were labeled based on their task epoch-related response (Figure 3 C).

### Distinct magneto-raman signatures of spin-flip phase transitions in CrI [^80f88762]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The polar plots for, which track the intensity ofas a function of angle θ, at various magnetic fields provide further evidence of the magnetic phase transition. As seen in Fig. 4a, the polar plot is rotated by ≈35° at B = 2 T when compared with B = 0 T. This can be understood if we write the Raman tensor for the A g phonon with an induced magnetization m under applied magnetic field (B ⊥ ab) aswhich separates the spin-independent and spin-dependent terms. The point group of CrI 3 requires that the total Raman tensoris symmetric under twofold rotation around the b axis (C 2x). Thus, andmust be symmetric under twofold rotation individually. As m z itself is antisymmetric under C 2x, then the form ofis required to also be antisymmetric under C 2x such that their product is symmetric:Thus, for the B = 0 T case (AFM state) where there is no induced magnetization, the Raman tensor would be purely symmetric, and we would not expect to detect the A g phonon in xy polarization configurations. A magnetic field applied perpendicular to the ab plane that spin-polarizes the CrI 3 to the FM state, however, introduces off-diagonal tensor elements and breaks this expectation, causing the polar plot to rotate as seen in Fig. 4a. Assuming there are minimal changes between the monoclinic (C 2h), 10 L CrI 3 and the hexagonal point group of the monolayer (D 3d), then β ≈ α + Δ and δ ≈ −(γ + Δ′), where Δ and Δ′ are small corrections. Writing the matrices as in Eq. (3) makes it clear that when the magnetic field direction is flipped from B z to − B z, thus flipping the direction of the induced magnetization, the signs of the off-diagonal elements switch, resulting in the opposite rotation of the polar plot, exactly as we observed in Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7.

### Many-body theory of positron binding to polyatomic molecules [^81504690]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

The coefficients C in the expansion of the positron wavefunction in Gaussians are found by solving the Roothaan equations F ± C ± = S ± C ± ε ±, where F ± is the Fock matrix and S is the overlap matrix. The one-body and two-body Coulomb integrals of the Fock matrix are calculated using the McMurchie–Davidson algorithm. We eliminate linearly dependent states by excluding eigenvalues < 10 −5 of the overlap matrices (typically ≲5% of the states). In practice, to minimize the basis dimensions we transform all quantities to a spherical harmonic Gaussian basis (for a given angular momentum, the number of Cartesian Gaussians is greater than or equal to the number of spherical harmonic Gaussians). Solution of the Roothaan equations yield bases of electron and positron Hartree–Fock molecular orbitals(which include ground and other negative energy states, and discretized continuum states) with which the self-energy diagrams can be constructed (see the next section for details).

Expanding the positron Dyson wavefunction in the positron Hartree–Fock molecular orbital basis astransforms the Dyson equation to the linear matrix equation HD = εD, where. Note that we calculate the full self-energy matrix including off-diagonal terms. Such a non-perturbative approach is essential for nonpolar molecules, where binding is enabled exclusively by correlations. In practice, to obtain the self-consistent solution to the Dyson equation, we calculate the self energy at a number of distinct energies E i spanning the true binding energy ε b, with the latter determined from the intersection of the ε b (E i) data with the line ε b (E) = E.

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^39b281e0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Understanding the interactions between liquids and solids is important for many areas of science and technology. Microtextured surfaces have been extensively studied in microfluidics, DNA technologies, and micro-manufacturing. For these applications, the ability to precisely control the shape, size and location of the liquid via textured surfaces is of particular importance for the design of fluidic-based systems. However, this has been passively realized in the wetting state thanks to the pinning of the contact line, leaving the non-wetting counterpart challenging due to the low liquid affinity. In this work, confinement is imposed on droplets located on well-designed shapes and arrangements of microtextured surfaces. An active way to shape non-wetting water and liquid metal droplets into various polygons ranging from triangles, squares, rectangles, to hexagons is developed. The results suggest that energy barriers in different directions account for the movement of the contact lines and the formation of polygonal shapes. By characterizing the curvature of the liquid-vapour meniscus, the morphology of the droplet is correlated to its volume, thickness, and contact angle. The developed liquid-based patterning strategy under active regulation with low adhesion looks promising for low-cost micromanufacturing technology, DNA microarrays, and digital lab-on-a-chip.

Identification rules for tracking moving cells in MBM videos

MBM video analysis brings forth additional challenges beyond those of individual images. In particular, we need to track cells over time, requiring us to determine if cells in consecutive frames are the same cell or not. Two distinct issues arose when making this determination: duplicate counts, and tracking motile cells.

Duplicate counts occur when the segmentation network erroneously segments a single group of adhered pixels as two distinct groups of adhered pixels, whose edges are close, but not touching. To minimize the duplicate counts, we checked to see if the centroids of any two groups of adhered pixels were within 50 pixels (1 px = 0.322 μm) of one another. Also, the shortest distance between the edges of all such pairs was computed, and if this distance was 5 pixels or fewer for any pair, the two groups of adhered pixels were considered to be one. In this case, the two groups of adhered pixels were replaced by the smallest polygon that contains them, known as the convex hull. One can imagine this shape as the result of stretching a rubber band over the two groups of adhered pixels and letting it rest taut.

Another case of duplicate counting occurs if phase 2 misclassified an adhered cell as other for any amount of frames between two positive classifications. This error would cause the analysis to detect a new group of adhered pixels, despite it being the same cell. We avoid this by giving each adhesion event a disappearance allowance. Each cell for an adhesion event was allowed to disappear for a number of frames before considering the adhesion event completed. If a cell disappeared for a number of frames below the allowance and then reappeared, the adhesion event would continue as if the misclassification never occurred. For sRBCs, we allowed cells to go undetected for up to two frames and still count as the same cell. For CAR-T cells, they could go undetected for up to nine frames. These frame thresholds helped us to not preemptively end adhesion events.

Manifold property changes by network building blocks.

Changes in the relative manifold properties between the input and the output of different network building blocks, shown as change in dimension vs change in center correlations (top) and change in radius vs change in center correlations (bottom). Each panel pools results from a specific building block in AlexNet (blue markers) and VGG-16 (green markers) for both point-cloud manifolds (full class, top 10%) and smooth manifolds (1-d and 2-d, translation and shear). Marker shape represents layer type (square — convolution layer, right-triangle — max-pooling layer, hexagon — fully connected layer). For layer sequences marker shape represents the last layer in the sequence. For isolated ReLU marker shape represent previous layer type; pentagon — ReLU after fully connected layer, up-triangle — ReLU after convolution layer. Color changes from dark to light along the network. a Changes in manifold properties for isolated ReLU operations. b Changes in manifold properties for isolated Max-pooling operations. c Changes in manifold properties for a common sequence of operations: one or more repetitions of convolution, ReLU operations, with or without intermediate normalization operation, ending with a max-pooling operation. d Changes in manifold properties for a common sequence of operations: fully connected, ReLU operations. The data analyzed here correspond to the first set of objects used in the analysis of the mean and confidence interval presented in Figs. 6 and 7, and include additional intermediate values not presented in those plots, notably the inputs of ReLU operations.

In contrast to single operations, we find that the networks' computational building blocks perform consistent transformation on manifold properties (Fig. 8 c, d). The initial building blocks consist of sequences of convolution, ReLU operation followed by pooling, which consistently act to decrease correlations and tend to decrease both manifolds' radii and dimensions (Fig. 8 c). On the other hand, the final building block, a fully connected operation followed by ReLU, decreases manifolds' radii and dimensions, but may increase correlations (Fig. 8 d), similarly to the max-pooling operation (Fig. 8 b). Furthermore, as composite building blocks show more consistent behavior than individual operations, we understand why DCNNs with randomly initialized weights do not improve manifold properties. Only by appropriately trained weights, the combination of operations with often opposing effects yields a net improvement in manifold properties.

### Shape-assisted self-assembly [^ab0a009c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

When one associates curvature to shape, three classifications can be envisioned molecularly: zero, positive, and negative curvatures. Flat molecules (zero curvature) are frequently observed in supramolecular polymerizations due to ease of access to these structures synthetically –. Bowl shapes (positive), and more so saddles (negative), are far less commonly used topographies for the opposite reason. Yet, to introduce order in an assembly, negatively curved systems stand out as preferred candidates to induce eclipsed stacking because transverse rigidity is increased on both molecular and macroscopic scales. Asymmetry in saddle design, in addition to replacing a uniform surface with a framework scaffold, heightens the entropic barriers further due to unequal axes of principal curvature (Fig. 1). An energetic minimum can then be reached with eclipsing negatively curved frames such that small deviations from overlap demand high energetic penalties and, consequently, enforce order. Depending on the asymmetry of the saddle, their assemblies likely present differentiated lateral interactions permitting the formation of tertiary structures. However, the path towards these molecular topologies is not trivial: seven- or eight-membered rings are often required as the centerpiece of a saddle design but are challenging synthetic constructs to work around. Five-membered rings, which would ordinarily foster bowl shapes, can be faced opposite to one another to devise 'non-classical' saddles. In the absence of central polygons, this shape can also be achieved through distortions in normally planar architectures due to coordination or steric crowding –. Consideration of these design principles and the available synthetic methodologies convinced us that a contorted porphyrinoid previously reported by Müllencould be tailored to become a versatile platform to explore shape-assisted linear stacking (Fig. 1).

### Persistent homology elucidates hierarchical structures responsible for mechanical properties in covalent amorphous solids [^e9ebd21b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Schematics of the key concepts and method of persistent homology used in this study.

a Visualization of nonaffine displacement in a three-dimensional amorphous structure under shear deformation, with a slice in the xy -plane. Gray circles denote atomic positions, and black arrows represent nonaffine displacements projected onto the xy -plane. The model system consists of 13,824 Si atoms in a cubic unit cell with a side length of 65 Å. The displayed slice corresponds to atoms with z-coordinates between 40 Å and 50 Å. b Illustration of a typical covalent amorphous network structure using a-Si as an example. SiSi 4 tetrahedral units share corners and MRO defined by the angles between these tetrahedra. Blue and red polygons show examples of a parent cycle and its associated child, respectively, observed in a covalent amorphous network. These cycles represent the hierarchical nature of the MRO at different scales. c–g Filtration process in persistent homology with increasing sphere radii. Filled polygons represent cycles transforming into boundaries. Sequence of empty and filled polygons depicts the concept of children: the red triangle is a child of the blue pentagon, and the yellow triangle is a child of the green hexagon. h Persistence diagram obtained from the filtration process. Squared radii (Å 2) are used as birth and death radii. Colors correspond to the polygons in the filtration process.

In addition to the inhomogeneous atomic displacement, another key aspect is the interplay between softness and the medium-range order (MRO), which is a distinctive feature of amorphous structures. Generally, MRO refers to atomic organization on a scale of 5–20 Å, which does not appear in purely random configurations. In covalent amorphous materials, network structures consist of polyhedral units created by atomic bonds that share corners, edges, and faces. Figure 1b shows an example of a corner-sharing network. The organization of the bond-length scale within polyhedral units is called the short-range order (SRO), whereas the MRO corresponds to the relative angles and connectivity between polyhedra. The angle between two adjacent polyhedra corresponds to the dihedral angle formed by four atoms, the restriction of which corresponds to the smallest MRO scale. When the angles between multiple polyhedra are correlated, the atomic ring structures are constrained and an MRO is imposed on a longer scale. However, the relationship between the MRO in these covalent amorphous networks and softness remains unexplored.

### Separability and geometry of object manifolds in deep neural networks [^195d62d3]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Finally, to demonstrate the causal role of center correlations on capacity, we have manipulated the manifold centers by randomizing them without changing the geometry of the manifolds, and compared the resultant capacity (Supplementary Fig. 10 b). As anticipated, center randomization improves capacity, especially in the first layers where the actual capacity exhibit high center correlations.

### Selective directed self-assembly of coexisting morphologies using block copolymer blends [^216275c6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Image analysis

We quantify order in the BCP patterns using image analysis of SEM data, as previously described in the literature. We used code written in the Python programming language, exploiting libraries for image manipulation (Python Image Library), numerical computations (numpy)and plotting (matplotlib). For dot patterns, image thresholding and segmentation is used to identify the cylinder cores. The local topology of the hexagonal lattice is assessed by connecting cylinder cores to nearest neighbours, using a cutoff distance of 1.36 × the average cylinder–cylinder distance (that is, halfway between the first and second 'rings' of cylinders surrounding a representative cylinder). For each cylinder, the number of neighbours (number of cylinders within the cutoff distance) is calculated. Using this nearest-neighbour map, defects can be identified by cylinders that deviate from the ideal state of having six nearest neighbours (regions where a cylinder is 'missing' are surrounded by cylinders of five nearest neighbours, distortions of the hex lattice lead to local configurations where the nearest-neighbour count is larger or smaller than six, and so on). The areal defect density is computed by dividing the defect count by the image size (cylinders at the periphery of the image are ignored, since they lack the correct nearest-neighbour count owing to the image edge). For line patterns, image thresholding and segmentation is used to identify the endpoints of individual lines. Endpoints (other than at the image edge) correspond to local defects in the morphology. The trend of the areal defect densities provides a robust measure of the relative ordering quality of different samples. The relative areal coverage of line patterns (F L) versus dot patterns was assessed using particle counting. A thresholded image was used to identify 'particles' within the image, and a size cutoff was used to distinguish between regions of dots (small particles) and lines (large, elongated particles). The spacing between rows of aligned BCP morphology was assessed by summing pixel grayscale intensity values in each column in the SEM image. Images were first Fourier-filtered to suppress imaging noise, and rotated to align the experimental patterns with the pixel grid. Columns were summed to yield a one-dimensional oscillating curve. Peak-fitting (Gaussian fit constrained to a local part of the curve) was used to identify the positions of local maxima; distances between adjacent maxima were used to measure the local pattern spacing (Δ x).

### Machine learning model for predicting the conversion to dementia using the cube copying test [^5894da09]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, 767 participants met the criteria, comprising 457 converters (318 with AD, 116 with DLB, and 23 with FTD) and 310 non-converters (Table 1). While some participants with DLB and FTD had comorbid AD, the distribution of dementia subtypes among study participants (AD: 69.6%, DLB: 25.4%, FTD: 5.0%) aligned well with previously reported prevalence rates in the literature (AD: 60–77%, DLB: 15–20%, and FTD: 5–15%). – Cardiovascular disease was observed in 178 (38.9%) of the converters and 115 (37.1%) of the non-converters.

Table 1.
Characteristics of the participants (n = 767).

The analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between converters and non-converters for all but one image feature. For local features, converters demonstrated greater absolute differences from the reference values (four lines in each direction) in the number of lines detected across all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) compared to non-converters. Converters also exhibited larger absolute differences from the reference value (eight vertices) in the number of vertices. Additionally, converters had shorter horizontal and vertical lines and longer diagonal lines than non-converters. For all line types, converters showed greater variance in line lengths, larger average angle differences between lines of the same type, and greater variance in angle differences for horizontal and diagonal lines.

### Order and stochasticity in the folding of individual drosophila genomes [^b90943ed]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Marginal scaling (MS) and marginal scaling and stickiness (MSS) models

We carried out the statistical analysis of the single-cell Hi-C maps to provide statistical arguments supporting the premise that the clustering observed in snHi-C contact matrices "is not random". For this, we used two different models of a polymer network based on Erdos-Renyi graphs, where bins of the contact map resemble graph vertices, and contacts between bins are graph edges(Supplementary Fig. 4a):
In the MS model, we require the probability of contact between nodes to respect the contact probability of the experimental contact map, i.e. P (s) = P c (| i − j |). Decay of the contact probability originates from the intrinsic linear connectivity of the chromatin nodes; therefore, it is an important ingredient for studying fluctuations in a polymer network. The probability of the link between i and j in the random graph I, j = 1, 2…, N is, thus, defined as follows:where the normalization factor in the denominator guarantees that the mean number of links in the graph equals N c (i.e. the number of experimentally observed links in each single cell). To obtain the average scaling, we merge all contacts from the available single cells and compute the average P c (s). Given the probability p ij by Eq. 2, we randomly generate adjacency matrices that have a homogenous distribution of contacts along the diagonals and do not respect local peculiarities of the bins, such as insulation score, acetylation, and protein affinity. Nevertheless, some non-homogeneity (clustering) of contacts still emerges as a result of stochasticity in each realization of this graph (Supplementary Fig. 4e).
the MSS model introduces probabilistic non-homogeneity along the diagonals of the adjacency matrices through definition of the "stickiness" of bins, or. Specifically, under "stickiness", we understand a non-selective affinity k i of a bin i to other bins; the probability that the bin i forms a link with any other bin in the polymer graph is proportional to its stickiness. Thus, the clusters of contacts close to the main diagonal of contact matrices form as a result of different "stickiness" of bins in the MSS model. Stickiness might effectively emerge as a result of a particular distribution of "sticky" proteins, such as PcG proteins known to mediate bridging interactions between nucleosomes and to participate in stabilization of the repressed chromatin state.

### Self-assembly of ordered graphene nanodot arrays [^4ac42e30]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 2a reveals structural details of the individual nanodots. The inset in Fig. 2a displays the dot marked by the arrow, which shows a hexagonal shape. In fact, although the dots often have a rather irregular shape, closer examinations suggest that their boundaries are largely composed of hexagonal segments (Supplementary Figs 5–7). By comparing the perimeter length and elongation of the dots with the values for a circle or hexagon (that is, for a compact shape) of the same area, we quantify the degree of irregularity. The ratio of major to minor axis for the best-fit ellipse is 1.5 ± 0.2, while measurements of the perimeter indicate that only half the irregularity is captured by ellipticity (Supplementary Fig. 9). Figure 2b highlights the structural difference between the ordered dot domains and the heterogeneous BCN alloy regions. The honeycomb pattern and uniform density of the atoms in the dots, correlated with their appearance at increased carbon enrichment, suggest that they are graphene dots. This is corroborated by direct measurement of the lattice periodicity within the dots, which is ~0.244 nm (Inset of Fig. 2b), in agreement with the value expected for graphene on Ir(111). More measurements of the lattice periodicity can be found in Supplementary Fig. 3. Moreover, the dots show a preferential alignment as illustrated in Fig. 2b. From Fig. 2c, d it appears that the dot array does not replace the brick-and-mortar structure; rather they coexist. In fact, the dots are generally found at the intersections of the mortar threads. This finding is not very surprising, considering that Lu et al.interpreted the mortar threads as being graphene nanoribbons. Thus, it is reasonable that the intersections between the threads would be preferential sites for further C segregation. Nevertheless, as illustrated in Fig. 2d, in some cases there is no dot (yellow arrows) or the dot is displaced (white arrow) from these intersection points. This suggests that the nanodot array is not a simple consequence of the brick-and-mortar pattern. Moreover, the graphene nanodots appear in the STM images with a different contrast than the mortar lines, suggesting a difference between the two structures. Indeed, in Fig. 2c, d, one can notice that, although the mortar lines look brighter than the surrounding BCN areas (that is, the bricks), yet they are neither as bright nor as uniform as the dots. This suggests a non-uniform chemical composition within the mortar structures, in contrast to the nanodots that appear to be pure graphene domains. Furthermore, we also note an increased apparent height at the interface between a graphene dot and the surrounding BCN area, as highlighted by the line profile in Fig. 2e. As we observe this effect only for particular scanning conditions, we ascribe it to electronic effects at the interface between the BCN domain and the pure phase dot.

### Deep learning for low-dose CT denoising using perceptual loss and edge detection layer [^c7964984]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Low-dose CT denoising is a challenging task that has been studied by many researchers. Some studies have used deep neural networks to improve the quality of low-dose CT images and achieved fruitful results. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network that uses dilated convolutions with different dilation rates instead of standard convolution helping to capture more contextual information in fewer layers. Also, we have employed residual learning by creating shortcut connections to transmit image information from the early layers to later ones. To further improve the performance of the network, we have introduced a non-trainable edge detection layer that extracts edges in horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. Finally, we demonstrate that optimizing the network by a combination of mean-square error loss and perceptual loss preserves many structural details in the CT image. This objective function does not suffer from over smoothing and blurring effects causing by per-pixel loss and grid-like artifacts resulting from perceptual loss. The experiments show that each modification to the network improves the outcome while changing the complexity of the network, minimally.

### Combinatorial summation of feynman diagrams [^42481276]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the 2DSU(N) Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.

### Privacy-preserving quality control of neuroimaging datasets in federated environments [^ed41075e]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

where n is the number of clusters. We can interpret this ratio as the following: the numerator indicates intra cluster distance, in which a smaller value shows that each distinct cluster is tightly bounded. A larger denominator value implies that the inter clusters are well separated from each other. Thus, if the α value is generally small, we can conclude that the algorithm performs well.
2. The intersection area can be seen as computing the overlap between two clusters. We first remove the outliers (see Figure 1) (Tony, Ming, & Zhi‐Hua,) to compute the convex hull for each group and use them to measure the overlap. For the intersection area, we find the area of each polytope(cluster) and find the total area by summing them. After that we compute the overlap area between each cluster. In specific, this is done by summing all of the polytope areas minus the area of the union of all the polytopes, normalized by the area of the union. The lower value of intersection area determines the formation of good cluster with less overlap.
Roundness is the ratio of the area of each polytope to the area of the circumscribed circle. To compute the roundness of each cluster, we first represent each cluster as a cloud with a convex hull. To remove the effect of the differences in perimeters, we normalize the perimeters. This normalization effectively approximates the process of making the perimeters equal. Finally, we compute the area of the polytope and use the area as our measure of roundness. The higher roundness metric value determines the good quality of the cluster. More precisely, it quantifies how the samples are distributed around the mean of a given cluster.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for amyloid PET imaging of the brain 1.0 [^e640d942]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Amyloid PET brain imaging — positive scan interpretation and regional patterns state that in patients with significant amounts of Aβ deposition in the brain, radiotracer uptake in gray matter blurs the distinction of the gray/white junction; a key feature for distinguishing Aβ 'positive' from 'negative' patients is loss of gray/white matter contrast with uptake extending to the edge of the cortex forming a smooth, regular boundary, and a convex outer surface may be outlined while gaps between the two hemispheres may no longer be defined or may appear as a thin regular line; abnormal uptake tends to be symmetrical, with most distinct accumulation in lateral temporal and frontal lobes, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and parietal lobes while the sensorimotor and visual cortex can be relatively spared; striatal uptake (notable in the caudate head) is often found and may be decisive in subjects with major cortical atrophy, and in hereditary forms of AD particularly intense striatal uptake has been described; the cerebellar cortex does not usually show uptake in the majority of amyloid-positive subjects, thus the cerebellum can generally be used as a reference region for visual as well as for semi-quantitative interpretation; an intermediate (or indeterminate) scan pattern may also be encountered and package inserts should be consulted for the number of affected cortical regions required to define a "positive" scan.

### Cognitive computational model reveals repetition bias in a sequential decision-making task [^bc693aa7]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Note that most studies that investigate the influence of repetition on value-based decisions use options with either fixed rewards (e.g. refs.), or fixed rewards combined with changing reward probabilities (e.g. refs.). In our task, through changing goals and grid layouts, we transparently vary the (relative) reward of the different options. With this, repeating an option throughout the task is not optimal. This results in a lower correlation between reward magnitude and behavioral repetition.

We selected these four trajectories to represent different principled trajectories that would make it difficult for participants to predict whether the DAS would remain optimal during the duration of a block. All four trajectories started out close to the expected points obtainable by the DAS so that the DAS was one of the best action sequences to select in the initial trials of a block. Only later into the block goals started to deviate from this initial value, or not. For example, one goal trajectory increased after half the block but then decreased again (trajectory ID 1, blue color) while another was remaining mostly close to points obtainable by the DAS (trajectory ID 4, red color).

With this procedure we effectively proposed an optimal sequence of actions at the first few trials of each block that was slowly devalued during subsequent trials. A repetition bias should manifest by increased DAS choices over the course of the experiment for the same expected rewards and should be detectable with summary statistics.

We subdivided the blocks into four segments of four blocks each (see Fig. 2 D). Within each segment all four trajectories of goals were used once in a pseudo-random order so that no trajectory was repeated in two consecutive blocks. This order of goal trajectories was the same for each participant.

To promote the use of the DAS, we manipulated three features of the task. First, at least the first two trials of each block had a trial-specific goal close to the points of the DAS (see Fig. 2 B). Overall, in 43.75% of all trials, the absolute difference between the trial goals and the expected points of the DAS was between zero and five points. Therefore, for these trials, due to the minimum difference of ten points between circles of different color, the DAS was one of the available action sequences with the highest expected reward. In the remaining trials, there was always at least one sequence with a higher expected reward than the DAS.

### A geometrical solution underlies general neural principle for serial ordering [^eb974788]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A general mathematical description of how the brain sequentially encodes knowledge remains elusive. We propose a linear solution for serial learning tasks, based on the concept of mixed selectivity in high-dimensional neural state spaces. In our framework, neural representations of items in a sequence are projected along a "geometric" mental line learned through classical conditioning. The model successfully solves serial position tasks and explains behaviors observed in humans and animals during transitive inference tasks amidst noisy sensory input and stochastic neural activity. This approach extends to recurrent neural networks performing motor decision tasks, where the same geometric mental line correlates with motor plans and modulates network activity according to the symbolic distance between items. Serial ordering is thus predicted to emerge as a monotonic mapping between sensory input and behavioral output, highlighting a possible pivotal role for motor-related associative cortices in transitive inference tasks.

### Rotating curved spacetime signatures from a giant quantum vortex [^809cd932]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Fig. 1
Side views of two distinct configurations of the giant quantum vortex.

a, At low propeller frequencies (here 1 Hz), the interface exhibits a discernible depression, and the vortex core beneath takes the form of a compact, polarized cluster of singly quantized vortices (called solid core). b, With the escalation of frequency (here to 2 Hz), a fully formed hollow core emerges, behaving like a multiply quantized object. Dark vertical stripes in the background provide contrast to the imaged interface. A simplified sketch of this interface (white lines) helps to identify these regimes in later figures. Scale bar, 10 mm.

The above limitations compelled us to propose an alternative, minimally invasive method to examine the vortex flow and extract macroscopic flow parameters that exploit the relative motion occurring between interface waves and the underlying velocity field. The corresponding dispersion relation for angular frequencies ω and wave vectors k readsin which F denotes the dispersion function. By solving equation (2), we find (see Methods) that the spectrum of interface modes gets frequency shifted and the velocity field can be inferred from these shifts. Therefore, we redirect our attention towards precise detection of small waves propagating on the superfluid interface.

### Nuclear fission modes and fragment mass asymmetries in a five-dimensional deformation space [^6c6f5020]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Nuclei undergoing fission can be described by a multi-dimensional potential-energy surface that guides the nuclear shape evolution — from the ground state, through intermediate saddle points and finally to the configurations of separated fission fragments. Until now, calculations have lacked adequate exploration of the shape parameterization of sufficient dimensionality to yield features in the potential-energy surface (such as multiple minima, valleys, saddle points and ridges) that correspond to characteristic observables of the fission process. Here we calculate and analyse five-dimensional potential-energy landscapes based on a grid of 2,610,885 deformation points. We find that observed fission features — such as the distributions of fission fragment mass and kinetic energy, and the different energy thresholds for symmetric and asymmetric fission — are very closely related to topological features in the calculated five-dimensional energy landscapes.

Development of cell substrates with controlled curvatures

We first set out to design substrates that would expose cells to a broad, yet controlled spectrum of curvatures. A complete description of surface curvature requires two independent curvature measures. The most common choices are either the two principal curvatures (i.e. the maximum and minimum curvatures, and, respectively), or the pair of the mean and Gaussian curvatures (Fig. 1a).

### Transition between distinct hybrid skyrmion textures through their hexagonal-to-square crystal transformation in a polar magnet [^c3d155b1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Magnetic skyrmions, topological vortex-like spin textures, garner significant interest due to their unique properties and potential applications in nanotechnology. While they typically form a hexagonal crystal with distinct internal magnetisation textures known as Bloch- or Néel-type, recent theories suggest the possibility for direct transitions between skyrmion crystals of different lattice structures and internal textures. To date however, experimental evidence for these potentially useful phenomena have remained scarce. Here, we discover the polar tetragonal magnet EuNiGe 3 to host two hybrid skyrmion phases, each with distinct internal textures characterised by anisotropic combinations of Bloch- and Néel-type windings. Variation of the magnetic field drives a direct transition between the two phases, with the modification of the hybrid texture concomitant with a hexagonal-to-square skyrmion crystal transformation. We explain these observations with a theory that includes the key ingredients of momentum-resolved Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions that compete at the observed low symmetry magnetic skyrmion crystal wavevectors. Our findings underscore the potential of polar magnets with rich interaction schemes as promising for discovering new topological magnetic phases.

Clustering of neuronal ensembles across sleep frame pairs

To determine if frames in sleep formed distinct clusters of patterned neuronal activity, the following procedure was adopted. A neuronal ensemble similarity score (n x n) matrix of frame pairs was constructed for each sleep with n frames. The diagonal of the matrix was zeroed. Subsequently, this matrix was transformed into a binary matrix with ones representing significantly correlated frame pairs (> 95 th percentile with respect to their shuffles) and zeros representing non-significant frame pairs. Next, 100 iterations of a k-means clustering algorithm with the cosine distance used as the dissimilarity metric was applied to each sleep. The number of clusters assigned to the k-means clustering algorithm were set between 2 and 30, based on preliminary exploratory analysis of the data from cuboid-reared rats (control group; we determined that our results were not impacted by the choice of k-means clustering range, on comparing the number of optimal detected clusters in the range 2 to 30 and the range 2 to 60). In each iteration, of the k-means algorithm, 2 to 30 clusters were found in the data and a metric of cluster isolation quality, the silhouette, was computed for each cluster.where a is the average distance between a cluster and its nearest cluster, while w is the average within cluster distance.

In each iteration, for all the assigned cluster numbers (2 to 30), the average silhouette value was computed. The assigned cluster number (2 to 30) with the highest average silhouette value in most iterations (the mode of the distribution) was selected as the optimal number of clusters in the data. Subsequently, the clustering iteration with the highest average silhouette value (for the modal, optimal number of clusters) was used for further analysis. The binarized neuronal ensemble similarity score matrix was re-sorted based on cluster identity to reveal distinct clusters.

Clustering of neuronal ensembles across sleep frame pairs for shuffled datasets

In order to determine, the number of clusters in shuffled sleeps, cell IDs were shuffled for the pyramidal cells' activity in frames and the neuronal ensemble similarity score computed for shuffled frame pairs. K-means clustering was performed on the shuffled frames using the same procedure as the real data. For this analysis, the assigned range of cluster numbers was set between 2 to 60 clusters (to limit potential saturation) and the cluster numbers in shuffled datasets of cuboid- and sphere-reared rats were compared with each other.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^5747a454]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Folded configurations of three triangulated hypar origami with different panel widths display invariant hypar geometry (same patterns as in Fig. 1). The three origami patterns have the same number of square creases (counted from the center outwards), denoted by n. Every other square crease is a mountain, and thus there are 10 mountain creases in total. Two panels on the both sides of a mountain crease are assigned the same width. All three concentrically pleated origami can fold approximately into the same hypar shape, as indicated by the red quadratic curves. a Standard hypar pattern: panel width d is a constant for all corrugations. b Functionally graded hypar pattern: panel width d increases as n increases. c Random hypar pattern: panel width d is a random variable for each corrugation. Since the hypar patterns are triangulated, folding is achieved by rigid origami simulation. The left images show the 3D views of the folded hypar origami. The middle images show the side views. The right images present quantitative measures. The blue dots (each dot corresponds to a mountain) in the charts show how (d / L) vanishes as n increases. The green dots show the residual (or error) of Eq. (2) when n is finite

Connecting geometry with mechanics

With an analytical description of the global homogenized geometry of the hypar pattern, we can associate the mechanical behavior of the pattern with its geometry by expressing the system energy in terms of the folding kinematics. First, let us consider how a hypar origami folds into a stable saddle shape. We start from a flat hypar pattern, and forcefully fold up the pattern. After the origami is folded into shape, the folding creases undergo inelastic deformation, which shifts the neutral (i.e. stress free) angles of the folding hinges from zero to the angles at a folded state with shape coefficient k = k 0 (see Eq. 10). However, the panels undergo elastic deformation, as we observe that they return to the initial flat configuration once cut out from a folded hypar origami. Thus, we assume that the bending hinges still have their neutral angles equal to zero, which corresponds to the state at k = 0. A stable configuration is drawn by minimizing the system total energy (E T).

### Dynamics of replication origin over-activation [^7666a4fd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To perform a detailed comparison of the frequency of initiation in nascent DNA derived from cells undergoing normal mitotic growth with that of MLN4924-treated, re-replicating cells, we used peak density plots created with BAMScale. This analysis allowed us to determine whether certain groups of replication origins are preferentially utilized during re-replication (Fig. 3c). Density plots represent peak sizes (number of reads/each peak) across the sample pairs. In such plots, similar replication initiation frequencies are reflected in similar peak sizes across the samples, with most peaks distributed along the diagonal (45 degrees dotted black lines in the diagrams shown in Fig. 3c). For example, a comparison the replication initiation frequencies in nascent DNA isolated during normal S-phase (HL DNA) in both untreated cells (control) and MLN4924 treated cells showed that most peaks were distributed along the diagonal, indicating similar peak sizes that correspond to similar initiation frequencies (Fig. 3c, left). By contrast, comparing replication initiation frequencies in nascent DNA isolated from aphidicolin treated cells with nascent DNA isolated from normally replicated cells (Fig. 3c, right) showed a distinct population of replication origins that exhibited a higher read per peak ratio in the aphidicolin sample, corresponding to activated dormant origins. When we compared re-replicated (HH) nascent strands from MLN4924-treated cells with nascent strands that were not re-replicated (HL), we did not observe a distinct population of activated dormant origins (Fig. 3c, middle panel). These observations suggested that although fiber analyses have shown a higher frequency of initiation in re-replicating cells, dormant origins were not overwhelmingly activated.

### Spiral packing and chiral selectivity in model membranes probed by phase-resolved sum-frequency generation microscopy [^54e9432c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

All the details about the distribution of molecular orientations are contained within the phase image, however, translating it into a clear structural picture requires additional analysis. In the first step, the molecular directions are extracted for selected regions and displayed as in-plane arrows, as shown in Fig. 4c (left side) for an exemplary domain. From this representation, it becomes immediately clear that the lipid packing is, indeed, curved. Since the absolute molecular orientations are obtained in these measurements, the curvature direction can be unambiguously determined as clockwise (CW) for the defined molecular axis.

To evaluate if there are any higher order hierarchal structural symmetries in these domains the phase contour lines connecting locations of equal molecular orientation can be analysed. The left side of Fig. 4d shows a schematic of four possible CW curved arrangements, including both molecular direction arrows and the corresponding phase contours. Each structure creates characteristic contour line patterns (parallel, radial, or spiral with either positive or negative curvature directions) which can be used for their identification. Comparison to the contour lines extracted for the exemplary domain (also shown in Fig. 4c, left side) suggests that the mesoscopic structure of the domains is an outer subsection of a CW (+)-spiral. The formed domains thus possess a superposition of two types of curvature, namely the turning direction of molecules about the spiral centre, and the curvature of the spiral itself.

Numbers and sizes of loops at distinct sequence depths and resolutions

To examine the influence of sequence depths on the numbers and sizes of loops, we loop called for decreased amounts (3/4 and 1/2) of whole Control and KO datasets of Biological replicate 1 (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The number of loops decreased accordingly at nearly equal rates both in Control and KO datasets with decreasing sequence depths. The sizes of loops somewhat decreased at lower sequence depths. We also presented the numbers and sizes of loops called independently at the three resolutions, e.g. 5, 10 and, 25 kb (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 4). More KO loops were detected at finer resolution than Control loops, which likely reflects the overall increase of contact frequencies in KO cells than Control. We observed certain variations in the numbers and sizes of loops detected at the distinct resolutions. The largest number and average sizes of loops were detected at 25 kb resolution. This is likely due to the fact that at relatively shallow mapped depth like ours, large bin size (coarse resolution) is required to detect loops. The largest average loop size at 25 kb resolution may be simply due to the largest number of loops detected at this resolution, e.g. if more loops are detected, more large loops are likely to be included. Then we consider this size variation largely computational, although it may involve in part biological and/or influence of HiC experimental and sequencing protocols.

Computation of insulation score

The insulation scoreswere computed by adding up normalized contact frequencies in a sliding window of 1 Mb aligned to the HiC matrix diagonal.

Computation of eigenvector

Suppose M is an intrachromosomal normalized contact matrix of n × n size, and X(i, j) is correlation between columns i and j of M (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n). A principal component analysis is performed on the correlation matrix, X. The eigenvector computed by juicer is the first eigenvector (principal component) of X, corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. The ± sign of an eigenvector value is arbitrarily given on each chromosome, then the sign is to be flipped according to the level of contact enrichment in a locus of the chromosome.

### GraphDDP: a graph-embedding approach to detect differentiation pathways in single-cell-data using prior class knowledge [^24719ef2]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Layout algorithm

The procedure we described yields an unweighted instance graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of vertices (one per cell profile) and E is the set of edges or selected pairwise relations between cell profiles. Before the layout phase we assign a desired length to each edge proportional to a desired distance between its endpoints i and j. We then use a force directed layout algorithm to determine the optimal position of each vertex (see Fig. 1e, f). Here we use the algorithm from(KK) to obtain a layout that can accommodate the specified edge lengths.

In detail, we model our data set as a dynamic system of particles, with coordinates v i = (x i, y i) ∈, mutually connected to each other by springs of strength k ij. We seek the layout that minimizes the total energy of the system:where d ij is the desired distance between i and j defined as the length of the shortest path between i and j on G (which can be readily computed using the Dijkstra's algorithm). The spring strength is defined as k ij = with constant K. The computation of the optimal layout is based on the observation that the necessary conditions for a local minimum are that = = 0 for 1 ≤ m ≤ n. However this yields 2 n simultaneous non-linear equations that are not independent. The authors suggest to adopt an iterative approximation scheme where only one particle m at a time is moved to its stable point while all other particles positions are frozen. This allows to use a two dimensional Newton-Raphson method to minimize E as a function of only x m, y m. Each time the particle with the largest contribution to the energy of the system is chosen, i.e. arg max m Δ m where Δ m = . The starting position is not critical and all particles are hence initially placed on a regular n -polygon. Each selected particle m iteratively updates its position x m, y m as: = = for t = 0, 1,… where the increments are computed by satisfying the following linear equations:The coefficients for these equations can be computed in close form starting from the total energy of the system and taking the required derivatives with respect to x m and y m. The algorithm terminates when Δ m becomes sufficiently small.

### Exploration of crystal chemical space using text-guided generative artificial intelligence [^fae8b849]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Using Chemeleon, 549 TiO₂ potential polymorphs, distinct from the known structures were sampled with compositions ranging in multiplicity from 1 to 13. Following preliminary geometry optimization using MACE-MP, 539 of these structures successfully converged. To compare the generated polymorphs with the known ones, we constructed a t-SNE plot based on their structural embeddings derived from CrystalNN fingerprints, as shown in Fig. 4d. The names of entries for all known materials are displayed in Supplementary Fig. S7. It is worth highlighting that the generated polymorphs, depicted as light grey points on the plot, not only encompass most known polymorphs but also occupy previously unexplored regions of the structural space.

Certain known polymorphs presented in Fig. 4d, such as structure I (mp-1102591), II (mp-1079207), and III (mp-655656) are positioned in regions not covered by the sampled structures. These were absent from the training set due to their high energy above the convex hull; a filter of 0.25 eV/atom was used to favour the generation of energetically favourable configurations. Indeed, most of the structures generated by Chemeleon exhibit energies below 0.15 eV/atom above the convex hull, according to MACE-MP as shown in Supplementary Fig. S8. The entry mp-1102591 consists of densely packed TiO₂ octahedra in a cubic symmetry, while mp-1079207 features sevenfold coordinated Ti with hexagonal symmetry. Lastly, mp-655656 features a square pyramidal coordination of Ti, typically seen in TiO. However, the layers in this structure are spaced far apart, making it difficult for the generative model to sample.

### LINE-1 ORF1p mimics viral innate immune evasion mechanisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^ba266753]. Cancer Discovery (2025). Medium credibility.

For LINE-1 ORF1p IHC area quantification in mouse xenografts, HALO Area Quantification module v.2.4.3 was used to determine the proportion of annotated tumor area positive for LINE-1 ORF1p. Color deconvolution of hematoxylin and chromogen stains as well as thresholds for LINE-1 ORF1p positivity were manually validated in each image. For EMT dual RNA-ISH cell enumeration, HALO AI DenseNet convolutional neural network classifiers were trained to distinguish tumor glands from stroma within the annotated tumor regions for each stain. HALO Multiplex IHC module v.3.4.9 was optimized to quantify the EMT dual ISH stain. The IHC stains were quantified with HALO Multiplex IHC module v.3.1.4. Cells were segmented based on the hematoxylin color-deconvolved image component. Marker positivity was determined based on signal intensity and area coverage within the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the color-deconvolved image component for each chromogen. Cell phenotypes were also defined using multiple markers (EMT dual ISH: Epi + QM +, Epi + QM −, and Epi − QM +). This quantification was performed within the tumor gland–classified regions. Data tables containing cell phenotype, signal intensities, and area analyzed were exported for statistical analyses. For tumor heterogeneity using hexagon tessellation, to test whether NTC versus ORF1 tumor samples had distinct differences in EMT expression, an approach was used that quantified EMT cell phenotypes within individual tiles of a hexagon tessellation overlaid on the annotated tumor region. Output object data from HALO segmentation analysis, which contain the bounding box coordinates of each cell, were converted to the cell center in micron coordinate space (0.268 microns/pixel). A hexagon tessellation, with side length of 50 microns, was then created using the R sf package. Tiles that did not contain any cells were excluded. Plots of the hexagon tiling for each sample were generated for visual inspection. Cell phenotypes (Epi + QM −, Epi + QM +, and Epi − QM +) and total number of cells were enumerated within each hexagon tile. Finally, cell phenotypes, normalized by the total number of cells in each tile, were compared for NTC and ORF1 groups using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For Masson trichrome area quantification, a HALO AI DenseNet classifier was trained to discriminate collagen-rich regions from tumor cells and subsequently determine their area proportions in each image. For multiplex ISH combined with PanCK-positive cell enumeration, cell segmentation and phenotyping were performed within annotated tumor regions using the HALO FISH-IF module v2.2.5. Nuclear detection was performed using the default AI nuclear segmentation algorithm based on the DAPI channel. Cells were categorized as PanCK + based on the channel's signal intensity within the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The positivity of ISH channels was determined based on signal intensity and dot size within a cell, with brighter and larger dots having more weight. The autofluorescence channel was employed as an exclusion marker to reduce false positives from folds, debris, and necrotic regions. Cell phenotypes were also defined using multiple marker criteria (e.g. PanCK + INFLAMED +, ACTA2 +, and Il6 +). Marker positivity thresholds were manually validated for cell phenotyping quality in each sample. HALO and HALO AI versions used were HALO v3.6.4134.137 and HALO AI 3.6.4134.

Finally, for the test dataset, differences in image features between misclassified and correctly classified images were analyzed by labels (Table 5). The results showed that for converters, misclassified images exhibited smaller absolute differences from the reference values in the number of lines detected in horizontal and diagonal directions, as well as in the number of vertices, compared to correctly classified images. Misclassified images also exhibited longer horizontal and vertical lines, shorter diagonal lines, and smaller variances in line lengths within each line type (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). Additionally, misclassified images had smaller averages and variances in angle differences among vertical and diagonal lines. Regarding global features, misclassified images had higher matching scores, lower PatchCore scores, and fewer reconstruction errors. For handwriting pressure features, misclassified images exhibited higher mean thickness, lower variance in thickness, and higher foreground ratios.

### Theoretical analysis of the effects of noise on diffusion tensor imaging [^404551d7]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A theoretical framework is presented for understanding the effects of noise on estimates of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios. Image noise produces a random perturbation of the diffusion tensor. Power series solutions to the eigenvalue equation are used to evaluate the effects of the perturbation to second order. It is shown that in anisotropic systems the expectation value of the largest eigenvalue is overestimated and the lowest eigenvalue is underestimated. Hence, diffusion anisotropy is overestimated in general. This result is independent of eigenvalue sorting bias. Furthermore, averaging eigenvalues over a region of interest produces greater bias than averaging tensors prior to diagonalization. Finally, eigenvector noise is shown to depend on the eigenvalue contrast and imposes a theoretical limit on the accuracy of simple fiber tracking schemes. The theoretical results are shown to agree with Monte Carlo simulations.

### Phase nucleation in curved space [^e8324386]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Nucleation and growth is the dominant relaxation mechanism driving first-order phase transitions. In two-dimensional flat systems, nucleation has been applied to a wide range of problems in physics, chemistry and biology. Here we study nucleation and growth of two-dimensional phases lying on curved surfaces and show that curvature modifies both critical sizes of nuclei and paths towards the equilibrium phase. In curved space, nucleation and growth becomes inherently inhomogeneous and critical nuclei form faster on regions of positive Gaussian curvature. Substrates of varying shape display complex energy landscapes with several geometry-induced local minima, where initially propagating nuclei become stabilized and trapped by the underlying curvature.
