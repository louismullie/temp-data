## Question

A 48-year-old woman with a 2-year history of primary Sjögren's disease presents to your clinic complaining of persistent gritty sensation and burning in both eyes. She reports that her symptoms have gradually worsened over the past 6 months. On examination, there is evidence of conjunctival injection and reduced tear meniscus. She has not previously used any specific treatment for her ocular symptoms.

Based on current EULAR guidelines, what is the most appropriate initial management for this patient's ocular symptoms? If her symptoms do not improve with this approach, what would be the next recommended step?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate initial management for ocular symptoms in a 48-year-old woman with primary Sjögren's disease, and what the next recommended step should be if symptoms do not improve with that approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of dry eye disease in primary Sjögren's. Then, I should verify the EULAR 2020 first-line recommendation for ocular dryness. Next, I will consider practical implementation details such as preservative-free formulations and dosing frequency. After that, I need to check what to do if symptoms persist despite optimized lubrication, including anti-inflammatory options and when to escalate to serum tears. Finally, I should confirm safety considerations, follow-up, and when to involve ophthalmology or consider systemic therapy if ocular surface inflammation remains refractory.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity. Primary Sjögren's disease causes aqueous-deficient dry eye with chronic ocular surface inflammation; conjunctival injection and a reduced tear meniscus align with moderate severity and suggest a need for structured therapy beyond occasional drops, especially with progressive symptoms over 6 months [^e13384f8] [^3b27c326].

> I should confirm the EULAR 2020 first-line recommendation. EULAR explicitly recommends artificial tears and ocular gels/ointments as first-line therapy for ocular dryness in Sjögren's, which applies directly to this patient's keratoconjunctivitis sicca without prior treatment [^c8c1e5c2] [^1a68a775].

> Wait, let me verify formulation and dosing details because these materially affect outcomes. Preservative-free lubricants are preferred to avoid detergent and proinflammatory effects of preservatives, and BSR 2025 advises regular use about every 2–3 hours during the day, with gels or ointments at night to reduce nocturnal exposure and morning discomfort; this cadence is supported by evidence that preservative-free drops improve symptoms and that frequent dosing is often necessary in aqueous-deficient states [^a4cfe2d8] [^9913a6b0] [^ff652d54].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about escalation before optimizing basics. I need to ensure adherence, proper technique, and environmental modifications are addressed, and I should reassess after 4–6 weeks of consistent therapy; if symptoms persist despite optimized lubrication, EULAR recommends considering ocular immunosuppressants and autologous serum eye drops for refractory or severe ocular dryness, which fits this scenario of ongoing grittiness and burning with inflammatory signs [^13552396] [^e4300687].

> Let me consider anti-inflammatory options next. Topical cyclosporine 0.05% is a reasonable next step under ophthalmic supervision; evidence shows modest improvements in symptoms and signs in dry eye populations, though RCTs specific to primary Sjögren's are limited and mixed, so expectations should be calibrated and therapy individualized with close follow-up for tolerability and response [^c74d4e28] [^658edaaf] [^debfe0f6].

> I should double-check the role of autologous serum tears. If inflammation persists despite cyclosporine or if cyclosporine is not tolerated, autologous serum drops are supported by EULAR and BSR for refractory cases; systematic reviews suggest improvements in patient-reported outcomes and corneal staining, though access and regulatory constraints vary and require coordination with ophthalmology [^13552396] [^54374940] [^490e2e2d].

> But wait, what if there is persistent corneal staining or significant ocular surface disease despite these measures? Short-course topical corticosteroids under ophthalmic supervision can be considered for flares or persistent inflammation, typically limited to 2–4 weeks to mitigate risks of cataract and intraocular pressure elevation; this is supported by BSR and aligns with cautious, time-limited use in inflammatory dry eye [^1d0beefb] [^5a0a670c] [^af308b14].

> I need to ensure I am not overlooking systemic contributors. If ocular surface inflammation remains refractory despite optimized topical therapy, or if there is concomitant systemic disease activity, EULAR supports considering B-cell targeted therapy such as rituximab in selected patients with severe, refractory systemic disease; however, large RCTs have not shown consistent benefit for sicca endpoints, so this should be reserved for carefully selected cases after multidisciplinary review and shared decision-making [^1a735057] [^b10126de] [^0abcf20a].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety. Re-evaluation at 4–6 weeks to assess symptom burden, corneal staining, tear breakup time, and tear meniscus helps guide escalation; throughout, I should monitor for preservative toxicity, contact lens intolerance, and environmental exacerbations, and coordinate with ophthalmology for advanced diagnostics and procedural options if disease progresses or vision is threatened [^e13384f8] [^8f0b38bb].

> Putting this together, my initial management is to initiate preservative-free artificial tears every 2–3 hours during the day and a lubricating gel or ointment at bedtime, with counseling on technique and adherence. If symptoms persist after 4–6 weeks of optimized lubrication, I would escalate to topical cyclosporine 0.05% twice daily under ophthalmic supervision, and if still refractory, consider autologous serum tears or a short, closely monitored course of topical corticosteroids, reserving systemic B-cell targeted therapy for severe, refractory cases with systemic involvement after multidisciplinary review [^c8c1e5c2] [^a4cfe2d8] [^13552396] [^1a735057].

---

The most appropriate initial management for ocular symptoms in primary Sjögren's disease is **preservative-free artificial tears** [^c8c1e5c2] applied regularly (about every 2–3 hours) [^a4cfe2d8] during the day, with nighttime gels or ointments to reduce nocturnal dryness [^c8c1e5c2]. If symptoms persist despite optimized lubrication, the next step is to add **topical cyclosporine 0.05%** [^e4300687] twice daily under ophthalmic supervision [^debfe0f6], as it reduces ocular surface inflammation and improves tear production [^c74d4e28]. If inflammation remains refractory, consider short-term topical corticosteroids [^1d0beefb] or autologous serum tears [^13552396] [^54374940], and reserve punctal plugs for carefully selected cases [^1f8baf30] [^9fbb15bc].

---

## Initial management: preservative-free artificial tears

- **First-line therapy**: EULAR recommends artificial tears and ocular gels/ointments as first-line therapy for ocular dryness in Sjögren's disease [^c8c1e5c2] [^1a68a775].

- **Formulation**: Preservative-free formulations are preferred to avoid preservative-induced toxicity and irritation, especially with frequent use [^ff652d54].

- **Frequency**: Regular use every 2–3 hours during the day is advised, with nighttime gels or ointments to maintain moisture [^a4cfe2d8] [^9913a6b0].

- **Evidence**: Artificial tears consistently improve ocular symptoms and are safe for long-term use [^af308b14].

---

## Adjunctive measures

- **Environmental modifications**: Use humidifiers, avoid direct airflow, and protect eyes from wind and dust [^b1951b20].

- **Lid hygiene**: Daily warm compresses and lid margin hygiene can reduce evaporative tear loss if meibomian gland dysfunction is present [^7095abca].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence and proper instillation technique to maximize benefit [^d44d3c45].

---

## Next step if symptoms persist: topical cyclosporine

If symptoms persist despite optimized lubrication, **topical cyclosporine 0.05%** [^e4300687] twice daily is the next recommended step [^debfe0f6]. Cyclosporine reduces ocular surface inflammation, increases tear production, and improves symptoms and signs in moderate-to-severe dry eye, including Sjögren's-related disease [^c74d4e28] [^658edaaf]. Common adverse effects include transient burning or stinging; monitor for tolerability and adherence [^c74d4e28].

---

## Escalation for refractory symptoms

If inflammation persists despite cyclosporine, consider the following:

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Short-term topical corticosteroids | Persistent inflammation despite maximal lubrication and cyclosporine | Strong recommendation, ophthalmic supervision required [^1d0beefb] [^5a0a670c] |
| Autologous serum tears | Refractory severe ocular dryness | Strong recommendation, specialized centers [^13552396] [^54374940] |
| Punctal plugs | Carefully selected patients; may worsen inflammation in some | Conditional recommendation, ophthalmic supervision [^1f8baf30] [^9fbb15bc] |

---

## Systemic considerations

Systemic therapies (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, rituximab) are **not indicated for isolated ocular dryness** [^ee475073] [^b10126de] and should be reserved for significant systemic disease activity or refractory extraglandular manifestations [^1a735057] [^1a768ab1].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular ophthalmic follow-up is essential to assess response, monitor for complications, and adjust therapy. Key assessments include symptom burden, corneal staining, tear break-up time, and ocular surface disease index [^e13384f8] [^311faf7d].

---

The most appropriate initial management is **preservative-free artificial tears** [^c8c1e5c2] with regular daytime use and nighttime gels or ointments. If symptoms persist, add **topical cyclosporine 0.05%** [^e4300687] twice daily under ophthalmic supervision [^debfe0f6]. Escalate to short-term topical corticosteroids or autologous serum tears for refractory inflammation, and reserve punctal plugs for selected cases [^13552396] [^1f8baf30].

### Advances, limitations and future perspectives in the diagnosis and management of dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome [^3b27c326]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome is a complex systemic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects exocrine glands such as the lacrimal glands. Dry eye disease is one of the most prevalent complications of Sjögren's syndrome, affecting most patients. It significantly impairs quality of life and management is often difficult and unsatisfactory, in part due to weak correlation between symptoms and signs and poor recognition of the three main subtypes aqueous-deficient, evaporative and neuropathic dry eye. This review provides an overview of key aspects of dry eye disease, such as its multifactorial aetiology and recent insights into pathophysiology. The uses and pitfalls of commonly-used diagnostic tests for dry eye are reviewed, as well as the increasing number of new imaging technologies and biomarkers to refine diagnosis. There are many current and emerging treatment options for dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome, but high-level evidence of efficacy is mostly lacking, as are evidence-based treatment algorithms. All these aspects make the management of dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome challenging.

### Expert perspective: challenges in Sjögren's disease [^63dfe3ec]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The management of Sjögren's disease is challenging because of several factors. Indeed, the clinical presentations are heterogeneous, and one must be able to identify prognostic markers to adapt the follow-up. In addition, there is no validated treatment. Nevertheless, international experts have been working for several years to establish recommendations to guide management. Since research in this field is extremely active, we anticipate the development of effective treatments for our patients in the near future.

### Current and future therapies for primary Sjögren syndrome [^0abcf20a]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by a triad of symptoms that affect all patients (dryness, pain and fatigue). In addition, systemic involvement can affect between one-third and one-half of patients. The management of patients with pSS has been negatively affected by a lack of effective treatments; however, knowledge of the epidemiology of pSS has increased, and advances in developing classification criteria, systemic disease activity scoring and patient-reported outcomes have been made during the past decade. Progress has also been made in understanding the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of pSS, which has enabled a more targeted therapeutic approach to be taken. At present, therapeutic decisions rely on the evaluation of symptoms and systemic manifestations and are mostly formed on the basis of experience rather than evidence, and on similarities with other autoimmune diseases, although the 2019 management recommendations from EULAR are now being used to inform clinical management of pSS. This Review summarizes the available evidence for systemic treatments for pSS and includes discussions of advances in outcome assessment, the current evidence for DMARD use and an overview of promising future therapeutics.

Introduction

Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS), a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease, has no cure. Although it was identified as a disease more than a century ago,the therapeutic management has not changed significantly in recent decades.The specific pathogenic basis of a disease that targets the exocrine glands has led to a very specific type of therapy (agents locally applied to the mucosal surfaces involved) as one of the key approaches. In contrast, the systemic element of SjS has traditionally been tackled using glucocorticoids (GCs) and immunosuppressive agents, due to their use in similar systemic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis.

During the first decade of this century, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of muscarinic agents and topical cyclosporine A (CyA) for oral and ocular dryness in SjS patients, respectively, and the first studies testing biological agents were considered the first signs of a new, game-changing therapeutic scenario for primary SjS patients. Despite this, the first specific systematic literature review (SLR) of SjS therapy, published in 2010, found that evidence remained very limited, without solid results that could change the disease management.Since 2010, there have been significant advances, including the accurate characterisation and scoring of the disease burden,the patient-centred therapeutic responseand the publication of large, well-designed therapeutic studies.

The aim of this review was to inform the new EULAR recommendations on the current state of evidence on the efficacy and safety of the main topical and systemic therapies used in SjS.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^22474ef1]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and rationale for guideline development

Sjögren disease (SD) is a chronic, auto-immune disease of unknown aetiology with significant impact on quality of life (QoL). Although dryness (sicca) of the eyes and mouth are the classically described features, dryness of other mucosal surfaces and systemic manifestations are common. The key management aim should be to empower the individuals to manage their condition; conserving, replacing and stimulating secretions; preventing damage and suppressing systemic disease activity.

This guideline builds on, and widens the recommendations developed for the first guideline published in 2017. We have included advice on the management of children and adolescents where appropriate to provide a comprehensive guideline for UK-based rheumatology teams.

State of the art on CPGs

The flow diagram adapted from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement for the identification of EBM CPGs on SS is represented in figure 1. Systematic database search identified 742 records that together with 35 records retrieved through manual search led to a total of 777 references for screening. Title and abstract screening was then conducted by HCP representatives, excluding 696 records. A total of 81 articles were eligible for full text assessment, of which 68 were excluded. Main reasons for exclusion included articles not related to SS (ie, wrong patients’ population) and article type other than guidelines (ie, original research or review manuscripts). A few articles were recommendations not supported by SLR, which were thus not EBM CPGs, the main focus of the present work. Finally, six papers were excluded as duplicates. In the end, seven articles were identified as EBM CPGs and included for further analysis.

The major topics of the included CPGs are summarised in table 1. We found high-quality EBM up-to-date guidelines on diagnosis (specifically addressing four extraglandular domains) and treatment/management (both of glandular and extraglandular manifestationsthat have all been recently published in the last 3 years by European (European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) SS task force; UK), American (USA) and Latin American (Brazil) societies/organisations. All of these presented high-quality methodology, were based on a thorough SLR and presented in a clear, appropriate way, with adequate, comprehensive recommendations relevant for clinical practice. Three other guidelines provided important information on early diagnosis of SSor management of dryness,and were evaluated as being of good overall quality, although in some instances based on a less robust methodological process. Of note, most of the analysed recommendations were often based on expert opinion, rather than solid evidence, considering the lack of high-quality studies that is seen in a number of areas of interest in SS.

With respect to AS and plug insertion, in addition to the very limited evidence available for primary-2002 patients, the two Cochrane SLRs found significant limitations in the quality of trials (incomplete descriptive statistics for reported treatment outcomes, sample sizes with too few participants, quasi-randomisation methods, complete masking may not have been feasible, short-term evaluation of efficacy, lack of details on adverse outcomes and tolerance). For AS, the Cochrane SLR concluded that current evidence suggests that 20% AS might provide some benefit in improving patient-reported symptoms over the short term (2 weeks), but longer periods of follow-up provide no evidence of improvement over longer periods, while no clear effects were found for objective clinical measures of the ocular surface. For punctal occlusion, the certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low (frequently downgrading the level of evidence due to the high RoB or imprecision in effect estimates), and it was concluded that current evidence suggests that punctal plugs are a modestly effective means of treating dry eye. For all these reasons, the use of AS and plugs in primary SjS has been considered as a rescue therapeutic option, always under prescription by an ophthalmologist. A combination of AS and plugs has recently been evaluatedin 28 SjS patients (primary and associated, criteria not detailed). Ophthalmologists play a key role in prescribing topical and systemic therapies for ocular dryness, always with a close multidisciplinary follow-up.

Summary

What was known before

In those patients with Primary Sjogren’s Syndrome the symptoms of dry eye disease have a significant degrading effect on health and vision related quality of life.
Often, the available dry eye disease treatment options for these patients are reactive and fail to provide long-term relief or a cure.

What this study adds

When managing Primary Sjogren’s Syndrome clinicians should be aware and considerate of impact of dry eye disease symptoms on patient’s health and vision related quality of life.
Clinical signs noted on slit lamp examination do not align with symptoms.
Thus, ophthalmologist should rely more on patient reported outcomes and visual acuity when treating patients with Primary Sjogren’s Syndrome related dry eye disease.
Treatment should be adjusted in accordance with patient reported perceptions.

Abstract

Sjögren disease (SD) is a chronic, autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology with significant impact on quality of life. Although dryness (sicca) of the eyes and mouth are the classically described features, dryness of other mucosal surfaces and systemic manifestations are common. The key management aim should be to empower the individual to manage their condition—conserving, replacing and stimulating secretions; and preventing damage and suppressing systemic disease activity. This guideline builds on and widens the recommendations developed for the first guideline published in 2017. We have included advice on the management of children and adolescents where appropriate to provide a comprehensive guideline for UK-based rheumatology teams.

Hydroxychloroquine

We identified 12 studies that assessed hydroxychloroquine in SjS patients, with only 4 (2 prospective and 2 RCTs) carried out in primary-2002 patients. Yavuz et al prospectively enrolled 32 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine for at least 2 years (no data on mean length or cumulative dose) and reported, in a further 12-week control study, a significant improvement in four out of eight ocular outcomes with respect to baseline, with no information on concomitant ocular therapies. Çankaya et al prospectively evaluated 30 women who started on 400 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine and reported a significant improvement in uSF rate (0.212 vs 0.162 baseline, p<0.05) but not stimulated salivary flow rate at 30 weeks, with improvement in only two of the five subjective oral VAS scores. Yoon et al carried out a small RCT in 26 patients and found no significant differences in dry eye in comparison with PLA, but with no definition of the primary outcome.The pivotal RCT was carried out by Gottenberg et al in 120 patients with primary-2002 SjS who were randomised to receive 400 mg/day of hydroxychloroquine (n=56) or PLA (n=64): the primary outcome was defined as a ≥30% reduction in two out of three VAS scores—dryness, fatigue, pain—without significant PLA differences at week 24 (17.6% vs 17.3%, p=0.96). For one of the secondary outcomes, hydroxychloroquine was associated with a statistical trend to improved pain (p values between 0.06 and 0.10 at 12, 24 and 48 weeks) although it was not superior to PLA for articular involvement; with respect to fatigue, no statistical differences were found.No cases of retinal toxicity or severe adverse events were reported in any of these studies.

Methods

A MEDLINE SLR was carried out by PB-Z and SR using the MeSH term ‘Sjögren’s syndrome’ combined with each therapeutic intervention proposed by the Task Force (see ‘Intervention’ section of the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study design (PICOS) strategy) with the following restrictions: date (1 January 1986 to 31 December 2017), studies (humans) and age (adults). Additional databases, such as EMBASE and Cochrane Central Library, were also checked. The SLR strategy followed prespecific PICOS definitions agreed by the Steering Committee members: (a) Population: in order to collect evidence from an aetiopathogenically homogeneous population, data was retrieved from studies including adult primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria (stated in the manuscript as ‘primary-2002’ patients) or the 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria; (b) Intervention: using the data from a 2010 SLR as a starting point,interventions were classified as topical or systemic medications; (c) Comparison: therapeutic interventions were compared with placebo (PLA) or other therapeutic interventions; (d) Outcomes: eligible studies had to contain sufficient, clear information on the effect of the therapeutic intervention (efficacy) and on the safety profile; (e) Study design: we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies (prospective non-PLA-controlled, non-randomised studies and those with quasi-experimental designs), case-control studies (comparing therapeutic options) and meta-analyses, according to the definitions proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM),while case series (descriptive/retrospective therapeutic studies) were considered in the absence of other studies; narrative reviews, experimental animal studies, duplicate publications and isolated case reports were excluded. In the absence of evidence on the target population, extrapolation of results from studies including SjS populations that differed from the definition in the PICOS strategy was allowed. Figure 1 summarises the SLR results. Summary-of-finding tables were generated for RCTs (table 1),prospective cohort studies (table 2)and case-control studies (table 3).For RCTs, the risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB assessment tool (Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions V.5.1.0 March 2011 (available from:)), and for uncontrolled studies, we used the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement checklist. The few RCTs available for each therapeutic intervention, together with the heterogeneity in the methodology of the studies included, such as differing participant characteristics, comparative interventions, the small size of the populations studied and the differences in follow-up intervals and outcomes measured, make it impossible to pool data in a meta-analysis.

Sjögren’s syndrome—epidemiology and comanagement: Among patients with clinically significant dry eye, about 10% have an underlying Sjögren’s syndrome, and reported population metrics include prevalence approximately 0.4%, annual incidence 5.3 per 100,000 with prevalence 92.8 per 100,000 and a female-to-male ratio of 20:1, and an annual incidence of primary Sjögren’s syndrome of 3.9 per 100,000. Patients with Sjögren’s syndrome, whether or not they have secondary autoimmune disease, should be comanaged with a rheumatologist; ocular manifestations may include scleritis, sterile keratitis, and uveitis, and decreased C4 at diagnosis has been associated with a higher risk of developing lymphoma.

### Sjögren's syndrome: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^933dbcb3]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In the last years, a number of good quality EBM recommendations on diagnosis and management of SS have been published by national and international organisations. Importantly, patients have been taking an active role and joining clinicians to develop CPGs and define important areas of future research and unmet needs.

However, there is still a need for robust studies addressing several key aspects of SS diagnosis and treatment to serve as basis for high-quality EBM guidelines, which should be implemented across Europe and updated regularly. There is a major gap concerning specific therapies, predictors and biomarkers for SS that may contribute to significantly improve the outcome of patients affected by this disease.

Initiatives such as the present one, involving patients and experts in multicentre consortiums, contribute to raising awareness for complex diseases such as SS and to defining key areas of development, ultimately leading to improved patient care.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^75941664]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current evidence on the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome (SjS) to inform European League Against Rheumatism treatment recommendations.

Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for case-control/prospective cohort studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews.

Results

Current evidence in primary SjS patients fulfilling the 2002 criteria is based on the data from 9 RCTs, 18 prospective cohort studies and 5 case-control studies. Two Cochrane systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have reported that topical treatments for dry mouth and dry eye are safe and effective. Ocular cyclosporine A was safe and effective in two RCTs including 1039 patients with dry eye syndrome. Two Cochrane SLRs on serum tear drops and plugs showed inconsistency in possible benefits, both for symptoms and objective measures. Five RCTs reported significant improvements in oral dryness and salivary flow rates for pilocarpine and cevimeline. An RCT showed no significant placebo-differences for hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for the primary outcome (visual analogue scale (VAS) composite of dryness, fatigue and pain). We identified seven RCTs carried out in primary SjS patients. RCTs using infliximab, anakinra and baminercept found no placebo-differences for the primary outcomes. The two largest RCTs randomised 255 patients to receive rituximab or placebo and reported no significant results in the primary outcome (VAS composite), while prospective studies suggested efficacy in systemic disease.

Conclusion

The current evidence supporting the use of the main topical therapeutic options of primary SjS is solid, while limited data from RCTs are available to guide systemic therapies.

Two papers arising from the patient organisation Sjögren’s Syndrome Foundation (SSF) effort of developing CPG for SS, approach the management of specific ocularand oraldryness and its complications. Foulks et al provide a broad review of the evaluation (symptoms and signs/tests of tear function) and treatment (topical/systemic treatments and other approaches) of SS-associated dry eye and emit recommendations on these areas, including a treatment algorithm based on severity level and response to therapy.Zero et al developed EBM recommendations for patients with SS who were with dry mouth, specifically focusing on caries prevention measures.

Treatment of dryness, fatigue and systemic involvement has been addressed in three different sets of high-quality recommendations proposed by European (UK),North American (SSF)and South American (Brazil)organisations. As part of the SSF initiative mentioned above, Carsons et al have systematically reviewed available literature and proposed treatment recommendations in three specific areas: biological therapy for sicca and systemic manifestations; management of fatigue and use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) for inflammatory musculoskeletal pain.Valim et al developed treatment guidelines, sponsored by the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology, covering a broad range of topics: general and patient education measures, including references on exercise, vaccination and vitamin D supplementation; symptomatic management of dryness (oral, ocular and other); systemic treatment of glandular and extraglandular manifestations, including csDMARDs and biologics, and treatment according to organ-specific involvement.The British Society of Rheumatology has also recently produced National Institute for Clinical Excellence-accredited CPGs for the management of adults with primary SS.This paper provides comprehensive recommendations covering the treatment of primary SS in its several dimensions: dryness (ocular, oral and other), salivary gland enlargement, fatigue and use of csDMARDs and biologics for systemic disease. Moreover, it addresses briefly the management of pregnancy in female patients with SS and lymphoma risk assessment and monitoring.

### New developments in Sjögren's syndrome [^041b99bd]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary SS is a chronic, autoimmune condition characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, which leads to glandular dysfunction and eventual irreversible tissue damage. The primary clinical manifestations are ocular and oral dryness, but 30–40% of patients develop systemic features and there is an increased lifetime risk of lymphoma, estimated to be 5–10%. Patients carry a large symptom burden with a subsequent reduction in health-related quality of life and work productivity. Current treatment strategies are empirical and rely on symptomatic management, with no biological or synthetic DMARDs proven to alter the progression of disease.

### A practical approach to severity classification and treatment of dry eye disease: a proposal from the Mexican dry eye disease expert panel [^b1951b20]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Mexican Dry Eye Disease Expert Panel Proposed Treatment Approach Based on Dry Eye Disease Severity

The management of DED is complex due to its multifactorial nature. The well-accepted principle that diagnosis precedes therapy means that clinicians must endeavor to identify the degree to which different types of dry eye and other ocular surface conditions contribute to the patient’s clinical presentation. The primary objective of DED management is to restore homeostasis of the ocular surface by breaking the vicious cycle of the disease. While treatments may be indicated explicitly for one aspect of an individual patient’s condition, several treatment modalities might appropriately be recommended for multiple aspects of a DED clinical presentation. Beyond the aim of identifying and treating the leading cause of the disease, the management of DED typically involves dealing with chronic sequelae requiring continuous rather than short-term treatment to eliminate the dry eye issues.

According to the disease stage, management algorithms are essential for a systematic therapy sequence, but such strategy is not always possible for DED as it is a complex condition varying inter-individually in severity and clinical course. However, to assist all eye care practitioners to custom a practical and efficacious evidence-based treatment strategy, we propose the management algorithm illustrated in Figure 7 and detailed in the following subsections. We also provide an evidence-based rationale for chosen therapeutic modalities.

Figure 7 
Systematic treatment approach proposed by the Mexican Dry Eye Expert Panel.

General Rules for All Patients

According to DED severity, the recommended step-management for patients’ refractory to therapy is additive and sequential. Regardless of disease severity, specific recommendations are suitable for all patients, including as-needed ocular lubricants, with a frequency depending on symptom severity.

Patient Education

Once diagnosis and severity are established, patient education regarding treatment strategies and prognosis is paramount. It is crucial to determine the frequency of episodes, presenting symptoms and signs, systemic medication intake, and associated systemic conditions. Whenever possible, such medications should be suspended. It is essential to assess for therapeutic adherence at every visit and identify potential aggravating factors of DED.

Environmental Conditions

Low humidity, air conditioning, and other hostile environmental conditions can exacerbate DED symptoms and should be considered. For example, in patients with ADDE or EDE, including Sjögren syndrome, GvHD, rosacea or severe MGD, protective eyeglasses, prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE), or low-water content contact lenses should be used to limit exposure to adverse environmental conditions.

Counseling and referral in dry eye—in moderate to severe cases that are unresponsive to treatment or when systemic disease is suspected, timely referral to an ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable and experienced in the management of these entities is recommended. Referral to an internist or rheumatologist can be considered for patients with systemic immune dysfunction or for those who require immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with systemic disease such as primary Sjogren's syndrome, secondary Sjogren's (associated with a connective-tissue disease), or connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis should be managed by an appropriate medical specialist. Patients who have dry eye and are considering keratorefractive surgery, particularly LASIK, should be cautioned that keratorefractive surgery may worsen their dry eye symptoms; effective treatment for dry eye should be achieved before undergoing keratorefractive surgery, and uncontrolled dry eye syndrome is a contraindication for keratorefractive surgery. Patients with severe dry eye are at greater risk for contact lens intolerance and associated complications.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^af308b14]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

For ocular topical therapies, among the 43 studies in SjS patients, only 6 (14%) were carried out in primary-2002 patients, while there are 4 SLRs on the management of dry eye using ATs, AS and plugs.The Cochrane SLR on AT showed that the AT formulations tested improved the signs and symptoms over the course of the studies included, although they found no consistent between-group differences when conducting head-to-head AT comparisons. The authors concluded that, given the large number of AT formulations compared and the wide variety of outcomes, it was difficult to propose that one over the counter AT formulation is superior to another for the treatment of dry eye syndrome. However, AT consistently improved ocular symptoms over the course of the trials included, based on within-group analyses, and three of four PLA-controlled trials consistently found that AT improved ocular symptoms compared with PLA (saline or vehicle), with a similar trend for many of the secondary outcomes. This review also found that the use of ATs is relatively safe, with the most common adverse events being blurred vision, ocular discomfort and foreign body sensation. It is important to consider that most outcomes were subjective measures of patient-reported outcomes rather than objective outcomes.With respect to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)/GC-based ocular tears, evidence not including primary-2002 SjS patients suggests careful use of tears containing NSAIDs or GCs due to the side effects associated with prolonged use.In these patients, ocular topical NSAIDs or corticosteroids may be a short-term therapeutic approach prescribed by ophthalmologists for the minimum time necessary (maximum 2–4 weeks).

### Treatment of Sjögren's syndrome-associated dry eye an evidence-based review [^c72d3111]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Outcomes-based review of reported treatment options for patients with dry eye secondary to Sjögren's syndrome (SS).

Clinical Relevance

Dry eye affects many individuals worldwide. Significant proportion of patients with dry eye has underlying SS, a progressive autoimmune condition. The few suggested guidelines for the treatment of dry eye are mostly based on severity of symptoms and/or clinical findings rather than on outcomes analysis, and do not differentiate SS from other causes of dry eye. METHODS AND LITERATURE REVIEW: A search strategy was developed to identify prospective, interventional studies of treatments for SS-associated dry eye from electronic databases. Eligible references were restricted to English-language articles published after 1975. These sources were augmented by hand searches of reference lists from accessed articles. Study selection, data extraction, and grading of evidence were completed independently by ≥4 review authors.

Results

The searches identified 3559 references as of August 10, 2010. After duplicate review of the titles and abstracts, 245 full-text papers were assessed, 62 of which were relevant for inclusion in the review.

Conclusions

In the current literature on SS-associated dry eye, there is a paucity of rigorous clinical trials to support therapy recommendations. Nonetheless, the recommended treatments include topical lubricants, topical anti-inflammatory therapy, and tear-conserving strategies. The efficacy of oral secretagogues seems greater in the treatment of oral dryness than ocular dryness. Although oral hydroxychloroquine is commonly prescribed to patients with SS to alleviate fatigue and arthralgias, the literature lacks strong evidence for the efficacy of this treatment for dry eye.

Potential gaps in current existing CPGs

We have identified a few potential gaps in current existing guidelines. Several key aspects regarding applicability, implementation (costs/resources) and monitoring/update plan of guidelines are generally missing in most available recommendations. This is important as the application of recommendations in clinical practice can be limited by local practices and rules (eg, cost, availability or approved indication of a given drug), that should thus be taken into account. A plan for monitoring the application and updating the guidelines should also be added, as per the best guidance on guideline elaboration methodology. We also consider that a better dissemination plan is needed for the current available guidelines, and that in some cases, the translation and/or adoption of these guidelines by other European countries would be helpful. Moreover, as mentioned above, a significant number of recommendations covering several areas of SS management and diagnosis are mostly based on expert consensus, considering the lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and high-quality observational studies for SS-related specific questions. Finally, it should be noted that 3/7 of the cited CPGs did not include patients’ representatives in the working panel, a relevant aspect that needs to be taken into account when generating CPGs.

### Treatment guidelines for rheumatologic manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome: use of biologic agents, management of fatigue, and inflammatory musculoskeletal pain [^c420cc39]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The Sjögren's Syndrome Foundation clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are designed to improve quality and consistency of care in Sjögren's syndrome by offering recommendations for management.

Methods

Management questions for the systemic manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome were posed by the CPG committee with input from patients and rheumatologists. Clinical questions were assigned to a topic review group that performed systematic reviews and data extraction and drafted guidelines. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendation were rated using the American Society of Clinical Oncology's modification of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Guideline recommendations were reviewed by a consensus expert panel (CEP) composed of 30-40 clinicians from academia and community practices, as well as registered nurses and patients, using a modified Delphi process. A CEP agreement level of 75% was set as a minimum for adoption of a guideline recommendation.

Results

Consensus was achieved for 19 recommendations; for 11 additional modules, available data were insufficient to allow a recommendation to be formulated. Of the 19 recommendations, 15 required 1 Delphi round, 2 required 2 rounds, and 2 required 3 rounds.

Conclusion

Key recommendations include a decision tree for the use of oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for inflammatory musculoskeletal pain, use of self-care measures and advice regarding exercise to reduce fatigue, and the use of rituximab in selected clinical settings for oral and ocular dryness and for certain extraglandular manifestations, including vasculitis, severe parotid swelling, inflammatory arthritis, pulmonary disease, and mononeuritis multiplex. The CPG committee strongly discouraged the use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for sicca symptoms and for the majority of clinical contexts in primary Sjögren's syndrome.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/GC-based tear drops

Evidence is overwhelmingly limited to studies including patients with associated SjS or non-2002 SjS patients. Only one studywas carried out in primary-2002 patients, and this compared topical 0.1% fluorometholone (FML) with topical CyA: although no significant differences were detected between groups for the main efficacy parameters (except for tear breakup time (BUT), with better results in the FML group), although patients treated with topical 0.1% FML showed significant improvements with respect to baseline in the Corneal Fluorescein Staining score (p<0.001), BUT (p<0.001) and Ocular Surface Disease Index (p<0.001) after 8 weeks of therapy, but not for the Schirmer test; no serious side effects were reported: the mean intraocular pressure change at 8 weeks was +0.4 mm Hg in the FML group versus −1.15 mm Hg in the CyA group (p=0.389).

In December 2002, an ophthalmic formulation containing 0.05% CyA was approved by the US FDA to treat dry eye disease at a recommended two times per day dose, based on the results of two RCTs that included 1039 patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (SjS patients were included in varying proportions).Since then, a summary of the results reported until now shows that most studies only demonstrated within-group improvements, and those that reported significant between-group differences (drug and vehicle) found improvement in only one to two of the four to eight ocular outcomes evaluated.In addition, a study extension trial found no additional improvement in subjective and objective measurements after 6 months of therapy.With respect to adverse events, the largest RCTfound that most events were mild-to-moderate and transient, with a significantly higher percentage of burning eye in comparison with PLA (15% vs 6% in PLA), and only 2% of patients discontinued because of burning and stinging.

There are no specific RCTs in primary-2002 patients, with only one case-control study, the above-mentioned study by Lin and Gong,which showed no significant differences with topical 0.1% FML and with a higher frequency of moderate-to-severe transient burning sensation in patients receiving CyA.

6. In people with SD who have sicca (dryness) symptoms of the eyes, what is the most clinically effective topical treatment?

Much of the evidence is based on studies looking at the dry eye population in general with very few looking exclusively at SD-related dry eye.

Cochrane and systematic reviews agree that artificial tears are safe and consistently improve ocular symptoms. They conclude that patients should be offered non-preserved or soft preserved artificial tears to avoid worsening of the dry eye disease due to the toxic, proinflammatory and detergent effects of the preservative. There is some evidence that combination formulations are more effective than single active ingredient artificial tears and that hyaluronic acid (HA) eye drops are superior to saline or non-HA based drops. The frequency of instillation of eye drops is important, with evidence suggesting that 2–3 hourly is optimum.

Recommendation

Advise regular use of a preservative-free lubricating eye drop (e.g. 2–3 hourly) (1, A) SOA 94.4%

Serum eye drops

Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of serum eyedrops for dry eye confirm improvement in patient-reported outcome measures, corneal staining and tear break-up time (TBUT). In the UK, serum eye drops are only available via specialized centres in line with published NHS policy.

Recommendation

Autologous or allogeneic serum eye drops may be offered to individuals with ongoing symptoms despite maximal management with conventional eye drops (1, A) SOA 91.9%

NB: In the UK, serum eye drops are only available via specialised centres in line with published NHS policy.

Topical steroid eyedrops

A Cochrane review of topical corticosteroids for dry eye disease found a small-to-moderate improvement in symptoms and signs.

Recommendation

Topical steroid eye drops, under ophthalmic supervision, may be offered short-term to individuals with ongoing persistent inflammation despite maximal management with conventional eye drops (1, A) SOA 94.9%

Immunomodulating eye drops

Ciclosporin

A systematic literature review of the use of topical immunomodulatory drugs including ciclosporin found some evidence of improvement in corneal staining and TBUT. Ciclosporin eye drops can be used off-label in children and adolescents from four years of age, based on the efficacy observed in keratoconjunctivitis, but there are no published studies in jSD.

### Making the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome in patients with dry eye [^718c7e0b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is a chronic and progressive systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves immune-mediated damage to the lacrimal and salivary glands.This pathology translates into hallmark clinical symptoms of dry eyes (keratitis sicca or keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth. SS is the second most prevalent autoimmune rheumatic disease,likely affecting close to four million Americans.–The exact prevalence is difficult to determine due to variations in disease definitions and lack of a diagnostic gold standard. Womenand Caucasiansare the predominantly affected demographic groups. SS is primarily a disease of middle- to older aged adults, with onset typically occurring in the fourth or fifth decade of life.In one large Scandinavian study, the prevalence of SS was approximately seven times higher among elderly individuals (71–74 years of age) compared with a middle-aged population (40–44 years).The condition is associated with significant impairments in quality of life–and functioning.

While rheumatologists typically oversee the overall care of SS patients, a multidisciplinary team that involves ophthalmology specialists, as well as oral care professionals, is critical not just for the management of known SS patients, but also to identify potential SS cases. The symptoms of SS can progress slowly and are often highly variable in presentation, making diagnosis difficult.–Consequently, it is estimated that the disease remains undiagnosed in more than half of affected adults.Data suggest that patients experience symptoms for an average of 3.9 years before a diagnosis of SS is made.Unfortunately, such delays in diagnosis can be a source of psychological distress from unexplained symptoms,not to mention prolonging the initiation of appropriate treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of SS is essential to prevent or mitigate development of complications such as cerebrovascular events and myocardial infarction.,–Unfortunately, dry eye symptoms are very non-specific, especially in the immediate absence of other SS-related complaints or findings. In a recent US survey of eye care specialists, most practitioners reported relying primarily on patient history to guide treatment decisions.These findings underscore the need for reliable objective measures and diagnostic tools to quantify and classify dry eye symptoms.

This review aims to provide eye care professionals with an understanding of methods for distinguishing SS dry eye from other types of dry eye and to describe options for a differential diagnostic approach. The reader is reminded that SS is a systemic disease with many non-ocular manifestations that are not addressed in detail herein, but have been reviewed elsewhere.Collaboration with a rheumatologist is essential when SS is suspected in a given patient.

### Diagnosis and management of Sjögren syndrome [^59251b30]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Sjögren syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth. Other organ systems are affected in many patients. Sjogren syndrome is classified as primary or secondary. In primary disease, Sjogren syndrome is a solitary process, whereas secondary disease accompanies another autoimmune disease--often rheumatoid arthritis. Sjögren syndrome is a challenging diagnosis, requiring the family physician to coordinate with a team of specialists, including dentists, otolaryngologists, rheumatologists, and ophthalmologists. Pilocarpine and cevimeline can help relieve dry eyes and dry mouth.

Management of DED

A recommended approach for management of DED was proposed by the Tear Film Ocular Society Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) II in 2017. DEWS II advocated a stepwise therapeutic guide (Figure 1 and Table 2) based on the etiology and severity of the disease.The severity of disease was categorized on a scale of 1–4, based on symptoms and clinical findings.Restasis CsA ophthalmic solution was originally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of moderate-to-severe KCS (severity levels 2–3 in the DEWS guidelines). However, it has been showed that patients with mild dry eye (severity level 1 in the DEWS guidelines) may also benefit from CsA treatment that may reduce the progression of DED severity.The authors agree with this approach since chronic inflammation anywhere in the body damages tissues and early interventions in other inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis and hepatitis, reduce tissue damage. Moreover, DEWS II cautioned that the management algorithm proposed in their report did not represent a rigid stepwise approach. Thus, patients with mild keratoconjunctivitis sicca often benefit from early CsA therapy. It is also critical to determine whether a patient has underlying Sjogren’s disease by consulting with a rheumatologist if dry mouth or particularly severe disease is noted since concurrent systemic treatments are often indicated in such patients.

Dry eye syndrome management—general principles emphasize that patients with dry eye symptoms often have many contributory factors and it is imperative to treat any causative factors that are amenable to treatment; tear replacement is frequently unsuccessful when used as the sole treatment if additional causative factors are not concomitantly addressed; patient education is a critically important aspect of successful management, and the ophthalmologist should educate the patient about the natural history and chronic nature of dry eye; realistic expectations for therapeutic goals should be set and discussed with the patient; and Table 3 lists a staged approach to treating dry eye syndrome, noting that specific therapies may be chosen from any category regardless of the level of disease severity, depending on physician experience and patient preference.

### Efficacy and safety of topical and systemic medications: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of Sjögren's syndrome [^658edaaf]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

With respect to topical CyA, the pivotal study (a combination of two trials including 877 patients—270 fulfilled the 1993 SjS criteria, not detailed how many were primary or associated) evaluated 14 efficacy outcomes (4 objective, 10 subjective) with no definition of which were primary or secondary and found statistically significant differences between groups only in 4 (2 subjective and 2 objective). In spite of this, the FDA approved their use. In addition, a review of the results of all reported studies shows that most studies only demonstrated within-group improvements, and those that reported significant between-group differences (drug and vehicle) found improvement in only 20%–30% of the outcomes evaluated.In addition, a study extension trial found no additional improvement in subjective and objective measurements in patients treated for >6 months.Although SjS patients were included in variable proportions in the above-mentioned RCTs, there are no RCTs specifically in primary-2002 patients.Only one recent prospective study was made in primary-2002 patients, which found no significant differences between topical CyA and topical 0.1% FML.A recent small RCT using 0.03% tacrolimus tear drops found significant improvements in 24 primary-2002 patients; the lack of definition of the population included (unclear whether they were primary or associated cases), the high rate of side effects and, especially, the limited number of cases does not support their widespread use in primary SjS patients, although they could be considered as a rescue therapy for CyA non-responders/intolerant patients.

### Update on Sjögren syndrome and other causes of sicca in older adults [^71e760c1]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Dry eye and dry mouth symptoms are each reported by up to 30% of persons more than 65 years of age, particularly in women. Medication side effects are the most common contributing factors. The evaluation of these symptoms requires measures of ocular and oral dryness. Sjögren syndrome is the prototypical disease associated with dryness of the eyes and mouth and predominantly affects women in their perimenopausal and postmenopausal years. In addition to topical treatment of the mucosal dryness, patients with Sjögren syndrome may require treatment with systemic immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents to manage a variety of extraglandular manifestations.

### Expert opinion in the management of aqueous deficient dry eye disease (DED) [^51e075a3]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

A survey was distributed to researchers and expert practitioners in the field of DED via the internet survey tool SurveyMonkey (surveymonkey.com, LLC; Palo Alto, California) in April 2013. Experts were identified by collecting corresponding author information from recently published manuscripts in the field of dry eye. PubMed and Web of Science were queried using the search terms “sjögren eye,” “keratoconjunctivitis sicca,” and “dry eye,” and all articles published from November 2008 to November 2012 were included. Those who had previously opted out of receiving emails from SurveyMonkey or those with invalid email addresses were pre-determined to be ineligible. The survey was anonymous and no participant identifiers of name, gender or age were collected; all recipients had the option of participating or opting out. IRB exemption was obtained from the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and all federal and state laws. After its initial distribution in April 2013, two survey reminders were sent and the survey was closed on July 1, 2013.

The survey consisted of 11 questions (Appendix 1), which were developed after a literature search identified the most common available medications for DED. Survey recipients were first presented with a clinical scenario of a patient with symptoms and physical exam findings consistent with aqueous deficient DED. Respondents were then asked to describe their use of various therapies for this patient including punctal plugs, topical, and oral medications using Likert scales. Next, participants were asked to indicate which of these therapies they would be interested in using more and primary limitations to their current use. Respondents were questioned regarding their routine treatment algorithms and treatment milestones they use to guide therapy. Lastly, general demographic questions were asked. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed using Stata 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^ce9e989a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Sjögren’s syndrome–related dry eye evaluation and therapy guidance: Evaluation of the patient should include symptoms of both discomfort and visual disturbance and determination of the relative contribution of aqueous production deficiency and evaporative loss of tear volume; objective parameters of tear film stability, tear osmolarity, degree of lid margin disease, and ocular surface damage should be used to stage severity to assist in selecting appropriate treatment options; patient education is critical; and treatment options include tear supplementation and stabilization, control of inflammation of the lacrimal gland and ocular surface, and possible stimulation of tear production according to the character and severity. Although there was paucity of rigorous clinical trials to support therapy recommendations, topical lubricants, topical anti-inflammatory therapy, and tear-conserving strategies seemed effective; the efficacy of oral secretagogues was greater in the treatment of oral dryness than ocular dryness; although oral hydroxychloroquine is commonly prescribed, the literature did not demonstrate strong evidence for the efficacy of this treatment for dry eye; another systematic review confirmed benefits for oral secretagogues (pilocarpine and cevimeline) for sicca features (mostly oral) and topical anti-inflammatories (cyclosporine) for moderate or severe dry eye; anti-tumor necrosis factor agents were not found to be effective, and the evidence for efficacy of rituximab was not strong.

Unmet needs

Despite considerable advances in recent years regarding the development of CPGs specific for SS that decisively contribute to improving care of patients with SS, a key point common to most recommendations is that they are frequently supported by low-to-moderate quality evidence and strongly rely on expert opinion. Indeed, there is a major need for high-quality studies in several areas of SS diagnosis and management in order to further support or modify currently available guidelines.The most important unmet need is the ability or not to recommend, in all patients or in a subgroup of patients, a DMARD able to change the evolution of the disease. For achieving this aim, it is crucial to pursue RCTs that have begun in this disease and that recently yielded for the first time a positive result, in a phase 2 RCT with an anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody.

Historically, despite its considerable prevalence among CTDs, SS has been devoted much less research interest, time and effort compared with other close conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitides.As such, clinical approach of SS has often mirrored the experience with these other CTDs, for which evidence is strongly supported by robust clinical trials and large observational studies. Regardless of the obvious similarities with some of these diseases, SS is a heterogeneous condition, with different clusters of patients defined by typical manifestations and symptoms and, therefore, a uniform response is unlikely to be seen with most treatments. This underlines the need for designing large studies, with several patient subgroups and patient’s stratifications, aiming to demonstrate the efficacy of csDMARDs, glucocorticoids, biologics and novel molecules specifically in SS.

For this matter, active and synergistic involvement of patients, clinicians and scientists in the definition of unmet needs and areas of future research in SS is crucial. Hopefully, these efforts will help to set the path for the elaboration of comprehensive high-quality CPGs, supported by a larger body of evidence, which will decisively contribute to improve and standardise SS patient care. In this regard, it is reassuring to learn that patient and scientific organisations such as SSF and EULAR have planned to develop additional CPGs covering other important questions, which should become available soon.

Rituximab

Rituximab has been tested in three prospective cohort studies,one case-control studyand four RCTs.A summary of the significant improvements reported with respect to baseline in the prospective cohort studies showed improvement in VAS for dryness,fatigueand pain/tender point count,while no significant improvements were reported for objective oral and ocular tests (except in the study by Pijpe et al in a subset of patients). In the case-control study, Carubbi et al compared the therapeutic effect of rituximab (n=22) and conventional immunosuppressive therapy (n=19) and found a significant improvement in patients treated with rituximab in the ESSDAI (<0.05), global VAS (<0.05), fatigue VAS (<0.01), dryness VAS (<0.01), physician VAS (<0.05), uSF (<0.01) and Schirmer test (<0.05) at the end of follow-up (120 weeks); the authors reported a complete lack of reported adverse events in either of the two arms in spite of the long-term nature of the study. With respect to the two small RCTs, Dass et al randomised 17 primary-2002 patients to receive rituximab (n=8) or PLA (n=9) and found no significant results in the primary outcome (improvement >20% VAS fatigue at 6 months, rituximab 87% vs PLA 56%, p=0.36), while Meijer et al randomised 30 primary-2002 patients to receive rituximab (n=20) or PLA (n=10) with no significant results for the primary outcome (improvement in SWSF rate at 48 weeks, p>0.05). Two large RCTs have recently been reported. In 2014, Devauchelle-Pensec et al randomised 122 primary-2002 patients to receive rituximab (n=63) or PLA (n=57) and found no significant results in the primary outcome (≥30 mm improvement at week 24 on at least 2 out of 4 VAS scores—dryness, fatigue, pain, global, 23% vs 22%, p=0.91), while Bowman et al randomised 133 primary-2002 patients to receive rituximab (n=67) or PLA (n=66) and found no significant results in the primary outcome (reduction ≥30% at week 48 in either fatigue or oral dryness VAS, rituximab 39.3% vs PLA 36.8%, p=0.76). Two recent meta-analyses including the four RCTs have confirmed the lack of significant between-group differences in mean improvements between baseline and week 24 values for fatigue VAS, oral dryness VAS, salivary flow rate and Schirmer test, and no significant difference between groups for the main adverse events.

Meta-analysis suggests an increase in cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and a small excess mortality has been observed in people with SD, particularly in males and those with underlying lung disease. SD remains a chronic illness with no disease modifying or curative treatments available to date. People can accumulate morbidity over time.

SD may occur alone, when it has traditionally been referred to as primary SD, or alongside another rheumatic disease, when it may present as either an overlap or secondary phenomenon. The ACR/EULAR criteria are now widely used to classify people with primary SD and are often used diagnostically.

This guideline builds on, and widens the recommendations developed for the first guideline published in 2017. We have included advice on the management of children and adolescents with SD where appropriate to provide as comprehensive a guideline as possible for UK based rheumatology teams.

Background

Primary Sjögren’s disease (pSjD) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterised by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of exocrine epithelial tissues, most commonly involving the lacrimal and salivary glands. Extraglandular manifestations are frequently observed and may affect multiple organ systems, including the pulmonary, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, nervous and renal systems. The overall prevalence is estimated to be 60 cases per 100 000 with a female to male ratio of 10:1.Secondary Sjögren’s is Sjögren’s disease that is associated with other systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma or dermatomyositis.

The diagnosis of Sjögren’s should be considered in a patient with subjective daily and persistent oral and/or ocular dryness. Diagnostic testing includes serologies, such as antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A (SSA)/Ro antibody, anti-Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen B (SSB)/La antibody and a minor salivary gland biopsy. Although not intended for diagnostic purposes, the 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Classification Criteria include labial gland biopsy, positive Anti-SSA, ocular staining, Schirmer’s test and an unstimulated salivary flow test in a patient with at least one symptom of oral or ocular dryness.
