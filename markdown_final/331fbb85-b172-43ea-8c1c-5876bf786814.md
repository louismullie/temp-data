## Question

How should insect bites be documented on the physical exam?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how insect bites should be documented on the physical exam. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the history elements that frame the exam. Then, I should verify immediate safety by screening for anaphylaxis and systemic illness. Next, I will document primary skin findings using standard dermatologic descriptors. After that, I need to assess secondary changes and complications, and differentiate simple reactions from cellulitis or necrosis. I should also consider vector-specific clues such as bed bugs, mosquitoes, or ticks and their timelines. Finally, I will ensure ancillary documentation, stewardship points, and follow-up are captured clearly with appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the core history needed before I anchor the physical exam findings: exposure setting and timing, number of lesions, prior similar reactions, atopy or immunosuppression, concurrent medications that may blunt or modify reactions, and the patient's chief symptoms including pruritus, pain, swelling, and any systemic features; I should also explicitly ask about stings versus bites because management and risk differ, and I need to document what the patient believes the culprit was while acknowledging that misidentification is common, especially for bed bugs and Hymenoptera, so I should not overcommit to an etiology without supporting findings [^113ky3ix] [^1172SzrV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; before I focus on the skin, I need to check ABCs and vitals to promptly recognize anaphylaxis or evolving systemic reaction, documenting heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and any urticaria, angioedema, wheeze, or gastrointestinal symptoms, because rapid intramuscular epinephrine is life-saving if anaphylaxis is present, and the physical exam should explicitly record improvement or progression over time if treated emergently [^111ZS3pQ] [^113LsZKG].

> Next, I will now examine and record the primary skin findings using a universal C-S-M-D framework: color (erythema, violaceous, hemorrhagic, necrotic), size in millimeters or centimeters, morphology (wheal, papule, vesicle, bulla, pustule, ulcer, eschar), and distribution (single, clustered, linear, "breakfast–lunch–dinner", exposed versus covered areas) with precise anatomic locations, since mosquitoes classically produce an immediate wheal-and-flare that peaks within minutes and bed bugs often cause clustered papules on exposed skin with periocular involvement sometimes presenting as the "eyelid sign" in children [^112143Jm] [^114baK7f] [^111kneqW] [^114eAF72].

> Wait, let me verify the secondary features that impact management; I should document pruritus intensity, pain and tenderness, warmth, excoriations, edema or induration beyond lesion borders, fluctuance, drainage, and lymphangitic streaking. I should measure the maximal diameter of edema/induration and note any skin breakdown or bullae formation because severe bullous reactions, though uncommon, can occur after bed bug bites and alter care and follow-up [^114KEFY5] [^113ky3ix].

> I should double-check for signs suggesting cellulitis or instead a robust local allergic reaction, because management diverges; ultrasound can help distinguish angioedema or simple soft tissue swelling from cellulitis at the bedside and has been shown to change management, and given data showing substantial antibiotic overuse for insect bites in primary care, I need to be explicit in my documentation if the findings are not consistent with bacterial infection to support stewardship [^1122xnD2] [^112ktUGx] [^116uDnSW].

> Let me consider the time course and reaction pattern; for mosquito bites, I should record whether there was an immediate wheal-and-flare within minutes versus a delayed papular reaction peaking around 24 hours, noting prior sensitization or desensitization patterns across age or repeated exposures, because these kinetics support a hypersensitivity rather than infection and guide counseling about expected evolution [^114baK7f] [^111GnSUQ].

> But wait, what if the distribution or morphology hints at a specific arthropod; I should document clustered papules on exposed sites with linear patterns for bed bugs and explicitly note any necrosis, ulceration, or expanding eschar which would raise concern for necrotic arachnidism and require escalation and serial exams, since recluse spider bites can progress from erythema to necrosis over days and warrant careful photographic documentation [^113ky3ix] [^115BoFBR].

> I need to ensure I do not miss tick bites and Lyme disease patterns; if there is a tick exposure history or a lesion suggestive of erythema migrans, I should document the lesion's size, expansion, and central clearing clearly, because typical erythema migrans can be diagnosed clinically while atypical lesions warrant paired serology; I should also screen and document cardiac symptoms that would trigger ECG evaluation for possible Lyme carditis during follow-up [^114EfCjr] [^113ky3ix] [^117NiHY8].

> Next, I should review what ancillary documentation is needed; I will measure and photograph lesions with a scale for serial comparison, consider point-of-care ultrasound if the diagnosis of cellulitis is uncertain, and reserve cultures for suspected secondary infection per SSTI guidance, while also documenting the wound environment, surrounding skin, exudate, and pain in a structured way to facilitate follow-up comparisons [^114mbgxG] [^114JhH9D].

> Hold on, I should verify that my plan aligns with conservative care whenever appropriate; for uncomplicated bed bug or mosquito reactions, I will document that supportive therapy is indicated with topical corticosteroids, emollients, and oral antihistamines and explicitly note the absence of cellulitic features to avoid unnecessary antibiotics, referencing the literature that indicates overprescribing in outpatient settings for insect bites [^113ky3ix] [^112ktUGx].

> Let me also confirm I have addressed systemic sting hypersensitivity; if the history reveals a systemic reaction to a stinging insect, I should document counseling to carry epinephrine autoinjectors and referral to allergy for evaluation and consideration of venom immunotherapy, since VIT reduces the risk of future life-threatening reactions and is standard of care after systemic stings [^115YoN5q] [^112h6KxB] [^111ZS3pQ].

> I will now examine red flags and follow-up; I need to record instructions for urgent care if the patient develops progressive swelling with pain, fever, necrosis, lymphangitic streaking, or any signs of anaphylaxis including airway or circulatory compromise, and I should schedule reassessment if lesions evolve rapidly or if necrosis is suspected to ensure timely surgical or specialty input [^111ZS3pQ] [^115BoFBR].

> To synthesize, a concise example note might read: "Multiple intensely pruritic erythematous papules with central puncta on the right lateral calf and posterior thigh, 3–6 mm, non-tender, warm but not hot, no fluctuance, no purulence, no lymphangitic streaking, clustered in a linear arrangement on exposed skin, onset of itch within minutes after outdoor exposure yesterday; vitals normal; no urticaria, angioedema, respiratory, or GI symptoms; impression most consistent with uncomplicated arthropod bites likely bed bugs or mosquitoes; plan: topical medium-potency corticosteroid, oral non-sedating antihistamine, cool compresses; no antibiotics; return precautions for fever, spreading erythema, severe pain, purulence, necrosis, or systemic symptoms" which captures C-S-M-D, timing, systemic screening, and a stewardship-aligned plan [^112143Jm].

On physical examination, document **morphology** (papules, wheals, vesicles, bullae, pustules, nodules, necrosis) [^112143Jm], **distribution** (clustered, linear, random; exposed vs covered areas) [^113ky3ix], and **associated features** (pruritus, pain, erythema, edema, excoriations, secondary infection, systemic signs) [^116nbXXE]. Also note **size and color**, the presence of a central punctum, and any lymphangitis or lymphadenopathy [^1123C7qv]. Record the **number of lesions**, symmetry, and chronic changes (lichenification, hyperpigmentation, scarring) [^114KEFY5]. Use **standardized dermatologic terminology** and document clearly to guide diagnosis and management [^112143Jm].

---

### Morphology of lesions

- **Papules**: Small, erythematous, pruritic papules are common in mosquito [^114baK7f] and flea bites [^116MWCqL].
- **Wheals**: Urticarial wheals with central punctum are typical of mosquito bites [^114baK7f].
- **Vesicles/bullae**: Vesicles or bullae may occur in bed bug bites [^113ky3ix] or severe hypersensitivity reactions [^111VwHv8].
- **Pustules**: Pustules suggest secondary bacterial infection or folliculitis [^114mbgxG].
- **Nodules**: Firm nodules may indicate chronic or repeated bites [^116MWCqL].
- **Necrosis**: Necrosis or ulceration suggests severe reactions or specific bites (e.g. brown recluse spider) [^115BoFBR].

---

### Distribution and pattern

- **Clustered**: Bed bug bites often appear in clusters [^116vgYdn] or linear "breakfast, lunch, and dinner" patterns [^113ky3ix].
- **Linear**: Flea bites may present in linear arrangements [^116MWCqL].
- **Random**: Mosquito bites typically have a random distribution [^114baK7f].
- **Exposed areas**: Bites commonly occur on exposed skin (arms, legs, face) [^113xpNgS].
- **Covered areas**: Bites under clothing suggest bed bugs or fleas [^113ky3ix].

---

### Associated features

- **Pruritus**: Intense itching is common, especially in mosquito [^114baK7f] and bed bug bites [^113ky3ix].
- **Pain**: Pain may indicate deeper involvement or secondary infection [^115BoFBR].
- **Erythema and edema**: Localized erythema and edema are common inflammatory responses [^113xpNgS].
- **Excoriations**: Scratch marks indicate chronic or severe pruritus [^114KEFY5].
- **Secondary infection**: Look for pustules, crusting, or purulent discharge [^114mbgxG].
- **Systemic signs**: Fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy suggest systemic involvement.

---

### Size and color

Measure lesion diameter (mosquito bites typically 2–5 mm; bed bug bites 3–10 mm) and document **color**. Erythema is common, and chronic hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation may develop [^116vgYdn].

---

### Central punctum

Document whether a visible **central punctum** is present, especially in mosquito or flea bites [^116MWCqL].

---

### Lymphangitis and lymphadenopathy

Assess for **lymphangitis** (red streaks suggesting possible secondary bacterial infection) [^115BoFBR] and **lymphadenopathy** (regional lymph node enlargement suggesting systemic involvement) [^1123C7qv].

---

### Chronic changes

Chronic changes include **lichenification** (thickened skin from chronic scratching), **hyperpigmentation** (darkening from repeated inflammation), and **scarring** (permanent marks from severe or repeated bites) [^114KEFY5].

---

### Documentation and terminology

Use **standardized dermatologic terminology** (e.g. papule, vesicle, wheal) and ensure **clear documentation** of lesion morphology, distribution, size, color, and associated features [^112143Jm].

---

### Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** includes **contact dermatitis** [^115YujjE] (allergic or irritant), **scabies** (burrows with intense pruritus), folliculitis (infected hair follicles), and viral exanthems (measles, chickenpox, etc).

---

### Clinical examples

| **Insect** | **Typical lesion** | **Distribution** | **Associated features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mosquito | Erythematous papule or wheal [^114baK7f] | Exposed areas | - Pruritus <br/> - Central punctum |
| Bed bug | Clustered papules or vesicles [^111VwHv8] | Exposed and covered areas [^116vgYdn] | - Pruritus <br/> - Linear pattern [^113ky3ix] |
| Flea | Linear papules [^116MWCqL] | Lower extremities | - Pruritus <br/> - Central punctum |
| Tick | Erythematous papule with central punctum | Exposed areas | Possible systemic symptoms [^114EfCjr] |
| Spider | Necrotic ulcer or bullae [^115BoFBR] | Any area | - Pain <br/> - Necrosis <br/> - Systemic symptoms |

---

In summary, document **morphology**, **distribution**, **associated features**, and **size/color** to guide diagnosis and management.

### Bullous reactions to bedbug bites reflect cutaneous vasculitis [^111VwHv8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

There has been a worldwide resurgence of bedbug infestations. Bites by these insects may cause mild or severe cutaneous reactions, and anaphylaxis has been reported. Little is known about the most severe cutaneous reactions, termed bullous or complex reactions.

- **Objective**: To study the time course and histopathologic findings of complex (bullous) cutaneous reactions to bedbugs in order to determine the optimal treatment for them.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: We prospectively photographed bullous reactions to observed bedbug bites at 30 minutes, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. Additionally, we biopsied reactions at 30 minutes and 6, 12, and 24 hours. We also reviewed Internet postings and the available medical literature on bullous reactions after bedbug bites.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Correlations between clinical and histologic findings using both routine and immunofluorescent techniques.

- **Results**: Bullous reactions to bedbugs are not rare. Of 357 photographs of bedbug bites posted on the Internet, 6% were bullous. In an individual with previous bullous reactions, experimental bedbug bites were associated with a progression of cutaneous responses at bite sites from immediate, pruritic, edematous lesions to a late-in-time macule, which evolved into bullous reactions by 24 hours. Bullous lesions eventually lysed but took weeks to heal. Histopathologic evaluation of bullous reactions showed a polymorphous picture with histologic evidence of an urticarial-like reaction early on that rapidly developed into a hybrid leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^113ky3ix]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Bed bug bites can result in clinical manifestations; the most common are small clusters of extremely pruritic, erythematous papules or wheals that represent repeated feedings by a single bed bug. Less common, but more severe, manifestations include grouped vesicles, giant urticaria, and hemorrhagic bullous eruptions. Bites should be managed symptomatically with topical emollients, topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, or some combination of these treatments.

Health professionals should be aware of this reemerging urban pest to facilitate prompt diagnosis of affected patients and treatment of the underlying environmental infestation. Bed bug bites must be differentiated from scabies, body lice, and other insect bites. Diagnostic clues include clustering and timing of bed bug bites. Unlike body lice, bed bugs are rarely found on affected persons or their clothing, and persons with good personal hygiene who enter an infested area are likely to be bitten.

### Common pediatric and adolescent skin conditions [^112143Jm]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Skin lesions are encountered in all areas of medicine, and it is therefore important for physicians to understand the fundamentals of explaining and diagnosing common skin conditions. This article begins with a discussion of the description and documentation of skin lesions based on color, size, morphology, and distribution. Pigmentation disorders, such as vitiligo, are depicted.

Cutaneous growths that are found in the pediatric and adolescent population include acrochordons, dermatofibromas, keloids, milia, neurofibromas, and pyogenic granulomas. Treatment of these growths usually involves observation or curettage with electrodessication. Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, poison ivy, and eczema are comprised of scaling patches and plaques; poison ivy and atopic dermatitis may also present with bullous and vesicular changes. Therapy typically consists of topical emollients and corticosteroids; phototherapy is reserved for refractory cases.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease of the pediatric and adolescent population. This condition can be psychologically debilitating, and therefore, proper treatment is of paramount importance. Therapeutic options include topical as well as oral antibiotics and retinoids. Extreme caution must be used when prescribing retinoids to post-pubescent females, as these agents are teratogenic.

Vascular anomalies are most commonly exemplified as port wine stains and hemangiomas. Port wine stains may be treated with pulsed dye laser or may be observed if they are not of concern to the patient or physician. Hemangiomas typically spontaneously regress.

### Evaluation of cutaneous immune response in a controlled human in vivo model of mosquito bites [^114baK7f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Mosquito bites cause a local cutaneous reaction with wheal and flare manifestation. Concordantly, the bite size reaction peaked after 15 minutes post-bite in this endemic study population. Few changes were detected in gene expression or influx and activation of neutrophils, dendritic cell subsets, and macrophages at the 30-minute post-bite time point. Upregulated genes were related to top-level processes such as signal transduction.

The study was not designed to assess the role of pre-stored immune mediators such as histamine (and others) in the development of edema and their modulation in the immune response. However, mosquito bites can activate cutaneous mast cells, which are prominent histamine-storing cells, and induce their degranulation. The release of histamine and other mediators leads to vasodilation, fluid accumulation at the bite site, and neutrophil influx, which were all ultimately observed.

### Furuncular myiasis from Dermatobia hominus: a case of human botfly infestation [^113f23NG]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Travelers to tropical regions are at risk for a myriad of exotic illnesses. Malaria and dengue are diagnoses associated with insect bites, particularly mosquito bites, acquired while traveling in foreign, tropical countries. Infestation with Dermatobia hominus, the human botfly endemic to South and Central America, is usually transferred via a mosquito vector. The human botfly should be considered in patients who have traveled to these endemic regions and present with a history of mosquito bites and non-healing skin lesions.

- **Objectives**: We present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians regarding furuncular myiasis from the human botfly.

- **Case report**: A 39-year-old pregnant woman presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an intensely pruritic lesion on the right calf and mild systemic symptoms 6 weeks after traveling to Belize. The lesion, initially thought to be a mosquito bite, had persisted despite escalating treatment modalities and had been incorrectly diagnosed by multiple physicians.

- **Conclusion**: Parasitic disease is not always a systemic process. Botfly infestation presents as local boil-like lesions that are irritating and uncomfortable. Once correctly identified, it can be easily treated in the ED.

### Vancocin [^115EuoQ5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations. Instruct patients to stop taking Vancocin immediately and promptly seek medical attention at the first signs or symptoms of a skin rash, mucosal lesions, or blisters [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

- **Antibacterial resistance**: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Vancocin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Vancocin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Vancocin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Anaphylaxis following a slow loris bite occurring in an area of forest fragmentation [^113LsZKG]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

On physical examination, the patient was moderately distressed and perspiring profusely. His respiratory rate was 25 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 120/90 mm Hg, pulse was 105 beats per minute, temperature was 36.9°C, and oxygen saturation was 99%. His eyes showed bilateral conjunctival injection, and there was swelling of his lips and lower eyelids (see Figure 1). Hoarseness and moderate salivation were also observed. Normal lung sounds were heard with no wheezes. Bowel sounds were increased, and epigastric tenderness was present. Skin examination exhibited no rash or other pathologies. Examination of the bite revealed multiple lacerated wounds on the tip of the right middle finger, 1–5 mm in length and 1 mm in depth (see Figure 2). An ECG was normal. A routine COVID-19 screening using a rapid antigen test was positive.

Figure 1
The patient's lips showing angioedema at admission.

Figure 2
The patient's right middle finger showing the initial bite wound.

The clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis was established according to the World Allergy Organization (WAO) criterion based on the patient's rapid onset of angioedema, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms, preceded by exposure to a possible elicitor — the slow loris bite. A wildlife veterinarian and a senior family physician were teleconsulted regarding definitive diagnosis and bite management. Oxygen was delivered at 3 L/min by nasal cannula. One injection of 0.5 mg epinephrine in 1:1000 dilution was given intramuscularly for primary treatment of anaphylaxis. Diphenhydramine 50 mg and dexamethasone 10 mg were administered.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for concussion, particularly concerning history and physical examination, the LCG 2022 guidelines recommend the following actions:

- **Elicit a thorough history**: Use a standardized concussion symptom inventory tool, which includes cognition screening.
- **Perform a physical examination**: Assess the potential contributing factors such as comorbid medical conditions and mental health conditions.

These steps are essential to guide the initial medical management in patients with concussion.

### Role of single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray in the classification of BAP1-inactivated melanocytic tumours [^116x5gMp]. Histopathology (2025). High credibility.

On histologic examination, all 15 cases with ≥ 2 CNAs showed a nodular or dome-shaped lesion (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4); the architecture was symmetric in 10 of 15 cases (Figure 1A), with a definitive background BAP1-retained nevus present in 7 of 15 cases (Figure 2B) and not identified in 8 of 15 cases (Table 2). The depth of dermal involvement ranged from 1.0 to 11 mm, with a mean of 2.5 mm and a standard error of the mean (SEM) of 0.6 mm. No lesions displayed ulceration. The median mitotic rate was 1/mm², with a range of 0–6/mm². Deep mitoses and a mitotic rate of 2 or more per mm² were present in 5 of 15 and 4 of 15 cases, respectively.

All lesions exhibited expansile or sheet-like growth (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). In 4 of 15 lesions, there was an extensive junctional component, while this was focal in 5 of 15 and absent in 6 of 15 lesions. Maturation was absent in 5 of 15 cases, present but incomplete in 9 of 15 cases (Figure 3B–D), and the remaining case showed maturation in the nevoid component but none in a deep penetrating nevus-like subpopulation. Infiltrative growth was present in 7 of 15 cases (Figure 3C, D), absent in 5 of 15, and not evaluable in 3 of 15 cases due to transection. An inflammatory response was brisk/diffuse in 3 of 15 cases (Figure 1A, C), nonbrisk/patchy and associated with the BAP1-inactivated component in 7 of 15 cases (Figures 1B and 3B), and absent in 5 of 15 cases.

### Clinical aspects of snakebite envenoming and its treatment in low-resource settings [^112zVrSf]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the public health importance of snakebite envenoming. The worldwide annual incidence is likely to be around 5 million bites, with mortality exceeding 150,000 deaths. The resulting physical and psychological morbidity leads to substantial social and economic repercussions. Prevention through community education by trained health workers is the most effective and economically viable strategy for reducing the risk of bites and envenoming. Clinical challenges to effective treatment are most substantial in rural areas of low-resource settings, where snakebites are most common. The classic skills of history taking, physical examination, and use of affordable point-of-care tests should be followed by monitoring of evolving local and systemic envenoming. Despite the profusion of new ideas for interventions, hyperimmune equine or ovine plasma-derived antivenoms remain the only specific treatment for snakebite envenoming. The enormous interspecies and intraspecies complexity and diversity of snake venoms, revealed by modern venomics, demands a radical redesign of many antivenoms.

### Skin necrosis, diffuse urticaria, and cellulitis due to presumed Loxosceles spider bite [^115BoFBR]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of a recluse spider bite range from local erythema to necrotic skin reactions; bites rarely lead to a systemic disease known as viscerocutaneous loxoscelism. A 29-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department with a wound, swelling, and pain on her left leg and a rash on her whole body as a result of a spider bite. On physical examination, a round, hard, black, irregularly shaped necrotic area was found in the bite zone on the lower posterior part of the left thigh, as were lesions in the form of erythematous papules around the area. There was a color change around the lesion, extending from the posterior to medial of the thigh, and a papule on a diffuse erythematous surface on the trunk and arms. At follow-up, the necrotic area had become more apparent. After approximately one month, the necrotic area was surgically debrided, and a flap was formed on the necrotic tissue area.

In this article, a case that was thought to be caused by a Loxosceles spider bite and which started with erythema, progressed to lymphangitis, cellulitis, and severe necrosis, and was surgically debrided, was evaluated in light of the clinical findings and previously reported cases of verified loxoscelism. In patients with a history suggestive of a bite and with these clinical findings, the diagnosis of a bite by Loxosceles spp. should be carefully considered based on clinical and epidemiological findings.

### Locoid [^115Kfezn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**

The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:

- **HPA axis suppression**: see warnings and precautions (5.1) and use in specific populations (8.4).
- **Ophthalmic adverse reactions**: see warnings and precautions (5.2).
- **Skin infections**: see warnings and precautions (5.3).
- **Allergic contact dermatitis**: see warnings and precautions (5.4).

The most common adverse reactions (greater than 1%) are application site reactions.

- **Clinical trials experience**

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety data described below reflect exposure to Locoid lotion applied topically twice daily for up to four weeks in vehicle-controlled clinical trials of 284 pediatric subjects aged 3 months to 18 years and 301 adult subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. See clinical studies (14).

The incidence of selected adverse reactions reported by 1% or more of subjects during the studies is presented in Tables 1 and 2.

- **Postmarketing experience**

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of topical corticosteroids, including Locoid lotion. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to…

### Management of stinging insect hypersensitivity: a 5-year retrospective medical record review [^112h6KxB]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters for Allergy and Immunology recommends that patients with a history of a systemic reaction to an insect sting be educated on ways to avoid insect stings, carry injectable epinephrine for emergency self-treatment, undergo specific IgE testing for stinging insect sensitivity, and be considered for immunotherapy.

- **Objective**: To review frontline providers' documented care and recommendations for imported fire ant and flying insect hypersensitivity reactions.

- **Methods**: A retrospective medical record review was performed of emergency department and primary care clinic visits between November 1, 1999, and November 30, 2004. Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes, medical records were selected for review to identify patients with potential insect hypersensitivity.

- **Results**: A total of 769 medical records from patients who experienced an insect sting were reviewed. Of 120 patients with a systemic reaction, 66 (55.0%) received a prescription for injectable epinephrine, and 14 (11.7%) were given information regarding avoidance of the offending insect. Forty-seven patients with systemic reactions (39.2%) were referred to an allergist. Of 28 patients who kept their appointments and underwent skin testing, 3 had negative results and 25 (89%) had positive results and were advised to start immunotherapy.

- **Conclusion**: Adherence to the stinging insect hypersensitivity practice parameter recommendations is poor. Many patients who have experienced a systemic reaction after an insect sting and have sought medical attention do not receive standard recommended care.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^112ktUGx]. Family Practice (2023). High credibility.

Insect bite inflammation may mimic cellulitis and promote unnecessary antibiotic usage, contributing to antimicrobial resistance in primary care. We wondered how general practice clinicians assess and manage insect bites, diagnose cellulitis, and prescribe antibiotics.

This is a quality improvement study in which 10 general practices in England as well as Wales investigated patients attending for the first time with insect bites between April and September 2021. Mode of consultation, presentation, management plan, and reattendance or referral were noted. Total practice flucloxacillin prescribing was compared to that for insect bites.

A combined list size of 161,346 yielded 355 insect bite consultations. Nearly two-thirds were female, ages 3–89 years old, with July as the peak month and a mean weekly incidence of 8 per 100,000. General practitioners still undertook most consultations; the majority were phone consultations, with photo support for over half. Over 40% presented between days 1 and 3, and common symptoms were redness, itchiness, pain, and heat. Recording vital signs was not common, and only 22% of patients were already taking an antihistamine despite 45% complaining of itch. Antibiotics were prescribed to nearly three-quarters of the patients, mainly orally and mostly as flucloxacillin. Reattendance occurred for 12% and referral to hospital for 2%. Flucloxacillin for insect bites contributed a mean of 5.1% of total practice flucloxacillin prescriptions, with a peak of 10.7% in July.

Antibiotics are likely overused in outpatient settings when managing insect bites.

Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.

- **Physical examination and follow-up**: A periodic history and physical examination are appropriate for all women, including those using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after the initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and deemed appropriate by the clinician. The examination should include a special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In cases of undiagnosed, persistent, or abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.

- **Lipid disorders**: Women being treated for hyperlipidemias should be closely monitored if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult (see "WARNINGS", 1d).

- **Liver function**: If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.

- **Fluid retention**: Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution and only with careful monitoring in patients with conditions that might be aggravated by fluid retention.

### Modification of footed pajamas to confirm arthropod bites: The modified onesie biting bug assessment suit [^112cibkv]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

When children present with features of bed bug bites, many parents are reluctant to accept the diagnosis. Furthermore, standard methods to detect arthropods in or around one's home can be expensive, time-consuming, and frustrating. We developed a simple, inexpensive way to provide evidence that the lesions are, in fact, due to arthropod bites. The Modified Onesie Biting Bug Assessment (MOBBA) suit utilizes simple alterations to a full-body onesie-type footed pajama, exposing some body surfaces to insect predators while protecting other areas.

### Ziprasidone mesylate [^117E1ixr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by collecting voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

- **Adverse findings observed in short-term, placebo-controlled trials with oral ziprasidone**: The following findings are based on the short-term placebo-controlled premarketing trials for schizophrenia (a pool of two 6-week, and two 4-week fixed-dose trials) and bipolar mania (a pool of two 3-week flexible-dose trials) in which ziprasidone was administered in doses ranging from 10 to 200 mg/day.

- **Commonly observed adverse reactions in short-term placebo-controlled trials**: The following adverse reactions were the most commonly observed, associated with the use of ziprasidone (incidence of 5% or greater), and were not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients (ziprasidone incidence at least twice that for placebo):

	- **Schizophrenia trials**:
		- Somnolence
		- Respiratory tract infection

	- **Bipolar trials**:
		- Somnolence
		- **Extrapyramidal symptoms, which include the following adverse reaction terms**: extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, dystonia, dyskinesia, and hypokinesia.

### Anaphylaxis following a slow loris bite occurring in an area of forest fragmentation [^117Wk9dW]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

At 12 hours after symptom onset, lip numbness, hoarseness, nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath improved, and there was no evidence of a biphasic anaphylactic reaction. The physical examination showed amelioration of angioedema and decreased conjunctival injection. The bite wound exhibited no signs of infection. The patient was released to self-isolation at home, and the local health department was notified of his positive COVID-19 test.

Home medications included amoxicillin 500 mg/clavulanate 125 mg orally every 12 hours for 5 days for wild animal bite infection prophylaxis and prednisone 50 mg once orally for biphasic reaction prevention. Oseltamivir 75 mg every 12 hours and a vitamin D, E, and C combination tablet once a day were prescribed for his positive COVID-19 antigen test, according to the Indonesian national guidelines at the time, aiming to prevent or mitigate symptomatic infection. For prompt self-treatment of a biphasic reaction, he was given a tuberculin syringe prefilled with 0.3 mg epinephrine, written instructions on usage and indications, and a demonstration of its use. Education regarding rabies vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was provided, along with a referral to a government facility for further treatment.

### Use of immunotherapy in the management of presumed anaphylaxis to the deer fly [^115AFVN8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Anaphylactic reactions to biting insects are generally thought to be rare events. Diagnostic and therapeutic standards for these events are not well documented in the literature.

- **Objective**: We describe a case report of a patient with multiple suspected immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated anaphylactic reactions to biting insects, specifically deer flies (Chrysops sp.), as well as a successful response to immunotherapy.

- **Methods**: Prick and intradermal testing with deer fly whole-body extract and measurement of specific IgE were performed to help determine the extent of the patient's hypersensitivity. Immunotherapy was subsequently administered with whole-body deer fly extract.

- **Results**: Skin testing was unable to differentiate between the patient and normal controls. In vitro testing was positive in the study patient but only at a low level. After initiating immunotherapy, the patient had repeated exposures to deer fly bites but failed to develop symptoms consistent with his previous anaphylactic episodes. Follow-up testing on the patient revealed no significant change in the level of skin reactivity or specific IgE.

- **Conclusions**: Anaphylaxis consistent with an IgE-mediated mechanism to Chrysops sp. is a real phenomenon and is amenable to immunotherapy for the prevention of life-threatening sequela after exposure. Skin testing using whole-body extract appears to be unreliable. In vitro testing was better able to discern a true sensitivity, although the difference between patient and controls was small.

### Dermatofibroma located on the tarsal plate after upper blepharoplasty [^111hE5uv]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Dermatofibroma is a firm, skin-colored, or reddish-brown sessile papule or nodule. It arises spontaneously without a known cause or after minor trauma, such as an insect bite. A 39-year-old Asian woman complained of a palpable mass and tenderness in the right upper eyelid. Upon physical examination, a firm, palpable subcutaneous mass was detected in the upper eyelid. Surgical exploration under local anesthesia revealed a fibrotic and firmly attached mass to the tarsal plate. Histopathologic examination indicated the mass was characterized by a fibroblast proliferation in the dermis with an overlying hyperplastic epidermis with frequent basal hyperpigmentation. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of dermatofibroma located on the tarsal plate. This article provides a notable example of an intratarsal location of dermatofibroma.

### A survey of patients with bed bugs in the emergency department [^111izGc9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Bed bugs are one of the most important human ectoparasites in the United States, posing a growing problem in the emergency department (ED). We evaluated 40 ED patients found with a bed bug. The data show that ED patients with bed bugs are statistically more likely to be male, older, more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have higher triage emergency severity index (ESI) scores, and arrive by ambulance than the general ED patient population (p < 0.05).

On average, bed bugs were found 108 minutes following a patient arrived at the ED, after 35% of subjects had already received a blood draw, and after 23% had already undergone a radiology study, thereby putting other ED patients and staff at risk for acquiring the infestation. We found that 13% and 18% of subjects had wheezing and a papular rash, respectively, on physical exam. Of those patients found with a bed bug in the ED, 42% reported having bed bugs at home, and 21% reported a possible home infestation.

### Seroquel [^112iAEmU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **6.1 Clinical study experience**: The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for Seroquel consisting of over 4,300 patients. This database includes 698 patients exposed to Seroquel for the treatment of bipolar depression, 405 patients exposed to Seroquel for the treatment of acute bipolar mania (both as monotherapy and adjunct therapy), 646 patients exposed to Seroquel for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as adjunct therapy, and approximately 2,600 patients and/or normal subjects exposed to one or more doses of Seroquel for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Among these approximately 4,300 subjects, about 4,000 (2,300 for schizophrenia, 405 for acute bipolar mania, 698 for bipolar depression, and 646 for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder) were patients who participated in multiple-dose effectiveness trials. Their experience totaled approximately 2,400 patient-years. The conditions and duration of treatment with Seroquel varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term as well as longer-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting reports of adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, and laboratory analyses.

### Eluryng [^111jvyqw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Other serious risks include toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which presents symptoms similar to the flu but can become serious very quickly. If you experience symptoms such as an allergic reaction (including hives and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat that causes difficulty in breathing or swallowing), liver problems (including liver tumors), high blood pressure, gallbladder problems, accidental insertion into the bladder, or symptoms of angioedema (especially if you have a family history of this condition), it is essential to contact your healthcare provider or seek emergency treatment immediately.

The most common side effects of Eluryng include:

- **Vaginal and cervical issues**: Tissue irritation inside your vagina or on your cervix, vaginal discharge, vaginal discomfort
- **Neurological and mood effects**: Headache (including migraine), mood changes (such as depression, especially if you had depression in the past)
- **Eluryng-specific issues**: Ring slipping out or causing discomfort
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Nausea and vomiting
- **General discomfort**: Weight gain, breast pain, discomfort, or tenderness, abdominal pain
- **Menstrual and sexual effects**: Painful menstrual periods, decreased sexual desire
- **Dermatological effects**: Acne

Some women may experience spotting or light bleeding during Eluryng use. If these symptoms occur, do not discontinue its use as the problem will usually resolve itself. However, if the symptoms persist, you should consult your healthcare provider.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^113swjNC]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Time from the presentation was recorded in 79.2% of cases. The mode of presentation was 1–3 days post-bite in 42.5% of the cohort, with a range of presentations from within 1 day to over 3 weeks. Single bite presentations were noted in 58.3% of cases, while multiple bites were reported in 38%, with 3.7% unrecorded. The site of the bite was not recorded in 58% of cases, possibly due to the use of images. However, when recorded, bites were mainly on the lower limb (27%), with 2.3% on the face and 0.9% involving the eye area.

Recorded symptoms and signs were reported by patients or general practice clinicians (GPCs) during consultations. Redness was noted in 77.7% of cases, itch in 45.4%, heat in 36.9%, and pain in 31.5%. Swelling was found in 19.7% and discharge in 6.8%. Systemic upset, such as malaise, was recorded in 10.7% of cases, with 8.1% of malaise reports occurring in phone-only consultations. Pyrexia (> 37.5°C) was observed in 1.4%. Other vital signs, such as pulse, were documented in 7.6% of the cohort.

We cannot report on comorbidities as it was unclear whether these were accessed by GPCs using "digital problem screens". Furthermore, we could not analyze the size of bites due to uncertainties in whether the size included areas of surrounding inflammation. There were no presentations of systemic allergic reactions or other insect-borne diseases, as Lyme disease cases had already been excluded.

### Point-of-care ultrasound on management of cellulitis versus local angioedema in the pediatric emergency department [^1122xnD2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether ultrasound can differentiate between cellulitis and angioedema from insect bites in pediatric patients, a prospective, pre-post study was conducted in an urban pediatric emergency department. Patients younger than 21 years, presenting with soft tissue swelling from insect bites without abscesses, were enrolled. The treating physician's pre-test opinions regarding the diagnosis and need for antibiotics were recorded. Ultrasound of the affected areas was performed, and its effects on management were documented. Further imaging, medications, and patient disposition were at the discretion of the enrolling physician. Follow-up was conducted via phone calls within a week of presentation.

Among the 103 patients enrolled with soft tissue swelling secondary to insect bites, ultrasound altered management in 27 (26%) patients (95% confidence interval, 18–35%). Of the patients who were either indeterminate in diagnosis or believed to require antibiotics, ultrasound changed management in 6 (23%) of 26 patients (95% CI, 6%-40%). In cases where antibiotics were not initially thought necessary, ultrasound altered management in 12 (16%) of 77 patients (95% CI, 7%-24%). Patients diagnosed with local angioedema achieved symptom resolution 1.4 days sooner than those diagnosed with cellulitis (mean, -1.389; 95% CI, -2.087 to -0.690; P < 0.001). No patient initially diagnosed with local angioedema received antibiotics upon follow-up.

Point-of-care ultrasound changed physician management in approximately 1 of 4 patients in the pediatric emergency department with soft tissue swelling secondary to insect bites.

### Managing snakebite [^1123C7qv]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Examination - **Bite site**: Look for fang marks, retained fangs, bleeding, swelling, bruising, discoloration, and blisters. Fang marks do not confirm snakebite since bites by lizards, fish, rodents, large spiders, and some insects and thorns also leave paired punctures. The absence of fang marks does not preclude envenoming, as many snake species produce faint or undetectable bites. Raised vertical, red, tender streaks on the bitten limb suggest lymphangitis. Regional lymph nodes may be enlarged and tender with bruised overlying skin. Note any tourniquets, ligatures, wound incisions, cauterization, and local traditional remedies as these may lead to specific complications requiring management. For instance, tourniquets and ligatures, if left on for long, can cause severe local damage, including ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene. Similarly, incisions and local applications can lead to local bacterial infections, sepsis, and tetanus.

- **Systemic examination**: Look for signs of coagulopathy such as subconjunctival, retinal, nasal, and gingivobuccal bleeds, ecchymoses, and internal hemorrhage (such as intracranial, pericardial, pleural, and retroperitoneal). Assess extraocular movements, bulbar function, and muscle power. Look for ptosis, muscle tenderness, and jaw stiffness. Jaw stiffness is a prominent but often overlooked feature in sea snake envenoming that, unlike trismus, can be reduced by sustained pressure on the lower jaw.

- **Identifying snake species**: Occasionally, patients or accompanying persons may bring the killed snake for identification or have a picture of it. A herpetologist can be consulted for accurate identification.

### Haloette [^1164iMaW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Other serious risks include toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Some of the symptoms are much the same as the flu, but they can become serious very quickly. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency treatment right away if you have the following symptoms: allergic reaction, including hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat causing difficulty in breathing or swallowing (anaphylaxis and/or angioedema); liver problems, including liver tumors; high blood pressure; gallbladder problems; accidental insertion into bladder; symptoms of a problem called angioedema if you already have a family history of angioedema.

- **The most common side effects of Haloette are**: Tissue irritation inside your vagina or on your cervix; headache (including migraine); mood changes (including depression, especially if you had depression in the past). Call your healthcare provider immediately if you have any thoughts of harming yourself; Haloette problems, including the ring slipping out or causing discomfort; nausea and vomiting; vaginal discharge; weight gain; vaginal discomfort; breast pain, discomfort, or tenderness; painful menstrual periods; abdominal pain; acne; less sexual desire.

Some women have spotting or light bleeding during Haloette use. If these symptoms occur, do not stop using Haloette. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your healthcare provider.

### Aquatic invertebrates as unlikely vectors of Buruli ulcer disease [^115uwzmg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Buruli ulcer is a necrotizing skin disease caused by *Mycobacterium ulcerans* and is associated with exposure to aquatic habitats. To assess possible transmission of *M. ulcerans* by aquatic biting insects, we conducted a field examination of biting water bugs (Hemiptera: Naucoridae, Belostomatidae, Nepidae) in 15 disease-endemic and 12 non-disease-endemic areas of Ghana, Africa. From collections of 22,832 invertebrates, we compared the composition, abundance, and associated *M. ulcerans* positivity among sites.

- **Findings**: Biting hemipterans were rare and represented a small percentage (usually < 2%) of invertebrate communities. No significant differences were found in hemipteran abundance or pathogen positivity between disease-endemic and non-disease-endemic sites, and between the abundance of biting hemipterans and *M. ulcerans* positivity. Therefore, although infection through insect bites is possible, little field evidence supports the assumption that biting hemipterans are primary vectors of *M. ulcerans*.

### Stinging insect identification: Are the allergy specialists any better than their patients [^1172SzrV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

It has been reported that the general population is not skillful at identifying stinging insects, with the exception of the honeybee. No information is available to evaluate allergy physicians' accuracy with stinging insect identification.

- **Objective**: To measure the accuracy of allergists' ability to identify stinging insects and assess their common practices for evaluating individuals with suspected insect hypersensitivity.

- **Methods**: A picture-based survey and a dried specimen insect box were constructed to determine allergists' and nonallergists' accuracy in identifying insects. Allergists attending the 2013 American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology meeting were invited to participate in the study. Common practice approaches for evaluating individuals with stinging insect hypersensitivity were also investigated using a brief questionnaire.

- **Results**: Allergy physicians are collectively better at insect identification than nonallergists. Overall, the mean (SD) number of correct responses for nonallergists was 5.4 (2.0) of a total of 10. This score was significantly lower than the score for allergists (6.1 [2.0]; p = 0.01) who participated in the study. Most allergists (78.5%) test for all stinging insects and use skin testing (69.5%) as the initial test of choice for evaluating individuals with insect hypersensitivity.

- **Conclusion**: Overall, allergists are more skilled at Hymenoptera identification. Most allergy specialists reported testing for all stinging insects when evaluating insect hypersensitivity, and skin testing was the preferred testing method.

### Capybara bites: Report of human injury caused by a Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris [^1139gzz9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Health care demand due to animal bites is frequent, especially in the emergency department (ED). In addition to the physical trauma caused by bites, concerns include infectious diseases that can be transmitted. The range of the lesions depends on the animal species. Bites of Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris (capybaras) in humans are relatively uncommon. Capybaras are docile animals; however, their large rodent incisive teeth could cause serious injury. Localized care, antibiotic therapy when necessary, careful examination of the structures, tetanus and rabies immunization as indicated, and follow-up are recommended for wild animal bites. The authors describe and discuss the medical management of a case with multiple lesions from capybara bites on the right thigh of a man.

- **Case report**: A 54-year-old male patient was admitted to the ED with a compression bandage soaked with blood after being bitten by a capybara. At the clinical examination, the patient had two lacerating wounds and multiple abrasions on the anterior face of the right thigh. Rabies prophylaxis was administered, and the wounds were irrigated and closed with sterile dressings. Oral amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium for 7 days was administered to the patient. The patient was followed up; 3 months after the attack, he returned to his previous level of activity without any complication.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: We recommend that practitioners and physicians provide prompt attention due to potentially significant morbidities, particularly rabies.

### Remicade [^116Lfb6U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In Studies I, II, and III, the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in score of at least 75% from baseline at Week 10 by the PASI (PASI 75). In Study I and Study III, another evaluated outcome included the proportion of patients who achieved a score of "cleared" or "minimal" by the sPGA. The sPGA is a 6-category scale ranging from "5 = severe" to "0 = cleared", indicating the physician's overall assessment of the psoriasis severity focusing on induration, erythema, and scaling. Treatment success, defined as "cleared" or "minimal", consisted of none or minimal elevation in plaque, up to faint red coloration in erythema, and none or minimal fine scale over less than 5% of the plaque.

Study II also evaluated the proportion of patients who achieved a score of "clear" or "excellent" by the relative Physician's Global Assessment (rPGA). The rPGA is a 6-category scale ranging from "6 = worse" to "1 = clear", assessed relative to baseline. Overall lesions were graded with consideration to the percent of body involvement as well as overall induration, scaling, and erythema. Treatment success, defined as "clear" or "excellent", consisted of some residual pinkness or pigmentation to marked improvement, with nearly normal skin texture, although some erythema may be present.

### Insect bite-induced hypersensitivity and the SCRATCH principles: A new approach to papular urticaria [^116MWCqL]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Insect bites and the associated hypersensitivity reactions, known as papular urticaria, account for a significant number of referrals from pediatricians and dermatologists to our pediatric dermatology clinic. Unfortunately, children affected by these eruptions are frequently misdiagnosed and often subject to expensive evaluations, including invasive and unnecessary procedures. Here, we review the course of four children with the typical physical findings and natural history of these reactions. Based on our clinical findings and experience with this patient population, we propose a set of principles (termed "SCRATCH") as clinical features to aid clinicians in making an early and accurate clinical diagnosis. We conclude that a more appropriate term for future study and diagnosis of this entity is insect bite-induced hypersensitivity.

Arthritis Care & Research (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tick bites, specifically the evaluation for Lyme disease, the 2021 guidelines by AAN/ACR/IDSA recommend considering antibody testing over currently available direct detection methods (such as PCR or culture performed on blood or skin samples). This is advised for patients with one or more skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for, erythema migrans. Testing should be performed on an acute-phase serum sample, followed by a convalescent-phase serum sample if the initial result is negative.

### Epipen Jr [^111ZS3pQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are used for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I), including anaphylaxis. They are effective in situations such as:

- **Insect-related causes**: Stinging insects (e.g. order Hymenoptera, which includes bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, fire ants) and biting insects (e.g. triatoma, mosquitoes).
- **Allergen-related causes**: Allergen immunotherapy, foods, drugs, diagnostic testing substances (e.g. radiocontrast media), other allergens.
- **Other causes**: Idiopathic anaphylaxis, exercise-induced anaphylaxis.

These medications are intended for immediate administration in patients identified as being at increased risk for anaphylaxis, including individuals with a history of anaphylactic reactions.

Anaphylactic reactions can occur within minutes after exposure and may include the following symptoms:

- **Cardiovascular symptoms**: Flushing, apprehension, syncope, tachycardia, thready or unobtainable pulse associated with a fall in blood pressure.
- **Neurological symptoms**: Convulsions.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, involuntary voiding.
- **Respiratory symptoms**: Wheezing, dyspnea due to laryngeal spasm.
- **Dermatological symptoms**: Pruritus, rashes, urticaria, angioedema.

EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are designed for immediate use as emergency supportive therapy but are not a substitute for immediate medical care. They are non-selective alpha and beta-adrenergic receptor agonists specifically indicated for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I), including anaphylaxis.

### Cimex lectularius ("bed bugs"): Recognition, management, and eradication [^116vgYdn]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Reports of bed bug infestations in major cities in the United States and abroad have been widely covered in the public press. Physicians and other clinicians who care for children need to be able to recognize bed bug bites and understand the social, psychological, and medical implications that this diagnosis will have on patients and their families. In this article, a case presentation serves to guide discussion regarding establishing the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and the management of bed bug bites and their complications.

- **Integrated pest management programs**: These involve housing managers, residents, and professional pest exterminators to provide both chemical and nonchemical solutions for eradication of bed bug infestations.

### Venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings [^115YoN5q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is commonly used to prevent further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have experienced a sting reaction. The efficacy and safety of this treatment had not previously been assessed by a high-quality systematic review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of immunotherapy using extracted insect venom for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in individuals who have had an allergic reaction to a sting.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to February 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), the Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval System, and OpenGrey. There were no language or publication status restrictions. We also searched trials databases, abstracts from recent European and North American allergy meetings, and the references of identified review articles to find additional relevant trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of venom immunotherapy using standardised venom extract in insect sting allergy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. We identified adverse events from included controlled trials and from a separate analysis of observational studies identified as part of a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Health Technology Assessment.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^116uDnSW]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Insect bite inflammation may mimic cellulitis and promote unnecessary antibiotic usage, contributing to antimicrobial resistance in primary care. We wondered how general practice clinicians assess and manage insect bites, diagnose cellulitis, and prescribe antibiotics.

- **Method**: This is a quality improvement study in which 10 general practices in England as well as Wales investigated patients attending for the first time with insect bites between April and September 2021. Mode of consultation, presentation, management plan, and reattendance or referral were noted. Total practice flucloxacillin prescribing was compared to that for insect bites.

- **Results**: A combined list size of 161,346 yielded 355 insect bite consultations. Nearly two-thirds were female, ages 3–89 years old, with July as the peak month and a mean weekly incidence of 8 per 100,000. GPs still undertook most consultations, most of which were phone consultations, with photo support for over half. Over 40% presented between days 1 and 3, and common symptoms were redness, itchiness, pain, and heat. Vital sign recording was not common, and only 22% of patients were already taking an antihistamine despite 45% complaining of itch. Antibiotics were prescribed to nearly three-quarters of the patients, mainly orally and mostly as flucloxacillin. Reattendance occurred for 12% and referral to hospital for 2%. Flucloxacillin for insect bites contributed a mean of 5.1% of total practice flucloxacillin prescriptions, with a peak of 10.7% in July.

- **Conclusions**: Antibiotics are likely to be overused in cases of insect bites.

### Papules, pustules, and rhinoconjunctivitis in a 4-year-old [^116F6DEo]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

In what way(s) can dermestid exposure lead to symptoms?

- **Type 1 IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to larval parts or type 4 delayed hypersensitivity reaction to larval parts**: Correct. Dermestid larvae have rows of easily detachable hairs called setae. It is unknown whether mechanical penetration of the skin or interactions between the human immune system and highly allergenic chitin comprising the setae are responsible for manifestations from dermestid exposure. In type 1 reactions, symptoms typically occur immediately upon exposure to the allergen and often include allergic rhinitis, asthma, and urticaria. In type 2 reactions, symptoms typically occur 2 to 3 days after exposure to the allergen and often manifest as allergic contact dermatitis type eruptions.

- **Dermestidae serve as vectors for a parasite for which humans are hosts**: Incorrect. Dermestidae do not harbor known human parasites.

- **Inflammatory reaction/physical trauma from dermestid bites**: Incorrect. Dermestid larvae and beetles do not bite humans.

### Klisyri [^1151o5SW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical trials experience**: Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions; hence, adverse reaction rates observed in one drug's trials cannot be directly compared to those in another drug's trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Two double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials involved 702 adult subjects with actinic keratosis on the face or scalp. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to Klisyri or vehicle. Participants had 4 to 8 clinically typical, visible, and discrete actinic keratosis (AK) lesions in a contiguous area of 25 cm² on the face or scalp. The subjects' average age was 70 years (range 45 to 96 years), and they were predominantly White (99%), male (87%), with Fitzpatrick skin types I or II (72%). The actinic keratosis was located on the face (68%) or scalp (32%). Treatment groups were comparable across all demographics and baseline characteristics, including AK lesion count and distribution on the face or scalp.

In the controlled trials, local skin reactions (LSRs) were collected independently of adverse events. Local skin reactions such as erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosions/ulcerations were assessed by investigators using a grading scale: 0 = absent, 1 = mild (slightly, barely perceptible), 2 = moderate (distinct presence), and 3 = severe (marked, intense).

### Urological evidence of tick bites in children [^114owZW1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Ticks pose a serious threat to individuals of all ages owing to numerous physical illnesses, including chills, aches, and a rash. Tick-borne illnesses range from a mild fever that may be treated at home to a severe disease necessitating hospitalization. Children are at an increased risk of tick bites due to their exposure to tick-infested areas during the summer. We report two cases of boys aged 3 and 8 years who sustained tick bites to the hemiscrotum and penis. Overnight hospitalization and a course of antibiotics were mandatory. In the first case, the child experienced significant scrotal cellulitis with erythema and edema extending to the suprapubic area, with induration of the right anterior scrotum at the site of the tick bite. A scrotal ultrasound demonstrated swelling of the scrotal wall. In the second case, considerable swelling and induration of the distal penis and glans, pruritus of the left groin and penis, and an erythematous rash over the entire anterior pelvis were observed. A high index of suspicion is warranted because a tick bite may present as penile edema. Pediatric emergency physicians should be aware of the risks associated with tick bites and accurately diagnose and initiate treatment to prevent morbidity and mortality.

### From bites to bytes: Evaluating user engagement and mosquito bite exposure patterns with the Bite Diary smartphone application [^117P8Azu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Additionally, we detected 11 records in Bite Diary, in which 10 participants logged bites outside of their assigned 7-day bite monitoring periods. These records were created up to 3 days after the end of the bite monitoring period or 1 day before the start of the bite monitoring period (on the day of the workshop). Of these 11 records, five indicated no bite, two indicated one bite, one indicated two bites, two indicated four bites, and one indicated 10 bites. These 11 records were excluded from further data analysis.

When comparing the date and time of bite record creation, which was automatically captured by the app, to the date and time of bite exposure entered by the user, we found that 91% of records (116 out of 128) were created within a 24-hour period of the reported bite exposure. We defined immediate logs as those records for which less than 1 hour had elapsed between the reported bite exposure time and the time of record creation. There were 77 such immediate logs (60%), with an average duration of 6.6 minutes (SD = 11) between the reported bite exposure time and the time the record was created.

- **Table 2**: Amount of time in hours that elapsed between the time of the bite exposure, which was reported by participants, and the time of record creation, which was automatically captured by the app

For the participants who reported getting bitten and recorded bites in Bite Diary during their respective bite monitoring periods, we requested information on their app usage. When asked to estimate how often they recorded the bites in Bite Diary, either immediately

### Study on the correlation between age and changes in mosquito bite response [^111GnSUQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Mosquito bite reactions consist of an immediate response characterized by an erythema and a wheal, which peaks at 20 minutes, and a delayed response characterized by a papule and/or an erythema, which peaks at 24 hours. Mosquito bite reactions progress from stage I to stage V as an individual is repeatedly bitten as follows: stage I, neither immediate nor delayed reaction; stage II, delayed reaction; stage III, both immediate and delayed reaction; stage IV, immediate reaction; and stage V, neither immediate nor delayed reaction. In 1985, we conducted a cross-sectional study that demonstrated a positive association between age and stage in response to an Aedes albopictus bite among 162 healthy volunteers. However, it remains unknown how the mosquito bite reaction stage progresses in the same individual over decades.

In the present study, the mosquito bite reaction of 10 subjects from the 1985 cross-sectional cohort was longitudinally evaluated over 30 years. We confirmed the time-dependent progression of stage in four subjects. One stage II subject and three stage III subjects had advanced to the next stage. We found that, contrasting with the general trend found in previous studies, the majority of the subjects (6/10) remained at stage III over the 30-year study period. Upon closer inspection, this apparently non-progressive group demonstrated a reduction in the size of the delayed reactions. The present study demonstrated a marked individual variability in the course of stage progression.

### Prospective audit of 106 consecutive human bite injuries: The importance of history taking [^1169ajf4]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Some patients attempt to conceal human bites with factitious mechanisms of injury. Follow-up questioning allows patients to modify their histories. This practice was prospectively audited.

- **Methods**: Patients with cutaneous wounds who did not present with a history of human bite were asked a follow-up question. Those who then gave a history of human bite were noted.

- **Results**: Certain groups of patients with human bites were significantly more likely to provide a factitious history and/or delay presentation.

- **Conclusion**: Follow-up questioning dramatically increased the case-detection rate, prompting specific management.

### The eyelid SIGN: A clue to bed bug bites [^111kneqW]. Pediatric dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

In pediatric patients, determining the culprit insect in arthropod assaults can be challenging. The patient's history may be vague, the causative insect may not be readily associated with the bites, and the clinical appearance of bites can be variable. Six pediatric patients from the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center dermatology offices with bed bug bites were identified. All had bites involving the face, trunk, and extremities. Five patients demonstrated papules on one upper eyelid associated with erythema and edema. One patient had papules on both upper eyelids. When an arthropod assault is suspected, the "eyelid sign", i.e. bites involving the upper eyelid associated with erythema and edema, may point to bed bugs.

### A case of dupilumab used to treat the exaggerated response to insect bites in the setting of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^112wiAbs]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old man presented to our dermatology clinic with a 2-year history of extreme cutaneous reactions to insect bites. The patient experienced marked edema and erythema that developed days after the insect bites, occasionally followed by blistering and skin ulcerations that healed with scarring. These reactions significantly affected the patient's quality of life and were largely unavoidable due to his occupation as a landscaper. His medications included bupropion, omeprazole, budesonide-formoterol, and trazodone, and he weighed 90 kg.

The onset of the extreme cutaneous reaction to insect bites coincided with the patient's recent diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). His medical history also included depression, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and asthma. A skin biopsy revealed an ulcer with papillary and reticular perivascular and interstitial dermatitis with numerous eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence ruled out bullous pemphigoid. Laboratory findings were notable for anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL and absolute eosinophilia of 872 cells/μL. The diagnosis was of an exaggerated response to insect bites in the setting of CLL.

### Mantle cell lymphoma presenting with exaggerated skin reaction to insect bites [^1148kgsS]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 62-year-old African-American woman with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the dermatology clinic for "bug bites". Skin examination showed resolving bullae on the shins and post-inflammatory pigment changes. Histopathology showed eosinophilic spongiosis and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) was negative for IgG, IgM, IgA, and C3. After returning to the clinic with severe bullous eruptions, the patient presented with anemia, lymphocytosis, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. An exuberant bite reaction in the setting of lymphoma was suspected. Further workup with hematology revealed elevated IgG and total protein levels. Flow cytometry showed a B-cell lymphoma subtype. Extensive imaging was positive for diffuse lymphadenopathy, with accompanying evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Our case highlights the importance of considering an exuberant arthropod bite reaction in the setting of undiagnosed lymphoma in a patient with bullous eruption and negative DIF.

### Mosquito allergy: Clinical features and natural course [^113xpNgS]. The Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Mosquito bite allergic reactions are due to sensitization to mosquito salivary proteins. The purpose of our study was to assess the clinical features of Thai patients with mosquito allergy and to define the natural desensitization course. Seventy patients with mosquito allergy were enrolled, with most patients being female. Half of the patients had a personal history of atopy. The average age of onset of mosquito reaction was 5.7 years old (range 2–58). Four patients were in the desensitization phase, in which clinical symptoms disappeared within 9.5 years (median).

The common cutaneous lesions were erythematous papules (68.6%) and immediate wheals (67.1%). The most common area of involvement was the leg. Forty out of 50 patients (80%) had positive skin prick testing to mosquito allergen (Culex quinquefasciatus), and 31 out of 42 patients (73.8%) had positive immunoglobulin E antibodies against allergens in C. quinquefasciatus saliva proteins.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices [^116UCxDV]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

These results highlight a mean incidence of the first presentation to general practices of insect bites of 8 per 100,000 population weekly over the six months of the study. A study from 1999–2003 exploring both insect bites and impetigo reported an incidence of 5.4 per 100,000 population in England as well as Wales over 12 months. As insect bite incidence reduces in the winter, our figure is comparable but does not represent additional consultations by alternative primary care providers.

In contrast to NICE guidance, 74% of our patients received an oral or topical antibiotic, most commonly flucloxacillin. This choice adheres to guideline recommendations for cellulitis, and some prescribing reflected reported patient adverse reactions or allergies. Flucloxacillin for insect bites is, therefore, a small contributor to the rise in flucloxacillin prescribing over the summer months. We found a difference between the previously reported idealization of practice by surveyed GPs and practice-based clinician activity. For example, vital signs were not prime factors in antibiotic prescribing. Either there is a high incidence of cellulitis, or there is overprescribing, with scope to improve antibiotic stewardship by exploring management as the next stage of quality improvement (QI). Although it is a small effect at the level of ten practices, the potential impact on antibiotic stewardship at the UK level is significant.

In addition, most patients still contact their general practices first but meet an expanded clinical team, with nurses seeing over a third of consulters. Almost 70% of consultations start by phone.

### Seroquel XR [^113hfCnx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical trials are conducted under a variety of conditions, making it difficult to directly compare adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of one drug with those of another. These rates may not reflect those observed in clinical practice.

The following information is derived from a clinical trial database for Seroquel XR, consisting of approximately 3400 patients exposed to the drug for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder in placebo-controlled trials. This experience corresponds to approximately 1020.1 patient-years. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting data from physical examinations, vital signs, body weights, laboratory analyses, and ECG results.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced an adverse reaction of the type listed at least once.

- **Adverse reactions leading to the discontinuation of treatment in short-term, placebo-controlled trials**:

	- **Schizophrenia**: There were no adverse reactions leading to discontinuation that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 2% for Seroquel XR in schizophrenia trials.

	- **Bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episodes**: There were no adverse reactions leading to discontinuation that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 2% for Seroquel XR in the bipolar mania trial.

### Optimizing intradermal administration of cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in controlled human malaria infection [^113PCBXQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

As previously described, the kinetics of the parasitemia differed from results documented during traditional CHMI by mosquito bite. Thus, we examined clinical symptoms to determine if differences existed between groups and between the two techniques. Systemic reactogenicity was documented for the period during which malaria would be expected to manifest (Days 8–18 post-CHMI).

During this inpatient period, three subjects (10.3%) experienced a severe reaction, and 11 subjects (37.9%) experienced moderate reactions. The most frequently reported moderate severity reactions were oral temperature (nine subjects, 31.0%), malaise and myalgia (seven subjects, 24.1%), and chills (six subjects, 20.7%).

- **Severe reactions**:
	- Severe oral temperature (ranging from 100.4°F to 102.2°F) was reported for two subjects, both in Group F (5 × 10⁴ total dose of PfSPZ ID in eight injections aliquot into 10 μL volume; i.e. 5 × 10⁴ PfSPZ ID 8 × 10 μL).
	- Two subjects had severe malaise (Group C: 1 × 10⁴ PfSPZ ID 2 × 10 μL and one in Group F: 5 × 10⁴ PfSPZ ID 8 × 10 μL).
	- **One subject had a severe headache (Group C**: 1 × 10⁴ PfSPZ ID 2 × 10 μL).
	- **One subject had severe chills (Group F**: 5 × 10⁴ PfSPZ ID 8 × 10 μL).

The numbers of subjects by group experiencing a severe systemic reaction are shown in Table 3.
