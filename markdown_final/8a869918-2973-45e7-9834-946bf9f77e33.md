## Question

colon cancer screening

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about colon cancer screening recommendations, including when to start, when to stop, which tests to choose, how to handle high-risk patients, and how to navigate controversies and implementation issues. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target population and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the age to initiate screening and reconcile differing guideline positions. Next, I will review when to stop screening and the role of life expectancy. After that, I need to examine the recommended screening modalities and intervals. Then, I should address high-risk populations and special situations. Finally, I will consider controversies, implementation, and a practical decision framework, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements and correct them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the target population and risk stratification. Average-risk adults are those without prior colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, or a personal/family history of hereditary syndromes like Lynch or FAP. This group comprises roughly three-quarters of the US population with a lifetime CRC risk near 4%, and screening recommendations apply to asymptomatic adults 45 years and older in this category [^115h56Y7] [^113CChUs] [^115wiiSJ].

> Now, I should verify the age to start screening. The USPSTF gives a Grade A for ages 50–75 and a Grade B for offering screening at 45–49, reflecting moderate certainty of moderate net benefit, with modeling showing modest gains in life-years and cases/deaths averted by starting at 45 versus 50, which operationalizes the earlier start for average-risk adults [^114yMWPa] [^1129x9Ny]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — other societies differ: the ACS strongly recommends starting at 45 for all, the ACG and MSTF suggest offering screening at 45–49 with stronger support for 50–75, and the ACP advises starting at 50 and suggests clinicians consider not screening 45–49 due to uncertainty, so I need to ensure shared decision-making for 45–49 given this heterogeneity [^112p4YTj] [^111G4Kxf] [^112EHEMn]. I should double-check the rationale for 45: incidence in 45–49 is rising and advanced neoplasia prevalence approaches that of 50–59, which supports an earlier start, though absolute risk remains lower than in older cohorts [^1145fW4T] [^114MVBHj] [^113CChUs].

> Next, I should review when to stop screening. The USPSTF recommends a Grade C for selective screening in 76–85 based on health, prior screening, and preferences, and advises stopping after 85. The ACS similarly individualizes 76–85 and discourages screening beyond 85. The ACP recommends stopping after 75 or when life expectancy is 10 years or less. The ACG/MSTF support individualized decisions beyond 75 with attention to comorbidity and prior screening history, so I need to ensure I incorporate life expectancy and prior test results into cessation decisions [^114yMWPa] [^1139Kohu] [^112EHEMn] [^112p4YTj] [^113LxijY]. Wait, let me verify the time-to-benefit point: modeling suggests it takes about 10 years to avert one CRC death per 1000 screened, so patients with limited life expectancy are unlikely to benefit and may experience net harm from procedural risks, reinforcing the need to stop in that context [^116567e4].

> I will now examine the recommended screening modalities and intervals. Tier 1 options consistently include colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT; flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, CT colonography every 5 years, and multitarget stool DNA (FIT-DNA) every 3 years are acceptable alternatives when first-line tests are declined or unavailable; I should confirm that any non-colonoscopy positive result requires timely colonoscopy for definitive evaluation and that test performance and patient preferences guide selection [^114Z8NT9] [^1142WG9t] [^117G7UT7]. Hold on, I should verify interval nuances: FIT is annual, colonoscopy is 10 years, sigmoidoscopy can be 5–10 years, CT colonography is 5 years, and FIT-DNA is 3 years; importantly, the USPSTF includes FIT-DNA and CT colonography among acceptable options, whereas the ACP 2023 guidance advises against stool DNA and CT colonography, so I need to reconcile this by aligning with local policy, payer coverage, and patient values while ensuring follow-up colonoscopy for positive noninvasive tests [^114yMWPa] [^112EHEMn] [^1142WG9t].

> Let me consider high-risk populations and special situations. For individuals with a first-degree relative with CRC or advanced adenoma, guidelines converge on starting at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative's diagnosis, whichever is earlier, typically with colonoscopy and shorter intervals. For suspected or confirmed hereditary syndromes, earlier and more intensive strategies are warranted. For second-degree relatives, average-risk screening is generally appropriate, though I should confirm family details carefully [^115BF2Tw] [^116muiy4] [^112m6Eym] [^116XWdR1]. I should double-check that prior adenomas or prior CRC place patients into surveillance pathways rather than average-risk screening, and that inflammatory bowel disease requires a different cadence altogether, which is outside the scope of average-risk guidance [^114V26Lh].

> But wait, what about controversies and implementation issues. The 45–49 debate hinges on absolute risk, modeling, and competing priorities; while some societies endorse 45 universally, others remain cautious, so shared decision-making is essential, especially given lower ADR in 45–49 compared with 50–54 in some cohorts and persistent underuse of screening overall [^1155rsHJ] [^117DqfX1]. I need to ensure we address disparities, access, and follow-up colonoscopy completion, because positive stool tests without timely colonoscopy worsen outcomes; personalized risk tools and polygenic risk scores may refine starting ages in the future, but they are not yet ready for routine clinical adoption [^116p4SZr] [^112iYgDa]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the USPSTF explicitly endorsed FIT-DNA as a first-tier option; let me verify — USPSTF accepts multiple modalities including FIT-DNA and CT colonography, but ACG/MSTF prioritize colonoscopy and FIT as first-tier, and ACP 2023 advises against FIT-DNA and CT colonography, so I should present this as a menu with trade-offs and coverage considerations rather than a single hierarchy [^114yMWPa] [^114Z8NT9] [^112EHEMn].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework. Start by confirming average versus high risk. If average risk, offer screening beginning at 45 with shared decision-making for 45–49, and routinely screen 50–75. If high risk, start earlier with colonoscopy and shorter intervals. For ages 76–85, individualize based on health status, prior screening, and life expectancy, and stop after 85. Select a test the patient can complete and that is accessible, ensuring a plan for colonoscopy follow-up if a noninvasive test is positive. Reassess periodically as comorbidities and preferences evolve [^113MuSkD] [^112EHEMn] [^1142WG9t]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with payer policy and local resources, as coverage and availability can shape realistic options and timing [^112Y2DXb].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and consistent with major guidelines: screen average-risk adults starting at 45 with shared decision-making for 45–49, strongly recommend 50–75, individualize 76–85, and stop after 85. Use colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT as preferred options, with sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, and FIT-DNA as acceptable alternatives when first-line tests are not feasible, and always arrange colonoscopy for positive noninvasive results. For high-risk patients, start earlier with colonoscopy and tailor intervals, anchoring on family history and hereditary risk [^114yMWPa] [^1142WG9t] [^114Z8NT9] [^115BF2Tw].

Colon cancer screening is recommended for **average-risk adults aged 45–75 years** [^114yMWPa], with earlier initiation for high-risk individuals (family history, hereditary syndromes, or inflammatory bowel disease) [^112iGYDD] [^112m6Eym]. The most effective options are **colonoscopy every 10 years** or **annual FIT** [^114Z8NT9]; flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography, and stool DNA tests are alternatives if colonoscopy is declined or unavailable [^114Z8NT9]. Screening should be individualized for ages 76–85 based on health, prior screening, and preferences [^112DECVv], and generally discontinued after 85 [^114uYNYf]. Early detection via screening reduces incidence and mortality [^1129x9Ny], but adherence and follow-up colonoscopy for positive noninvasive tests are critical for effectiveness [^114o1EV9].

---

## Recommended screening age ranges

- **Average-risk adults**: Begin screening at age 45 [^114yMWPa] and continue through age 75 [^112DECVv].
- **High-risk adults**: Start earlier (age 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative) [^112iGYDD] if there is a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced adenomas [^114QDyjU], hereditary syndromes (Lynch, FAP) [^113MuSkD], or inflammatory bowel disease [^113MuSkD].
- **Adults aged 76–85**: Individualize based on health, prior screening, and preferences [^112DECVv]; generally discontinue after age 85 [^114uYNYf].

---

## Screening modalities and intervals

| **Modality** | **Interval** | **Effectiveness** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Colonoscopy | Every 10 years | High sensitivity for polyps and cancer; allows polypectomy | Invasive; requires bowel prep; sedation |
| FIT (fecal immunochemical test) | Annually | Noninvasive; detects occult blood | Requires dietary prep; false positives/negatives |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy | Every 5–10 years | Lower invasiveness; detects distal lesions | Limited view; requires enema prep |
| CT colonography | Every 5 years | Noninvasive; full colon evaluation | Radiation exposure; bowel prep |
| Stool DNA (FIT-DNA) | Every 3 years | Noninvasive; detects genetic markers | Higher false positives; more expensive |

---

Colonoscopy and FIT are **first-line options** [^114Z8NT9]; alternatives are used when these are declined or unavailable [^117G7UT7].

---

## Benefits and limitations of screening

### Benefits

Benefits include **reduced incidence and mortality** through early detection and polyp removal [^1142WG9t] and prevention via removal of precancerous polyps [^114o1EV9]. Noninvasive stool tests also improve participation and adherence [^notfound].

---

### Limitations

Limitations include **false positives/negatives** with stool tests and CT colonography, as well as procedural risks such as bleeding or perforation with colonoscopy. Costs and access barriers — including disparities in availability, insurance coverage, and patient acceptance — also limit uptake [^112Y2DXb].

---

## Factors influencing screening choice

- **Patient preferences**: Comfort, convenience, and willingness to undergo invasive procedures [^111TGFhT].
- **Clinical factors**: Age, comorbidities, prior screening history, and risk stratification [^112iGYDD].
- **Resource availability**: Access to colonoscopy, CT colonography, and laboratory services [^112bv8iD].

---

## Impact of screening on incidence and mortality

Screening **reduces colorectal cancer incidence by 20–30%** and mortality by approximately 30% [^1129x9Ny]. Early detection enables less invasive treatments and improves survival [^114o1EV9].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

- **USPSTF**: Screen ages 45–75; individualize 76–85; stop after 85 [^112DECVv].
- **ACS**: Screen starting at 45; individualize 76–85; stop after 85 [^1142WG9t].
- **ACG**: Strong recommendation for 50–75; conditional for 45–49; individualize > 75 [^112p4YTj].

---

## Barriers to screening

- **Patient-related**: Fear, discomfort, lack of awareness, and low health literacy [^notfound].
- **System-related**: Limited access, insurance coverage gaps, and workforce shortages [^112Y2DXb].
- **Cultural and socioeconomic**: Disparities by race, ethnicity, and income [^115VtU9c].

---

## Strategies to improve screening rates

- **Education**: Increase awareness of benefits and options [^114o1EV9].
- **Access**: Expand colonoscopy capacity and insurance coverage [^112Y2DXb].
- **Patient navigation**: Support scheduling, prep, and follow-up [^111TGFhT].
- **Shared decision-making**: Align tests with patient preferences [^112Muz86].

---

Colon cancer screening is recommended for average-risk adults aged 45–75, with earlier initiation for high-risk individuals [^114yMWPa]. Colonoscopy and FIT are the **most effective options** [^notfound], and screening should be individualized for older adults based on health and preferences [^113MuSkD]. Screening reduces incidence and mortality, but adherence and follow-up are essential for effectiveness [^114o1EV9].

### Estimated average-risk colorectal cancer screening-eligible population in the US [^112oAwCP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) expanded the recommended colorectal cancer (CRC) screening age from 50 to 75 years to 45 to 75 years, with selective screening for individuals aged 76 to 85 years. Expanding the screening age downward to age 45 years added approximately 19 million individuals in the US to the average-risk population. The previous estimate did not include individuals aged 76 to 85 years or take into account individuals who use CRC screening modalities that require rescreening at various intervals. Accurate estimates of the CRC screening–eligible population are crucial for facilitating health policy decision-making and optimizing the allocation of health care resources. The objective of this analysis was to provide an updated estimate of average-risk CRC screening–eligible individuals in the US.

### Final recommendation statement: colorectal cancer: screening [^117UgdEP]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation

This final recommendation replaces the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for colorectal cancer. In 2016, the USPSTF recommended screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years (A recommendation). In addition, the USPSTF concluded that the decision to screen for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years should be an individual one, taking into account the patient's overall health and prior screening history (C recommendation) and that screening should be discontinued after age 85 years.

In the current recommendation, while continuing to recommend colorectal cancer screening in adults aged 50 to 75 years (A recommendation), the USPSTF now recommends offering screening starting at age 45 years (B recommendation). As it did in 2016, the USPSTF continues to conclude that screening in adults aged 76 to 85 years should be an individual decision (C recommendation) and screening should be discontinued after age 85 years.

Age-based screening guidance — start, consider not screening, and stop: Clinicians should start screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults at age 50 years. Clinicians should consider not screening asymptomatic average-risk adults between the ages of 45 to 49 years, and clinicians should discuss the uncertainty around benefits and harms of screening in this population. Clinicians should stop screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults older than 75 years or in asymptomatic average-risk adults with a life expectancy of 10 years or less.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115ZPVf2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF colorectal cancer screening initiation and cessation — the USPSTF recommends offering colorectal cancer screening starting at age 45 years. Although the absolute risk of developing colorectal cancer in adults younger than 50 years is lower, rates are 20.0 new colorectal cancer cases per 100 000 persons aged 40 to 49 years, 47.8 new cases per 100 000 persons aged 50 to 59 years, and 105.2 new cases per 100 000 persons 60 years or older, and modeling suggests that starting colorectal cancer screening at age 45 years may moderately increase life-years gained and decrease colorectal cancer cases and deaths compared with beginning screening at age 50 years. In adults aged 76 to 85 years, the age at which the balance of benefits and harms becomes less favorable and screening should be stopped varies based on health status, prior screening status, and individual preferences; modeling studies estimate that generally, few additional life-years are gained when screening is extended past age 75 years among average-risk adults who have previously received adequate screening; and in adults 86 years or older, evidence on benefits and harms is lacking and competing causes of mortality likely preclude any survival benefit that would outweigh the harms of screening.

### Updates on age to start and stop colorectal cancer screening: recommendations from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^1121Xi4A]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry — To approximate an average-risk screening population among adults ages 45 to 49, investigators combined colonoscopies for "low-risk" diagnostic symptoms with screening; low-risk symptoms showed no association with advanced neoplasia (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81–1.24). In this screening-equivalent group, any colorectal neoplasia occurred in 17.5% and advanced colorectal neoplasia in 3.7%; clinically significant serrated polyps were found in 5.9% (including hyperplastic polyp ≥ 1 cm or hyperplastic polyp ≥ 5 mm proximal to the rectosigmoid), similar to ages 50 to 54 years (6.1%).

### Screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^112a9iT3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this guidance statement is to guide clinicians on colorectal cancer screening in average-risk adults.

Methods

This guidance statement is derived from a critical appraisal of guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults and the evidence presented in these guidelines. National guidelines published in English between 1 June 2014 and 28 May 2018 in the National Guideline Clearinghouse or Guidelines International Network library were included. The authors also included 3 guidelines commonly used in clinical practice. Web sites were searched for guideline updates in December 2018. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the quality of guidelines.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults at average risk for colorectal cancer.

Guidance Statement 1

Clinicians should screen for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults between the ages of 50 and 75 years.

Guidance Statement 2

Clinicians should select the colorectal cancer screening test with the patient on the basis of a discussion of benefits, harms, costs, availability, frequency, and patient preferences. Suggested screening tests and intervals are fecal immunochemical testing or high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing every 2 years, colonoscopy every 10 years, or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years plus fecal immunochemical testing every 2 years.

Guidance Statement 3

Clinicians should discontinue screening for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults older than 75 years or in adults with a life expectancy of 10 years or less.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to choice of screening tests, alternative choices, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain non-colonoscopic tests every year and no later than every 3 years in average-risk individuals from the age of 50 not already taking part in colonoscopic screening programs.
Prefer FIT over high-resolution guaiac FOBT due to the better detection rate and positive predictive value for adenomas and cancer.
Obtain a colonoscopy at the earliest convenience if the test results are positive.

### Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk adults: 2018 guideline update from the American cancer society [^114Zmusc]. CA (2018). Medium credibility.

Comparison with other guidelines — start age and sigmoidoscopy strategy: ACS recommends beginning screening at age 45 years, whereas the USPSTF recommends beginning at age 50 years; the USPSTF recommends flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) every 10 years combined with annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which is not included among ACS testing options. The ACS guideline development group (GDG) relied upon randomized controlled trial evidence supporting a 5-year screening interval for FS alone and concluded that the FS-only option at a 5-year interval should be maintained, while noting concerns about continuing to endorse FS because of low availability and utilization in the United States.

### Colonoscopic screening in average-risk individuals ages 40 to 49 vs 50 to 59 years [^112WbPXP]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Screening guidelines for colorectal cancer include colonoscopy starting at age 50 years based on the prevalence of adenomas and the incidence of colon cancer at that age. However, only one prior study has investigated the prevalence of colorectal neoplasia with colonoscopic screening in asymptomatic average-risk individuals ages 40–49 years in the United States.

Methods

We analyzed the results of screening colonoscopies offered to patients of a health care provider that offers screening services as part of an employer-provided wellness program. The primary end points were prevalence of adenomas and cancers for those aged 40–49 years vs those 50–59 years.

Results

We analyzed 553 screening colonoscopies for patients ages 40–49 years and 352 screening colonoscopies for patients ages 50–59 years. In the 40–49 years age group, 79 patients (14%) had 1 or more adenomas, of which 11 (2% of screened) had an advanced neoplasm (> 1 cm). In the 50–59 years age group, 56 patients (16%) had 1 or more adenomas detected. Of those patients, 13 (3.7% of screened) had an advanced neoplasm, and 1 patient (0.3%) had an adenocarcinoma detected.

Conclusions

We found on colonoscopic screening that the prevalence of total adenomas was similar in individuals ages 40–49 and in those 50–59 years, although the prevalence of advanced neoplasia in the 50–59 years age group may be higher than that in the 40–49 years age group.

### Personalized initial screening age for colorectal cancer in individuals at average risk [^112iYgDa]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How can risk variation in individuals without a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) be translated into personalized starting ages of screening?

Findings

In this cohort study of 242 779 participants with no previous screening for and no family history of CRC, derivation of risk-adapted starting ages of screening used 2 major CRC risk indicators, sex and a polygenic risk score (PRS), based on the risk advancement period concept. Risk-adapted starting ages varied by as much as 24 years between men in the highest PRS decile and women in the lowest PRS decile, even among individuals at average risk.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the risk advancement period approach enables derivation of starting ages of screening according to risk factor profiles from large-scale cohort studies, which vary greatly even within individuals at average risk.

### Updates on age to start and stop colorectal cancer screening: recommendations from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^114Z8NT9]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer screening modalities and intervals — average-risk adults: We recommend high-quality colonoscopy every 10 years or an annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) as first-tier options for screening of colorectal neoplasia. We recommend flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years, CT colonography every 5 years, or FIT–fecal DNA every 3 years in individuals who decline colonoscopy and a FIT. We suggest that capsule colonoscopy (if available) is an appropriate screening test every 5 years when individuals decline colonoscopy, FIT, FIT–fecal DNA, CT colonography, and flexible sigmoidoscopy.

### Screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians (version 2) [^112EHEMn]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this updated guidance statement is to guide clinicians on screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) in asymptomatic average-risk adults. The intended audience is all clinicians. The population is asymptomatic adults at average risk for CRC.

Methods

This updated guidance statement was developed using recently published and critically appraised clinical guidelines from national guideline developers since the publication of the American College of Physicians' 2019 guidance statement, "Screening for Colorectal Cancer in Asymptomatic Average-Risk Adults". The authors searched for national guidelines from the United States and other countries published in English using PubMed and the Guidelines International Network library from 1 January 2018 to 24 April 2023. The authors also searched for updates of guidelines included in the first version of our guidance statement. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument was used to assess the quality of eligible guidelines. Two guidelines were selected for adoption and adaptation by raters on the basis of the highest average overall AGREE II quality scores. The evidence reviews and modeling studies for these 2 guidelines were also used to synthesize the evidence of diagnostic test accuracy, effectiveness, and harms of CRC screening interventions and to develop our guidance statements.

Guidance Statement 1

Clinicians should start screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults at age 50 years.

Guidance Statement 2

Clinicians should consider not screening asymptomatic average-risk adults between the ages of 45 to 49 years. Clinicians should discuss the uncertainty around benefits and harms of screening in this population.

Guidance Statement 3

Clinicians should stop screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults older than 75 years or in asymptomatic average-risk adults with a life expectancy of 10 years or less.

Guidance Statement 4a

Clinicians should select a screening test for colorectal cancer in consultation with their patient based on a discussion of benefits, harms, costs, availability, frequency, and patient values and preferences.

Guidance Statement 4b

### Updates on age to start and stop colorectal cancer screening: recommendations from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^1139jqVm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

This document is a focused update to the 2017 colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations from the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. This update is restricted to addressing the age to start and stop CRC screening in average-risk individuals and the recommended screening modalities. Although there is no literature demonstrating that CRC screening in individuals under age 50 improves health outcomes such as CRC incidence or CRC-related mortality, sufficient data support the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force to suggest average-risk CRC screening begin at age 45. This recommendation is based on the increasing disease burden among individuals under age 50, emerging data that the prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in individuals ages 45 to 49 approaches rates in individuals 50 to 59, and modeling studies that demonstrate the benefits of screening outweigh the potential harms and costs. For individuals ages 76 to 85, the decision to start or continue screening should be individualized and based on prior screening history, life expectancy, CRC risk, and personal preference. Screening is not recommended after age 85.

### Age matters: adenoma detection rates in average-risk screening patients aged 45 to 49 compared with those aged 50 to 54 [^1155rsHJ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Goals

This study aims to address gaps in medical knowledge by determining whether adenoma detection rate (ADR) in average-risk screening patients aged 45 to 49 is equivalent to screening patients aged 50 to 54.

Background

Current guidelines recommend initiating colon cancer screening at age 45, yet our understanding of the effects of ADR in average-risk individuals among 45- to 49-year-olds is still limited.

Study

A retrospective analysis was conducted on records of average-risk screening colonoscopies performed on patients aged 45 to 54 from January 2018 to August 2022. Exclusions were prior diagnoses of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, personal or family history of genetic cancer syndromes, incomplete colonoscopy, and inadequate bowel preparation. The primary outcome was ADR in the age 45 to 49 group compared with the age 50 to 54 group.

Results

Of the 3199 average-risk screening colonoscopies performed, 879 and 2116 patients were included in the age 45 to 49 and 50 to 54 groups, respectively. Both groups were predominantly female, White ethnicity, never smokers, and obese. ADR was found to be 27% in the age 45 to 49 group compared with 34% in the age 50 to 54 group (odds ratio 0.70, 90% CI: 0.60–0.83, P -value for equivalence = 0.81 w/ margin 0.77 to 1.30).

Conclusions

The study did not demonstrate equivalent ADR between the 2 age groups, with ADR being substantially lower in the age 45 to 49 group (27% vs. 34%). Despite this, the ADR in the 45 to 49 age range surpasses the established benchmark of 25%, supporting the decision to lower the screening age to 45 years. Ongoing national monitoring is essential to comprehensively evaluate the impact of these updated guidelines.

### Population-level impact of the BMJ rapid recommendation for colorectal cancer screening: a microsimulation analysis [^113DY6xJ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world. Studies have shown that population-based screening for CRC and its precursors can effectively reduce CRC mortality. However, the average lifetime risk of developing CRC is 4%–5%. This implies that 95% of individuals will never develop CRC and thus not benefit from screening while they are exposed to its burdens and potential harms. Therefore, individuals ideally make an informed choice to be screened or not, weighing these expected harms and benefits.

Currently, individuals are recommended to start CRC screening between ages 45 and 60 in most Western countries. In 2019, a BMJ Rapid Recommendation guideline panel proposed screening initiation based on CRC risk instead. This panel summarised and balanced harms, burdens and benefits of CRC screening such as incidence and mortality reduction, required number of screening tests and the risk of complications, given an individual's predicted 15-year risk of CRC. The panel recommended in favour of CRC screening if this risk exceeds 3% and against CRC screening if the risk is below 3% (weak recommendation), effectively suggesting to start screening when an individual's risk exceeds 3%. For risk estimation, the panel used the QCancer-colorectal risk prediction tool, which uses risk factors such as age, sex, smoking status, alcohol status and prior cancer diagnoses. Its discriminative power ranks among the highest of all 'comprehensive' tools: those that use variables that are routinely available in the UK biobank or are easily obtained through questionnaires.

We suggest consideration of genetic evaluation with higher familial CRC burden (higher number and/or younger age of affected relatives). We suggest initiating CRC screening at age 40 or 10 yr before the youngest affected relative and then resuming average-risk screening recommendations for individuals with CRC or advanced polyp in 1 FDR at age ≥ 60 yr. In individuals with 1 second-degree relative (SDR) with CRC or advanced polyp, we suggest following average-risk CRC screening recommendations.

### Are colorectal cancer screening recommendations for first-degree relatives of patients with adenomas too aggressive? [^114jjE2e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Consensus guidelines of the American Cancer Society, the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology recommend first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with an adenoma before age 60 should be screened every 5 years with colonoscopy starting at age 40. This is the identical recommendation for those with a first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) before age 60. There is good evidence that first-degree relatives of individuals diagnosed with CRC before age 60 are at substantially increased risk for developing cancer at a young age. However, it is unclear whether an individual with a first-degree relative with an adenoma diagnosed before age 60 is at increased risk of CRC. Because not all adenomas portend the same cancer risk in the individual who has the adenoma, they would not be expected to portend the same risk in their first-degree relatives. Because of these uncertainties, the US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend more aggressive screening of first-degree relatives of individuals with an adenoma. The adenoma detection rate for individuals 50 to 59 years old without a first-degree relative with CRC is sufficiently high (approximately 25%-30%) that almost half the population would be high risk on the basis of one first-degree relative having an adenoma. Given the weakness of evidence supporting the guidelines, suboptimal levels of screening in the general population, and lack of resources to comply with the recommendation, first-degree relatives of individuals with adenomas should be screened as average-risk persons until more compelling data are available to justify more aggressive screening.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1129x9Ny]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force colorectal cancer screening — modeled benefits per 1000 individuals screened show life-years gained and reductions in colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and deaths, with additional benefit from starting at age 45 y vs 50 y. Outcomes are expressed per 1000 40-year-olds who start screening at age 45 or at age 50. For life-years gained, fecal immunochemical test (FIT) every year shows 292 at age 50 y vs 318 at age 45 y, with 26 additional life-years gained if screening starts at age 45 y. For CRC cases averted, colonoscopy (COL) every 10 y shows 53 at age 50 y vs 61 at age 45 y, with 8 additional CRC cases averted if screening starts at age 45 y. For CRC deaths averted, FIT every year shows 25 at age 50 y and 26 at age 45 y, with 1 additional CRC death averted if screening starts at age 45 y. This overall benefit translates to an estimated 104 to 123 days of life gained per person screened, and lowering the starting age from 50 to 45 years results in an estimated additional 2 to 3 cases of colorectal cancer being averted, an estimated 1 additional colorectal cancer death averted, and an estimated 22 to 27 additional life-years gained per 1000 adults (ie, 8 to 10 additional days of life gained per person screened). Because of imprecision in sensitivity and specificity, there is considerable uncertainty in model predictions for high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (HSgFOBT) strategies, and compared with other options for stool-based screening, these strategies do not provide an efficient balance of the benefits (life-years gained) vs harms and burden.

### Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk adults: 2018 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112Y2DXb]. CA (2018). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening — insurance coverage context and implications for adults aged 45–49 years are described as follows: Insurance coverage policies related to CRC screening are largely driven by the linkage of the ACA's preventive services provisions to USPSTF recommendations, and the current USPSTF recommendation to begin CRC screening at 50 years sets a minimal threshold for insurers; there is no prohibition against coverage for screening at an earlier age, yet many individuals aged 45 to 49 years will experience challenges with insurance coverage for their screening examinations and may face relatively high out-of-pocket costs.

### Colon cancer screening and the end of life: is age just a number? [^111tKWYu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Age is the strongest risk factor for colorectal cancer. Although there is updated guidance for the age at which to start screening, there is little guidance for individuals or their medical teams on how to decide when to stop. Current recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force and other societies focus primarily on age. For patients older than 85 years, guidelines discourage screening because the harms largely outweigh benefits. Although at a population level, the overall benefit of screening in older individuals decreases, one must individualize the recommendation based on comorbidities, functional status, screening history, and gender-not solely base it on age. Patient and caregiver preferences must also be thoroughly explored. Current models struggle with incorporating other colorectal cancer risk factors such as family history, previous adenomas, and modality of previous screening into recommendations and simulations, but are likely to improve with machine learning and whole electronic health record prediction-based approaches.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114yMWPa]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52 980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000–2002 to 2014–2016. In 2016, 26% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31% were not up to date with screening.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and preferences.

### Progress and challenges in colorectal cancer screening and surveillance [^114o1EV9]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death throughout the world. There is evidence that screening of average-risk individuals can result in mortality reduction with early cancer detection and cancer prevention by detection and removal of cancer precursor lesions. The optimal form of screening is not clear. Fecal screening tests can be performed at home at low initial cost, but current versions lack high sensitivity for cancer precursor lesions, and tests need to be repeated at regular intervals. Adherence to repeat testing for negative tests and referral for colonoscopy for positive tests are important elements of program effectiveness. Structural examinations of the colon are more invasive and may result in detection of both early cancer and cancer precursor lesions. Every screening program has advantages and limitations, but each program ultimately depends on quality and patient adherence.

Age to begin colorectal cancer (CRC) screening — burden of disease highlights rising early-onset incidence and cohort patterns. There has been about a 51% increase in CRC among those younger than 50 years since 1994; rectal cancer doubled between 1991 (2.6 of 100,000) and 2014 (5.2 of 100,000) in individuals aged 20 to 49 years, and adults born around 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer and 4 times the risk of rectal cancer compared with adults born around 1950. Increases in colon cancer incidence continued through 2013 for ages 20 to 29 years (2.4% per year) and 30 to 39 years (1.0% per year), and from the mid-1990s to 2013 in adults aged 40 to 54 years. Rates among adults aged 50 to 54 years and 55 to 59 years have converged, with a 12.4% difference in colon cancer rates in 2012–2013, and rectal cancer rates were the same for the 2 age groups; the age-adjusted proportion of CRC in adults younger than 55 years shifted from 11.6% during 1989 to 1990 to 16.6% during 2012 to 2013 for colon tumors and from 14.6% to 29.2% for rectal tumors. Current age-specific incidence is 31.4 per 100,000 for ages 45 to 49 years versus 58.4 per 100,000 for ages 50 to 54 years, and approximately 45.3% of adults aged 50 to 54 years reported recent screening. By race/ethnicity, CRC incidence among blacks, including those younger than 50 years, has historically been higher than among whites, Hispanics, and Asian Americans; although incidence rates for blacks younger than 50 years have remained generally stable, resulting in comparable contemporary incidence between the 2 groups, the CRC incidence rate for individuals younger than 50 years is higher among Alaska Natives than for any other racial/ethnic group in the United States.

### Screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians (version 2) [^115RaBME]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in asymptomatic average-risk adults — scope and target population are defined to guide clinicians on age to start and stop screening and selection of type and frequency of screening tests for asymptomatic average-risk adults, with average risk characterized by no prior diagnosis of CRC, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease, and no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose a person to a high lifetime risk for CRC (for example, Lynch syndrome).

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111LZpmQ]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — age ranges and recommendation strengths for colorectal cancer screening are summarized as follows: There is a general consensus that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened, and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American College of Physicians (ACP), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the US Multi-Society Task Force all recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in this age group. In 2017, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommended beginning screening at age 45 years in Black adults (weak recommendation) and screening at age 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of a family member, whichever is earlier) in persons with a family history for colorectal cancer. In 2018, the ACS recommended that screening begin at age 45 years in all adults (qualified recommendation), while the AAFP's recommendations do not address screening before age 50 years. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology suggested screening in average-risk persons aged 45 to 49 years (conditional recommendation) and recommended screening average-risk persons aged 50 to 75 years (strong recommendation). Generally, guidelines agree that screening should either be individualized in older adults aged 76 to 85 years (ACS, AAFP, and US Multi-Society Task Force) or stopped altogether (ACP), with general consensus that screening should stop after age 85 years.

### Calculating the starting age for screening in relatives of patients with colorectal cancer based on data from large nationwide data sets [^11399kWz]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Although colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines acknowledge the need for earlier screening for high-risk individuals, such as those with family history of CRC, there is limited information on how many years earlier these high-risk individuals should be screened; current practice is based on weak evidence. We aimed to provide risk-adapted recommendations on the starting age of CRC screening for individuals with different family histories.

Methods

We collected data from nationwide family-cancer data sets in Sweden and calculated risk-adapted starting ages of screening for individuals with different family histories of CRC. Family history was defined as a dynamic (time-dependent) variable, allowing for changes during the follow-up period of 1958 through 2015.

Results

During a follow-up of 12,829,251 individuals with genealogy information, 173,796 developed CRC. The 10-year cumulative risk for the average-risk population at age 50 years (the guideline-recommended age for screening) was 0.44%. Individuals with different family histories of CRC attained this equivalent 0.44% risk 3–29 years earlier than their peers in the general population without such a family history. For example, individuals with 1 affected first-degree relative diagnosed before age 45 years reached the corresponding risk level 16 years earlier.

Conclusions

We determined risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening for close or distant relatives of patients with CRC, using high quality nationwide data sets. These findings might be used in counselling individuals about the appropriate age to start CRC screening, to optimize screening practice, and to supplement guidelines for CRC screening.

### Personalized initial screening age for colorectal cancer in individuals at average risk [^116G2bke]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second most common cause of cancer-related death globallyeven though there are effective ways of early detection that could substantially reduce the burden of the disease. Meanwhile, screening for CRC is recommended and offered to the population at average risk in many countries, but screening recommendations, offers, and use vary substantially between countries. For example, CRC screening by screening colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, or DNA-based stool test is now recommended starting from 45 years of age in the US, whereas screening programs starting between 40 and 60 years of age have been implemented or no screening is offered at all in various European countries. Besides variation in CRC incidence between countries, increasing evidence suggests substantial variation of CRC risk within populations, which has prompted suggestions for risk-adapted, personalized screening offers. A particularly relevant issue in this respect is if and to what extent starting ages for CRC screening should be adapted to personal risks. Although recommendations for earlier screening among people with first-degree relatives with CRC have long been established, other major risk determinants are not routinely considered in screening recommendations. Also, there are no established routines for translating the wide variation in CRC risk in individuals without a family history into personalized starting ages of screening. In this study, we illustrate the derivation of risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening based on the concept of risk advancement period (RAP). We illustrate the approach using 2 major CRC risk indicators, sex and a polygenic risk score (PRS), as an example, but the approach could easily accommodate other risk factors for deriving personalized starting ages of screening.

### Colorectal cancer screening [^115cdW9W]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade we have seen dramatic advances in colon cancer screening. Reduction in mortality in average risk screening for colorectal cancer has now been shown in multiple trials. Efforts to increase public awareness and compliance with evidence-based screening guidelines are underway. Recent guidelines have incorporated family history, as it has been identified as a common risk factor. The genes responsible for the inherited syndromes of colon cancer have been identified and genetic testing is available. Currently, screening the average risk population over the age of 50 would reduce mortality from colon cancer by 50%. Future advances will likely include improved screening tests, and the development of familial genetic testing.

Results

The DIRECt consensus produced 31 recommendations for patients diagnosed with eoCRC ≥ 18 years old based on 145 articles (summarized in Supplementary Appendices 2–7). When appropriate, issues related to colon or rectal cancers specifically are highlighted; in cases where statements applied to both colon and rectal cancer, the term colorectal cancer (CRC) was used. All statements are summarized in Tables 2–4 (Table 2: diagnosis, risk factors, and genetics; Table 3: pathology, oncology; Table 4: endoscopic diagnosis and treatment, therapy, and supportive care). Areas of controversy are described throughout the main text and summarized in Table 5.

Section I – Diagnosis (D)

D.1: Comment.

Historically, CRC screening has started at age 50 for average-risk individuals in the United States. As a result, CRC diagnoses in patients aged < 50 have been referred to as early- or young-onset in the literature. Some U.S. societies have recently recommended lowering the average-risk population screening age to 45 years. – For the purpose of continuity and consistency in research, we recommend using the term early-onset CRC (eoCRC) and defining this as CRC diagnosed younger than 50 years of age. However, with changes in age for population-based screening, it will be critical to assess whether there are differences in risk factors, diagnosis, and/or outcomes for those age 45 and older compared with those younger than age 45. Several terms have been used to describe CRC in the youngest age groups. – The Scientific Panel suggested "very early onset" for CRC diagnoses before 35 years based on definitions used in previous studies. – Age 18 is conventionally used to distinguish adult- from pediatric/adolescent-onset cancers.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^116gDpDC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United States. The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guidance statement for clinicians by assessing the current guidelines developed by other organizations on screening for colorectal cancer. When multiple guidelines are available on a topic or when existing guidelines conflict, ACP believes that it is more valuable to provide clinicians with a rigorous review of the available guidelines rather than develop a new guideline on the same topic.

Methods

The authors searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse to identify guidelines developed in the United States. Four guidelines met the inclusion criteria: a joint guideline developed by the American Cancer Society, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology and individual guidelines developed by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the American College of Radiology. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: ACP recommends that clinicians perform individualized assessment of risk for colorectal cancer in all adults. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: ACP recommends that clinicians screen for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults starting at the age of 50 years and in high-risk adults starting at the age of 40 years or 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest affected relative was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 3: ACP recommends using a stool-based test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at average risk. ACP recommends using optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at high risk. Clinicians should select the test based on the benefits and harms of the screening test, availability of the screening test, and patient preferences. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4: ACP recommends that clinicians stop screening for colorectal cancer in adults over the age of 75 years or in adults with a life expectancy of less than 10 years.

As a part of the screening process, all positive results on non-colonoscopy screening tests should be followed up with timely colonoscopy". ACS clarifies, "The recommendation to begin screening at age 45 is a qualified recommendation". and "The recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 y and older is a strong recommendation". For stopping, ACS states, "Average-risk adults in good health with a life expectancy of greater than 10 years continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years (qualified recommendation)". and that clinicians should "individualize CRC screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history (qualified recommendation)". and should "discourage" individuals "over age 85 years" from continuing screening (qualified recommendation).

### Trends in incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer in the United States among those approaching screening age [^116gsDax]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) incidence rates are increasing, and controversy exists regarding whether average-risk screening should begin at 45 or 50 years of age. In 2018, the American Cancer Society recommended that average-risk screening start at 45 years of age. Others recommend screening at 50 years of age, although the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommends screening African American individuals at age 45 years of age owing to higher incidence, mortality, and earlier-onset disease. The American Cancer Society decision incorporated modeling studies that used updated incidence and mortality data encompassing time periods of increasing EOCRC incidence rates; modeling compared life-years gained by initiating screening at 45 vs 50 years.,

Aforementioned incidence analyses used EOCRC rates in defined age-group ranges (ie, 40–49 years) stratified over different time periods. However, incidence analysis in 1-year age increments as a continuous variable during a recent time period will allow for the assessment of the transition between the ages of 49 and 50 years. This transition is of particular interest because this is historically when average-risk screening is first recommended.

Risk rises with age: "Age is one of the most important risk factors for colorectal cancer, with incidence rates increasing with age and nearly 94% of new cases of colorectal cancer occurring in adults 45 years or older". Higher incidence groups are listed, but "all adults 45 years or older should be offered screening, even if these risk factors are absent".

Recommendations of Others

Many organizations have issued guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer. There is a general consensus that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American College of Physicians (ACP), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the US Multi-Society Task Force (which includes the American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) all recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in this age group, although specific recommended tests and frequency of screening may vary. Currently, where recommendations and guidelines vary is the age to initiate screening. In 2017, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommended beginning screening at age 45 years in Black adults (weak recommendation) and screening at age 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of a family member, whichever is earlier) in persons with a family history for colorectal cancer. In 2018, the ACS recommended that screening begin at age 45 years in all adults (qualified recommendation). The AAFP's recommendations do not address screening before age 50 years. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology suggested screening in average-risk persons aged 45 to 49 years (conditional recommendation) and recommended screening average-risk persons aged 50 to 75 years (strong recommendation).

Generally, guidelines agree that screening should either be individualized in older adults aged 76 to 85 years (ACS, AAFP, and US Multi-Society Task Force) or stopped altogether (ACP), with clear consensus that screening should stop after age 85 years.

Early screening plays a critical role in reducing CRC incidence and mortality. Although stool-based tests and colonoscopy screening may be useful for secondary prevention of EOCRC, there is no consensus on the optimal screening methods or the recommended age to begin screening for average-risk or high-risk populations. Individuals who test positive on stool-based tests but do not undergo follow-up colonoscopy have a significantly increased risk of CRC incidence and mortality, particularly among those under 50 years of age. Given the rising incidence of EOCRC, the American Cancer Society revised its guidelines in 2018, lowering the recommended screening age from 50 to 45 for average-risk individuals, while recommending that high-risk individuals begin screening by age 40. However, adherence to these recommendations among younger individuals remains low. While ideally, screening should be tailored to individual risk, CRC screening has yet to incorporate personalized risk assessment. Evaluating genetic polymorphisms, early-life exposures, and their environmental interactions could improve the efficiency of EOCRC screening and early detection. Despite the increasing incidence of CRC among younger populations, the absolute incidence remains significantly lower than in older populations. Thus, whether current screening methods are appropriate for younger individuals remains uncertain, and evidence is limited. For young individuals, using risk scores to guide screening modality selection (e.g. stool-based tests followed by colonoscopy for high-risk subgroups) could reduce reliance on invasive procedures, representing a promising strategy. However, existing CRC risk prediction models require further optimization and validation with more data before they can be effectively applied.

We suggest CRC screening in average-risk individuals between ages 45 and 49 yr to reduce incidence of advanced adenoma, CRC, and mortality from CRC, and we suggest that a decision to continue screening beyond age 75 yr be individualized. For modalities, we recommend colonoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) as the primary screening modalities for CRC screening; for individuals unable or unwilling to undergo a colonoscopy or FIT, we suggest consideration of the following screening tests for individuals unable or unwilling to undergo a colonoscopy or FIT: flexible sigmoidoscopy, multitarget stool DNA test, CT colonography, or colon capsule, and we suggest against Septin 9 for CRC screening. For screening intervals, we recommend that the following intervals should be followed for screening modalities: FIT every 1 yr; colonoscopy every 10 yr, and we suggest that the following intervals should be followed for screening modalities: multitarget stool DNA test every 3 yr; flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 yr; CT colonography every 5 yr; colon capsule every 5 yr.

### Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk adults: 2018 guideline update from the American cancer society [^111TGFhT]. CA (2018). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening — test selection and patient preferences: From a practical implementation standpoint, the choice offered will usually be among 1 or 2 stool-based tests and 1 or 2 structural examinations, and the offering of a choice applies primarily to the uptake of screening in individuals initiating screening or who have failed to adhere to prior recommendations, for whom exploring test preferences may improve adherence. For individuals who have been adherent to screening, it is reasonable for clinicians to continue ordering the same previously completed test without offering new options unless the patient raises specific concerns. In some settings, there may be only one high-quality screening option available for many patients, making discussion of unavailable options not useful. Resources for clinicians and patients include materials found online at cancer.org/coloncancer.

### Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk adults: 2018 guideline update from the American cancer society [^1142WG9t]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed among adults and the second leading cause of death from cancer. For this guideline update, the American Cancer Society (ACS) used an existing systematic evidence review of the CRC screening literature and microsimulation modeling analyses, including a new evaluation of the age to begin screening by race and sex and additional modeling that incorporates changes in US CRC incidence. Screening with any one of multiple options is associated with a significant reduction in CRC incidence through the detection and removal of adenomatous polyps and other precancerous lesions and with a reduction in mortality through incidence reduction and early detection of CRC. Results from modeling analyses identified efficient and model-recommendable strategies that started screening at age 45 years. The ACS Guideline Development Group applied the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria in developing and rating the recommendations. The ACS recommends that adults aged 45 years and older with an average risk of CRC undergo regular screening with either a high-sensitivity stool-based test or a structural (visual) examination, depending on patient preference and test availability. As a part of the screening process, all positive results on noncolonoscopy screening tests should be followed up with timely colonoscopy. The recommendation to begin screening at age 45 years is a qualified recommendation. The recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 years and older is a strong recommendation. The ACS recommends (qualified recommendations) that: 1) average-risk adults in good health with a life expectancy of more than 10 years continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years; 2) clinicians individualize CRC screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history; and 3) clinicians discourage individuals older than 85 years from continuing CRC screening. The options for CRC screening are: fecal immunochemical test annually; high-sensitivity, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test annually; multitarget stool DNA test every 3 years; colonoscopy every 10 years; computed tomography colonography every 5 years; and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.

Figure 1. Clinician Summary: Screening for Colorectal Cancer

What does the USPSTF recommend?

For adults aged 50 to 75 years:

- Screen all adults aged 50 to 75 years for colorectal cancer. Grade A

For adults aged 45 to 49 years:

- Screen adults aged 45 to 49 years for colorectal cancer. Grade B

For adults aged 76 to 85 years:

- Selectively screen adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer, considering the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and patient's preferences. Grade C

To whom does this recommendation apply?

Adults 45 years or older who do not have signs or symptoms of colorectal cancer and who are at average risk for colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).

What's new?

The USPSTF expanded the recommended ages for colorectal cancer screening to 45 to 75 years (previously, it was 50 to 75 years). The USPSTF continues to recommend selectively screening adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, general population, aged 45–49 years, ACG 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining screening for CRC in 45–49 years old average-risk individuals to reduce the incidence of advanced adenoma, CRC, and mortality from CRC.

### AGA clinical practice update on risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and post-polypectomy surveillance: expert review [^112iGYDD]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations and risk stratification — average risk and family history: In summary, most CRCs are sporadic and risk increases with older age. Screening is recommended for average-risk adults starting at age 45 years with several available tests. For individuals with a family history of CRC, screening is recommended 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40 years with colonoscopy. Based on current evidence, risk stratification for initiating CRC screening or surveillance should be based on age, family history, predisposing hereditary CRC syndromes, prior screening, or other CRC predisposing conditions.

Screening in individuals at increased or high risk for CRC — scope boundaries: This update focuses on average-risk adults and does not address screening or surveillance for higher-risk groups, which include individuals with a history of adenomatous polyps, a personal history of CRC, a family history of CRC or adenomatous polyps diagnosed in a relative before age 60 years, a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, a confirmed or suspected hereditary CRC syndrome, or a history of abdominal or pelvic radiation for a previous cancer.

### AGA clinical practice update on risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and post-polypectomy surveillance: expert review [^112bv8iD]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

Since the early 2000s, there has been a rapid decline in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, due in large part to screening and removal of precancerous polyps. Despite these improvements, CRC remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with approximately 53,000 deaths projected in 2023. The aim of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Review was to describe how individuals should be risk-stratified for CRC screening and post-polypectomy surveillance and to highlight opportunities for future research to fill gaps in the existing literature.

Methods

This Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: All individuals with a first-degree relative (defined as a parent, sibling, or child) who was diagnosed with CRC, particularly before the age of 50 years, should be considered at increased risk for CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: All individuals without a personal history of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary CRC syndromes, other CRC predisposing conditions, or a family history of CRC should be considered at average risk for CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Individuals at average risk for CRC should initiate screening at age 45 years and individuals at increased risk for CRC due to having a first-degree relative with CRC should initiate screening 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40 years, whichever is earlier. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Risk stratification for initiation of CRC screening should be based on an individual's age, a known or suspected predisposing hereditary CRC syndrome, and/or a family history of CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: The decision to continue CRC screening in individuals older than 75 years should be individualized, based on an assessment of risks, benefits, screening history, and comorbidities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Screening options for individuals at average risk for CRC should include colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, flexible sigmoidoscopy plus fecal immunochemical test, multitarget stool DNA fecal immunochemical test, and computed tomography colonography, based on availability and individual preference. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Colonoscopy should be the screening strategy used for individuals at increased CRC risk. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The decision to continue post-polypectomy surveillance for individuals older than 75 years should be individualized, based on an assessment of risks, benefits, and comorbidities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Risk-stratification tools for CRC screening and post-polypectomy surveillance that emerge from research should be examined for real-world effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in diverse populations (eg, by race, ethnicity, sex, and other sociodemographic factors associated with disparities in CRC outcomes) before widespread implementation.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115K7wtm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for colorectal cancer.

Methods

To update its recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review on 4 selected questions relating to test characteristics and benefits and harms of screening technologies, and 2) a decision analytic modeling analysis using population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of available screening modalities when used in a programmatic way over time.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. The risks and benefits of these screening methods vary. (A recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against routine screening for colorectal cancer in adults 76 to 85 years of age. There may be considerations that support colorectal cancer screening in an individual patient. (C recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for colorectal cancer in adults older than age 85 years. (D recommendation). The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of computed tomographic colonography and fecal DNA testing as screening modalities for colorectal cancer.
