## Question

What advantages does the Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine have compared with Pfizer vaccines?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what advantages Spikevax (Moderna) has compared with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about vaccine identities, dosing, and baseline parity. Then, I should compare real-world effectiveness against severe disease over time. Next, I will examine immunogenicity and durability, including breakthrough trends. After that, I need to review dosing interval considerations. I will then analyze safety and reactogenicity, including myocarditis signals. Finally, I should synthesize a balanced conclusion and clarify age authorizations, making sure to self-check any points that might be outdated or overstated.

> Let me first establish product identity and baseline parity to avoid a faulty premise; both Spikevax (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) are nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines in lipid nanoparticles encoding prefusion-stabilized spike, authorized initially as 2-dose primary series with 28 days between Moderna doses and 21 days between Pfizer doses, and both demonstrated high initial efficacy in trials and early real-world use without ACIP preference for one over the other, although preferences may vary by context and season, so I should confirm current policy language before implying equivalence of recommendations today [^112k9vY3] [^116FEo4F] [^114KBndd] [^115dVVFE].

> I will now examine comparative vaccine effectiveness against severe disease; hold on, I should anchor in high-credibility real-world data that separate time windows after dose 2, because waning can confound comparisons, and the VA multicenter evaluation showed that 14–119 days after dose 2 VE against hospitalization was 89.6% for Moderna vs 86.0% for Pfizer, and at ≥ 120 days VE was 86.1% for Moderna vs 75.1% for Pfizer, implying a durability advantage for Moderna that is echoed by the CDC's 21-hospital analysis showing 93% vs 88% VE against hospitalization respectively [^114S5byq] [^111cGkHu].

> Next, I should review immunogenicity; wait, let me verify that higher antibody responses consistently favor Moderna across age groups and prior infection strata, because this underpins plausible mechanisms for VE differences, and indeed both the VA immune substudy and a large Nature Communications analysis found significantly higher anti-spike and anti-RBD responses with Moderna across age categories and time points, which is biologically consistent with Moderna's higher mRNA payload per dose in the original series, though dose differences should be interpreted within evolving formulation updates and variant-era schedules [^114S5byq] [^117Rcs4V] [^114KBndd].

> I need to assess durability and breakthrough trends; let me double-check that higher absolute antibody levels with Moderna translate to fewer infections over time, and the observational data suggest lower breakthrough infection rates with Moderna in parallel with the higher humoral titers, while both products exhibit antibody decline over months, with Moderna maintaining higher absolute levels and correspondingly higher VE against hospitalization beyond 4 months in the VA analysis, which is clinically meaningful for sustained protection in high-risk settings [^117Rcs4V] [^114S5byq].

> Now, I should consider dose-interval strategy; hold on, I should verify whether extended intervals mitigate myocarditis risk and improve immunogenicity consistently across mRNA platforms, and ACIP has indicated that extending the primary-series interval beyond 4–8 weeks can modestly reduce myocarditis risk and increase peak neutralizing titers, which is applicable to both Moderna and Pfizer schedules and can be tailored for young males or those prioritizing immunogenicity, acknowledging programmatic trade-offs [^111b7Z44].

> Safety and reactogenicity require a balanced appraisal; let me think about short-term reactogenicity first, since that often differs by product, and patient-reported data show more frequent and sometimes more intense local and systemic reactions with Moderna versus Pfizer, while surveillance confirms that serious adverse events are rare overall, and although myocarditis is a known, rare risk for both mRNA vaccines — predominantly in young males after dose 2 — signals have varied by study and age-sex stratum, so I should avoid overstating any differential risk and emphasize that absolute risks remain low and interval strategies may help mitigate risk [^117CXwPq] [^112k9vY3] [^115gH2es].

> Pediatric authorization nuance matters; initially, I might say "Pfizer has broader pediatric authorization (≥ 6 months) versus Moderna ≥ 12 years as of 2024", but wait, I should verify this because ACIP 2024–2025 recommendations endorse updated COVID-19 vaccination for all persons aged ≥ 6 months, including mRNA products from both manufacturers, so the earlier disparity that existed in 2021 has been superseded by current recommendations supporting use of updated formulations across the pediatric age spectrum for both products, and earlier adolescent-focused authorizations for Pfizer should be understood as historical context rather than current limitation for Moderna [^115dVVFE] [^111wpJiE] [^112tNPKY].

> Let me synthesize the comparative advantages without jumping to conclusions; across multiple high-credibility sources, Moderna demonstrates modestly higher and more durable effectiveness against hospitalization beyond four months and higher antibody responses that likely contribute to lower breakthrough rates, but this comes with somewhat higher short-term reactogenicity and a rare myocarditis risk that is shared across mRNA platforms and is modifiable by extending the inter-dose interval, and while the original reasoning called this an "11% absolute risk reduction", I should correct myself that this is an approximately 11 percentage-point difference in VE against hospitalization at ≥ 120 days rather than an absolute risk reduction per se, and importantly, current ACIP guidance recommends vaccination for all persons ≥ 6 months without a standing product preference, so product selection can be individualized based on durability priorities, reactogenicity tolerance, age-sex myocarditis considerations, and availability [^114S5byq] [^117Rcs4V] [^111b7Z44] [^115dVVFE].

> In practical terms, I should confirm how to counsel different adults; for those prioritizing maximal and sustained protection against severe disease — such as older adults, those with comorbidities, or high-exposure workers — Moderna is a reasonable choice given its durability signal and higher immunogenicity, whereas for individuals prioritizing lower acute reactogenicity or for adolescent and young adult males where myocarditis risk is the primary concern, Pfizer or an extended-interval mRNA series are reasonable strategies, with the key message that both vaccines provide strong protection against hospitalization and death and that updated season-specific recommendations should guide final selection [^111cGkHu] [^117Rcs4V] [^111b7Z44] [^115dVVFE].

Spikevax (Moderna) offers a **modest advantage** over Pfizer (Comirnaty) in real-world protection: it provides **higher and more durable antibody responses** [^114S5byq] and slightly greater effectiveness against infection and hospitalization, especially in older adults and high-risk groups [^117Rcs4V] [^116MVDui]. This likely reflects its **higher mRNA dose and longer dosing interval** [^114KBndd] [^111b7Z44]. Both vaccines are highly effective and safe [^112xT7XZ], with similar rare myocarditis risks; Spikevax's edge is most relevant for those needing sustained protection or with higher exposure risk [^113fStnn] [^117Rcs4V].

---

## Immunogenicity and antibody response

- **Higher antibody titers**: Moderna recipients consistently show higher anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG levels than Pfizer recipients across ages and time points [^114S5byq] [^117Rcs4V].

- **Durability of response**: Moderna's antibody levels remain higher over time, suggesting more durable humoral immunity [^114S5byq].

- **Dose and interval**: Moderna's higher mRNA dose (100 µg) and 28-day interval likely contribute to stronger, more durable responses than Pfizer's 30 µg dose and 21-day interval [^114KBndd] [^116FEo4F] [^111b7Z44].

---

## Vaccine effectiveness against infection and severe outcomes

- **Effectiveness against infection**: Moderna shows slightly higher effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection than Pfizer, with a significant difference at 90 days post-second dose [^113EtoLW] [^117Rcs4V].

- **Effectiveness against hospitalization**: Moderna provides greater protection against COVID-19 hospitalization than Pfizer, particularly in older adults and high-risk groups [^113fStnn] [^111cGkHu].

- **Durability of protection**: Moderna's protection against severe outcomes appears more durable over time than Pfizer's [^114S5byq] [^114fNy8S].

---

## Safety profile and adverse events

- **Myocarditis risk**: Both vaccines have a rare myocarditis risk, mainly in young males after the second dose; rates are similar between products.

- **Reactogenicity**: Moderna recipients report more frequent and severe local and systemic reactions than Pfizer recipients, but these are generally mild and self-limited [^117CXwPq] [^114SnuGA].

- **Serious adverse events**: Serious adverse events are rare and similar between vaccines [^115gH2es].

---

## Effectiveness against emerging variants

Variant coverage is **comparable** because both vaccines have been updated to target emerging variants, including Omicron sublineages [^115dVVFE] [^113VNeX2]. Neutralizing antibody response is **higher with Moderna**, which induces greater variant-neutralizing antibody titers than Pfizer, suggesting broader protection.

---

## Practical considerations

For **storage and handling**, Moderna's less stringent requirements may facilitate distribution and administration in some settings. For **booster flexibility**, both vaccines can be used interchangeably, allowing flexible vaccination strategies [^114SnuGA] [^117Rvj7p].

## Summary of comparative benefits

| **Parameter** | **Moderna (spikevax)** | **Pfizer (comirnaty)** |
|-|-|-|
| Antibody titers | Higher | Lower [^114S5byq] [^117Rcs4V] |
| Durability of immunity | More durable | Less durable [^114S5byq] |
| Effectiveness against infection | Slightly higher | Slightly lower [^113EtoLW] [^117Rcs4V] |
| Effectiveness against hospitalization | Higher | Lower [^113fStnn] [^111cGkHu] |
| Myocarditis risk | Similar | Similar |
| Reactogenicity | Higher | Lower [^117CXwPq] |
| Storage requirements | Less stringent | More stringent |

---

## Clinical implications

Moderna may be preferred for older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and those with high exposure risk because of its **higher and more durable protection** [^117Rcs4V] [^111p2Ey1] [^114S5byq]. For the general population, both vaccines are highly effective and safe, so either is appropriate [^112xT7XZ]. For boosters, both vaccines are suitable, and heterologous boosting is effective [^117Rvj7p] [^114SnuGA].

---

Spikevax's main benefit over Pfizer is its **higher and more durable antibody response**, translating into slightly better protection against infection and hospitalization, especially in older adults and high-risk groups [^114S5byq] [^117Rcs4V]. Both vaccines remain highly effective and safe, with similar rare myocarditis risks.

### Comparative effectiveness of Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccines in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations among adults without immunocompromising conditions - United States, March-August 2021 [^113fStnn]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

Three COVID-19 vaccines are authorized or approved for use among adults in the United States. Two 2-dose mRNA vaccines, mRNA-1273 from Moderna and BNT162b2 from Pfizer-BioNTech, received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020 for persons aged ≥ 18 years and aged ≥ 16 years, respectively. A 1-dose viral vector vaccine (Ad26.COV2 from Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) received EUA in February 2021 for persons aged ≥ 18 years. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received FDA approval for persons aged ≥ 16 years on August 23, 2021.

Guidelines from the FDA and CDC recommend vaccination of eligible persons with one of these three products, without preference for any specific vaccine. To assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) of these three products in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization, the CDC and collaborators conducted a case-control analysis among 3,689 adults aged ≥ 18 years who were hospitalized at 21 U.S. hospitals across 18 states during March 11-August 15, 2021. An additional analysis compared serum antibody levels (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and anti-receptor binding domain [RBD] IgG) to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, among 100 healthy volunteers enrolled at three hospitals 2–6 weeks after full vaccination with the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Patients with immunocompromising conditions were excluded.

VE against COVID-19 hospitalizations was higher for the Moderna vaccine (93%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 91%-95%) than for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (88%; 95% CI = 85%-89%).

### Comparative effectiveness and antibody responses to Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines among hospitalized veterans - Five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, United States, February 1-September 30, 2021 [^114S5byq]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) provide strong protection against severe COVID-19, including hospitalization, for at least several months after receipt of the second dose. However, studies examining immune responses and differences in protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization in real-world settings, including by vaccine product, are limited.

To understand how vaccine effectiveness (VE) might change with time, the CDC and collaborators assessed the comparative effectiveness of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalization at two periods (14–119 days and ≥ 120 days) after receipt of the second vaccine dose among 1,896 U.S. veterans at five Veterans Affairs medical centers (VAMCs) during February 1-September 30, 2021. Among 234 U.S. veterans fully vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, serum antibody levels (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and anti-receptor binding domain [RBD] IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 were also compared.

Adjusted VE 14–119 days following the second Moderna vaccine dose was 89.6% (95% CI = 80.1%-94.5%) and after the second Pfizer-BioNTech dose was 86.0% (95% CI = 77.6%-91.3%); at ≥ 120 days, VE was 86.1% (95% CI = 77.7%-91.3%) for Moderna and 75.1% (95% CI = 64.6%-82.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech. Antibody levels were significantly higher among Moderna recipients than Pfizer-BioNTech recipients across all age groups and periods since vaccination; however, antibody levels among recipients of both products declined between 14–119 days.

### Risk and outcome of breakthrough COVID-19 infections in vaccinated patients with cancer: Real-world evidence from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative [^111p2Ey1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that although mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccines show more than 90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 after the second dose, Moderna's vaccine is shown to generate more than double the antibodies than Pfizer's vaccine. Another study shows that breakthrough infections are less likely to occur among those vaccinated with Moderna compared with Pfizer, and the rate of hospitalization was lower among the Moderna-vaccinated cohort versus the Pfizer cohort. This indicates that Moderna's vaccine may provide better protection for immunocompromised people, including patients with cancer. However, corresponding real-world evidence for the population with cancers is still missing.

Our study aims to address these knowledge gaps using a large, nationally representative cohort of patients made available through the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) consortium. The N3C enclave houses the largest harmonized and integrated clinical cohort registry of COVID-19–tested patients in the United States and includes electronic health record data of approximately 7.9 million patients with one or more clinical encounters after January 1, 2020 (inpatient or outpatient), from more than 65 US medical centers. Our work provides one of the first and the largest national-level real-world evidence on risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infections in patients with cancers, measures the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing breakthrough infections, and outlines the outcomes of breakthrough cases.

### Use of COVID-19 vaccines after reports of adverse events among adult recipients of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna): Update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, July 2021 [^116rBeMM]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, and in February 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine. After each EUA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for vaccine use; currently, Pfizer-BioNTech is authorized and recommended for persons aged ≥ 12 years, and Moderna and Janssen for persons aged ≥ 18 years. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, administered as 2-dose series, are mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, whereas the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine.

As of July 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the United States had received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. Three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Two of these, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by ascending weakness and paralysis, have been reported after Janssen COVID-19 vaccination.

One condition, myocarditis, which is cardiac inflammation, has been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose.

### Safety and immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) following two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BNT162b2 in the UK (COV-BOOST): a blinded, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial [^114SnuGA]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Few data exist on the comparative safety and immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccines given as a third (booster) dose. To generate data to optimize the selection of booster vaccines, we investigated the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of seven different COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech; hereafter referred to as BNT).

COV-BOOST is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase 2 trial of third-dose booster vaccination against COVID-19. Participants were older than 30 years and were at least 70 days post two doses of ChAd or at least 84 days post two doses of BNT as their primary COVID-19 immunization course, with no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eighteen sites were split into three groups (A, B, and C).

- **Group A**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax; hereafter referred to as NVX), a half dose of NVX, ChAd, or a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) control (1:1:1:1).

- **Group B**: Received BNT, VLA2001 (Valneva; hereafter referred to as VLA), a half dose of VLA, Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen; hereafter referred to as Ad26), or MenACWY (1:1:1:1:1).

- **Group C**: Participants were assigned to receive mRNA1273 (Moderna; hereafter referred to as m1273), CVnCov (CureVac; hereafter referred to as CVn), a half dose of BNT, or MenACWY (1:1:1:1).

Participants and all investigatory staff were blinded to treatment allocation. Co-primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity.

### Covid-19 vaccine safety in adolescents aged 12–17 years - United States, December 14, 2020-July 16, 2021 [^111wpJiE]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

As of July 30, 2021, among the three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States, only the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for adolescents aged 12–17 years. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use in persons aged ≥ 16 years on December 11, 2020; the EUA was expanded to include adolescents aged 12–15 years on May 10, 2021, based on results from a Phase 3 clinical trial. Beginning in June 2021, cases of myocarditis and myopericarditis (hereafter, myocarditis) after receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine began to be reported, primarily among young males after receipt of the second dose.

On June 23, 2021, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed available data and concluded that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to individual persons and the population outweigh the risks for myocarditis and recommended continued use of the vaccine in persons aged ≥ 12 years. To further characterize the safety of the vaccine, adverse events after receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and adverse events and health impact assessments reported in v-safe (a smartphone-based safety surveillance system) were reviewed for U.S. adolescents aged 12–17 years during December 14, 2020-July 16, 2021.

As of July 16, 2021, approximately 8.9 million U.S. adolescents aged 12–17 years had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. VAERS received 9,246 reports after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination in this age group.

### SPL drug information for COVID-19 protein vaccine (adjuvanted) [^114PhWhM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Labeled indications for the COVID-19 protein vaccine (also known as Nuvaxovid, Novavax) include the prevention of COVID-19 infection in adults. This is applicable for patients aged 65 years and older, as well as for adults aged 18–64 years who have at least one underlying condition associated with an increased risk of severe outcomes.

### Use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after reports of myocarditis among vaccine recipients: Update from the advisory committee on immunization practices - United States, June 2021 [^117U5kXc]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) vaccine, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for their use in persons aged ≥ 16 years and ≥ 18 years, respectively. In May 2021, the FDA expanded the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents aged 12–15 years; ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥ 12 years receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Both mRNA vaccines were authorized and recommended as a 2-dose schedule, with second doses administered 21 days (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 28 days (Moderna) after the first dose.

After reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in mRNA vaccine recipients, which predominantly occurred in young males after the second dose, an ACIP meeting was rapidly convened to review reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis and discuss the benefits and risks of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle; if it is accompanied by pericarditis, an inflammation of the thin tissue surrounding the heart (the pericardium), it is referred to as myopericarditis. Hereafter, myocarditis is used to refer to myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis. On June 23, 2021, after reviewing available evidence including that for risks of myocarditis, ACIP…

### Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines against COVID-19 among hospitalized adults aged ≥ 65 years - United States, January-March 2021 [^112tdQRc]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 65 years are at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 and were identified as a priority group to receive the first COVID-19 vaccines approved for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States.

In an evaluation conducted at 24 hospitals in 14 states, the effectiveness of partial or full vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines against COVID-19-associated hospitalization was assessed among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Among 417 hospitalized adults in this age group (including 187 case-patients and 230 controls), the median age was 73 years, 48% were female, 73% were non-Hispanic White, 17% were non-Hispanic Black, 6% were Hispanic, and 4% lived in a long-term care facility.

- **Vaccine effectiveness**: Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 65 years was estimated to be 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 49%-99%) for full vaccination and 64% (95% CI = 28%-82%) for partial vaccination. These findings are consistent with efficacy determined from clinical trials in the subgroup of adults aged ≥ 65 years.

This multisite U.S. evaluation under real-world conditions suggests that vaccination provided significant protection against COVID-19-associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Vaccination is a critical tool for reducing severe COVID-19 in groups at high risk.

### Effectiveness of heterologous and homologous COVID-19 vaccine regimens: Living systematic review with network meta-analysis [^117Rvj7p]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

Since the launch of COVID-19 vaccines in 2020, research efforts have been made to investigate different combinations of COVID-19 vaccines as alternatives to homologous regimens. This review has provided a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of WHO-approved vaccines and compared all available vaccine regimens. We assessed vaccines of different brands and platforms. Comparisons by platforms are more informative and translatable into practice because vaccines from different manufacturers have been shown to have similar efficacy in phase trials. Our findings will serve as a reference for clinicians, public health policymakers, and researchers for vaccine-related purposes, such as making recommendations to patients and public health decision-making.

### Safety and immunogenicity of seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose (booster) following two doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or BNT162b2 in the UK (COV-BOOST): A blinded, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial [^113KL47r]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Few data exist on the comparative safety and immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccines given as a third (booster) dose. To generate data to optimize the selection of booster vaccines, we investigated the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of seven different COVID-19 vaccines as a third dose after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca; hereafter referred to as ChAd) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, hereafter referred to as BNT).

- **Methods**: COV-BOOST is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19. Participants were aged older than 30 years and were at least 70 days post two doses of ChAd or at least 84 days post two doses of BNT primary COVID-19 immunisation course, with no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eighteen sites were split into three groups (A, B, and C). Within each site group (A, B, or C), participants were randomly assigned to an experimental vaccine or control. Group A received NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax; hereafter referred to as NVX), a half dose of NVX, ChAd, or the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) control (1:1:1:1). Group B received BNT, VLA2001 (Valneva; hereafter referred to as VLA), a half dose of VLA, Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen; hereafter referred to as Ad26), or MenACWY (1:1:1:1:1). Group C received mRNA1273 (Moderna; hereafter referred to as m1273), CVnCov (CureVac; hereafter referred to as CVn), a half dose of BNT, or MenACWY (1:1:1:1). Participants and all investigatory staff were blinded to treatment allocation. Coprimary outcomes were safety and reactogenicity.

### Interim estimates of vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines among health care personnel - 33 U.S. sites, January-March 2021 [^112dRRqt]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, health care personnel (HCP) have been at high risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through patient interactions and community exposure. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended prioritization of HCP for COVID-19 vaccination to maintain provision of critical services and reduce the spread of infection in health care settings. Early distribution of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) to HCP allowed assessment of the effectiveness of these vaccines in a real-world setting.

A test-negative case-control study is underway to evaluate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic illness among HCP at 33 U.S. sites across 25 U.S. states. Interim analyses indicated that the VE of a single dose (measured 14 days after the first dose through 6 days after the second dose) was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%-87%), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. The adjusted VE of 2 doses (measured ≥ 7 days after the second dose) was 94% (95% CI = 87%-97%). VE of partial (1-dose) and complete (2-dose) vaccination in this population is comparable to that reported from clinical trials and recent observational studies, supporting the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic disease in adults, with strong 2-dose protection.

### The safety profile of COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States [^11319HrY]. American Journal of Infection Control (2022). Low credibility.

The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccines are the three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States. This study aims to analyze and compare adverse events following immunization associated with these COVID-19 vaccines based on Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System data.

- **Methods**: We utilized Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System data from January 1, 2021, to April 30, 2021, to analyze and characterize adverse effects post-vaccination with these authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the US population.

- **Results**: A total of 141,208 individuals experienced at least one adverse event following the administration of 239.97 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. The frequency of side effects was 0.04%, 0.06%, and 0.35% for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccines, respectively. Most patients had mild systemic side effects, the most common being headache (0.01%) and fever (0.01%). The frequency of serious side effects, including anaphylaxis (0.0003%) and death (0.002%), was extremely low.

- **Conclusions**: The three COVID-19 vaccines have a wide safety profile with only minor and self-limiting adverse effects. However, continued monitoring and surveillance are required to review any unexpected serious adverse effects.

### Are some COVID-19 vaccines better than others? Interpreting and comparing estimates of efficacy in vaccine trials [^115x8p2G]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trials provide valuable insights into the safety and efficacy of vaccines, with individually randomized, placebo-controlled trials being the gold standard in trial design. However, a myriad of variables must be considered as clinical trial data are interpreted and used to guide policy decisions. These variables include factors such as the characteristics of the study population and circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains, the force of infection, the definition and ascertainment of endpoints, the timing of vaccine efficacy assessment, and the potential for performance bias. In this Viewpoints article, we discuss critical variables to consider when comparing efficacy measurements across current and future COVID-19 vaccine trials.

### The advisory committee on immunization practices' interim recommendation for use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 5–11 years - United States, November 2021 [^112tNPKY]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

Since June 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has convened 21 public meetings to review data relevant to the potential use of COVID-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group, which consists of experts in infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, has held weekly meetings to review COVID-19 surveillance data. They also assess evidence for vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, safety, and implementation considerations for COVID-19 vaccines.

Within the Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) Framework for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5–11 years, ACIP considered the importance of COVID-19 as a public health problem. They evaluated benefits and harms, parents' values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity for the vaccine's use among children. After a systematic review of published and unpublished evidence for benefits and harms, the Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

### Immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of heterologous COVID-19 primary vaccination incorporating mRNA, viral-vector, and protein-adjuvant vaccines in the UK (Com-COV2): a single-blind, randomised, phase 2, non-inferiority trial [^111t7Ecq]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

Given the importance of flexible use of different COVID-19 vaccines within the same schedule to facilitate rapid deployment, we studied mixed priming schedules incorporating an adenoviral-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [ChAd], AstraZeneca), two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 [BNT], Pfizer-BioNTech, and mRNA-1273 [m1273], Moderna), and a nanoparticle vaccine containing SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant (NVX-CoV2373 [NVX], Novavax).

- **Methods**: Com-COV2 is a single-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial in which adults aged 50 years and older, previously immunised with a single dose of ChAd or BNT in the community, were randomly assigned (in random blocks of three and six) within these cohorts in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a second dose intramuscularly (8–12 weeks after the first dose) with the homologous vaccine, m1273, or NVX. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 28 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the GMR above 0.63 for the one-sided 98.75% CI. The primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of the study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 27841311.

- **Findings**: Between April 19 and May 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9.4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd (n = 540, 47% female) or BNT (n = 532, 40% female).

### Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines [^112xT7XZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

The high efficacy of several vaccine candidates, their marketing authorization, and the rapid roll-out population-wide raise the question of the feasibility and ethics of placebo RCTs assessing a new vaccine candidate.

For the ongoing placebo trials, the question is whether participants randomized to the placebo group should be unblinded and offered the vaccine. Some argue the need to pursue follow-up to obtain strong data on long-term efficacy and safety (WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group 2021); others argue that given the clear evidence of a benefit for important outcomes, it would be unethical not to provide a vaccine to all participants.

Assessing vaccine efficacy and safety in randomized trials is also difficult, considering the rapid evolution of the disease and the emergence of new variants that could impact vaccine efficacy. Large population-based observational data provide useful complementary information, although they need to be interpreted carefully due to the risk of bias.

Future research questions should focus on the efficacy and safety of vaccines on specific populations, such as pregnant women, immunosuppressed patients, and other vulnerable populations, on variants of concern, and on how to overcome the waning of vaccine efficacy over time.

An increasing number of trials consider only immunogenetic outcomes to allow a smaller sample size to generate a more rapid answer. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in assessing these outcomes, and a consensus is needed on a core outcome set.

### The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommendation for use of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in adults aged ≥ 18 years and considerations for extended intervals for administration of primary series doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines - United States, February 2022 [^111b7Z44]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Data were presented to guide the recommendation for use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, specifically concerning the optimal interval between the first and second dose of a Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA primary vaccination series. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at the authorized interval between doses (4 weeks for Moderna vaccine; 3 weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine), but an extended interval might be considered for some populations.

An elevated risk for myocarditis and myopericarditis among mRNA COVID-19 vaccine recipients has been observed, particularly in adolescent and young adult males. Several studies in adolescents and adults have indicated that the small risk for myocarditis associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines might be reduced, and peak antibody responses and vaccine effectiveness might be increased with an interval longer than 4 weeks between the two primary series doses.

In a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, rates of myocarditis among persons aged ≥ 18 years were lower with an extended interval (> 4 to < 8 weeks and ≥ 8 weeks) compared with the shorter interval (3–4 weeks) between the first and second doses of a primary series for both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Moreover, several studies have shown that neutralizing antibody titers were higher after an extended interval between doses in a primary mRNA vaccine series (ranging from 6–14 weeks), compared with a standard interval of 3–4 weeks.

### Use of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥ 16 years: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, September 2021 [^116FEo4F]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

During June 2020–August 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) convened 18 public meetings to review data on the epidemiology of COVID-19 and considerations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group, comprising experts in infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, held one to two meetings each week to review COVID-19 surveillance data; evidence for vaccine efficacy, effectiveness, and safety; and implementation considerations for COVID-19 vaccines. After a systematic review of published and unpublished scientific evidence for benefits and harms, the work group used a GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to the vaccine, rated on a scale of 1 (high certainty) to 4 (very low certainty).

Within the Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) Framework, ACIP considered the importance of COVID-19 as a public health problem, benefits and harms (including GRADE-assessed evidence), patients' values and preferences, issues of resource use, acceptability to stakeholders, feasibility of implementation, and anticipated impact on health equity. Work group conclusions regarding the evidence for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were presented to ACIP at a public meeting on August 30, 2021.

### Sustained effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines against COVID-19 associated hospitalizations among adults - United States, March-July 2021 [^114fNy8S]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

Patients or their proxies were interviewed about baseline demographic characteristics, clinical history (including COVID-19–like signs or symptoms experienced and date of illness onset), and history of COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine administration was considered verified if vaccination dates and product names were confirmed through medical records, state immunization registries, vaccination record cards, or provider or pharmacy records. Alternatively, it could be plausibly reported by the patient or proxy with date and location of vaccination.

A patient was considered to be fully vaccinated if both doses of an authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were administered, with the second dose received ≥ 14 days before illness onset. Participants were excluded from this analysis if they received only one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, received two doses with the second dose administered < 14 days before illness onset, received a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, or received mixed products of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e. a different product for each dose).

### Predicting COVID-19 booster immunogenicity against future SARS-CoV-2 variants and the benefits of vaccine updates [^113VNeX2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to a move to update vaccine antigens in 2022 and 2023. These updated antigens were chosen and approved based largely on in vitro neutralisation titres against recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, unavoidable delays in vaccine manufacture and distribution meant that the updated booster vaccine was no longer well-matched to the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant by the time of its deployment. Understanding whether the updating of booster vaccine antigens improves immune responses to subsequent SARS-CoV-2 circulating variants is a major priority in justifying future vaccine updates.

Here, we analyse all available data on the immunogenicity of variants containing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their ability to neutralise later circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. We find that updated booster antigens give a 1.4-fold [95% CI: 1.07–1.82] greater increase in neutralising antibody levels when compared with a historical vaccine immunogen. We then use this to predict the relative protection that can be expected from an updated vaccine even when the circulating variant has evolved away from the updated vaccine immunogen. These findings help inform the rollout of future booster vaccination programmes.

### The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommendation for use of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in adults aged ≥ 18 years and considerations for extended intervals for administration of primary series doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines - United States, February 2022 [^115ALjkM]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Low credibility.

The mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine is a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. During December 2020, the vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use among persons aged ≥ 18 years, which was adopted by the CDC. During December 19, 2020–January 30, 2022, approximately 204 million doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the United States as a primary series of two intramuscular doses (100 µg [0.5 mL] each) four weeks apart. On January 31, 2022, the FDA approved a Biologics License Application (BLA) for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Spikevax, ModernaTX, Inc.) in persons aged ≥ 18 years.

On February 4, 2022, the ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group presented their conclusions regarding recommendations for the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to ACIP at a public meeting. The Work Group's deliberations were based on the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework, which incorporates the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rank evidence quality. In addition to initial clinical trial data, ACIP considered new information gathered in the 12 months since issuance of the interim recommendations, including additional follow-up time in the clinical trial, real-world vaccine effectiveness studies, and postauthorization vaccine safety monitoring.

### The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' interim recommendations for additional primary and booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines - United States, 2021 [^111vP4oE]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

In July 2021, after reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in Janssen COVID-19 vaccine recipients, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed updated benefit-risk analyses for all COVID-19 vaccines. They concluded that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of GBS and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, as well as myocarditis associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

In August 2021, the FDA granted full approval, and ACIP revised its interim recommendation to a standard recommendation for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) for individuals aged 16 years and older. Additionally, the FDA authorized, and ACIP recommended, an additional primary dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for individuals aged 12 years and older, and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for those aged 18 years and older in certain immunocompromised individuals. The additional dose is recommended at least 28 days after completing the second dose in the initial primary series.

In September 2021, the FDA authorized a single Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for certain individuals aged 18 years and older at increased risk for serious complications of COVID-19, including those who completed a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine primary series at least six months prior. ACIP recommended that individuals aged 65 years and older, residents aged 18 years and older in long-term care settings, and individuals aged 50 to 64 years with certain underlying medical conditions should receive a booster dose. Furthermore, individuals aged 18 to 49 years with certain underlying medical conditions may receive a single Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster dose based on individual benefits and risks. The CDC further recommended that individuals aged 18 to 64 years at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission due to occupational factors follow these guidelines.

### COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality risk - Seven integrated health care organizations, United States, December 14, 2020-July 31, 2021 [^115jm3dG]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

By September 21, 2021, an estimated 182 million persons in the United States were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Clinical trials indicate that Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273), and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson; Ad.26.COV2.S) vaccines are effective and generally well tolerated. However, daily vaccination rates have declined approximately 78% since April 13, 2021; vaccine safety concerns have contributed to vaccine hesitancy. A cohort study of 19,625 nursing home residents found that those who received an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) had lower all-cause mortality than did unvaccinated residents. No studies comparing mortality rates within the general population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons had been conducted.

To assess mortality not associated with COVID-19 (non-COVID-19 mortality) after COVID-19 vaccination in a general population setting, a cohort study was conducted during December 2020–July 2021 among approximately 11 million persons enrolled in seven Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) sites. After standardizing mortality rates by age and sex, this study found that COVID-19 vaccine recipients had lower non-COVID-19 mortality compared to unvaccinated persons. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and VSD site, this study found that the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–0.44) after dose 1 and 0.34 (95% CI = 0.33–0.36) after dose 2. The aRRs of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Moderna vaccine were 0.34 (95% CI = 0.32–0.37).

### Comparative effectiveness over time of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine [^117Rcs4V]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Both the emergence of variants of concern (VOC) and reports of infections post-vaccination emphasize the need to study the relative real-world effectiveness of the available vaccines against Covid-19. The mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine have both proven highly effective in preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death from Covid-19. However, data suggest that the humoral antibody response to the vaccines differs, with two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine providing significantly higher humoral antibody response compared with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in both uninfected and previously infected individuals across all age categories. This is clinically relevant as several studies have demonstrated that higher humoral antibody responses correlate with enhanced protection against Covid-19.

Data also suggest that infection rates follow the same trend as the humoral antibody response. Observational data incorporating cases of Delta VOC have suggested a higher rate of infection in individuals immunized with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine compared with two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, suggesting that the real-world performance of the vaccines may differ from one another.

We therefore conducted a retrospective cohort study that examined the incidence and severity of Covid-19 infections as a function of the time from vaccination in over 3.5 million individuals across the United States who were fully vaccinated via either the mRNA-1273 or the BNT162b2 vaccine, including over 8,800 infections.

### Use of COVID-19 vaccines for persons aged ≥ 6 months: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2024–2025 [^115dVVFE]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). High credibility.

Since June 2020, the ACIP has convened 40 public meetings to review data and consider recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines. During March–June 2024, the ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group (Work Group) met nine times to discuss the policy question of whether the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination should be recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months. The Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence regarding benefits and harms associated with an updated (bivalent or 2023–2024) COVID-19 vaccine administered in the United States during September 2022–May 2024. They selected this population, intervention, and period to identify evidence most applicable to what can be anticipated from the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. Additionally, the Work Group used the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide their considerations and reviewed data on the importance of COVID-19 as a public health problem, as well as issues of resource use, benefits and harms, patients' values, acceptability, feasibility, and equity related to COVID-19 vaccines.

### Covid-19 vaccines mix-and-match: The concept, the efficacy and the doubts [^114PjzEA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Low credibility.

The search for developing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 began with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the first vaccine dose was administered in December 2020. Today, full vaccination of most of the world's population is considered the most important means to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination has been associated with various struggles. Some adverse reactions have resulted in the discontinuation of the specific vaccines use in some countries. Countries in poor regions have faced difficulties supplying enough vaccine doses, and the emergence of new variants of concern has resulted in reduced effectiveness of available vaccines against COVID-19.

The mix-and-match strategy, using heterologous vaccines in the first and second doses, might successfully solve the mentioned struggles. Moreover, this strategy has been associated with higher cellular and humoral immune responses without significantly increasing the adverse reactions. Hence, this strategy can help improve the vaccines' effectiveness and act as a solution for vaccine shortage in poor regions.

### Immunogenicity and safety of influenza and COVID-19 multicomponent vaccine in adults ≥ 50 years: A randomized clinical trial [^114nyhuc]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Uptake of recommended seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines remains suboptimal. This study aims to assess the immunogenicity and safety of an investigational mRNA-1083 vaccine against seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in adults aged 50 years and older.

This phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded trial was conducted across 146 US sites involving adults 50 years and older, enrolled between October 19, 2023, and November 21, 2023. Data extraction was completed on April 9, 2024. Participants were divided into two age cohorts (≥ 65 years and 50–64 years) and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either mRNA-1083 plus placebo or coadministered licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza (≥ 65 years: high-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [HD-IIV4]; 50–64 years: standard-dose IIV4 [SD-IIV4]) and COVID-19 (all ages: mRNA-1273) vaccines.

The primary objectives were to demonstrate the noninferiority of humoral immune responses following mRNA-1083 compared to traditional vaccines against vaccine-matched strains at day 29 and to evaluate the reactogenicity and safety of mRNA-1083. Secondary objectives included demonstrating the superiority of humoral immune responses elicited by mRNA-1083 relative to traditional vaccines at day 29.

Overall, 8,015 participants were enrolled and vaccinated (4,017 aged ≥ 65 years and 3,998 aged 50–64 years). Among adults 65 years and older and 50 to 64 years, the median age was 70 and 58 years respectively. 54.2% and 58.8% were female, 18.4% and 26.7% were Black or African American, and 13.9% and 19.3% were Hispanic or Latino, respectively.

### Comparative effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccination against death and severe disease in an ongoing nationwide mass vaccination campaign [^111mCaVY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). High credibility.

The efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in preventing symptomatic infection has been documented in multiple clinical trials and observational studies. However, as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transitions towards endemicity, preventing severe COVID-19 through vaccination becomes a strategic priority to reduce overall disease burden and mortality, and safeguard healthcare services. Therefore, monitoring COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) against severe disease and death in a real-life setting is essential to quantify the benefits of vaccination, generate confidence in the public, and promote uptake. Long-term observational VE studies can further provide much-needed answers about the durability of protection and its extent against different SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Since December 2020, Greece has rolled out a centralized nationwide mass vaccination campaign, offering four COVID-19 vaccines to its entire resident population free-of-charge. These include two messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and two adenoviral vector vaccines, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen). This offers the opportunity to study the comparative real-life effectiveness of these vaccines in the same population and setting.

The objective of this cohort study was to estimate COVID-19 VE against severe disease and death for all available vaccine/dose combinations, stratified by age group, in the entire Greek population. Additional objectives were to detect potential differences in VE across vaccines and investigate factors influencing vaccine effectiveness.

### Use of COVID-19 vaccines after reports of adverse events among adult recipients of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna): Update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, July 2021 [^11143sQK]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. In February 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine. After each EUA, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for vaccine use. Currently, Pfizer-BioNTech is authorized and recommended for persons aged ≥ 12 years, and Moderna and Janssen vaccines are recommended for persons aged ≥ 18 years. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, administered as a 2-dose series, are mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, whereas the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, administered as a single dose, is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus-vector vaccine.

As of July 22, 2021, 187 million persons in the United States had received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Close monitoring of safety surveillance has demonstrated that serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are rare. Three medical conditions have been reported in temporal association with receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Two of these conditions (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS], a rare syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and Guillain-Barré syndrome [GBS], a rare autoimmune neurologic disorder characterized by ascending weakness and paralysis) have been reported after Janssen COVID-19 vaccination. One condition (myocarditis, cardiac inflammation) has been reported after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination, particularly after the second dose.

### Use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine after reports of myocarditis among vaccine recipients: Update from the advisory committee on immunization practices - United States, June 2021 [^112k9vY3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

In December 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for their use in persons aged ≥ 16 years and ≥ 18 years, respectively. In May 2021, the FDA expanded the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents aged 12–15 years; ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥ 12 years receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These mRNA vaccines were authorized and recommended as a 2-dose schedule, with second doses administered 21 days (Pfizer-BioNTech) or 28 days (Moderna) after the first dose.

- **Adverse events**: After reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in mRNA vaccine recipients, which predominantly occurred in young males after the second dose, an ACIP meeting was rapidly convened to review reported cases of myocarditis and pericarditis and discuss the benefits and risks of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle; if it is accompanied by pericarditis, an inflammation of the thin tissue surrounding the heart (the pericardium), it is referred to as myopericarditis. Hereafter, myocarditis is used to refer to myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis.

On June 23, 2021, after reviewing available evidence including that for risks of myocarditis…

### Comparative effectiveness of Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccines in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations among adults without immunocompromising conditions - United States, March-August 2021 [^111cGkHu]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

Two-dose regimens of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines provided a high level of protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations in a real-world evaluation at 21 U.S. hospitals during March–August 2021. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 hospitalization for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines was 93% and 88%, respectively, whereas the single-dose Janssen vaccine had somewhat lower VE at 71%. Persons vaccinated with the Janssen vaccine also had lower post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels than did recipients of mRNA vaccines. Although an immunologic correlate of protection has not been established for COVID-19 vaccines, antibody titers after infection and vaccination have been associated with protection. These real-world data suggest that the two-dose Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine regimens provide more protection than does the one-dose Janssen viral vector vaccine regimen. Although the Janssen vaccine had lower observed VE, one dose of the Janssen vaccine still reduced the risk for COVID-19–associated hospitalization by 71%.

### Comparative effectiveness over time of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine [^113EtoLW]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Real-world analysis of the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination is important in determining the comparative effectiveness of the available vaccines. In this retrospective cohort study, using deidentified administrative claims for Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals in a research database, we examined over 3.5 million fully vaccinated individuals, including 8,848 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a follow-up period between 14 and 151 days after their second dose. Our primary outcome was the rate of Covid-19 infection occurring at 30, 60, and 90 days, at least 14 days after the second dose of either the mRNA-1273 vaccine or the BNT162b2 vaccine. Sub-analyses included the incidence of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death/hospice transfer. Separate analysis was conducted for individuals above and below age 65 and those without a prior diagnosis of Covid-19.

We show that immunization with mRNA-1273, compared to BNT162b2, provides slightly more protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection that reaches statistical significance at 90 days, with a number needed to vaccinate of > 290. There are no differences in vaccine effectiveness for protection against hospitalization, ICU admission, or death/hospice transfer (aOR 1.23, 95% CI (0.67, 2.25)).

### The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' interim recommendation for use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents aged 12–15 years - United States, May 2021 [^114Kk8XX]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

Since June 2020, ACIP has convened 14 public meetings to review data on the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the potential use of COVID-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group, comprising experts in infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, has held weekly meetings to review COVID-19 surveillance data, evidence for vaccine efficacy and safety, and implementation considerations for COVID-19 vaccines.

Within the EtR framework for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents aged 12–15 years, ACIP considered the importance of COVID-19 as a public health problem, as well as issues of resource use, benefits and harms, patients' and parents' values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, and equity for use of the vaccine among adolescents. After a systematic review of published and unpublished evidence for benefits and harms, the Work Group used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to the vaccine, rated on a scale of 1 (high certainty) to 4 (very low certainty). Work Group conclusions regarding the evidence for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were presented to ACIP at a public meeting on May 12, 2021.

### COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality risk - seven integrated health care organizations, United States, December 14, 2020-July 31, 2021 [^115b33Sb]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Low credibility.

By September 21, 2021, an estimated 182 million persons in the United States were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Clinical trials indicate that Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273), and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson; Ad.26.COV2.S) vaccines are effective and generally well tolerated. However, daily vaccination rates have declined approximately 78% since April 13, 2021; vaccine safety concerns have contributed to vaccine hesitancy.

A cohort study of 19,625 nursing home residents found that those who received an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) had lower all-cause mortality than did unvaccinated residents. However, no studies comparing mortality rates within the general population of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons have been conducted.

To assess mortality not associated with COVID-19 (non-COVID-19 mortality) after COVID-19 vaccination in a general population setting, a cohort study was conducted during December 2020-July 2021 among approximately 11 million persons enrolled in seven Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) sites. After standardizing mortality rates by age and sex, this study found that COVID-19 vaccine recipients had lower non-COVID-19 mortality than did unvaccinated persons. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and VSD site, this study found that the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 0.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38–0.44) after dose 1 and 0.34 (95% CI = 0.33–0.36) after dose 2. The aRRs of non-COVID-19 mortality for the Moderna vaccine were 0.34 (95% CI = 0.32-…

### Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike responses to Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines by previous infection status [^111gmxoi]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). High credibility.

As vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are rolled out globally, individuals and their clinicians may wish to seek reassurance that vaccination has been effective and to understand how long protection is likely to last. Given that vaccines generate an immune response to viral spike antigens, anti-spike antibody titres, associated with neutralizing activity, provide a potential surrogate marker of protection. Therefore, understanding the assay- and time-dependent dynamics of post-vaccination anti-spike antibody measurements, how they differ between individuals (e.g. by age, gender, ethnicity, and with comorbidities), and how these findings relate to protection are increasingly important.

Multiple vaccines have been developed globally. In the UK, three vaccines have been approved for use, with Pfizer–BioNTech BNT162b2 and Oxford–AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) being the most widely used. At the time of writing, many individuals have received only one dose following an extension of the dosing interval to 12 weeks to maximize initial population coverage. The dynamics and magnitude of the immune response seen in vaccine immunogenicity trials are assay-dependent, predominantly focusing on individuals without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and use in-house assays developed early in the pandemic rather than the commercially available, validated assays now accessible to diagnostic laboratories. Emerging real-world data show that nearly all individuals vaccinated with the mRNA vaccines Pfizer–BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 seroconvert.

### mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19 disease and reported allergic reactions: Current evidence and suggested approach [^111LFxC6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for two highly effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. This has brought hope to millions of Americans amidst an ongoing global pandemic. The FDA EUA guidance for both vaccines advises against administering the vaccine to individuals with a known history of severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of the COVID-19 vaccine.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) additionally recommends that individuals with a history of an immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable, or any history of anaphylaxis, be observed for 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. All other individuals should be observed for 15 minutes after vaccination. Staff at vaccine clinics must be able to identify and manage anaphylaxis.

Despite very strong safety signals in both phase 3 trials post-FDA EUA, reports of possible allergic reactions have raised public concern. To provide reassurance and support during widespread global vaccination, allergists must offer clear guidance to individuals based on the best information available and in accordance with the broader recommendations of regulatory agencies.

This review summarizes vaccine allergy epidemiology and proposes drug and vaccine allergy expert opinion informed risk stratification for allergy specialist use, in conjunction with guidance from public health and regulatory authorities. The risk stratification schema guides care for individuals with different allergic profiles.

### First month of COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring - United States, December 14, 2020-January 13, 2021 [^115gH2es]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

During December 14, 2020–January 13, 2021, v-safe enrolled 1,602,065 vaccine recipients who completed at least one survey; 814,648 (50.8%) received Pfizer-BioNTech, and 787,417 (49.2%) received Moderna vaccines. The median recipient age was 46 years (range = 16–110 years); 1,106,656 (69.1%) were women. There were 10,825 (0.68%) enrollees who reported that they were pregnant at the time of vaccination, and 262 (0.02%) reported a positive pregnancy test result after vaccination. Solicited local and systemic reactions were similar between persons receiving first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and chills were most frequently reported. Enrollees reported more reactions on the day after vaccination than on any other day. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, reactions were more frequent after the second dose than the first; the reported rate of fever and chills was more than four times higher after the second dose than after the first.

### Predicting COVID-19 booster immunogenicity against future SARS-CoV-2 variants and the benefits of vaccine updates [^111hX48d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The continual emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants has driven vaccine manufacturers and regulatory bodies to update COVID-19 vaccine immunogens. Ideally, the choice of which vaccine to deploy would be informed by vaccine efficacy trials against the relevant circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, the decision of which immunogen to include in a vaccine occurs well before a vaccine's eventual approval, manufacture, and deployment, and therefore randomised controlled trials are not possible in the time required to inform strain selection decisions. As a result, the assessment and comparison of different updated vaccine immunogens have been made based largely on neutralising antibody titres after vaccination, most commonly against the vaccine immunogen. Since continued evolution and neutralisation escape can occur before an updated vaccine is widely administered, in general, the circulating variant at the time of vaccine deployment no longer matches the immunogen that was included in the vaccine and against which the vaccine was assessed.

The advantage of an update to a vaccine immunogen therefore must be assessed in the context of an anticipated mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating strains. The relative benefits of updating a vaccine immunogen are thought to depend on the antigenic relationships between the historical, contemporaneous, and future circulating variants. That is, the infection and vaccination history of an individual is thought to contribute to their cross-recognition profile of different variant strains. Further, booster immunogenicity may also be influenced by these factors.

### Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines against COVID-19 among hospitalized adults aged ≥ 65 years - United States, January-March 2021 [^116vtjtN]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 65 years are at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 and were identified as a priority group to receive the first COVID-19 vaccines approved for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States. In an evaluation at 24 hospitals in 14 states, the effectiveness of partial or full vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was assessed among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Among 417 hospitalized adults aged ≥ 65 years (including 187 case-patients and 230 controls), the median age was 73 years, 48% were female, 73% were non-Hispanic White, 17% were non-Hispanic Black, 6% were Hispanic, and 4% lived in a long-term care facility. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19–associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 65 years was estimated to be 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 49%–99%) for full vaccination and 64% (95% CI = 28%–82%) for partial vaccination. These findings are consistent with efficacy determined from clinical trials in the subgroup of adults aged ≥ 65 years. This multisite U.S. evaluation under real-world conditions suggests that vaccination provided protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Vaccination is a critical tool for reducing severe COVID-19 in groups at high risk.

Randomized clinical trials of vaccines that have received an EUA in the United States showed efficacy of 94%–95% in preventing COVID-19–associated illness.

### Effectiveness of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and hospitalizations among nonimmunocompromised children and adolescents aged 5–17 years - VISION Network, 10 states, April 2021-January 2022 [^111BhSut]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Vaccination was defined as having received the listed number of doses of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine ≥ 14 days (for 2 doses) or ≥ 7 days (for 3 doses) before the medical event index date. The index date was the date of respiratory specimen collection associated with the most recent positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result before the medical event or the admission date if testing only occurred after admission.

### Comparative effectiveness and antibody responses to Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines among hospitalized veterans - five Veterans Affairs medical centers, United States, February 1-September 30, 2021 [^116t7ixN]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) provide strong protection against severe COVID-19, including hospitalization, for at least several months after receipt of the second dose. However, studies examining immune responses and differences in protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization in real-world settings, including by vaccine product, are limited. To understand how vaccine effectiveness (VE) might change with time, the CDC and collaborators assessed the comparative effectiveness of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in preventing COVID-19–associated hospitalization at two periods (14–119 days and ≥ 120 days) after receipt of the second vaccine dose among 1,896 U.S. veterans at five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) during February 1–September 30, 2021.

Among 234 U.S. veterans fully vaccinated with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, serum antibody levels (anti-spike immunoglobulin G [IgG] and anti-receptor binding domain [RBD] IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 were also compared. Adjusted VE 14–119 days following the second Moderna vaccine dose was 89.6% (95% CI = 80.1%–94.5%) and after the second Pfizer-BioNTech dose was 86.0% (95% CI = 77.6%–91.3%); at ≥ 120 days, VE was 86.1% (95% CI = 77.7%–91.3%) for Moderna and 75.1% (95% CI = 64.6%–82.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech. Antibody levels were significantly higher among Moderna recipients than Pfizer-BioNTech recipients across all age groups and periods since vaccination; however, antibody levels among recipients of both products declined between 14–119 days and ≥ 120 days.

### The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' interim recommendations for additional primary and booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines - United States, 2021 [^112jcXFE]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

In clinical trials for mRNA and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, rates of local or systemic adverse events were similar or lower following a booster dose (whether homologous or heterologous) than after the last primary series dose. No serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported for mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. For Janssen, three serious adverse events (facial paresis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular accident) were attributed by the site investigators to booster vaccination within 6 months of administration, among 5,070 booster recipients in the evaluable population. Outside of clinical trials, more than 13 million persons in the United States had received an additional or booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of October 25, 2021 (predominantly with Pfizer-BioNTech), and no unexpected patterns of adverse events have been observed in national safety surveillance systems.

From the GRADE evidence assessment, the level of certainty for all benefits and harms of a Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine booster dose was type 4 (very low certainty) for the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19, prevention of hospitalization attributable to COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech and Janssen), prevention of death attributable to COVID-19 (Janssen), serious adverse events, and reactogenicity. No data were available to assess the GRADE benefit of prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The main reasons for the low level of certainty in the evidence assessment include small study sizes and lack of a randomized primary series comparison group.

### Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing hospitalization among adults aged ≥ 65 years - COVID-NET, 13 states, February-April 2021 [^116MVDui]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of full vaccination in preventing hospitalization among adults aged 65–74 years was estimated at 96% (95% CI = 94%–98%) for Pfizer-BioNTech, 96% (95% CI = 95%–98%) for Moderna, and 84% (95% CI = 64%–93%) for Janssen vaccine products. Among adults aged ≥ 75 years, the effectiveness of full vaccination was 91% (95% CI = 87%–94%) for Pfizer-BioNTech, 96% (95% CI = 93%–98%) for Moderna, and 85% (95% CI = 72%–92%) for Janssen vaccine products.

The effectiveness of partial vaccination among adults aged 65–74 years was 84% (95% CI = 76%–89%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and 91% (95% CI = 87%–93%) for Moderna vaccine products. Among those aged ≥ 75 years, the effectiveness of partial vaccination was 66% (95% CI = 48%–77%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and 82% (95% CI = 76%–86%) for Moderna vaccine products. Sensitivity analyses accounting for the interval between infection and hospitalization did not yield notably different vaccine effectiveness estimates, with point estimates varying by < 1% for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine models, while point estimates for Janssen COVID-19 vaccine models varied by < 10%, with few cases eligible for inclusion and wide CIs.

### Impact of prior COVID-19 infection on perceptions about the benefit and safety of COVID-19 vaccines [^1153hMpD]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Low credibility.

In this online survey of 1,733 US adults conducted in December 2021, respondents believed that COVID-19 vaccines are less beneficial and less safe for individuals who have already had COVID-19. Individuals who experienced COVID-19 after being vaccinated perceived the vaccines as less beneficial and less safe compared to those who had not become infected. These findings highlight the need to better communicate the evolving evidence of COVID-19 vaccine benefits and safety. Moreover, there is a necessity to tailor communications according to individuals' COVID-19 history and vaccination status.

### Use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccine: Updated interim recommendations from the advisory committee on immunization practices - United States, December 2021 [^113zZGf1]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Since June 2020, ACIP has convened 23 public meetings to review data on the epidemiology of COVID-19 and the use of COVID-19 vaccines, including nine meetings during which Janssen COVID-19 vaccine-related data were reviewed. The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group, comprising experts in infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, has held weekly meetings to review COVID-19 surveillance data, evidence for vaccine efficacy and safety, and implementation considerations for COVID-19 vaccines.

In addition, the COVID-19 Vaccines Safety Technical Work Group (VaST), consisting of independent vaccine safety experts and established to provide expert consultation on COVID-19 vaccine safety issues, has reviewed safety data from the COVID-19 vaccination program during weekly meetings.

After TTS was first identified in the United States in April 2021, a benefit-risk assessment for the use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was presented to ACIP using an adapted Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) framework. In the setting of limited COVID-19 vaccine supply in the United States at that time, ACIP reaffirmed its interim recommendations for the use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥ 18 years under FDA's EUA. This was updated to include a warning that rare clotting events might occur after vaccination, primarily among women aged 18–49 years. Updates to the benefit-risk assessment were also reviewed by ACIP in June 2021, after an increased risk for myocarditis, particularly in males aged 12–29 years, was observed after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

### Patient-reported reactogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccinations vs. comparator vaccinations: A comparative observational cohort study [^115uvjEP]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Participants in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination group were more likely to report local and systemic side effects 14 days after their vaccination than those in the comparator group. However, 16 weeks later, there was no higher reporting of seeking medical consultations in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination group. Patients who had received ChAdOx1 at least once even reported significantly fewer outpatient and inpatient consultations than the comparator group. Adverse events and medical consultations were reported significantly more frequently by women, younger people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions.

### Comparison of symptoms and antibody response following administration of Moderna or Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [^117CXwPq]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Moderna (mRNA-1272) and Pfizer (BNT162b2) SARS-CoV-2 vaccines demonstrate favorable safety and efficacy profiles, but direct comparison data are lacking.

- **Objective**: To determine the vaccines' side effect profiles and expected antibody responses, which may help personalize vaccine selection and identify individuals with a suboptimal vaccine response.

- **Design**: One hundred forty-nine healthy, largely seronegative adults were assigned to receive either the Moderna (n = 79) or Pfizer (n = 70) vaccine. Following the second dose, participants completed a survey documenting their side effects. Serum samples were collected 0 to 4 days prior to dose 2, and 14 ± 4 days, 30 ± 4 days, 90 ± 10 days, and 180 ± 20 days after dose 2. Convalescent serum specimens were collected 32 to 54 days from donors following a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 20). Anti-spike antibodies were measured using the Roche Diagnostics Elecys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay on a Roche cobas e801 instrument.

- **Results**: Participants receiving the Moderna vaccine experienced side effects with greater frequency and severity. Both vaccines elicited a robust antibody response, but the median signal was higher in Moderna recipients. Symptom severity decreased with age. Antibody response in Pfizer recipients negatively correlated with age. Antibody response decreased after 6 months (84% reduction in Moderna, 79% Pfizer), but values remained greater than for convalescent donors. Antibody response did not correlate with gender or symptom severity.

- **Conclusions**: Moderna may be preferred in individuals in need of greater immune response.
